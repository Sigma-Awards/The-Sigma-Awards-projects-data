United Kingdom,Sky News,Big,Shortlist,,Carmen Aguilar Garcia,"After seven years working as a TV reporter and a digital journalist in several media in Spain and Chile, I had the opportunity to work on a data project. Neither I nor the rest of the team had previous experience working with data, so we took a few online courses before starting. The process wasn't easy nor efficient due to our lack of knowledge but, after finalising it, I realised this was the kind of journalism I wanted to specialise in. I kept taking online courses but the more I dug into this discipline the more I discovered I could and should learn about it. I, therefore, decided to invest a full year learning about data and its application to journalism to have a strong preparation before facing this new path in my career. I then moved to the UK to study the MA Data Journalism at Birmingham City University, led by Paul Bradshaw, who has become my referent since then. As soon as I graduated, I had the opportunity to join Sky News as the first data journalist. I was the first but did not want to be the only one for longer. My main goal was to show how data journalism adds value to traditional reporting and to demonstrate that this is a discipline to put the focus on and invest in. I was only a reporter, so the way of showing this was making an impact with my work. My new skills were useful to find new stories hidden in data that other media hadn't reported about. I have also contributed to other colleagues' stories by looking for new stories or angles and by using data to add context and to explain the wider problem. Data has also been the starting point of several investigations published on all our platforms, and it has been used to allow the user to personalise the information, offering and analysing data as local as possible. As a solo data journalist, I have covered the whole process, from checking the quality of the data to building visualisations and creating visual projects. But I have not been alone. I have made collaboration with other departments a fundamental part of my strategy. On one hand, I have contributed to other journalists' work - helping them with statistical analysis, creating data structures to easily query data and share findings, offering new stories and helping with visual storytelling. I have also trained journalists and designers to use data visualisation tools and data software. On the other hand, joining forces with professionals with specific skills (such developers, correspondents and designers) enriched and improved the stories I have worked in and made possible more complex projects. This idea of collaboration also contributed to showing what data journalism is and how it can add value to their work across the newsroom, planting a small seed in every department. When the pandemic started, my workload increased exponentially but all this previous work laid the foundation to better face the new challenge. Since COVID started, I have published stories and visualisations more frequently and have worked with designers, TV reporters, digital journalists and developers to create useful content for our audience. But , I also went a step further and co-developed an automation project from which all the newsroom benefited from. Almost two years since I joined, I am not the only data journalist in Sky News anymore. Not only am I part of a team, but I have been recognized in international conferences and invited to share my expertise with other journalists who, like me, might be facing a solo","In all the projects I am presenting I have been in charge of the data analysis and the data visualisations, as well as co-structuring the stories to better present them for our audience. I have adapted my skills and my knowledge to the process and necessities of each story, using several data tools, such as R, Python, Excel, Open Refine, QGIS and Google Sheets to gather, clean and analyse data, and building visualisations with Flourish and Datawrapper to tell visual stories. I have worked on daily stories as well as medium- and long-term projects and investigations, which means that I have had to manage my time efficiently to meet all necessities. The pressure on daily and weekly stories - such as COVID analyses about infections and excess deaths within the UK and Europe or analyses to reveal the inequality in the rollout of the vaccine across the world and the importance of India in the vaccine supply - has been considerably high. I have undertaken high-level analyses, co-produced the stories and built visualisations in a short period of time - sometimes within a day. In addition to that time pressure, working for an international media means meeting high expectations, reaching a diverse audience and competing with bigger data teams. While working on longer projects and investigations, I have developed strong collaboration skills and created a robust working relationship with many departments across Sky News. The story about the people displaced due to climate events involved collaborating with designers and reporters, as well as external organisations (the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre), and I joined forces with the recently created forensic team to reveal deforestation in the highest protected areas of the Brazilian Amazon. One of the biggest challenges during the first two years was facing the pandemic. Covering this story was a titanic work for a single person, and, again, collaboration was key to face this up. Working with a developer, we automated part of the data process (gathering, cleaning, standardising and visualising data) and we've created stories - such as the travel tracker - which updated automatically to offer the latest information to our users without any daily human intervention This is one of the projects which has had a great impact internally. It has contributed to saving dozens of hours, especially to the data team, increasing the number of stories and visualisations published and offering up-to-date information at any time to our users. This system has also impacted on creating consistency among the departments, increasing the efficiency in the data and design departments and improving the content of many of our digital stories. Moreover, it has been recognised externally, as we were invited to talk about it at the Journalism AI Conference and it was shortlisted in the SIGMA Awards. Several experts have also praised many of the data stories, such as the one about the lack of diversity among the UK councilors, the investigation about the deforestation in the Amazon and the shortage of general practitioners (GPs) in England. Likewise, the scroll-down technique to present the data in many of the stories better present the information and increase the engagement, and it has also been highlighted by people in and out of the industry. Pageviews are also a good metric to assess the impact. Many of the data stories have been in the top ten of the most viewed on our digital site. In fact, the story about the shortage of GPs in England has been one of the most-read stories of 2021, even though it was published at the end of the year.",English,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-deaths-above-average-in-almost-every-area-of-great-britain-12198585,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-three-quarters-of-european-countries-see-coronavirus-cases-rise-12241884,https://news.sky.com/story/the-vaccine-divide-wealthy-nations-have-23-jabs-for-every-one-in-a-poorer-country-12215449,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-how-does-indias-pause-on-vaccine-export-hurt-other-nations-12290300,https://news.sky.com/story/climate-change-the-people-forced-from-their-homes-by-floods-wildfires-storms-and-sea-level-rise-12355533,https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-alert-deforestation-warnings-at-record-levels-in-protected-parts-of-brazil-12416814,https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-summer-tracker-in-depth-guide-to-how-different-countries-rates-compare-12324242,https://news.sky.com/story/the-number-of-doctors-is-falling-and-appointments-are-going-up-but-thats-only-part-of-the-problem-12431982,,,,,,,,,

Brazil,"Fiquem Sabendo, OCCRP, freelance",Small,Shortlist,,Using data to monitor FOIA in brazil,"Stories I've written in the past 10 years helped to save millions in public funds and investigate illegal practices from individuals, companies and governments. I used to do investigative journalism by talking to lots of people and reading hundreds of documents. I still do it, but now I have been learning how to code to collaborate with cross-border and data-driven projects. In 2021 I have been sharing my time between reporting using data and developing projects that help other journalists and researchers get the data they need. I created scrapers that improve how all Brazilian journalists can find public data. One of the scrapers finds all FOIA (Freedom of Information) requests answered by the federal government in Brazil since the law was enacted, in 2012, based on a keyword and time range that interests the user, and then put them all into a CSV file. There is another scraper that helps people analyze what kind of information request is being denied by the government due to privacy or secrecy laws. It scrapes and parses a huge dataset looking for those cases, finds PDFs and transforms the information into a simple CSV file. Both scrapers can be found here. In the first semester, as a Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism fellow, I have created a guide on how to get the maximum potential from FOIA requests. This project evolved and now it is being used to teach thousands of journalists in Brazil through a partnership between the organization I co-founded, Fiquem Sabendo, and of the most relevant investigative journalistic associations in Latin America, Abraji. At Fiquem Sabendo, me and my team have opened multiple datasets that were being held from Brazilian citizens. We ended the secrecy of companies and people who deforest the Amazon and get fines for that. We've revealed that more money is spent on military pensions - including those accused of crimes during the dictatorship - than on social benefits. I also have joined OCCRP as their first Brazil editor and was responsible for coordinating cross-border investigations involving Brazil and other countries. One of the projects revealed multiple investigations against the giant Canadian group Brookfield for environmental crimes and threats against Brazilian citizens. In this other project, Open Lux, we have revealed how the mother of a Brazilian politician that is being investigated for corruption created an offshore in Luxembourg without l In the past, I was part of a team that broke a story revealing that a bid result was already set before the due date. It made a city save millions in public funds. Using public data, I found out that high-level officials received housing benefits ilegally from public universities for years. A court said they should give the money back. Using social media data, I was able to investigate and highlight the most impactful disinformation network in Brazil during the 2018 presidential elections. They were reaching more people than famous artists like Anitta or Madonna. The story made Facebook shut their pages down a week later. I have also coordinated a series of articles that led government authorities to investigate and then shut down an illegal air charter service, seize illegal airplanes and sanction people and companies who were operating those services.

Argentina,Aviacionline.com,Small,Participant,,Aviacionline - Covid vaccine logistics,"We put together a series of articles to fight disinformation and political bias in a subject as complex and important as Covid vaccines transportation. The series tried to be technically accurate and easy to read at the same time. We had an internal goal: to elevate the debate level. And we think we succeeded. Aviacionline is a publication that has grown to be the most widely read Spanish-speaking aviation source. We recently expanded to English and the path and goals are the same: truth before bias, to inform rather than to deliver propaganda, to let the reader get to their own conclusions. ","In the Covid world, the best and worst of each one of us has emerged. In the midst of the health crisis, the same people that refused states intervention demanded a governmental response. In some cases, the polarization of political ideas has led to creating trenches where those sympathizing with the government were convinced that every measure was right and well taken. The opposing side tended to dismiss all actions as wrong, without taking a single minute for analysis. But if things aren't black or white in normal times, one can only imagine how many shades of gray there are in a global crisis no politician was ever prepared to deal with.  This series was born after a political decision: to use Argentina's flag carrier, state-owned Aerolíneas Argentinas, to transport the Sputnik V vaccines produced in Russia. Aerolíneas Argentinas is an icon for the political tribal war the country has been into for the last 70 years: Peronism and anti-Peronism. Without any bias -better said, having gotten rid of all of our biases- we tried to explore a couple of simple questions: does this logistical effort make any sense? Are those saying that this is a political deal that is not good for our country right? Can we set the record straight from a technical point of view, in a way that is precise and accurate but easy to read? What you're about to read was created not to end the fight. We wouldn't be able to intervene there. But what we accomplished was, for us, much more important: we elevated the level of discussion. When these articles appeared, people needed to stop repeating information that was incorrect. We exposed big media as they created pieces based on improper data, by mistake, or purposefully.  We got cited by Aerolineas' CEO, to defend its operation logic. We got cited by people on the two sides of the trenches. But the most important part was that a good number of people that got stranded on the disinformation were able to discern and think for themselves to reach their own conclusions.  Besides all clicks, ads, revenue, relevance, virality, all that matters is that. We created pieces that made people think. What more can we wish as a reward for what we love to do. ","English, Spanish",https://www.aviacionline.com/2021/01/aerolineas-argentinas-las-vacunas-rusas-y-la-complejidad-logistica-del-vamos-viendo-parte-1-la-fabula-del-costo-del-carguero/,https://www.aviacionline.com/2021/01/aerolineas-argentinas-russian-vaccines-and-the-logistical-complexity-of-the-well-see-approach-part-1-the-fable-of-the-freighters-costs/,https://www.aviacionline.com/2021/02/aerolineas-argentinas-las-vacunas-y-la-complejidad-logistica-del-vamos-viendo-parte-1-bis-el-dilema-del-hielo-seco/,https://www.aviacionline.com/2021/02/aerolineas-argentinas-vaccines-and-the-logistical-complexity-of-the-well-see-approach-part-1-bis-the-dry-ice-dilemma/,https://twitter.com/ceriani_pablo/status/1375123096512892928,,,,,,,,,,,,

Professionally, I was a Microsoft Dynamics Nav ERP Developer Consultant for a company in Benin and worked on major projects deploying integrated management and database software solutions, before moving into journalism in 2016.  Since 2016, I have been following and processing economic news in Africa on a daily basis, with a specialty on issues related to high finance, public management, etc. For the past two years, I have been working non-stop on how to exploit data to present the news, how to make data talk, and how to use data to deconstruct fake news. All these experiences confirm my belief that tomorrow's journalism will not be based on data and its applications. As such, I am preparing to start a PhD program by 2023 on the use of artificial intelligence and Big Data in the media. I'm a Power BI consultant and have a good command of data manipulation and visualization tools (Google Sheets, Python, Dash, plotly, Seaborn, Pandas, Datawrapper, Infogram, Tableau, Bokeh,...) Since 2019, I have been managing Mediamania Africa, the African subsidiary of Mediamania, the Geneva-based company that develops Agence Ecofin. Mediamania Africa publishes the website Togo First, the first online media specialized on economic news about Togo. I am in charge of the editorial staff of this media and also the administrative tasks, the HR management with a staff of 10 employees (journalists, translators, Community Manager, ...). In parallel, I am responsible for data at Agence Ecofin since the end of 2020. I'm a general culture enthusiast, a former champion of Génies en Herbes, self-taught and a geek on the edges. I know how to learn fast and adapt as quickly.  ","https://www.togofirst.com/fr/telecoms/0312-9075-le-secteur-de-l-internet-fixe-au-togo-en-6-points-infographie  This article reviews the fixed internet sector in Togo (West Africa), the key figures of the sector such as the operators' turnover, their subscriber base, their investments and the technologies deployed. Upon publication, the article received very positive feedback, shared by the most important decision makers (ministers, CEOs, institutions).

United States,USA TODAY,Big,Participant,,"Extremism, misinformation and public opinion","The staff of USA TODAY this year applied tools used by researchers in linguistics, computational social science, social media and political extremism to provide readers with deep insights on some of the biggest news events of 2021, drilling down particularly on where misinformation originates and how it spreads. The work stemmed from a deliberate, cross-team effort initiated in 2020 and focused on the intersection of misinformation, extremism and public opinion. (Earlier stories, outside the contest year, included one in December 2020 using the Twitter API to trace the spread of a single lie about vaccination.) We only found greater urgency to our effort as we entered year two of the pandemic, the chaotic end of the Trump administration and a new phase in America's reckoning with racial injustice. The main analytical firepower behind the coverage in this entry was senior data reporter Aleszu Bajak. He has formed longstanding contacts in academia and industry that helped him develop expertise in social media and text analysis, particularly in quantifying, mapping and determining the networks of political rhetoric and misinformation. He's keenly attuned to the academic literature on those subjects as well as cutting edge techniques from natural language processing, political communication and computational social science. Bajak joined forces with senior technology writer Jessica Guynn, who has covered social media companies and how they work at USA TODAY for years, and Will Carless, whose work at Reveal and USA TODAY has made him one of the nation's top investigative beat reporters on extremism. Together, these journalists found key moments on which to narrowly focus the lens. Javier Zarracina and Mitchell Thorson, creators on USA TODAY's Graphics team, grounded the findings in accessible and captivating interactives. Data reporters Kevin Crowe and Dan Keemahill, national reporter Grace Hauck, investigative intern Brenna Smith and political correspondents Chelsey Cox and Phillip M. Bailey also played important roles in our data-driven coverage.  We believe that helping Americans understand the hidden mechanics behind our perceptions of truth and falsehood is an essential service to democracy. The staff of USA TODAY contributed to this vital effort during the past year through insightful data journalism coupled with well-honed beat reporting. We are proud to present their work to you.","This portfolio spans diverse news events, but the stories share a common thread in the way they make use of data, particularly textual analysis. In one analysis, of activity on the conservative social platform Parler, linked the rise in use of the phrase ""civil war"" on Jan. 6 to the moment in President Trump's speech when he told the crowd to ""fight like hell."" Pulling in a tranche of Parler posts from the Social Media Analysis Toolkit API, we also found a dramatic negative turn in user sentiment the moment Trump took the stage. The project was cited in President Trump's second impeachment trial.  Another analysis of the Capitol attack, published Jan. 12, documented and quantified the spread of claims that Antifa ran a ""false flag"" operation fomenting the mob, showing a steady migration from extreme fringe users of social media to Fox News and lawmakers giving speeches on the House floor. A few days later, we used ProPublica's congressional Twitter data to identify the partisan breakdown of lawmakers who lost followers when Twitter cracked down on spreaders of QAnon misinformation. Our analysis found the move took away thousands of Twitter users who followed GOP lawmakers. Another story followed deplatformed Twitter users onto new platforms, including the dark web. We tapped the SMAT API to search Parler posts once again, consulted Crowdtangle to examine Facebook activity, and scoured Telegram data provided to us by the Social Computing Group at the University of Zurich. These data sources revealed calls for violence were only growing. For an April news story, we used R to compile contents of more than 5,000 files hacked from the crowdfunding website GiveSendGo, using regular expressions to find connections to the Proud Boys and Jan. 6 rioters. The files, which contained donor names, comments and donation amounts, revealed a trend: people with Chinese surnames contributing to Proud Boys campaigns. Extremism reporter Will Carless and investigative intern Brenna Smith tagged the names while data reporter Aleszu Bajak helped quantify donations. Also in April, we used data to illuminate public perceptions of race and policing. We examined a range of data sources to gauge sentiments following a Minnesota jury's conviction of Derek Chauvin in George Floyd's death. Among the findings:   Utilizing a unique panel of Twitter users whom researchers have verified as conservative and liberal based on voter registration data, we documented the right's disproportionate focus on Rep. Maxine Waters' remarks as grounds for a mistrial -- and the left's turn to names of Black men and women killed by police in the days before the verdict.   News consumers barely tuned in to the verdict with the exception of two markets: Minnesota and Washington, D.C.   The number of mentions of George Floyd from members of Congress dwarfed those of any other Black man killed by police in recent years in the moments following legal decisions in their cases.   We again turned to language analysis in November following Election Day. One story focused on how conservative personas drove the rise of ""Critical Race Theory"" as a battle cry. It drew on a database of TV news transcripts hosted at Stanford University and transcripts of campaign videos, conservative podcasts, think tank publications and radio shows. We mapped the weaponization of the term including the importance of words related to classroom education in Glenn Youngkin's win as Virginia governor. Collectively, these penetrating stories drew 1.2 million pageviews, averaging 160,000 each. They gave readers new tools to understand an overwhelming deluge of bad news. We submit this portfolio as an example of explanatory data journalism at its best.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/02/01/civil-war-during-trumps-pre-riot-speech-parler-talk-grew-darker/4297165001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/01/12/how-antifa-conspiracy-theory-traveled-fringe-floor-congress/6620908002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/2021/04/27/chauvin-verdict-data-twitter-media-reactions-analysis/7333093002/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/15/trump-republican-lawmakers-follower-counts-slashed-twitter-purge/4168064001/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/13/trump-extremists-banned-facebook-twitter-violence-gab-telegram-signal/4151498001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/2021/11/12/critical-race-theory-outrage-built-multi-year-conservative-effort/6337814001/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/06/republican-candidates-may-campaign-against-crt-after-youngkin-win/6265270001/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/05/04/proud-boys-chinese-americans-community-support-donations/7343111002/,,,,,,,,,

China,National Business Daily of China,Big,Participant,,National Business Daily of China,"Every day, governments at all levels in China publish a large number of environmental administrative penalties, pollution source emission monitoring data, ECA (Environmental Compliance Approval) information on specific public networks. These environmental risk information related to the public interest is often over-dispersed, complex and professional, so it is rarely paid attention to by the public or reported in the media.   Since September 2020, China's leading professional financial media, NBD(National Business Daily of China), has been working with IPE (Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs) , a well-known NGO organization in the field of environmental protection, to tap into China's complex environmental risk data from the perspective of public corporate environmental responsibility and green investment.   We have used technical methods to monitor nearly 4,000 A-share listed companies in China and the affiliated companies they operate or invest in. Every week we analyzed this data in depth, looking for particularly noteworthy stories or bad behaviors, and using AI + Writing to form news that make these environmental risk events easy to understand and well-known, especially for holders or potential buyers of listed companies' stocks to see the investment risks behind environmental problems.   NBD is a cutting-edge financial media in mainland China, known for revealing reports on listed companies and investment and financial management. It is committed to becoming the watchman of China's economic society and capital market. The project was planned and led by the Beijing team of the company channel, the core news division of NBD .   This team mainly studies and reports on listed companies. They believe that the operation of enterprises is related to the public interest, and that supervision of the standardized operation of enterprises is beneficial to public welfare.","The ""A-share Green Report"" project is a long-term data journalism project that continuously generates new stories and is constantly upgraded. In over one year from September 2020 to December 2021, we reported over 2000 environmental risk events through AI + Writing, and conducted 59 in-depth analysis reports , 5 A-share environmental risk lists and an annual report. Every week, reporters fact-check and clean up the nearly 100 pieces of data which is provided by IPE, and then turn the data into instant news in batches by AI + Writing .The reporter then further cross-compared other types of data from listed companies to analyze and explore the impact of environmental incidents on listed companies, forming an in-depth analysis report ""A-Share Green Weekly"". This project has pioneered a new model for mining news through dynamic data in China and has also created a unique environmental risk assessment list for listed companies in China. The challenge we face is to check and clean up complex and diverse raw data, and to accurately match the equity relationships of related companies. At present, the reporter has worked out a set of efficient methods with technical assistance. In addition, the standardized evaluation of professional environmental information is also a challenge. But now we have jointly developed a set of persuasive environmental performance scoring mechanisms with our partner institutions IPE. In this project, the most complex part is to cooperate with different departments and different agencies. Such a workflow mechanism needs to be explored gradually in the long-term operation. The impact of the ""A-share Green Report"" project is very obvious. It promotes more than 50 listed companies to actively fulfill their environmental responsibilities. There is also a lot of feedback from multiple stakeholders ,like overseas investment institutions beginning to focus the A -share they invested and we reported that had a lot of environmental administrative penalties.","English, Chinese",http://industry.nbd.com.cn/columns/1355,http://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2021-12-22/2052120.html,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSkgABIG6MMhR_RBIcNZ-lYUYXQqbGRTfX8IqTHp7TU/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United States,The Wall Street Journal,Big,Participant,,The New Student Debt Crisis--The Wall Street Journal,"To the Judges: The Wall Street Journal exposed the predatory nature of elite U.S. universities. These schools baited vulnerable families into taking on mountains of debt to pay for high-cost degrees. The universities became richer while low-income students and parents were burdened with loans in fields with dim salary options. The Journal’s reporting focused on the fastest growing sector of student loans: the federal government’s Grad Plus and Parent Plus program. This unlimited supply of debt has become a money machine that allows families to meet otherwise unaffordable costs. When borrowers fail to pay down the loans—and they are doing so in shocking numbers—taxpayers are left with the bill. The coverage showed how both the federal government and wealthy schools put financial benefit and political expediency ahead of poor and middle-class students, many with loan balances above $300,000. One borrower we profiled said of his university: “You tell them, ‘I need assistance,’ and they’re like, ‘OK, here’s a loan.’ It was just an endless supply of money.” The investigation drew on new data released by the Education Department that for the first time exposed how much graduate students from individual programs borrowed and whether they paid it back. Among our findings:   The social work master’s program at the University of Southern California teamed up with a for-profit company, charging $115,000 for a two-year online degree that left half its graduates earning $52,000 or less two years later.    Parents borrowing to send their children to Baylor University had the worst repayment rate after two years—only about 25%—of any private school with a large endowment. Parents were saddled with Plus loans because Baylor is one of the least generous among wealthy colleges in giving scholarships to needy students.   Film program graduates of Columbia University who took out federal student loans had a median debt of $181,000. Two years after earning their master’s degrees, half of the borrowers were making less than $30,000 a year. That’s the worst debt compared with earnings among graduates of any major university master’s program in the U.S.   New York University topped them all. Graduate students and parents collectively borrowed $3.4 billion in Plus loans over the past decade, more than at any other university in the U.S.   In Washington, lawmakers acknowledged that their no-limit borrowing has plunged millions of families into debt but they have punted on capping or otherwise changing the Plus program year after year. One reason, the Journal showed: They fear universities’ backlash.  Many families we profiled are burdened for life, with debt relief coming in some cases only upon death. Kayla Foots’s mother owes $57,000 in Parent Plus loans. The $100,000 taken out by her stepfather was wiped away when he died in 2020. Ms. Foots said: “That is so crazy and so sad that that was the silver lining out of the situation.”  At USC, the Journal found that the social work program targeted poor and minority students. Their marketing materials had cartoon profiles of the school’s hypothetical recruits including “Needy Nelly,” a Black woman who repeatedly needed help with her application. Days after our article ran, the dean of the social work school told students it was trying to get out of its “stupid” contract with its for-profit partner, 2U, Inc.  Beyond our articles, the Journal offered consumer-oriented tools and visualizations to help parents and students better understand how their debt can balloon and which schools and programs are providing the best or worst value.  Our data-driven project represents the finest tradition in accountability journalism, and we are proud to nominate it for a Sigma Award.  ","Getting access to Grad Plus and Parent Plus data was a years-long effort by The Wall Street Journal’s Andrea Fuller, a data reporter on the investigative team who specializes in education. The U.S. Education Department denied her request for the information a decade ago when she was a data reporter at the Chronicle of Higher Education because it hadn't calculated the figures. In other words, federal officials didn’t have a handle on their $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio, and consumers couldn’t know which schools were fueling the problems. That began to change in late 2019, when the Education Department first published some salary data for the graduates of individual programs. It released the largest trove yet in January 2021, including data on what graduate degree recipients earned two years out of school, what their early-career loan repayment rates looked like, and how good of a job parents of students at different colleges did at paying back their debts. Armed, finally, with this massive new data set, Ms. Fuller teamed with a number of Journal reporters to produce a series of text articles and visualizations that provided a tremendous service to the public. They took data with thousands of columns of information repeated across multiple files, cleaned and analyzed it and then presented it in a way that was accessible to people making financial decisions about their educational future.    In our first visual story, we revealed with undeniable specificity which programs left graduates with debt loads far beyond what they could pay back on their new salaries. This debt-to-income ratio can be wonky, so we presented examples, such as the master’s degree programs in public health at the University of Southern California and California State University, Long Beach. Graduates from these nearby schools had similar median incomes two years after finishing, but USC graduates left school with 2.5 times as much debt as Cal State Long Beach grads. Our tool then allowed users to make their own such comparisons for programs at the undergraduate, master’s, doctorate and professional degree levels. More than 28,000 programs were showcased at some 1,700 universities and colleges. Our second visual explains how graduates can diligently pay on their loans only to end up with more debt than when they started paying. We put readers in the shoes of a graduate who begins a two-year master’s program in 2021 that charges $100,000 in tuition. Our “borrower” ends up paying $185,000 but still owing $202,000. Both the reporting and visualization components took enormous effort. Ms. Fuller spent many hours on the phone with experts on various student loan forgiveness programs as she built her model. Even the experts didn’t always know the particulars or agree on them. For the visual element, graphics reporters James Benedict and Jason French used scrollytelling to keep the reader focused on one main visual that changed over time. It showed the amount paid growing with very little impact on the bright red debt column. This seemingly simple design – bar charts and animation – makes an immediate and powerful statement of how crushing this debt can be for individuals.",English,https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-a-graduate-degree-worth-the-debt-check-it-here-11626355788,https://www.wsj.com/articles/baylor-university-college-debt-parent-plus-loans-11634138239?mod=hp_lead_pos5,https://www.wsj.com/articles/usc-online-social-work-masters-11636435900?mod=hp_lead_pos10,https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyu-college-graduate-parent-student-loans-11639618241?mod=Searchresults_pos1&page=1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-your-student-debt-keeps-growingeven-when-you-keep-paying-11640994313?mod=hp_lead_pos7,https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-professional-degrees-leave-students-with-high-debt-but-without-high-salaries-11638354602?mod=hp_lead_pos5,https://www.wsj.com/articles/law-school-student-debt-low-salaries-university-miami-11627991855?mod=hp_lead_pos5,https://www.wsj.com/articles/journalism-schools-leave-graduates-with-hefty-student-loans-11631275201?mod=hp_featst_pos4,https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-university-student-debt-parent-grad-plus-loans-congress-school-borrowing-11638930489?st=bbk11zdwecehced&reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter,,,,,,,
India,"Undark, Hakai, Article 14",Small,Participant,,Disha Shetty,"Dear Judges, I am an independent science journalist based in Pune, India. I request you to consider my portfolio of data-driven stories on health and environment for the Sigma Awards 2022.  I have over a decade of work experience working across television, print and digital platforms in India in both full-time and independent roles. In 2017-18 I attended Columbia University for a mid-career masters programme on a scholarship that focused on health, environment and medicine journalism. My work since returning to India after that programme has involved taking all that training and putting it to use in a developing world setting.  I am a science journalist whose work intersects themes like gender, health and environment. Often a single piece of mine has all of those elements given most environment stories also have public health impacts for affected communities. In recent years I have travelled around India documenting the impact of climate change, reported from the UN on a UN fellowship and more recently reported from COP26 on an Earth Journalism Network fellowship for journalists from the developing countries.  Dr Randi Epstein at Columbia University and Samar Halarnkar, editor of Article 14, are among those I consider my mentors. Dr Jaya Shreedhar who taught me health reporting at Asian College of Journalism in 2012-13 and Dr Nagaraj Karkada an adjunct faculty there are also big influences. Both of them had encouraged me to apply to Columbia University and written my recommendation letters.  Much of my reporting is supported by grants from the Pulitzer Center, EJN and International Women’s Media Foundation that I have used to report on underreported issues from rural and tribal parts of India. My reporting has appeared in publications both in India like IndiaSpend and The Wire, and in international publications like Undark, Hakai and Forbes, among others.  In my reporting I aim to use data effectively and marry it with story-telling. For me this means using scientific studies, government data as well as those from interviews and to tell a coherent story. This is important as in a developing country setting data in isolation might not tell the full story as the data could be incomplete, entered wrongly or entirely absent. Often the lack of data tells a bigger story and in my reporting I try to highlight these aspects that form an integral part of data journalism in any developing country. Another aspect I pay close attention to in my climate reporting is interpreting global data sets for local audiences and what it could mean for them.  The stories I am entering as a part of the portfolio have been commissioned by a range of Indian and international publications as I spent all of 2021 working as an independent journalist. I request you to consider my portfolio for this award.   Warm Regards, Disha","Dear jury members, Thank you for your time in going through my stories. I will briefly explain my rationale behind entering each of these pieces.  The first piece is an essay for the international publication Undark that looked at emerging evidence on how women were responding better to COVID guidelines and how we could use this information to guide our policy response. This essay was based on a scientific study and was written at a time when pandemic response left out women’s voices right after the first wave, something that has since been more balanced. For me this piece was an attempt to use data to make a case for representation of more women in response.  My second and third pieces were from a project funded by the Pulitzer Center. It was a project on which I spent a year start to finish. From getting the funding to travel to then finding a home for the piece - it was a long journey. The story involved taking on big corporations that most Indian publications didn’t want to. I looked at the impact of coal dust in India’s smallest state Goa and raised the issue of lack of scientific evidence on how it was affecting the health of the community breathing in the coal dust. For the piece I married ground reporting, scientific evidence and raise the issue of lack of certain evidence that would weaken the community's fight for justice in the court of law.   In the third piece I spoke of how this is a systemic issue and explored how this lack of scientific evidence is a recurring theme in most environmental issues in India. This then allows governments and corporations to get away with wrongdoing. In this series I merged my expertise in both health and environment reporting to highlight systemic issues. I highlighted how lack of data fails many fights for justice - a theme familiar to most developing countries.  My final piece was also for Undark where I unpacked why it is important for any country to keep track of its dead. The piece was written at a time when a large number of Indians were dying of COVID and I stepped back to unpack what deaths tell us about the health of the living and why registering the dead is important for the living. Again, I tried to tell a systemic story here highlighting the need to maintain better public health data.  In all, my portfolio of stories range from solutions journalism to ground reporting with data being a common theme. It is also an example of what data journalism can look like in developing countries where the quality of data is dubious and quantity limited. I request you to consider the piece for the award. Thank you.   Warm Regards, Disha  ",English,https://undark.org/2021/02/04/pandemic-response-women-voices/,https://hakaimagazine.com/features/in-goa-the-water-runs-black/,https://www.article-14.com/post/the-lack-of-evidence-to-confirm-obvious-environmental-damage-is-derailing-local-battles-for-justice--6111ea1ef1f5c,https://undark.org/2021/09/01/the-struggle-to-keep-track-of-indias-dead/,,,,,,,,,,,,,
India,IndiaSpend,Small,Participant,,Shreya Raman,"I am an independent data journalist reporting on gender, health and public policy. My journalistic career began in May 2017 when I joined Mirror Now, a TV news channel after finishing my post-graduate diploma from Asian College of Journalism. After working for a year as a producer at Mirror Now, I joined IndiaSpend, a data journalism initiative that covers public policy issues. During my three-year stint at the digital non-profit , I wrote several longform reports on gender, health and employment, in addition to managing data projects and creating data visualisations for the website. My interest in data journalism began with the classes that Rukmini S–one of the most prominent data journalists in India–conducted at ACJ. Her classes formed the foundation to my approach to data and imbibed in me the importance of looking at data critically and reporting on them with nuance. At IndiaSpend, I was further able to nourish my interests in analysing and writing on data with active support and guidance from former editor Samar Halarnkar, deputy editor Karthik Madhavapeddi and my colleagues. In September 2019, I was selected as a finalist for the Impact Journalism Grant for a report on land rights of women farmers in India.In 2021, I was selected for three fellowships. The first one is a data journalism fellowship organised by Tableau Foundation and Equal Measures 2030 for which I wrote on an indepth report on how climate change is exacerbating violence against women. The second fellowship, organised by Rising Flame and Behanbox, is a reporting fellowship on issues of violence against women and trans persons with disabilities. In December 2021, I was also selected for the Global Nutrition and Food Security Fellowship by the International Center for Journalists. For the fellowship, I will be collaborating with a journalist from Kenya for a story on urban agriculture.","My portfolio includes 5 longform stories that I reported and wrote in 2021. While these stories do not share a common topic, they all aim to hold the government accountable by making data the crux. The first story in my portfolio tries to ascertain the progress made by state governments and companies in setting up creche facilities in offices. The article, written four years after an amendment mandating these creches, found that only 2 of the 28 state governments have notified rules and compliance is low. In April 2021, after the Indian government expanded COVID-19 vaccination to everyone above the age of 45, multiple state governments started reporting a vaccine shortage. While the central government denied any shortage, my co-writer Kriti Kapur and I analysed vaccination rates and earlier central government statements on vaccine availability to prove that the existing stock would not have lasted longer than a few days. In May 2021, the central government, while expanding the vaccination drive to include all adults, announced that state governments would have to procure the vaccines for those between the ages of 18 and 44. My colleague Shreehari Paliath and I analysed state government budgets, projected population figures and rates of COVID-19 vaccines and found that India’s poorest states might have to spend as much as 30% of their health budgets, adding to their debts. We also found how the central government had allocated more than enough money to pay for vaccines for all adults in the latest budget. The story was an attempt to highlight how policy decisions can lead to vaccine inequality. For both these stories on COVID-19 vaccination, I led the data analysis process and the writing. Last two stories of my portfolio look at the gendered impacts of the pandemic, specifically on women’s incomes. The first story highlighted how women from self help groups who helped mitigate the pandemic-related hunger and nutrition crisis, were unpaid for their labour. These women who prepared and served nearly half a million meals were struggling with reduced incomes and piling debt. The story was of increased importance because it highlights how the government initiative to fight hunger is built on women’s unpaid labour. The last story of this portfolio looks at the impact reverse migration of workers from cities to rural areas had on women farmers. The story counters the government's narrative about a booming agriculture sector by highlighting how despite increased agricultural outcomes, incomes and wages for farmers remain low.",English,https://www.indiaspend.com/women/large-employers-are-required-to-provide-creches-but-most-dont-733316,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19/india-may-not-have-enough-doses-to-meet-its-covid-vaccination-targets-data-show-741382,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19/8-poorest-states-may-spend-30-of-health-budgets-for-covid-19-vaccines-747578,https://www.indiaspend.com/womenwork/rural-women-collectives-struggle-to-survive-manage-covid-fallout-764367,https://www.indiaspend.com/agriculture/why-women-farmers-are-losing-jobs-earnings-savings-even-as-agriculture-booms-773953,,,,,,,,,,,,
Finland,Helsingin Sanomat,Big,Participant,,Helsingin Sanomat HS.fi Data Desk Portfolio,"Data desk, the digital journalism team in Finnish Helsingin Sanomat, has been doing cutting edge data journalism for years. The desk includes developers, data journalists and producers, and motion and graphic designers. The team does data journalism using large variety of sources and analysis tools. The team has broken countless news, developed innovative tools for the newsroom, pushed the limits of online narration. The team’s embrace of open data has lead, for example, to a position as a major COVID-19 data source to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The team, established ten years ago, has been a frontrunner of digital journalism in Finland.","A major part of data desk’s work is to create immersive and impactful stories online. They are created with all different departments of the newspaper. Helsingin Sanomat is a partially paywalled media, and a sizable share of new subscriptions for the newspaper come through data desk’s online stories. The portfolio represents different aspects of the team’s skillset. During 2021 much effort went into daily COVID-19 reporting, but there was time to also do an analysis on forest cuttings in Finland (“Metsä puilla paljailla”), do an interactive study on wildly varying housing prices in Finland (“Mihin rahasi riittävät?”), visualize the story of ice man Ötzi (“Ötzin tarina”), local election results and so on.

Finland,Helsingin Sanomat,Big,Participant,,Helsingin Sanomat HS.fi environment and climate stories,Helsingin Sanomat focused on environmental and climate journalism during 2021. This was visible from the front page of HS.fi to individual stories. Some of the most important stories were also data driven. Those are presented in this portfolio. The stories translate quite well to English using the translation tool in Chrome.,"How much time is there to act? We created a carbon budget count down calculator based on IPCC data. If the CO2 emission stay the same and we want to keep global warming under 1,5 degrees with high probability, we have about 8 years to act. This countdown calculator is also an element that has been used on the front page of HS.fi, embedded there with climate stories. Cut Down Forests. The story illustrates the cutting of forests in Finland. For the story we created an interactive map that has nearly all the cutting areas in Finnish forests from the last 15 years. This was the first time this kind of data was shown in Finnish journalism. The map itself tells a lot, and in addition, for the story we took forest experts for a walk to tell us what they see in different types of forests. Nature near you. We wanted to provide our readers with information on how to find valuable nature near them. Officials have mapped these places but the information is buried within the map services of different cities. For this story and map we collected this geodata from different cities and one nationwide official and put them in one map. If you live in the capital area of Finland you can now easily see what the nearest valuable nature places to you. The last forests with high biodiversity value. For this story we used an openly available geodata set that has the biodiversity value information for all the forests in Finland. The maps in the story clearly show that while Finland is a country with lots of forest, most of it not that diverse anymore. And that connects directly to nature loss. In the story we travel to one of the forests that still has high biodiversity value but is not conserved yet.",Finnish,https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000008292125.html,https://pakki-delivery.datadesk.hs.fi/?appId=549d58f4-25e5-4375-8c01-e7d0227c926d&brand=hs,https://dynamic.hs.fi/a/2021/hakkuut/,https://dynamic.hs.fi/a/2021/vihreatihmeet/,https://dynamic.hs.fi/a/2021/viimeisetrippeet/,,,,,,,,,,,,
Nigeria,PREMIUM TIMES,Small,Participant,,Yusuf Akinpelu,"Before I joined the BBC Lagos as an Interactive Journalist this year, I led the data desk at PREMIUM TIMES, Nigeria’s only Pulitzer-winning newspaper, with about a dozen awards and fellowships under my belt, becoming one of the youngest reporter-editor in my country.  I have led a series of data projects which has produced tremendous success in terms of reach and impact.  Under my leadership, my team was a able to publish scores of groundbreaking data stories, most authored by me, others co-authored. I provided editorial advise in the data visualisation for the maiden edition of PREMIUM TIMES' bank report last year.  After a yearlomg data collection and analysis, my team also published a story on what Nigerian asylum seekers tell Canadian authorities to entry into the Great White North. We did this by analysis and collating details of court transcripts published by the Canadian Federal Court and converting the information into spreadsheet format before analysing it and eventual storytelling.  Similarly, for the first time in Nigeria's history, I reviewed the curriculum vitae of the nation's current ministers and state governors and converted details in it into excel spreadsheet format. The three-part report compared the educational qualifications, age and alma mater of the nation's current ministers. This is one of the projects I applied with.  Prior to heading the data desk, I covered the National Assembly for the newspaper. I won the bronze trophy in the online category of the 2021 Norbert Zongo African Prize for Investigative Journalism for my story on how dirty fuels imported in Nigeria kill many. I'm a two-time fellow of the Oil and Gas Reporting programme organised by the Natural Resource and Extractives Programme (NAREP), a project of Premium Times Centre for Investigative Journalism. I was also a fellow of Civil Media Lab's Criminal Justice Reporting programme, where I reported about jungle justice. I give life to data by telling stories and taking data beyond the surface and digging deep by unveiling the humans behind them. This I do through compelling visualisation, excellent storytelling and critical analysis. Doing this, I've published over 50 stories. A graduate of statistics from the University of Ibadan, I'm also a satirist with Punocracy, and I've authored over three dozens fact checks for DUBAWA, a leading fact checking platform in Nigeria. In 2019, I was shortlisted for the Wealth of Nations/Thomson Reuters Foundation Reporting on illicit finance in Africa. The same year, I won the 2019 Youth Digest Campus Journalism Award of the Best News Writer, and 2018 UCJUI Award for Campus Journalist of the year. My exploits at Nigeria's leading investigative newspaper has opened doors for me, one of which informed how the BBC snapped me up to bring Mt wealth of experience to improve their data storytelling. I am particularly motivated to follow the path less followed by telling solution-driven human angle data stories. This is what ranks me as one of the best hands in the craft in my country. I also offer, for a large number of my peers and even senior colleagues in the field, mentorship and editorial advice in helping them chart accelerated growth in their career path. ","My entries focused on four areas of human development: environment, governance, education and criminal justice system. On environment, my three stories mined data from Nigeria's government-run petroleum company, NNPC, audit report which hadn't been published for over 40 years. The data examined the fiscal leakage and waste Nigeria incurs from the maintenance of its decrepit refineries as well as spending on the out-of-touch refineries over the years. The other parts examined the various data on how the importation of dirty fuels way below European standard are imported into Nigeria because of regulation laxity, thereby endangering the lives of Nigerians. I spoke with the people behind the data by humanising the story and visualising it. The story was further fledged by conduct crossborder research on the prices of fuel across other African countries. No sooner had the series being completed than the Nigerian government began the launch of its gas policy which ensures Nigeria taps into its huge proven natural gas deposits. One of the stories has won a continental award this year. On governance, I analysed the curriculum vitae of Nigeria's current 44 ministers. Extracting information into spreadsheet format to tell data story was the goal. Upon analysis, I was able to extract their ages, their educational qualifications and alma mater. Having to pore through hundreds of pages of resumes while comparing information with background checks took weeks. There were instances of missing information in the resumes, this was overcome by further research especially using biographies and historical information about the person in question. The three-part story was able to achieve one major discourse: the discrepancy between Nigerians and those that lead them. For instance, while more than 80 per cent of Nigerians haven't celebrated their 40th birthday, all but one of the ministers, including the one for youths, are way above their 50th birthday. The ministers' average age was 61 years. Appointing older citizens as ministers has been norm since the return to democracy in 1999, with the exception being in the early years after that when two ministers in their 30s were appointed. That was the youngest ever since then. The piece checked the government in its subsequent appointments with the appointment of a 40-year-old Abdulrasheed Bawa as the nation's antigraft agency boss. On the criminal justice system, I titled the two-part series ""Dying Inside."" This was to mirror how Nigerian prisons risk dying before their day in court due to the poor condition of the prisons and overcrowding. In never-seen-before jail daata, which is never published by the prison authorities, I was able to paint a vivid picture of the prison situation in the country. The data was obtained in confidence from the records department of the correctional centre, in liaison with another journalist, Juliana Francis of the News Telegraph. It detailed the breakdown of the state-by-state as well as prison-by-prison figure of prisoners in the country, those awaiting trial, those convicted and those on death row. The story ultimately reignited the discussion around death penalty in the country. It opened up on the condition of the inmates on death row and how conservative governors would rather hold inmates on death row for years than sign their death warrant. Still, despite that they seldom use the law, they wouldn't repeal it. The story picked the interest of the Death Penalty Project which reshared the story. On education, I analysed the official state-by-state out-of-school children data but did not stop there. I went further to collate the federal allocation to each state since the beginning of the Buhari presidency in 2015 and compare the states with the highest",English,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/452486-analysis-despite-govts-repeated-promises-importation-of-dirty-fuels-continues-in-nigeria.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/435772-special-report-how-nigerians-are-paying-deadly-price-for-europes-dirty-fuel.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/450407-despite-being-majority-young-nigerians-excluded-from-ministerial-positions.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/448722-special-reports-about-one-third-of-nigerias-ministers-attended-same-university.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/451378-analysis-about-half-of-nigerias-current-ministers-studied-these-courses.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/502989-dying-inside-prisons-in-10-states-in-nigeria-hold-80-of-countrys-death-row-inmates.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/503081-dying-inside-ii-prisons-in-lagos-rivers-kano-hold-highest-number-of-awaiting-trial-inmates.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/489846-analysis-nigerian-states-receiving-huge-federal-allocations-but-cant-keep-children-in-school.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/483619-special-report-kano-akwa-ibom-eight-other-states-housed-most-of-nigerias-out-of-school-children.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/458507-analysis-as-nigeria-continues-to-miss-gas-flaring-deadlines-huge-revenue-is-lost.html,,,,,,,
Hungary,"ATLO, Átlátszó",Small,Shortlist,,ATLO – Hungarian data and visual journalism,"ATLO is a Budapest-based visual journalism project. It was launched by Hungarian investigative journalism center Átlátszó in November 2018. Since then we created more than 60 projects for clients and for own purpose. Our works are often featured in local and international sites, television and radio channels, conferences and listings. The team currently is a duo of two data journalists and visualisation experts: Attila Bátorfy, who is head of team and creator of the ATLO project, and Krisztián Szabó.  Bátorfy has been working in the field of journalism since 2008, and has been working with data since 2014. He is a master teacher of journalism, media studies and information graphics at the Media Department of Eötvös Loránd University, and research fellow and data advisor at the Central European University's Center for Media, Data and Society and serve on the editorial board of Médiakutató, a quarterly scientific journal of Media Studies. For his journalistic work he was awarded with the Transparency-Soma Prize for the best investigative reporting, two Quality Journalism Prizes, the János Eörsi Memorial Award for the best economic investigative article and he received the Junior Prima Prize.  Szabó finished his masters degree at the Media Department of Eötvös Loránd University in media studies in 2021 summa cum laude. He is part of Átlátszó since May 2020, with the expertise in data journalism and data visualisation. He is also part of the graphic team ATLO. In 2021, he received the Junior Prima Prize for his journalistic work. Our work is seperated into two aspects: creating visualisation stories for our own purpose and for clients. in 2021, we created nine bigger projects (3 of which were for clients) and several smaller visualisations, maps, and experimental work. We also work as the data journalism team of investigative journalism center Átlátszó.  We are inspired by the country we live in: Hungary has great potential regarding data visualisation, and it is visible in the large share of projects we created over the years. We are also inspired by a international data journalism community and visualisation experts: some of our work and experiments this year were inspired by material we saw on the internet, mostly on Twitter.  ","Hungarian Money was a cross-border project supported by IJ4EU, where five investigative newsrooms from Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia uncovered the international spendings of the Hungary-based Gábor Bethlen Fund. ATLO was behind the data analysis and visualisation in the articles,the site creation, and a general help to other contributors. The project was listed in a weeky collection of best data journalism projects by GIJN. Mosquito Monitor was a client work for the Hungarian Centre for Ecological Research. Their aim is to monitor the presence of invasive mosquito species. They have been collecting data for years, and they needed a website where this data could be presented in an appropriate and interactive way. Site building and visualisations, as well as data automatisation (via Google Sheets) was made by our team. We are still frequently doing maintenance work on the site, adding new charts and expanding the scope of the project. Alternative Budapest was a collaboration between ATLO and Budapest Brand. The aim of the project was to create an ""online issue"" mapping the web of cultural places located in Budapest. Data collection was made by the Budapet Brand team, our team was invited to the project to create interactive visualisations from the collected data. In the end, we created most of the site, added more functionality, uploaded articles to the ""application"" and helped the team during the launch phase of the project. A year of the pandemic (A járvány egy éve) is a custom-made scrollytelling visualisation, telling the story of the first year of covid in Hungary through the daily published data. The project was listed in a weeky collection of best visualisations by GIJN. Hungarian Oppositional Pre-elections of 2021: this project was an election-tracking website, that showed live-updated visualisations about the status of the Hungarian Pre-elections. The site also offered viewers additional visualisations and analytical articles about the background and preludes of the event. The site had 300 thousand visits with 170 thousand unique visitors during the two days of the vote count. It was also included in a weekly collection by Datawrapper. In a summertime project, we compiled the past 125 years of the Olympic Games, with the scope of all Hungarian medalists in the history of the Olympics.  We also created three experimental map-based works about certain aspects of Hungary: Climate Maps compiled several versions of Hungary, based on weather and human impact. Half Hour Distance was another experiment, showing in 3d ""coral-like"" formations how far away one can go by car from the capitals of each county. It was inspired by Craig Taylor's Coral Cities and was included in Datawrapper's weekly list. Hungary's Elevation Map showcases the elevation levels of Hungary by every 100 meter, with the inspiration from Alasdair Rae's tweet. It was included in Datawrapper's weekly list of interesting works. Here you can find an overview.  Apart from that we wrote more than 100 data-based articles in various topics and created around 700 charts and diagrams to those articles in the data journalism department of Átlátszó. ","English, Hungarian",https://atlo.team/atlo-team-english/,http://hungarianmoney.eu,https://szunyogmonitor.hu/index.php/szunyogmonitor-english/,https://terkep.alternativbudapest.hu/index.html,https://atlo.team/ajarvanyegyeve/,https://atlo.team/ellenzekielovalasztas/,https://atlo.team/olimpia125/,https://atlo.team/fel-orara/,https://atlo.team/domborzat/,https://atlo.team/idojaras-klima-es-emberi-tevekenyseg-terkepeken/,,,,,,,
Spain,The Washington Post,Big,Shortlist,,Adrián Blanco's portfolio,"Dear 2022 Sigma Awards Committee,  During the past few years as a Graphics reporter at The Washington Post, I've analyzed dozens of datasets and published dozens of pieces, hundreds of graphics and experimented with new ways for data to tell stories. ""Biden nominated as many minority women to be judges in four months as Trump had confirmed in four years"" and ""More than 1,700 congressmen once enslaved Black people"" are two pieces I have recently worked on that show complex analyses of hand-crafted databases, high-quality data visualizations and curated design. Over this time, I have become a better graphics reporter, widening my range of technical and visual skills. From my position in the newsroom, I have tried to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing and learning across the Graphics team and the newsroom. I have been part of the onboarding process of numerous colleagues, offering support and solving questions, teaching them the systems in place and making them feel welcome from the very first minute on the team. As a Graphics reporter, I always aim to create beautiful and well designed graphics that stop people from scrolling to take a deeper look and leave having learned something new and unexpected. I strongly believe on the use of highly curated visualizations to explain complex concepts such as redistricting, policy making or even election results that have an impact in our daily lives. As data and visual reporters, I believe we have the capacity to not only react to the news with explainers, but also push exclusive content and generate our own databases where no data exists. This piece titled  ""How the coronavirus exposed health disparities in communities of color"" is one that I worked on at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. It showcases my interest in pushing for more investigative, highly curated and uniquely presented content. I am fascinated by the possibilities the intersection of reporting, data and design offers to journalism. Not only do I put this combination of skills in practice on my own work,  but also advocate for it. In my free time, I have also mentored students and taught classes on these disciplines at Master's levels. Kind regards, Adrián Blanco Ramos adrianblancoramos.com","Dear 2022 Sigma Awards Committee,  My portfolio showcases my goal of innovation and thinking outside of the box for daily pieces to highly curated investigations. No matter the topic or the approach, my goal when working on a story or graphic is to create a ‘whoa’ factor for the reader.  In terms of presentation, I always pursue beautiful and well designed stories that stop people from scrolling to take a deeper look and leave having learned something new and unexpected. Examples of highly sophisitcated data visualizations include a population change cartogram I worked on for the Census 2020 state population release and an analysis on how America’s demographics are changing. The story included covering the abstraction of reality in the shape of a cartogram indicating demographic change thorough out the U.S.,  is truly unique as it encodes several variables such as population totals, shifts and growth. I followed a similar abstract concept on the second story where the mountains represent demographic change by county. Behind the scenes, I have developed a wide range of skills to analyze complex databases, identify the most important patterns in the database and prepare the main findings for publication. The analysis by race and gender of the federal judiciary in the U.S., as well as the investigation on the congressmen who once enslaved Black people are examples of sophisticated analyses based on hand-crafted datasets created in the newsroom for investigative purposes that I have worked on during the past year.. My portfolio also features a few courses and workshops on data visualization and data analysis that I taught over the past year. I find it incredibly rewarding to teach others and help them grow and develop their skills to become better reporters. The original topics, attention to the detail and the technical skills put into practice to create these pieces are some of the things I enjoy the most while reporting. I feel strongly that this portfolio reflects my passion and aim as a reporter.  Links to these stories and my work are attached.

India,IndiaSpend,Small,Participant,,"Shreya Khaitan, IndiaSpend","I have been a journalist for seven years. I started off at The Wall Street Journal as a reporter for their India blog, India Real Time. There I researched for a series on drug resistant tuberculosis and wrote on a number of topics, ranging from reservation for women in Indian politics to the black and yellow taxis plying the city’s roads. Returning to India, after a course on global human development at Georgetown University in Washington DC, I wanted to combine data, development issues and journalism, and I found my home at IndiaSpend, where I have spent the last five years. I write on several issues, mainly education and health. I also edit stories. My report on a pilot TB care programme in Gujarat's Mehsana district won the 2017 REACH Media Award for excellence in reporting on TB. Through my stories, I try to give more nuanced, detailed and accurate information on major developmental issues in India. During the Covid-19 surge, I wrote about children's issues that were being forgotten in the surge of the virus. More often than not, journalism that gets the most attention is either reactive or sensational, and one very important aspect, that of delving deeper to provide a more thoughtful, nuanced view on issues--such as children with Covid-19 and orphans--is missed. I try to do exactly that in the stories I have submitted for this award. ","During the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, misinformation abound, especially related to children and Covid-19, not just on social media but also in news media. In these two stories, I attempted to get the facts straight on two bits of misinformation: 1. More children are suffering from Covid-19 and more are getting serious Covid-19 in the second wave 2. There is a tide of abandoned minors because of their parent's death from Covid-19 I used the limited data that was available, and combined that with testimony from doctors, child protection experts and with conversations with people on the ground. This was a case where data could give only part of the facts, a common situation during the pandemic (and otherwise), but the truth became clear with reporting. On the first, I found a common error we all make, by conflating large numbers with a problem being more common. More children in India were getting Covid-19, but not because children were more susceptible to the Delta variant but because cases overall were increasing; in fact in 2021, a similar proportion of all cases were in children as was the case in the previous wave in 2020. Understandably, the number of serious cases was also larger than previous waves, but the risk of severe infection in children remained about the same. I also explained the different manifestations of Covid-19 in children and what doctors and parents suggested as the best ways to care for suffering children. One of the main challenges here was to get through to parents as well as children to understand their experiences of the disease. We were able to even get children on video for this, while also talking (not on video) to a parent whose child had suffered greatly because of a post-Covid-19 manifestation called Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome. On the second, social media posts amplifying requests on assisting children orphaned because of Covid-19, were picked up by news media, and turned into stories, including by international media, on how a surge of orphaned children in India needed help. There was not much public data at that time, since data comes with a lag, but I got access to some data from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, presented in a court case. This, I combined with ground reporting to know whether organisations were seeing a manifold rise in orphaned children. The reality, I found, was that there were fewer orphaned children than the wild estimates. In addition, the issue was not one of abandaned children, but that of help for kin and extended family to support these children. I used the opportunity to explain why calls on social media to adopt orphaned children were illegal and why children are better taken care of by immediate and extended family, if they are happy to take them in. The challenge with this story was to get the facts straight without undermining the very real and heart-wrenching struggle of orphaned children. The two other stories covered the major issues that children were facing due to the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic, and due to prolonged schools closures, which impacted children's mental health and learning. I wrote the story on how Covid-19 disrupted education with a focus on children's voices--that we needed to hear from those who had been impacted, rather than experts.",English,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19/most-children-getting-mild-covid-19-even-severe-cases-treatable-746129,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19/what-calls-for-adopting-covid-orphans-are-missing-752632,https://www.indiaspend.com/child-rights/how-covid-has-put-children-at-risk-of-abuse-labour-marriage-755065,https://www.indiaspend.com/education-check/education-disrupted-children-lose-friends-learning-schools-remain-shut-766847,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia,IStories,Small,Participant,,Polina Uzhvak,"I published my first texts seven years ago in a free local city newspaper. I was in high school then and barely someone read my articles. Even then, I realized that the problems of garbage dumps and bad roads are more interesting than concerts and celebrations which I was asked to describe. I wanted to write about problems and hoped that it could solve them or at least draw attention to them.   During my study at the university, I was an intern in different Russian outlets, such as Novaya Gazeta and Takie Dela. I wrote reports about ecology, poverty, problems of disabled people, homeless rehabilitation, animal shelters. I liked my work but realized that personal stories and interviews with experts do not show the whole issue objectively. So I started to search other formats.   Math and statistics have been always fascinated me (oddly enough for a journalism student in Russia), that's why I chose a master's program in Data Journalism. Russian Data Journalism is young. Some teachers had barely understood what we were going to do, but the course of data visualization was really useful. I was inspired by our teacher  Alexander Bogachev, who explained to us the basics of data analysis and data visualization. With him, we went from basics, such as ""how to open a .csv file"", to interactive dashboards and the first data stories.   My first data story was about the phenomenon of secondary orphanhood. It is when adoptive parents return orphans to Orphanage. I published it in 2020 in IStories, together with my mentor Sonia Savina, we prepared a video data report on this topic. We have combined the data and personal stories of the people. I liked this format and tried to use it in the following texts. My internship in IStories grew into a full-time job, and at the end of 2020, I became a member of the IStories data department.   2021 was the most interesting and productive year of seven years in the field of journalism. I worked with some of the best data journalists in Russia. I used all skills I had learned during my studies and continued to learn from more experienced colleagues. For a whole year, I have been looking for social topics that are interesting to me and that no one has ever covered using data and numbers. Ecology problems, workers' rights, problems of orphans, schools in the regions, election fraud — these are the topics I worked with.   In our editorial, data-journalists not only analyze data and write texts, but also prepare visualizations, organize trips to Russian regions, and write scripts for video data reports. Moreover, we make video tutorials for beginners in data journalism. My work has become multitasking and I find it exciting.   2021 was the year when I started doing the journalism I dreamed of. Sometimes I was wrong, chose the wrong strategies and made mistakes, but it was a great experience that gave me useful skills.     But so far, my data investigation and reporting have not yet led to serious changes. Official services ignored the problems even if all the evidence was presented. It's demotivating. But this year I will try to be more persistent. To be considered for the portfolio prize at this year’s Sigma awards would be an important sign that I am moving in the right direction.","This year I wrote some articles about issues that have been mentioned in public but have not been proven with data yet. For example, housing for orphans. Russian law guarantees free housing for orphans over 18 years old. According to the research, about 200’000 orphans remain homeless and this number increases each year. Orphans wait for their flats for years: in some regions over 40 years.    Russian government keeps data in so-called statistical forms. These are large Excel files, one per each of the 85 Russian regions, with a lot of pages. These files are unsuitable for data analysis. I found a method how to collect the necessary data from such tables even without programming skills. This method was useful for my other articles. I also wrote a detailed tutorial on it for journalists.   Then I wrote about schools problems. I decided to research the topic after my dad said that his school amenities have not been changing for 30 years. The school has modern computers — but a hole in the floor instead of a toilet.   I found that more than 6’000 school buildings do not have even the basic amenities and 11% of the buildings required capital renovation. The main difficulty was a data limitation. Many problems such as mold on the walls or rotten floors cannot be counted. To highlight them I took an interview with parents and principals. Some of them refused to talk because they found these problems embarrassing and were afraid of the consequences. But I was able to find heroes who find childrens’ health more important than a school reputation.   I made the second research about Russian schools with Yulia Alykova. To find populated places situated far from schools we made a script in Python which matches a settlement with the closest school and shows the distance between them. We discovered that at least 100’000 schoolchildren who live far from school are not provided with school buses. So kids have to walk to school along a highway and through a forest. Sometimes it leads to accidents.    The other three data investigations show how official statistics hide serious problems of labor rights, ecology and poverty.  I wrote about data manipulation that leads to workers' deaths. According to the International Labor Organization, there are between 500 and 1000 non-fatal accidents at work for one accident that resulted in death in developed countries. There are only 22 non-fatal accidents for one death in Russia. This is an indicator of incomplete data. Most workers were afraid to talk, but some confirmed anonymously that employers force them to record work-related injuries as domestic injuries. As a result, employees continue to work in dangerous conditions and die.   For the story about air pollution, I examined all available government datа, standards, federal programs. I discovered that standards were loosened, the state monitoring covers only 20% of Russian cities and does not track all emissions. The results of such measurement cannot be reliable. But the government continues to rely on them and ignore suffering people.   I also wrote about poverty. Аccording to official statistics, the poverty level in Russia is decreasing. But studies based on the deprivation model don’t confirm it. For example, almost half of Russians cannot afford to buy two pairs of shoes for a season for each family member. I have combined government statistics and data from scientists' research to show why the problem is invisible and why the living wage in Russia cannot be associated with normal life. I implemented scrollytelling to explain the topic in a visual way using Flourish and JS library Scrollama.","English, Russian",https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/02/11/orphans-housing/,https://www.istories.media/en/reportages/2021/03/15/schools-basic-amenities-problems/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/05/14/schools-accessibility/,https://www.istories.media/en/investigations/2021/06/10/deaths-at-work/,https://www.istories.media/en/investigations/2021/08/05/russian-environmental-monitoring-system-does-not-work/,https://www.istories.media/en/reportages/2021/09/09/poverty/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pq0RjfpEM&t=426s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqp7H49T13o,https://istories.media/workshops/2021/03/22/power-query/,,,,,,,,
Brazil,Fogo Cruzado,Small,Participant,,Cecilia Olliveira,"Over a million Brazilians have been murdered since I decided to become a journalist back in 2001 — more than the entire death toll of the U.S.-led Global War on Terror, which began the same year. As a young woman from a working class background who was the first in the family to go to college, I knew that I wanted to dedicate myself to an issue that impacted the daily lives of my community. This is why I have spent my career investigating the drug war, arms trafficking, and violence both at the individual level and through data to reveal broader trends in my nation’s ongoing daily tragedy. I’ve had the good fortune to work with local NGOs and the U.N. doing data-driven reporting on urban violence. I worked for years alongside legendary British reporter Misha Glenny as a researcher on his book, “Nemesis: One Man and the Battle for Rio,” which uses the story of one of Rio’s most infamous drug bosses to explain the city’s drug war and I’ve spent years doing deep investigations into paramilitary militias and drug gangs for news outlets like The Intercept and El País. Since 2015, I run Fogo Cruzado, an independent data journalism initiative that tracks gun violence in the Rio de Janeiro and Recife greater metropolitan areas.  FC provides real-time alerts for the 400,000+ users who downloaded our app to help them avoid active shootouts. It also collects, verifies, and publishes a rich dataset that is regularly used by other journalists, academics, and public officials to better understand the situation we live in. Everything is open source and free. I founded FC out of my frustration with the lack of high-quality data in my field. It was clear to me that the police were intentionally hiding and even obfuscating data that it did not want the public to see. Rio was under the global spotlight and the governor did not want facts getting in the way of his narrative of reformation and progress. Our data journalism helped change the story and expose the truth about what was really going on. I started collecting the data on my own using a simple Excel spreadsheet and relying on open source intelligence and my network of sources, but soon gained the support of Amnesty International, which invested in the project and helped turn FC into something much more ambitious. Now, we are an NGO with a staff of 21 that has partnered with nearly 100 academic institutions, and been cited thousands of times in the local and international media. We are the go-to source of reliable data on 20 measures of gun violence with plans to expand to more cities. Due to our work, we have received recognition and prizes from the Federal Supreme Court, the Public Ministry, and multiple journalism awards. Our data was also used as key evidence in a Supreme Court ruling that severely limited the police’s ability to launch deadly raids in favelas during the Covid-19 pandemic, resulting in an immediate 70% reduction in homicides. In 2020, I was a finalist for Reporters Without Borders' Press Award and earned a fellowship from the Shuttleworth Foundation.  As a reporter, I use FC data and cross-reference it against original, on the ground investigations or other datasets that allow us to produce original insights, such as revealing the moment when police-led paramilitary militias became more prominent in Rio’s crime scene than traditional drug gangs, or collecting bullet casings from recent shootouts to trace the illicit, international origins of the munitions that fuel the bloodshed.","I am the founder and executive director of Fogo Cruzado, the project that I am submitting for consideration by the Sigma Award committee. At Fogo Cruzado, we produce, verify, analyze, and distribute 27 categories of high-quality, original data about armed violence that can be found nowhere else covering 34 cities in the greater Rio de Janeiro and Recife metropolitan areas. Our goal is to create accountability, save lives, and help promote a better understanding of armed violence in order to reduce it.  Over 400,000 people have downloaded our app and our work is regularly featured in every major news outlet in Brazil, as well as major international ones, making us, arguably, the largest and most influential source of journalism on armed violence in Brazil. Our goal is impact, therefore we exert great effort to ensure that we are viewed as partners and not rivals by other news outlets. When a shooting happens, our team tracks it in real time using social media, user submissions, trusted sources, and official accounts. Our data analyst will confirm the information is accurate, geolocate it, then push it out on social media and our app. We will then follow up to discover if anyone was injured or killed, if the police were involved, if it took place near a school or hospital, and many other relevant data points. This information is then systematically loaded into our database which anybody can access and we produce monthly and annual reports, which is also cross-referenced with other datasets, and can be compared year over year. We also assist researchers, journalists, and public officials to access and understand the data. Journalists on our team also sort through the data to find leads for interesting investigations, which we either report on our own or develop in collaboration with other media outlets.  FC data has recently been used to draw attention to the tragic number of children and adolescents who are accidentally killed during shootouts in Rio. In 2021, our data was essential to develop a new state law that prioritizes investigations into the murders of children and adolescents. That same year, we were called before the Federal Supreme Court to explain how police tactics in favelas were actually driving the majority of homicides in Rio, rather than preventing them. In 2021, FC has again participated in multiple award-winning investigations, including a look at how the Covid-19 pandemic has driven violence in Recife, a map of armed groups in Rio, and a report on the similar modus operandi of death squads that commit massacres in poor neighborhoods across Brazil. We were also recognized by the prestigious Innovare Prize from the Federal Supreme Court.  The importance of our work has also been acknowledged by the Ford Foundation, Open Society Foundations, Oak Foundation and others who provide us with essential operational funding. With this help, we have been busy innovating structurally. Over the past 14 months, we have dramatically overhauled our API, website, app, and backend to develop new tools and make it easier to operate and access our database. This open source software will be launched shortly and will be freely available to any other organizations that want to use them. We’ve also implemented psychological counseling to assist our staff who, through their work, are in daily contact with horrific violence. I am extremely proud of what FC has accomplished in only a few short years and our ambitious plans to expand. The FC team would be extremely honored to be considered for recognition by the Sigma Awards, an organization representing the best in data journalism. Thank you.  ","English, Portuguese",https://api.fogocruzado.org.br/,https://github.com/voltdatalab/crossfire,https://erickgn.github.io/mapafc/,https://documental.xyz/intervencao,http://apps.mprj.mp.br/sistema/inloco/,https://theintercept.com/2019/06/08/pernambuco-predisio-tiroteio/,https://theintercept.com/2019/12/16/brazil-bullets-guns-ammunition-analysis/,https://theintercept.com/2018/12/13/brazil-rio-de-janeiro-drug-gangs/,https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2021-04-29/100-criancas-baleadas-em-cinco-anos-de-guerra-contra-a-infancia-no-rio-de-janeiro.html,https://theintercept.com/2020/10/26/chacina-sobre-rodas/,,,,,,,
Kyrgyzstan,Temirov Live,Small,Participant,,"Public Foundation ""New Media""","Our organization “New Media” has only been around for a year. During this time, she made a noticeable leap, we managed to implement several projects: 1) The first project we started with was “Temirov Live”, an investigative project from Kyrgyzstan created by journalist Bolot Temirov. Bolot Temirov was included by the US State Department in the list of 12 people – anticorruption champions award (around the world). https://kg.usembassy.gov/factcheck-kgs-bolot-temirov-receives-u-s-state-departments-inaugural-anticorruption-champion-award He was among the prize-winners in investigations at local journalistic competitions. https://t.me/gijnRu/861 “Temirov Live” sets the mission of realizing the function of the media as the fourth estate. The goal is to combat corruption by publicizing investigations of corruption or other criminal activities of representatives of the judicial, legislative and executive branches of government. As well as the identification of the criminal activity of organized criminal groups. After the start of the project, it became clear that one should not be limited only to the main activity; it is necessary to develop investigative journalism in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia. Among other things, expand its activities and bring investigations to legal consequences. That is, to submit to courts, complaints and other actions that would lead to the restoration of justice and legality. Achieving transparency in the activities of the authorities, thereby eradicating the irresponsibility of state bodies under pain of public censure and reaction. “Temirov live” YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpZtteaL03_LrVORzSfxwZg 2) The second project is the “Ait Ait Dese” YouTube channel. A project consisting of video materials in the Kyrgyz language aimed at the regions of the country. Akin the improviser(poet-improviser), tells about urgent problems in Kyrgyzstan such as high levels of corruption and low levels of accountability; illegal attempts to regulate the activities of NGOs, harassment of independent media and political suppression of freedom of speech; poor understanding of democratic processes and institutions, especially in rural areas; and general political instability due to regional and clan fragmentation of the population. Through the traditional method of communicating information, we convey the importance of these issues to the deepest layers of the population. To date, the project ""Ait Ait Dese"" covers the investigations of the ""Temirov Live"" channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWrgXNU6_vblOSq3pR34-vg/featured The project began its activities in June this year, but in such a short time it managed to attract attention in well-known media: https://detector.media/infospace/article/193135/2021-10-24-v-kyrgyzkomu-yutubi-zyavyvsya-kanal-avtor-yakogo-perespivuie-antykoruptsiyni-zhurnalistski-rozsliduvannya-v-tradytsiyakh-narodnoi-muzyky-video/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtmuryvxPZY https://t.me/gijnRu/1839","                                       How brown coal is killing us       This investigation describes the causes of the smog in Bishkek, which has been hanging over the city every winter since 2016. During the investigation, we learned that the main factor is residential areas, then the Thermal power plant and last are cars. And the smog appeared because, since 2017, imports of Shubarkol coal from Kazakhstan have been halved every year. And people had to use Karakeeche brown coal, which produces much more harmful substances than Shabyrkul. And also, the Thermal power plant is starting to use brown coal more and more every year.        In this investigation we conducted a regression analysis, we used AQI(air quality index) values as the dependent variable, and as independent variables, we used days when CHP worked (1) and days when CHP did not work (0), packed in a categorical variable, and for cars we also used a categorical variable, 1 - when there were almost no cars, it was during the pandemic when traffic was controlled and there were not many cars, 0 - the rest of the time.  And for the residential sector, we used the average temperature values for the day (when it's cold, people start heating their houses).    We collected this data using web scraping (python, BS4 library, Selenium)                                   Stolen mandates in parliament 2021       This investigation refers to several violations by the Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan. First - on November 28 after 8:00 p.m. information appears in all Kyrgyz mass media that turnout was 1 215 527 people. And on December 20 the website says that the turnout was 1,293,831 people. That is 78 thousand ballots came out of nowhere. Second - the votes of Ali Toktakunov, the candidate of the Atameken party, decreased by about 100 votes. Thirdly, we conducted a regression analysis and found out that on average the pro-government parties gain less at the polling stations where violations were observed, and the opposition parties, on the contrary, gain more at the stations where violations were observed and observers were active.       In this investigation, we collected voting data using web scraping (python, BS4 library, Selenium), and compared the number of votes in different time periods.       We also conducted a regression analysis, as a dependent variable we took the number of party votes at each polling station, and as an independent variable, we used the data on reported violations to the Central Election Commission and the ""Kloop.kg"" news agency. (1 - polling stations where violations were observed, 0 - polling stations where no violations were observed)","Kyrgyz, Russian",https://youtu.be/B9xtAQIPqXo,https://youtu.be/j4xmOIdWHk4,https://youtu.be/SJaA9y7NpVk,https://youtu.be/v8tK6DSejlI,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia,"Important Stories, YouTube",Small,Participant,,Sonya Savina,"I am a data journalist for ""Important Stories"", a small investigative media based in Russia. I have been working as a data journalist for 5 years. My career started after graduation from the National Research University ""Higher School of Economics"" in Moscow, where I got my master's degree in data journalism. Before ""Important Stories"" I worked as a data journalist for RBC, Proekt and Conflict Intelligence Team.  My area of interest is to unveil social problems in Russia through the open data. I suppose that my approach to tell people data-stories is unique for Russian data journalism, because it combines insights based on data analysis and also stories told by ordinary Russian people who are faced with problems which I found in data. I believe that behind every cell in Excel spreadsheets there is a real person and often they are victims of bad government decisions.  I usually work in two different formats: publish a text story with data visualisations on our site and make a video version for YouTube.  The whole year of 2021 was tough for our team and for all of the Russian independent journalists. For example, the Russian government designated ""Important Stories"" as a ""foreign agent"" (this is a kind of repressive policy towards Russian independent journalism). It happened after we published several investigations about president Vladimir Putin and his allies. Despite all of this pressure, 2021 was full of interesting data stories that we published, some of which I invite you to read.","The article ""I'm never going back to that hell — I don't want to give birth in this country anymore"" tells why in Russia despite all the government's promises to help pregnant women, they are still scared to give birth. We have analysed data concerning maternal and infant mortality rates and talked to families whose children either suffered trauma or died during labour. The video version of the story gained more than 500 thousand views (https://youtu.be/QGZAI5wBNG8). After this story was published, we received many similar stories from all over the country. Also one of our heroines won the court against the doctors and they paid her compensation. In the data story ""They have been re-optimized to the point that soon no one will be able to get sick at all"" we have proved that 20 million Russians may not be able to wait for an ambulance to arrive when their lives are at stake. To assess the territorial availability of emergency medical care, we calculated the travel time from each Russian settlement to the nearest medical institution, at which an ambulance can be located. To build routes, we collected the coordinates of Russian settlements and the nearest medical facilities. Then we wrote a program in the Python programming language, which for each locality searches for the nearest medical facility and calculates the distance to it and the time on the road using the Yandex API. We have also made a video report (https://youtu.be/JeCt_eux8-U) from a Russian district, where the only ambulance team serves 40 settlements, with a population of 10 thousand. For the data story ""I sit and pray to God to get there alive"" we analyzed all available open data on public transportation system in Russia. We found out that most of the public transport in Russia is worn out and accidents are becoming more frequent. To test how safe and accessible Russian public transport really is we went to Astrakhan, the city that is declared the worst in terms of the quality of passenger traffic. For a data story ""To stand in a queue for thirty years – we will stay alive in despite"" we analyzed data on queues for apartments in Russian regions and found that 54 % of all Russian families have been waiting in queue for housing for ten or more years. We investigated how it can affect ""children of the GULAG"" (old people who were repressed during the Soviet era and members of their families who are trying to return home from exile) and found that they could never wait to return from exile because of the queues. In the data story ""Houses wintered with snow"" we analyzed data on resettlement from deteriorated houses in Russia and figured out, in which regions people wait for resettle for the longest time. We also talked to the town residents in one of the Russian regions, where every third is forced to survive under a rotten roof, with a leaky floor and without central heating.  I am the principal creator of all these projects: my role was to collect, analyze, vizualise data and also reporting. I am also thankful to my co-author Gleb Limansky for filming and editing video-versions in 3 of these projects.","English, Russian",https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/06/01/im-never-going-back-to-that-helli-dont-want-to-give-birth-in-this-country-anymore/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/07/26/they-have-been-re-optimized-to-the-point-that-soon-no-one-will-be-able-to-get-sick-at-all/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/11/15/i-sit-and-pray-to-god-to-get-there-alive/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/01/19/to-stand-in-a-queue-for-thirty-years-we-will-stay-alive-in-despite/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/03/01/houses-wintered-with-snow/,,,,,,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,BBC,Big,Participant,,BBC Shared Data Unit,"The BBC Shared Data Unit has continued to promote and support data journalism at a regional level across the UK, whilst making national and local headlines with a series of public interest data investigations.  The team’s collaborative model sees it share its data journalism with more than 1,000 local news outlets across television, radio, print and digital.  During the course of the year, the team have also led three masterclasses in investigative journalism for regional journalists, and hosted more than 30 drop-in sessions for journalists wanting to learn key technical skills.   The team’s public interest data investigations have made headlines across the BBC and regional news teams across the UK.  The team focuses on finding news stories that are hiding in plain sight, using data journalism techniques to explore the impact of local and national government policies on the lives of individuals.  A commitment to transparency and the open data movement is at the heart of our team and our output.  We have demonstrated how adopting open data principles enhances the trust in our reporting, builds a personal relationship with audiences and helps to engage them in the process of journalism.   We demonstrate our commitment to transparency through sharing source data, methods and code for every project we embark upon. Prior to the pandemic, the SDU had offered in-person training at the team’s headquarters in Birmingham.  When the team resorted to working from home, it had to explore new ways of delivering its commitment to help promote data journalism skills across the regional news industry.  We piloted several approaches and asked for feedback from participants.  We now have a three-tiered approach to delivering training   A week-long masterclass   A chapterised version of the masterclass taking place every Monday for ten weeks   Drop-in lunchtime sessions   The week-long masterclass offers journalists more than 25 hours of in-person training in investigative data journalism.  Participants develop skills to be able to source, clean, analyse and visualise datasets for their audiences, as well as exploring more advanced techniques such as how to maximise their use of Freedom of Information laws, how to scrutinise Companies House accounts and how to use advanced internet searches.  The chapterised version of the masterclass gives the same experience to journalists unable to commit to the week-long experience, whilst the drop-in sessions give journalists an opportunity to pick up a new skill over their lunch hour.  On the back of our training, regional news journalists have been able to tell stories that would otherwise have gone untold.","The team has demonstrated a wide range of technical skills across its portfolio.  Techniques include accessing open data sources, using Freedom of Information laws, scraping data from websites or building our own databases.  What matters is finding the right data to bring important information into the public record. For example, this year the team's senior reporter Alex Homer published a series of investigations into the work of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).  His reporting examined three key area:    Internal reviews by the DWP when a person claiming benefits dies or comes to serious harm   The rising proportion of people denied disability benefits who were taking the government to court and winning   Calls for further reform to fast-tracked terminal illness benefits.    The stories were picked up by UK national newspapers ranging from The Mirror and Guardian to MailOnline and The Times, and they were also used by BBC national television news, local BBC TV and radio and more than 100 regional news outlets partnered with the SDU. Debbie Abrahams MP told the Work and Pensions Committee on 7 July one ""exposé by the BBC"" led dozens more families to share experiences of their relatives' deaths, and later that month at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson confirmed the Minister of State would meet with Ms Abrahams and bereaved relatives to discuss this issue. Other examples of impactful public interest work include:    An expose into how police forces were failing to use new powers available to them to protect people from stalkers   A deep dive into the impact of the pandemic on councils' finances    An investigation into the mental health crisis sparked by Covid-19   An investigation into the ""prejudice"" faced by people with non-visible disabilities when applying for a blue badge parking permit.    The team has demonstrated a wide range of technical skills across its portfolio.  Techniques include accessing open data sources, using Freedom of Information laws, scraping data from websites or building our own databases.  What matters is finding the right data to bring important information into the public record. For example, our investigation into council finances involved building a spreadsheet containing information on the budgets set by 170 councils.  The resulting analysis, with more than 5,000 separate data points, involved months of data gathering and cleaning.  The subsequent story revealed how UK councils faced a £3bn black hole in their budgets as they emerged from the pandemic. In March, the team reported on the problems faced by 300,000 children of UK prisoners amid concerns that they had been ""forgotten"" during the pandemic.  These included delays to a video call system which was not fully rolled out until nine months after the start of the pandemic and had suffered a range of problems, and variations in when prisons allowed in-person visits after national and localised lockdown restrictions. We began by using a web-based scraper to log each time an official MoJ prison page was updated.

United States,The Wall Street Journal,Big,Participant,,The Wall Street Journal--Four investigations,"To the Judges: The Wall Street Journal exposed how federal judges broke the law, how elite universities prey upon poor and middle class borrowers, how hospitals have inequitable disparities in their  procedure prices and how TikTok, the world’s fastest growing social network, sends young users deep into rabbit holes of content that feature sex, extreme dieting and drugs.  Together these projects demonstrate an impressive breadth of data-driven reporting in 2021 that held accountable powerful companies, non-profits and public officials. Among our findings: –TikTok served minors thousands of videos pushing paid pornography, glorifying extreme weight loss, promoting sales of drug paraphernalia, and highlighting depression and self-harm. The app takes note of subtle cues to zero in on what users want to watch. We showed how over time, the videos become less mainstream, less vetted by moderators and more disturbing. Even though some TikTok creators labeled videos as for adults only, the app served them to kids anyway.  –The federal government’s Grad Plus and Parent Plus, the fastest growing sector of U.S. student loans, has created a money machine that allows families to meet otherwise unaffordable costs at elite universities. Our investigation drew on new data released by the Education Department that for the first time exposed how much graduate students and parents of students from individual programs borrowed and whether they paid it back. We showed how both the federal government and wealthy schools put financial benefit and political expediency ahead of poor and middle-class students.   –Not only are there wide disparities among what people pay for hospital procedures, but hospitals often charge the uninsured–who may be the least able to afford care–the highest prices. Moreover, our investigation found that hundreds of hospitals hid their data, defying a new law that required greater pricing transparency. They hid this information so well that only a sophisticated data analysis by the Journal’s reporters uncovered the fact that many had embedded special coding on their sites that masked the data from web searches.  –More than 130 federal judges broke U.S. law by hearing more than 950 cases in which they held a financial interest in one of the litigants, according to our analysis of stockholdings of roughly 700 federal judges. Two-thirds of the rulings by judges who owned stock in a litigant came down in favor of their or their family’s financial interest when motions were contested. These projects had immediate and powerful impact: –Either Tiktok or the creators removed more than 1,700 videos from the app after the Journal first flagged them to the company. In December, TikTok said it would retool its recommendation algorithm to stop showing users too much of the same content. The company said that it was testing ways to avoid pushing too many videos from a certain topic, such as extreme dieting, to individual users to protect their mental well-being. –One elite school that we profiled, the University of Southern California, said it would try to unwind its contract with a for-profit company that was leaving its master’s degree students with high debt loads and low salary options.  –More than 100 hospitals swiftly rectified their websites and made the pricing data findable after being called out by our reporting. –Citing the Journal’s coverage, U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts pledged to improve the federal judiciary’s ethics training and compliance. So far, 777 cases have been upended by notices telling parties they could seek to have them reheard by a new judge.  The reporting also led directly to bipartisan federal legislation to curb judicial abuses. The Journal is proud to nominate this portfolio for a Sigma Award.","Some background on the Journal’s projects: On Tiktok: The technology that powers social media is secret, valuable and powerful. To pierce that shield, the Journal created dozens of automated accounts, or bots, to understand how the app works. The result was the most detailed view ever into the way that TikTok draws in users and keeps them scrolling. The Journal’s Rob Barry and John West created the bots using dozens of cloud-based devices and eight minicomputers. The bots, which made decisions based on machine-learning techniques, watched hundreds of thousands of videos on TikTok over months. Reporters also created an internal tool for searching and tagging those collected videos. Throughout, TikTok regularly removed the Journal’s bots from the platform, challenging reporters to find creative ways to get them back online: changing the bots' IP addresses, phone numbers and email accounts, among other things to avoid detection.  On Judges: The Journal used never-before compiled data provided by the Free Law Project, a nonpartisan legal-research nonprofit, which requested financial-disclosure forms for all federal judges from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The Free Law Project also gathered disclosures from additional sources to create a searchable database, believed to be the most complete archive of judicial stockholdings. The reporters then scrutinized tens of thousands of civil cases overseen by those judges to find financial conflicts. To do this, the Journal’s Coulter Jones merged financial disclosure data with court docket data from the Free Law Project for district judges and from legal-research firm Westlaw for appellate judges. On Elite Colleges: Reporter Andrea Fuller sought the release of data on Parent Plus repayment rates for individual colleges a decade ago. The Education Department denied her request for the information because it didn't bother to calculate the figures, effectively keeping the public in the dark. Therefore, federal officials didn’t have a handle on many details regarding the $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio. That began to change in late 2019, when the Education Department first published some salary data for the graduates of individual programs. It released the largest trove yet in January 2021, including data on what graduate degree recipients earned two years out of school, what their early-career loan repayment rates looked like, and how good of a job parents of students at different colleges did at paying back their debts. Armed, finally, with this complex data set with thousands of columns, Andrea’s analysis revealed with undeniable specificity which programs left graduates with debt loads far beyond what they could pay back. On Hospital Prices: What people are charged at hospitals has been a closely guarded secret, the product of proprietary negotiations between hospitals and payers. Hospitals were required to make their prices public this year under new federal rules meant to encourage competition that could lower costs. The Journal’s Tom McGinty reviewed hospital pricing disclosures collected by Turquoise Health Co., a startup that has been gathering the data from hospital websites since the regulations went into effect. To analyze how cash prices compared with the rates that hospitals charged to commercial insurers and Medicare Advantage plans, the Journal calculated the percentile of where each negotiated rate or cash price fell within the range of prices for each service at each hospital, using the ecdf function in the statistical program R. But comparing the prices was no simple shopping trip. Hospitals published prices that were incomplete, calculated inconsistently, or filed in arcane formats. Many hospitals didn’t bother to comply at all. Nonetheless, the Journal’s analysis included 15,581 examples of the rates hospitals charged for the services, pulling back the veil of secrecy. ",English,https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-algorithm-sex-drugs-minors-11631052944,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tiktok-inundates-teens-with-eating-disorder-videos-11639754848,https://www.wsj.com/articles/131-federal-judges-broke-the-law-by-hearing-cases-where-they-had-a-financial-interest-11632834421,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hidden-interest-judges-financial-conflicts-graphic-11632834079?mod=article_relatedinline&mod=article_relatedinline,https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-journal-found-judges-violations-of-law-on-conflicts-11632833775?mod=article_relatedinline&mod=article_relatedinline,https://www.wsj.com/articles/financially-hobbled-for-life-the-elite-masters-degrees-that-dont-pay-off-11625752773?mod=searchresults_pos4&page=1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-a-graduate-degree-worth-the-debt-check-it-here-11626355788,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-often-charge-uninsured-people-the-highest-prices-new-data-show-11625584448?st=lumy822d6wafj8l&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink,https://www.wsj.com/articles/boston-hospital-prices-healthcare-insurance-cost-11639576524?st=2up8nvzln6k6lh3&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospitals-hide-pricing-data-from-search-results-11616405402?st=fy6to3wm3f5x5ba&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink,,,,,,,

Almost tohalf are dumped in landfills or dumps, which harm the environment but guarantee income of thousands of families. A survey carried out by the teams of the Réporter Record Investigação, through the crossing of data and access to reports from the Ministry of Economy, reveals the portrait of adults and children who work in the worst dumps in Brazil. Our first destination is Eunápolis, in Bahia, a city with more than 112,000 inhabitants, where the our reporters reported the illegal disposal of hospital waste, in the midst of a health crisis. ""There are syringe tubes, catheters, blood bags, all mixed with common garbage"", shows thescavenger to our reporter. In Itabuna, in the south of the state, the word hunger is part of the vocabulary and daily life of hundreds of families. Many of them were left without income as the pandemic worsened and they went to live near the city dump. Thus, they guarantee at least a little food.""It's the need. It's the only way we can have food on the table"", summarizes the collector. From Bahia to Ceará. In the city of Pacajus, with 73 thousand inhabitants, our teams found children and teenagers working at the dumping ground, one of the worst forms of work childish. In addition to exposing them to dangers and illnesses. ""I've cut myself with glass while working,"" says the 10-year-old boy. And more: the best experts and scholars on the subject talked about what to do with thescavengers after the closing of the dumps, scheduled for August 2024. After our registration and collection, the city of Eunápolis stopped disposing of the waste,especially the hospitals, to the city dump.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Shortlist,,"Data Journalism of Süddeutsche Zeitung 2021 – Coronavirus, Climate Crisis and Elections","As for every journalist, this has been a challenging year for the Data Unit at Süddeutsche Zeitung, but also an exciting one. More than maybe ever we feel that we as journalists really made a difference, as we helped our readership making sense of what’s going on in the world. Three major issues dominated the lives of people in Germany in 2021: the ongoing pandemic, the climate crisis, which was clearly felt for the first time, and the federal elections. The virus is invisible to the naked eye, as are the changing climate and the political impact of algorithms and social networks for the most part, so looking at and interpreting the numbers is the best way to figure out where we are and what might come next.   Süddeutsche Zeitung is the leading daily quality newspaper in Germany. Founded 1945 and based in Munich, it offers reporting, analysis and opinion for a national audience. Editorial staff is 400+ people, with bureaus in Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stuttgart, plus correspondents in major capitals all around the world. Its award-winning Data Team was established in 2018 to focus on data-driven reporting across all topics, with close links to the Investigations team (known for the Panama Papers, among other stories). Although it is a standalone unit of the newsroom, the team always works very closely with specialist editors from the other departments, graphic designers and developers, combining their expertise and skills with their own to achieve the best result for readers. As the team sees it, data journalism is first and foremost journalism - its goal is to tell stories, explain complex issues, expose injustice and corruption. The team is committed to constantly learning, experimenting with new tools, sources and storytelling formats, and providing the best possible experience for Süddeutsche Zeitung readers - online and in print. Exchanging ideas, sharing knowledge and learning from each other are important pillars of the philosophy. Towards their readers, they try to be as transparent as possible - publishing detailed descriptions of their methodology, source code and raw data wherever possible.   ","Coronavirus Dashboard: Keeping our readers up to date with the latest and, most importantly, accurate figures on the coronavirus pandemic is a matter of the heart for us - but also a lot of work. Our Coronavirus Dashboard, which we reworked this year, has been part of our homepage www.sueddeutsche.de since the beginning of the pandemic. Many figures also get adapted to a big, daily graphic in the print edition. Lack of data standards in Germany and frequently changing data formats have repeatedly led to difficulties in our automated pipelines.   Vaccination Bot: Several million people have viewed our dashboard, as well as our Vaccination Bot. We launched the Vaccination Bot in early 2021, at a time when there was little vaccine available. The rules were complicated as to who was first. With our interactive calculator, our readers could find out approximately when they could expect to get vaccinated.   Green, yellow, Corona: For this project we tried out a methodology that was completely new to us: sensor journalism. Using our own CO2 measuring devices, we measured how high the Corona contagion risk is at schools, kindergardens, offices and homes. And were able to show how to minimize the risk with proper ventilation.    The Climate Monitor: But there is a risk which is even more threatening than the current pandemic: the climate crisis. During the heavy floodings in Western Germany we published an elaborate storytelling about how the climate in Germany already changed. Since then we offer monthly updated analysis of the German weather and how it compares to the longterm average in our climate dashboard at sz.de/klima in detail for every single place in Germany.   The World on the Brink: In November, new emissions targets were adopted at COP26 in Glasgow. But these bare figures and often imprecise pledges are not easy to understand. In ""The World on the Brink"" we therefore described in concrete terms what it means for the world's climate if the pledges are not met, only partially met or met in full.   Federal Elections – The Analysis: Back to the present. As the world may have noticed, the year 2021 marked neither the end of the pandemic nor of climate change, but it did mark the end of Angela Merkel. Olaf Scholz was elected as the new German Chancellor. Again, we used a new technique: natural language generation (NLG). With our automatically generated texts and graphics, we were able to provide our readers with a very detailed election analysis for each constituency shortly after the election.   Politics on Facebook, Distorted world: Much of the federal election campaign was conducted on social networks. To understand their influence on the elections, we teamed up with the US nonprofit newsroom The Markup. Together, we implemented their Facebook Inspector called Citizen Browser in Germany. Via this international cooperation, we were able to show how different Facebook looked like to people with different political attitudes.    The hatred grows: In 2021, the pandemic also spurred radicalization in Germany. Protests against the COVID restrictions escalated as protesters teamed up with players of the German Far Right. They mainly use Telegram, a platform that does not moderate or sanction hate speech. To monitor this threat, we scraped 12 million messages from possibly radical groups and channels. We built our own dictionary of more than 2000 words that indicate different aspects of hate speech. Using this, we were able to describe how the usage of hate speech not only increased within a year of Telegram messaging – but also how the words the people used shifted from demagogy to conspiracy fables.   ",German,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ZPVb3rd_11ywIPGNc8KTBslnGb9K7Xj/view?usp=sharing,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/coronavirus-die-wichtigsten-daten-in-grafiken-e536967/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/archiv-impfbot-wann-waeren-sie-dran-gewesen-e927398/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/mit-co2-ampeln-gegen-corona-e452127/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/klimawandel-aktuell-der-sz-klimamonitor-e203859/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/nach-der-cop26-welt-am-abgrund-e488967/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bundestagswahl-wahlkreise-ergebnisse-1.5417929,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/politik-auf-facebook-verzerrte-welt-e883580/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/radikalisierung-in-der-corona-krise-e742536/,,,,,,,,
United States,"Pulitzer Center with Macaranga - Malaysia and SouthEast Asia Globe (republication), Bloomberg - US, Philippine Center of Investigative Journalism, The Intercept - Brasil and Mongabay (republication), Tempo - Indonesia, The New York Times, NBC, EL Pais",Big,Shortlist,,RAINFOREST INVESTIGATIONS NETWORK,"The Rainforest Investigations Network (RIN) is a collaborative investigative journalism initiative founded in 2020. Led by the Pulitzer Center, the network brings together journalists to expose the causes and powers behind the destruction of the planet's major rainforests in the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia. We believe the network is an innovative and unique effort to improve coverage of one of the most important issues today: the destruction of ecosystems and the implications for biodiversity and climate change. To achieve this goal we have a strong focus on data analysis and sharing information inside and outside  the network, facilitating transnational collaborative journalism, building capacity, and creating long-lasting impact. In its first year, RIN selected 13 journalists from 10 countries, who as Investigative Fellows dedicate themselves for a whole year to projects that mix fieldwork and building sources with data analysis. This gives them the unique opportunity to work solely on rainforest issues and complete projects they otherwise would not be able to do.  Twelve of the Fellows work from the three rainforest regions and one works in an international context because of the global importance of the issue. Their outlets include  local, regional and international newsrooms, providing unique opportunities for global data collaborations. With the support of the network, the Fellows were able to overcome challenges with obtaining governmental information in Colombia, lining up flight information with satellite imagery of air strips in the Amazon, tracking supply chains from Indonesia to the U.S., and untangling complex corporate structures financing environmental damage in the Congo Basin. Our network highlights how ecologically important regions are threatened by supply chains connected to consumers in developed countries. These chains, supported by large multinational companies and governments, are often linked to illegal exploitation of natural resources such as agricultural commodities and timber. Sometimes they are even linked to organized crime, as with gold mines in Venezuela and Brazil. It is because of this global nature that RIN relies heavily on the power of sharing data to communicate the scale of this problem. We believe that this is the only way to truly reveal the complexities in a systematic way. In addition to the Fellows, the network has an editorial team of experienced investigative and environmental journalists, including an environmental investigations editor, a data editor and an editorial coordinator. With constant support from the Pulitzer Center’s senior editors and outreach teams, the editors closely follow the investigative projects and provide not only editorial advice, but also access to databases, analysis tools and other investigative resources. . In the past year, the network organized eight training sessions on data analysis, uncovering supply chains and reading financial documents, for example, tailored to the varying levels of investigative experience among the Fellows. As the initiative reports on territorial transformations caused by environmental degradation, the use of high resolution satellite imagery has proved to be one of the most important methodologies for us. In its first year, RIN has produced over a dozen in-depth investigations that have already had impact in the countries in which they were published. The stories are based on extensive research of public documents and have been produced with multidisciplinary teams of journalists, data scientists, and environmental science researchers. In Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil, companies and governments have responded immediately to the revelations brought by the reports, proving the power of investigative journalism based on rigorous data analysis. RIN is a network that will continue to grow through the selection of new Fellows. At the same time we will continue to look for ways to contribute to training and sharing data journalism methodologies.","This portfolio includes eight investigations selected from the almost 40 stories produced by the first group of Rainforest Investigations Network Fellows, which reached almost five million readers. Story 1 - Pahang Deforestation Adds to Decades of Indigenous Land Rights Struggle in Malaysia Published by Macaranga in partnership with the Southeast Asia Globe. Fellow Yao Hua Law analyzed hundreds of environmental permit documents and found how a Malaysian logging company was infringing on the land of an Indigenous community. The reporter compared satellite images to illustrate the rapidly advancing deforestation at the site. Because of these revelations, the community took legal steps to block the project and the permit was withdrawn. Story 2 - Amazon Fast Approaching Point of No Return This report by Jessica Brice published on the cover of Bloomberg's Business Week magazine looks at the mechanisms of illegal land grabbing in the Brazilian Amazon. By consolidating public databases and scraping information from PDFs, the report shows the intricate legal gray zone that involves local politicians and the agribusiness presence in Brazil's National Congress. Story 3 - Greed for Gold Originally published in Portuguese by Hyury Potter at Intercept Brasil, it exposes irregular gold mining conducted by company Gana Gold in the state of Pará. The reporter obtained documents from Brazil's National Mining Agency and showed that the operations had no environmental licensing. He showed the destruction caused by the mining company with high-resolution satellite images obtained with the help of RIN. After publication, the company was fined. Story 4 - Irresponsible Food State This long investigative report by Indonesia’s Tempo magazine shows how economic recovery plans launched during the pandemic are generating deforestation. Through field trips with the use of digital maps and drones, the reporter showed that the development areas proposed by the government in Kalimantan have not been respected and have advanced into areas that are supposed to have protection. The story was used as an example of how Indonesia does not uphold deforestation pledges at the UN climate talks in Glasgow.  Story 5 - How Americans' Appetite for Leather in Luxury SUVs Worsens Amazon Deforestation Published by Fellow Manuela Andreoni in The New York Times, this story follows in detail the leather supply chain starting from the Brazilian Amazon rainforest to the suppliers for some of the top U.S. carmakers, which she uncovered through analyzing cattle purchase and sale document data. After publication, a local court in Brazil mentioned the story to argue for changing regulation.  Story 6 - Palawan Authorities Rezone Forest to Allow Mining A co-publication of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism and NBC, this series looks at the nickel supplied for electric vehicle battery production in the U.S. The field reporting along with analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery shows that expansion plans on the island of Palawan in the Philippines will worsen an already complicated situation for local communities. Story 7 - This Fabric is Hailed as 'Eco-friendly.' The Rainforest Tells a Different Story Led by RIn Fellow Andy Lehren, the NBC investigative team and RIN colleagues at Tempo Indonesia used digital mapping and high-resolution satellite images to reveal the connection between illegal deforestation in Indonesia and the production of clothing with viscose fabric, used by international fashion retailers.  Story 8 - The Colonial Network of Palm Oil Plantations in the Democratic Republic of Congo Fellows Gloria Pallares (EL PAIS) and Madeleine Ngeunga (InfoCongo) teamed up to show the companies behind environmental destruction in the DRC. With the help of RIN editors and financial specialists hired by RIN, they untangled a complex corporate web to find who is financing the destruction. ","English, Bahasa Malaysia, Portuguese, Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia",https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/pahang-deforestation-adds-decades-indigenous-land-rights-struggle-malaysia,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/amazon-fast-approaching-point-no-return,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/200-million-gold-extracted-amazon-mine-through-illegal-licenses,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/irresponsible-food-estate,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/how-americans-appetite-leather-luxury-suvs-worsens-amazon-deforestation,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/palawan-authorities-rezone-forest-allow-mining,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/fabric-hailed-eco-friendly-rainforest-tells-different-story,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/colonial-network-palm-oil-plantations-democratic-republic-congo,,,,,,,,,
China,Netease DataBlog,Small,Participant,,Netease DataBlog,"As one of the pioneer columns in data journalism, Netease DataBlog has constantly provided data-driven stories for China's readers in the past 10 years, committed to conveying multi-dimensional, comprehensive, and useful information. We cover stories in variable aspects, including society, education, health, economy, culture and so on. Stories closely related to the lives of Chinese people will especially be our consideration.  COVID-19, carbon emissions, rainstroms, shortage of medical resources, as well as education equality are the main concerns to most ordinary people and so to us. In the past 2021, NetEase DataBlog had published more than 100 data-driven stories in articles, videos, reports, illustration and interactive diagrams. Not merely in amounts, we also achieved brilliant communication effects, receiving dozens of positive feedback. And We are the one with the most subscribers(17 million) among China's data journalism columns. With engrossing and informative content, impressive design style, and flexible use of SNS data mining, questionnaire survey on large scale, and other technique, NetEase DataBlog has gained a high reputation in the field of data journalism in China. And we have become a regular object in academic case studies. As a small data journalism team, we hope to learn from the best data journalism projects globally by entering the Sigma Awards 2022 competition.","Over the past few decades, China has achieved great economic success. The living conditions of most Chinese people have improved. However, success and improvement in the economy have not alleviated people's anxiety. On the contrary, many people are under great pressure in life and work. DataBlog aims to tell stories of the daily issues encountered by ordinary Chinese people on all aspects, with an approch of data. Education is the most essential issue for every Chinese family. In ""The New Anxiety of Chinese parents,"" we discussed why Chinese parents are reluctant to send their children to vocational schools. Although more than 6 million junior high school graduates enroll in vocational schools each year, many parents feel that vocational schools have no promising future because of uncertainty in job prospects and unnecessary discrimination as well as neglect. In the article ""Divorce is surging among China's rural young people"", we noted that China's rural young people are experiencing a divorce tendency, which is led by women who have traditionally been weaker in their marriage relationships. We also found that the younger generation of Chinese women, who no longer regard forbearance as a virtue, are becoming less and less tolerant of disharmonious marriages. In 2021, the haze caused by COVID-19 was yet looming globally. Although China had adopted a dynamic zero-out prevention and control strategy, there were still some local epidemic cases this year. For instance, the outbreak in Nanjing, which is an eastern city in China, spread to many cities nationwide in a short period through airports. NetEase DataBlog retraced the spread of the virus by rearranging the patient's epidemiological investigation. In addition to COVID-19, China's Henan province also experienced an unusually extreme rainstorm during the same period. We lost at least 302 lives without appropriate disaster prevention. Less than a day after the rainstorm, Netease DataBlog arranged the detail of this disaster based on precipitation and other data. In 2021, we also produced a lot of popular science stories in health, especially focusing on women's perspectives. For example, in the article ""Why is it so hard to get a lifesaving vaccine for Chinese women?"" we found that the 9-valent HPV vaccine, which has been available for seven years, is still hard to access in China. In many areas, less than 5 percent of applicants received the lifeguarding vaccine. And it is the vaccine that can protect women from cervical cancer. At the same time, we also hope that Chinese women can get rid of the shame in menstrual period, using menstrual pad without any concerns.

United States,The Wall Street Journal,Big,Participant,,The Change project from the Wall Street Journal,"To the Judges, In 2021, the Wall Street Journal dispatched a team of journalists across the country to show readers how the pandemic is accelerating demographic, economic and social change far beyond the walls of the workplace. The series melded data analysis with vivid photography and insightful interviews to reveal how the contours of American society -- from where we live to how we worship to the risks facing seniors -- are being permanently altered by the battle with Covid-19.  Using FOIA requests, we obtained every residential change of address filed with the U.S. Postal Service between 2018 and 2020 to show how the pandemic accelerated moves from big cities to suburbs and rural areas. The series attracted the attention of everyone from Elon Musk, who tweeted that the decline in population growth documented by the WSJ posed “potentially the greatest risk to the future of civilization,” to readers like Rita Smith of Palm Desert, Calif., who wrote of our story on elder abuse, ""You are doing a great service for our senior population and their families.""  Our review also identified what are likely permanent turning points for the economy, with a surge in retirements, and changes in the patterns of practice for religious institutions. The number of churchgoers has steadily dropped in the U.S. over the past few decades. But Covid-19 and its lockdown restrictions accelerated that fall. In-person church attendance is roughly 30% to 50% lower than it was before the pandemic. That has left churches looking for different approaches to connect with existing members and attract new ones. The package of stories is prescient, sometimes chilling, and beautifully presented for readers. For those reasons, the Wall Street Journal is proud to nominate the series, internally dubbed “The Change Project,” and it’s authors, Janet Adamy, Paul Overberg, Yan Wu, Luis Melgar, Clare Ansberry, Amara Omeokwe, Anthony DeBarros, Arian Campo-Flores, Joseph De Avila, Elizabeth Findell and Christine Mai-Duc, for the Sigma Awards. Thank you for your consideration, Jeanne Cummings Washington Deputy Bureau Chief Jeanne.Cummings@wsj.com 202-812-7369","The Change project attracted more than 2.3 million readers and brought data-driven rigor to topics of national importance. Our biggest obstacle was getting access to the U.S. Postal Service files showing how many Americans moved during the pandemic and where they went. Thanks to our FOIA requests, we were able to obtain a full three years of data on U.S. moves so we could compare 2020 relocations to pre-pandemic trends. Our own data journalists analyzed the figures and created an interactive map that brought these new mobility patterns to life in fascinating detail.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Participant,,#wahlfilter,"Süddeutsche Zeitung is the leading daily quality newspaper in Germany. Founded 1945 and based in Munich, it offers reporting, analysis and opinion for a national audience. Editorial staff is 400+ people, with bureaus in Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stuttgart, plus correspondents in major capitals all around the world. Its award-winning Data Team was established in 2018 to focus on data-driven reporting across all topics, with close links to the Investigations team (known for the Panama Papers, among other stories). Although it is a standalone unit of the newsroom, the team always works very closely with specialist editors from the other departments, graphic designers and developers, combining their expertise and skills with their own to achieve the best result for readers. As the team sees it, data journalism is first and foremost journalism - its goal is to tell stories, explain complex issues, expose injustice and corruption. The team is committed to constantly learning, experimenting with new tools, sources and storytelling formats, and providing the best possible experience for Süddeutsche Zeitung readers - online and in print. Exchanging ideas, sharing knowledge and learning from each other are important pillars of the philosophy. Towards their readers, they try to be as transparent as possible - publishing detailed descriptions of their methodology, source code and raw data wherever possible. ","How content is positioned in social media determines how many people see it. Facebook and Instagram have long since stopped displaying their content simply according to the rule ""the latest post appears at the top”. Instead, they use their own opaque algorithms that are based on criteria such as the user's behavior and preferences. But to what extent does this influence how they perceive the world? What kind of content is shown to users, and what is not?  In the #wahlfilter project, the SZ tried to gain insight into how social media works and understand how it influences us - especially before the federal elections in Germany in september 2021. For this, SZ collaborated with the American research platform The Markup as well as Algorithmwatch to collect data from a panel of around 400 users who have been deliberately put together in a demographically diverse way, and show what content is displayed in each person's Facebook or Instagram feed. This allowed the SZ team to check, for example, how often supporters of political parties see posts from their own favorite party - including its local chapters, or how visible posts from political parties are. Since large parts of the election campaign takes place on social networks, and many people use Facebook and Co. as their main source of information, the question of the influence of their algorithms has enormous social and democratic relevance. And the analyses show: There are differences.  ",German,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WgDwz4vkCEd5ejhtzemek2lzDFYX0A52/view?usp=sharing,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/politik-auf-facebook-verzerrte-welt-e883580/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/wahlkampf-wie-der-instagram-algorithmus-wirkt-e545670/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/wahlkampf-wie-parteien-auf-instagram-kommunizieren-e335776/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/instagram-facebook-wahlkampf-politik-parteien-social-media-ingrid-brodnig-datenanalyse-algorithmus-bundestagswahl-1.5410300,,,,,,,,,,,,
United States,The New York Times,Big,Participant,,Tracking Vaccinations and a Broken Public Health System,"We are proud to submit “Tracking Vaccinations and a Broken Public Health System” for a 2022 Sigma Award for data journalism.  While the vaccine supply remained low, The New York Times tracked daily in every state the inconsistent and ever-changing rules to determine who was eligible for a vaccine, a target not undertaken by any other publication. This data collection provided a backbone for hundreds of stories. The reporting showed that a person could be eligible for the vaccine in one county, but not in the next, as well as racial and political disparities. The Times also studied how prepared the United States was for the next pandemic. And journalists showed that vaccine mandates appeared to have little impact on overall vaccination rates. The Times’s effort to collect coronavirus vaccination and public health data and translate it into stories and public service trackers has been geared toward helping readers find and navigate the ever-changing, inconsistent and often confusing rules of the vaccine rollout. And it has focused on using this data, bolstered by traditional shoe leather reporting, to show readers the inequity of the vaccine distribution system — in the United States and around the world. Even as the vaccine has become more widely available, this data has helped show how ill-equipped the public health system is to handle a future pandemic, not to mention the ongoing surges the country continues to face. The vaccination eligibility tracker attracted enormous attention from readers. As The Times added age and job categories to its tracker, states began expanding eligibility rules — faster than they originally planned — to include those categories, perhaps not to be outdone by other states. As The Times added categories, reporters from other news organizations began asking about disparities in those categories at White House and state health department press conferences. The Times’s vaccination data tracking and analysis have been cited by numerous other news organizations — including Forbes, National Public Radio, The Rachel Maddow Show, Mother Jones and The Guardian —  as well as by academic researchers, the White House, local government agencies, the Congressional Research Service and consulting groups, like McKinsey. The Times’s analysis of public health department surveys was cited in a letter from the National Association of County and City Health Officials to Attorney General Merrick Garland, requesting federal protection for local public health workers, and the investigation was cited by many other news organizations and featured on “The Daily” podcast. ","Beginning in December 2020, Times reporters conducted multiple rolling surveys of state and local governments to track basic vaccination data. Once the C.D.C. began reporting daily doses, Times journalists shifted their focus to other areas where gaps existed.  On a daily basis for months, journalists scoured government websites and contacted state and local government agencies when the rules were not clear. Quickly, it became clear that the eligibility rules were prioritizing people in unequal ways as the vaccine supply remained low. Times journalists began digging into that prioritization and how it differed from place to place.  Once all adults were made eligible for the vaccine in every state, The Times began an effort to study the people who chose not to get shots and to look closely at the public health system.  The Times built on the process it developed last year for collecting and vetting Covid-19 cases and deaths as it waded into the even murkier territory of recording vaccinations, demographics, hesitancy, eligibility rules, vaccine mandate rules and public health survey results. It created several internal databases dedicated to tracking this data. Each database had a strict methodology for entry and verification, developed by Times journalists. The Times mainly used R, Microsoft Excel and Google spreadsheets to analyze data. The stories in this series used underlying data gathered from extensive surveys of state and local health departments. For example, for “Why Public Health Faces a Crisis Across the U.S.,” Journalists sent an extensive survey to every county health department in the U.S. (about 3,000 departments) and they submitted more than 100 public records requests. The team analyzed state legislation related to the coronavirus that had been introduced in every state (about 8,000 bills, in total). The team watched more than 100 hours of video of public meetings. Danielle Ivory and Mike Baker interviewed more than 150 local health officials, lawmakers and public health experts.  The reporting showed that local health officials were actually less equipped to confront a pandemic than they were at the beginning of 2020.  For “Least Vaccinated U.S. Counties Have Something in Common: Trump Voters,” using federal health data, Times journalists analyzed vaccine hesitancy estimates for every county and state. Using R, Times journalists used a regression analysis to determine how strong the relationship was between a county’s voting record and its vaccination rate. Joining real vaccination dose data from the C.D.C. with data from the U.S. Census Bureau, journalists found that, even after accounting for a variety of factors, the political divide still remained.  It was important to create strict methodology and definitions, so that journalists would interpret information in a standardized way. This was particularly important when updating the eligibility tracker because the rules were often open to multiple interpretations. The vetting system ensured that information about vaccine doses, eligibility, demographics and other vaccination-related records were sourced properly and checked by multiple people before publication. For example, a journalist updating eligibility rules associated with a state was required to save a copy of written confirmation of the rules as a PDF and add it to an internal database of source documents and link to that PDF in the eligibility database. That journalist would also check the largest counties in that state and do a scan for small counties with differing rules — and that sourcing would be saved to the source database. That journalist would then flag the state for a fact-check from at least one additional journalist. Every state in the eligibility database was checked in this manner every weekday. ",English,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-19-vaccine-eligibility.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/09/us/covid-vaccine-eligible-preexisting-conditions.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/17/us/vaccine-hesitancy-politics.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/us/coronavirus-public-health.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/18/us/vaccine-mandate-states.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/05/us/vaccine-racial-disparities.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/10/us/covid-prison-outbreak.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/19/world/covid-vaccine-inequality.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/10/us/covid-breakthrough-infections-vaccines.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/us/covid-prisoners-vaccine.html,,,,,,,

Dataphyte is news medium based in Abuja,Nigeria. As a data journalist, I've done investigations with the aid of data. In October,2021, I did an investigation on ""How five Federal Government MDAs made payments without description."" This report made it to the Editor's pick. Also, in December 2021, I did an investigation on the Nigerian Open Treasury Portal on "" Suspicious payment by the Federal Government's Ministeries; Departments and Agencies into personal accounts."" This story made it to the Organization's top 21 stories in 2021. These stories have put the MDAs on their toes. The MDAs are now aware that the datas on the Open Treasury Portal are being investigated by journalists. ","The story revealed how Federal Government Ministeries,Department,and Agencies released 4billion into personal accounts. The Nigerian Open Treasury Portal was created for accountability and Transparency purpose. Investigation into the Open Treasury Portal revealed that the MDAs have made several suspicious transactions. The payments into personal accounts are suspicious because the payments were not made into either suppliers nor contractors' accounts,instead, they were disbursed into individuals' accounts. Before I embarked on the project, I've done several analysis such as consultation into the Nigerian Financial Procurement act .Despite having a concrete evidence, the difficulty I encountered was that: the MDAs were not ready to own up. I called several stakeholders incharge,still, they kept information to themselves. After several months of investigating, I was able to file my report.  After the report was published, members of the public charged the Federal Government to look into the MDAs activities for accountability purpose.",English,https://www.dataphyte.com/latest-reports/governance/suspicious-payments-mdas-release-n4bn-to-personal-accounts-in-3-months/,https://www.dataphyte.com/latest-reports/governance/suspicious https://www.dataphyte.com/latest-reports/in-3-months-five-federal-govt-agencies-paid-n790-million-without-description/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,NationalWorld,Small,Participant,,Aimee Stanton,"In the early stages of my journalism career there wasn’t a spreadsheet in sight - I couldn't do basic calculations, nevermind how to use a dataset to find and tell a story. In other words I never expected my career to develop into one involving formulas and charts - but I am incredibly glad it has done so. My early experience was very much centred around ‘traditional’ journalism. I studied journalism at Edinburgh Napier University and after graduating in 2012 I interned and worked freelance at numerous publications in the UK and in Germany I worked on small investigations and then on lifestyle content. I joined the central content features desk at local and regional news publisher JPIMedia in 2015. I was really keen to broaden my knowledge and expand my journalism skills so I jumped at the opportunity to go on a three month secondment to the BBC Shared Data Unit in Birmingham. From being terrified of spreadsheets to working on my own investigations, the Shared Data Unit opened my eyes to the world of data journalism and showed me the impact it can have on not only the newsroom but on society as a whole. It was here that my passion for data journalism really began. After leaving my secondment I returned to JPIMedia where I joined the newly formed data unit with Claire Wilde (Data and Investigations Editor for JPIMedia). Claire has been a huge support over the years and really encouraged my growth as a journalist. Together we produced a number of hard-hitting investigations for all local and regional JPIMedia newspapers. The last year has seen some major changes at JPIMedia - including the launch of their new UK wide site NationalWorld. I now work primarily for NationalWorld in its data unit, led by Data and Investigations Editor, Harriet Clugston, where I produce data driven investigations, data explainers and respond to daily stats published by official bodies. Harriet is a fantastic editor and colleague and is very supportive in helping me develop stories. On a separate note, journalism is often recognised as being a very male dominated profession, especially data journalism, so I am incredibly proud to work alongside two top class female data journalists.  Working at NationalWorld since its inception has also been a brilliant opportunity and our editor Nick Mitchell is extremely supportive and passionate about the use of data journalism in everyday reporting. As a result we’ve run a number of training sessions to help reporters get to grips with not just spreadsheets but data visualisation too. The analysis and visualisations are just one fraction of the role though and as a journalist I am extremely passionate about showing the human story behind the numbers. Whether it is pollution on your doorstep to asylum applications being rejected, my aim as a journalist is to tell these hidden stories and I hope the pieces attached showcase the best of my ability.","Link 1: For this investigation I used government data to analyse planning permission for renewable energy sites across the UK. The story, which ran to coincide with the COP26 conference, aimed to highlight the state of the UK’s renewable energy sector as the country steps further away from fossil fuels. I discovered that planning applications for onshore wind farms in the UK had collapsed in the last five years after subsidies were scrapped. This led campaigners to warn that the UK's 2050 net zero target would not be hit if there was not more investment. Link 2: The Insulate Britain campaign group dominated UK headlines in 2021 by blocking major motorways in England. Their aim was for the government to take action on insulating Britain's homes which inspired me to look into the energy efficiency ratings of some of the UK’s best known buildings. My focus was on Number 10 Downing Street and I revealed that the building, which is home to the Prime Minister, had a below average energy efficiency rating and failed to use any renewable energy sources.  Link 3: Sourced through publicly available data and an Environmental Information Request, this investigation looked into environmental crime across England and Scotland. This was an extremely messy data set and I spent some time clearing and analysing the data. My analysis revealed prosecutions for corporate environmental crime had plummeted. It was a complex analysis and I ended up running multiple stories based on the single dataset to show which companies had been prosecuted for polluting around the country. Link 4: Having a smart meter is thought to be one of the main consumer actions needed to reduce energy consumption and achieve net zero by 2050 but the UK’s smart meter rollout was severely hampered by coronavirus restrictions. My analysis revealed that even before the pandemic the rollout was slowing pace making a 2025 target unlikely to be hit. Link 5: In response to a Government U-turn on sewage discharges I looked into pollution at beaches across England and revealed incidents were at a record high. This included waste and oil spills. Link 6: This investigation revealed how the UK Government denied asylum to dozens of Afghans during the Taliban’s resurgence, affecting both children and the elderly. Link 7: The arts sector has been hit extremely hard by coronavirus restrictions so I was keen to explore how much support they have been receiving. My analysis found that the major cities (Edinburgh and London) have been hoovering up grants leaving culture deserts behind. Link 8: Vaccine and health misinformation has been rife throughout the pandemic so I investigated whether controversial homeopathic treatments were still being prescribed by the NHS. My analysis found GPs had prescribed homeopathic treatments to NHS patients 1,000 times during the pandemic.",English,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/cop26-huge-decline-in-renewable-wind-farm-planning-applications-government-accused-of-total-sabotage-of-sector-3432746,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/environment/downing-street-rated-e-for-energy-efficiency-and-uses-no-clean-fuels-3409295,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/environment/pollution-huge-drop-in-prosecutions-of-companies-for-environmental-crime-as-charity-warns-cuts-have-left-watchdog-toothless-3305712,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/environment/smart-meter-rollout-government-set-to-miss-key-2025-energy-target-with-21000-installations-needed-per-day-3463014,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/sewage-and-pollution-at-england-beaches-at-record-high-amid-controversy-over-mps-storm-overflows-vote-3435003,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/afghanistan-uk-government-refused-asylum-to-dozens-of-afghans-during-taliban-takeover-of-country-3473131,https://www.nationalworld.com/culture/the-areas-in-england-and-scotland-starved-of-arts-funding-as-capital-cities-hoover-up-grants-3356096,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/gps-prescribed-controversial-homeopathic-treatments-to-nhs-patients-1000-times-during-covid-pandemic-3397262,,,,,,,,,
Jordan,GRLبنت,Small,Participant,,GRLبنت,"GRLبنت is a local initiative designed to share stories highlighting culture & art, travel, personal narratives, & social justice issues in the MENA region. We are excited to be considered for this award so that our work is recognized by an international organization celebrating data journalists around the world. We find our work to be impactful to local communities and to international audiences through digital platforms that are able to spread news and information on a wide scale. We believe that the past few years have been crucial in shaping the opinions of the MENA region after the Arab Spring in 2011, especially youth, which constitute 60% of the MENA population. Many people living in the region no longer want to accept governmental actions limiting their personal freedoms, including their freedom of speech. At the same time, Western audiences have been fed misleading information about the Middle East, especially following the 9/11 attacks leading to many misconceptions. Since March 2020, GRLبنت has aimed to amplify the voices of individuals, particularly women & LGBTQ+ members, as they share their cultures & prominent challenges they face in their societies. Through storytelling, we are able to share individual experiences from the region that give a contrasting view to what is presented by state owned media resources. Meanwhile, GRLبنت also showcases the beauty of Middle Eastern countries by sharing travel destinations, cultural practices, & success stories to shift misconceptions. Lara Bellone d’Altavilla and Sam Sykes are the original co-founders of GRLبنت. They met upon arriving in Amman in September 2019 and instantly connected over their shared passion for cross-cultural experiences, travel, humanitarian work, and a love for the region. GRLبنت, was created to shift the preconceived notions that many people have about the MENA region, which is often perpetuated by Western media, and to give global audiences a greater understanding of the people living in the region. يلا نتعرف GRLبنت was launched in March 2020, just before the Jordanian government implemented one of the strictest international lockdowns. GRLبنت developed during a time of uncertainty and peace in a small apartment in Jabal Al Weibdeh. Since then, our team has grown and our mission has shifted. Initially, GRLبنت was meant to only focus on travel and culture in the Middle East, but we realized the importance of sharing locals’ stories, interviews, and experiences especially during COVID-19. Our focus changed due to the Jordanian people that we befriended while living in Amman, who were open to sharing their stories with us. Now, we have broadened our focus to other countries in the MENA region, making new friends along the way. Our team has expanded to include Ahmad Taha (Translator), Reem Metwally (Content Developer), Raed Meyhar (Web Developer). Our main activities focus on publishing content on our social media pages regarding community, gender, & cultural topics. We have established our social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, TikTok) along with maintaining our website.  Our activities have included interview series highlighting issues not covered by local media, such as honor killings & sexual harassment, due to social stigmas & media controlled by national governmants. We aim to continue raising local & international awareness about specific issues, such as violence against women & LGBTQ+ rights.","Our activities fall under our 1001 Stories project, which is a series of interviews educating people around the globe about the experiences of MENA locals. Through this series, individuals share their personal stories & perspectives on the social issues they face on a daily basis.  1001 Stories includes the following activities:   Solo Stories- We passionately share marginalized stories through interviews & storytelling, aiming to amplify diverse perspectives leading to greater cross-cultural understanding & societal change. Our interviews range from mothers, artists, to activists including women's rights activist, Rana Husseini.   COVID-Stories- Set of interviews highlighting the experiences of individuals during COVID. Some of the interviews focus on the different aspects of Ramadan & others focus on female healthcare workers in MENA. We developed this series to emphasize the importance of unity & human connectivity as we continue to live in an age of COVID-19.   Harassment is a Crime- Highlights victims of sexual harassment & assault in Jordan. We interviewed notable female figures in multiple Jordanian sectors about their experiences with sexual harassment in their respective fields. These courageous women, including actress Rania Kurdi and Dr. Manal Tahtamouni, spread awareness about this topic specific to Jordan.   مشروع IMPACT (Project Impact)- Focuses on organizations that are working towards the enhancement of groups within their local communities. We interview & describe the work that impactful individuals & organizations are performing, from social peacebuilding to community art projects.    Salam of Mind (Peace of Mind)- Focuses on breaking social stigmas & fears that circulate around mental health in the Middle East, but exist globally. By sharing the stories of psychological professionals & individuals that sought treatment, we hope to create a safe space for everyone to learn & share about their struggles so that we can end the shame of seeking therapy services. Apart from 1001 Stories, GRLبنت's editor, Lara Bellone's articless have been published by various publications including MyKali, The New Humanitarian, and The American University of Cairo. Her articles focus on social issues of women and girls in the MENA region and directly connect with GRLبنت's work.

Truly incredible work.",LA NACION DATA,"In October 2010, after an ONA pre conference workshop “Data Journalism for Beginners”, we launched LA NACION DATA as a newsroom strategy. We dreamt big, started small, and never stopped. Our beginnings were really challenging. Argentina was a country without FOIA law and no open data policies. We started gathering allies from within the company but also making bonds with the incipient Hacks/Hackers, open data, open government and data science initiatives. To accelerate change we hosted 4 Datafest public events in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 and strengthened  learnings on opening, analyzing and visualizing data of public interest generated by different stakeholders (government, multilateral organizations, academia, media, NGos, etc). Collaboration is in our DNA. We started in 2012 for our news application on statement of assets working with transparency NGOs until the launch of our Environment Legislator Monitor in 2021. We also partner with other  newsrooms in national (Chequeado), latinamerican (Red Palta) and international (ICIJ, Journalism AI collab) areas. We went massive with crowdsourcing developing our open source, online and collaborative platform Vozdata with the support of Knight Mozilla OpenNews and Civicus. Since 2014, we have used it to digitize and make databases from scratch with 10.000 PDFs of Senate expenses, 40.000 phone interceptions’ audios and 16.000 Elections documents PDFs.  This year we used the platform to audit a computer vision algorithm preselected 30.000 PDFs documents with the help of 300 volunteers. Our scope includes data driven investigations, data as a service and “data-teinment”.  We are a team of 12  journalists,  data scientists, developers and designers. We  usually work in  collaboration with the Graphics department for big projects. Our main inspiration through the last 11 years came from  Propublica, The Guardian UK, Los Angeles Times, NYTimes, WaPo, Civio (Spain), The Economist, Reuters, Ojo Publico, Texty.  We usually got ideas from conferences like NICAR, ONA, GEN Summit, Abrelatam, Hacks/Hackers Argentina, WIDS and data journalism books. Mentors: Knight Mozilla OpenNews, EJC, JSK at Stanford University, Prof. Rosental Alves and lately from, PolisLSE Journalism AI Collab.","2021 Highlights [Climate & Biodiversity Crisis]: Our herculean effort to visualize impossible unstructured data from Congress bills projects related to climate and biodiversity crisis. The Legislative Environmental Monitor is based on a huge database made from scratch and updated periodically from unstructured text. This tool is helpful to understand the law enactment process, monitor the advance of bills in an opaque context and provide a public service for the audience to demand specific measures against the climate & biodiversity crisis. This application was made by LA NACION Data together with four NGOs ‒one of them, a specialist in legislative matters‒ and the other three are local references in environmental topics.  [AI + Crowdsourcing] Our first Computer Vision project for monitoring Elections documentation in a country where votes are counted manually and there are multiple paper options as political parties participate in primaries or general elections, (it could go to + 15 different options to count in some districts). The purpose of the project was to monitor telegrams with computer vision and then validate data provided by the algorithm using crowdsourcing.  [AI + Text]: Our first NLP and machine learning project analyzing 600 hundred lyrics from trap music. Trap is one of the most popular music genres among young people in Argentina. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to analyze their lyrics, demystify the concepts around the genre and understand what these artists, who bring about such a furor among the new generations, are talking about.  [Legislative Elections pack]. Electoral coverage presents the challenge of innovating on an event that takes place in the country every two years. At LA NACION we developed more than ten pieces with great visual and interactive power to provide a public service and guarantee a differential consumption experience for the newspaper's audience. At the same time, we guarantee the detailed analysis of the large volume of data (more than 24.4 million votes distributed in 379 departments, 135 districts and 15 municipalities) and its comparison with previous elections, whose data are stored in a large historical database. [Corruption in Vaccination against Covid]: The vaccination campaign against COVID in Argentina had irregularities since its inception. Less than two months after it began, a corruption scandal known as the ""VIP vaccination center"" came to light: government officials, family members and those closest to the government had received doses before the prioritized groups. We decided to follow the campaign and the vaccination system from two different sides. On the one hand, control the number of doses received, distributed and applied. On the other hand, monitor the implementation of public policies by combining public data and many requests for access to public information as main sources. [Real Economy Monitor (MER)]: Argentina is within the Top 5 countries in the world regarding inflation. Our domestic and hyperregulated economy lives with 7 different types of US dollars conversion rate to Argentina’s pesos. MER is an invaluable tool for our readers to follow for free more than 80 indicators. Data as a service maintained by LN Data team.

Russia,Important Stories,Small,Winner,"Alesya Marokhovskaya and her colleagues at Important Stories’ data department use advanced techniques and creative data strategies to turn numbers into incredibly important stories for the Russian public. They are selfless journalists who have inspired others, shared code, and helped with data processing for numerous local media outlets in the country. The outstanding and world-class data works authored by Alesya and her team at istories are developed by dedicated investigative journalists who work every day with a huge target on their back. Since selecting istories and Alesya as winners of the Sigma awards, the Kremlin has designated Important Stories as an “undesirable organization”, a categorization that means istories journalists can be sentenced to jail if they carry on with their journalism. The people sharing their data investigations can be fined or sentenced to jail, too. The youngest data department in Russian media has known pressure before, as it was designated last summer a “foreign agent” in Russia, but they kept their focus and went on in exposing abuses in the country’s judiciary, politics, problems in its housing allocation system as well as serious mismanagement and fraud in the healthcare and education sectors.",Important Stories (IStories),"Important Stories is a small (20 people) young Russian media that was founded by investigative journalists and data journalists. Data journalism is one of the most important areas for Important Stories. (you can switch the language of the site to English, we specially translate some of our important articles into English)  We have the youngest data department in Russia — only one year old, but it contains the most experienced russian journalists who have worked and collaborated with major independent Russian media (Novaya Gazeta, Medusa, RBC), participated in major international projects (Pandora Papers, Troika Landromat, FinCEN files, OpenLux  and much more). All of us are young data-journalists (from 24 to 28 years old) with 2-5 years of experience in data journalism.  The peculiarity of our materials is that we are always looking for human stories, we see in the data not just numbers, but a person. We choose the most important and dangerous topics for research, which are practically not taken up by other Russian media. For example, we investigate the falsification of criminal cases by the police, environmental problems, health problems, fraud in State Duma elections and much more.  Also at each meeting we discuss which stories from around the world inspire us to do something similar for our country.  In addition, each of us knows at least one programming language to solve interesting technical problems in order to extract and analyze data even where it seems that it is impossible. We are always happy to share our skills with others, so we often make training videos ""How we did it"" based on our materials (you can check our Workshops). We are open to sharing data and code. That is, we not only try to make high-quality data materials, but also share our knowledge.   Our data team: Alesya Marokhovskaya (editor and data-journalist) Sonya Savina (data-journalist) Polina Uzhvak (data-journalist) Irina Dolinina (data-journalist) Julia Alykova (data-journalist) Katya Bonch-Osmolovskaya (data-journalist) As the editor of our Data Department, I believe that not only the entire department can be awarded, but each of the authors can be separately marked as a Young Talent.  Besides, journalism in Russia is going through dark times. For our investigations and research, the Russian government has labeled IStories as a foreign agent, so we are working under the heaviest pressure. But we don't want to stop and plan to continue making many important data stories.","This is a story about how the police use the same fake witnesses in cases for drug crimes. IStories have downloaded 56,860 documents from the website of the Moscow City Court. Next step was challenging: we needed to extract names from the text. So we used Python for this task. Then, again, with the help of programming, we found names that are repeated in several cases. Then we read all the documents ourselves and collected evidence. We managed to find 142 such witnesses. 2. Using the scrollytelling technique IStories shows on charts and laws of mathematics why and how the results of the Duma elections in September 2021 could have been falsified and what role electronic voting played in those falsifications. 3. According to the International Labor Organization, there are between 500 and 1000 non-fatal accidents at production facilities and enterprises for one accident resulted in the death. In Russia there are only 22 non-fatal accidents per death. This is an indicator of incomplete data. 4. Russian readers don't like to read about the climate, but we have found a convenient way to tell about it simply, clearly and on data. So for this story we used the scrollytelling technique. And it worked. It turned out to be one of the most widely read stories for IStories about ecology. 5. In this data story we discovered that 100 000 schoolchildren who are due to a school bus, are not provided with it. Not all families in Russian regions have a car, so kids have to walk to school along a highway, through forest, dangerous railroad crossing, off-road or snowdrifts. To find populated places situated far from schools we made a script in Python which matches a place with the closest school and shows the distance between them. 6. In autumn 2021, the Russian media began to write a lot about the fact that migrants commit many crimes in Russia. The Ministry of Internal Affairs said that this is deliberately done by media recognized as «foreign agents». Therefore, using programming, neural networks and open data, we checked which media actually incite hatred — it turned out that these are pro-state media. And we have refuted the widespread myths that migrants are dangerous criminals. 7. We examined all available government data on air pollution, environmental standards, federal programs and ecoactivists’ works. We found out  that  standards were loosened, the state monitoring of atmospheric pollution covers only a fifth of all Russian cities and does not track all emissions. The results of such measurement cannot be reliable. 8. We have proved that 20 million Russians may not be able to wait for an ambulance to arrive. We calculated the travel time from each settlement to the nearest medical institution. To build routes, we collected the coordinates of settlements and the nearest medical facilities. Then we use Python for each locality searches for the nearest medical facility and calculates the distance to it and the time on the road. 9. We analyzed data on queues for apartments in Russian regions and found that 54% of all Russian families have been waiting in queue for housing for ten or more years. We investigated how it can affect ""children of the GULAG"" and found that they could never wait to return from exile because of the queues. 10. Every year it loses 150-200 historical heritage objects. As a result over the past 10 years 2.5 thousand national attractions were lost. We analyzed the registers of historical heritage objects and found out that the regional authorities deprive architectural monuments of their protected status.","English, Russian",https://istories.media/en/investigations/2021/02/18/im-a-witness-who-helps-the-police-to-fabricate-drug-related-cases/,https://istories.media/en/investigations/2021/03/31/expendables-of-the-quota-system/,https://istories.media/en/investigations/2021/06/10/im-so-tired-of-burying-my-friends/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/10/19/warm-arctic-hot-siberia/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/05/14/schools-accessibility/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/11/23/how-propagandists-incite-hatred-towards-migrants-and-the-ministry-of-internal-affairs-accuses-foreign-agents-of-doing-so/,https://istories.media/investigations/2021/08/05/dad-help-me-im-suffocating-why-the-russian-environmental-monitoring-system-does-not-work/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/07/26/they-have-been-re-optimized-to-the-point-that-soon-no-one-will-be-able-to-get-sick-at-all/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/01/19/to-stand-in-a-queue-for-thirty-years-we-will-stay-alive-in-despite/,https://istories.media/en/reportages/2021/11/29/historical-heritage-loss/,,,,,,,
Netherlands,RTL Nieuws,Big,Participant,,Wouter van Dijke (Young Talent prize),"I am a data journalist, teacher and trainer from The Netherlands, on a mission to spread enthusiasm for telling stories with data. Despite my young age, I am making my mark on data journalism in my country, through my own work and by empowering others to learn data journalism skills. I don’t have a typical journalism background: I studied biology at university. But even then, I knew I wanted to be a journalist. I volunteered at a magazine for LGBTQ youth, where I eventually became editor-in-chief. After finishing my degree, I decided to follow a postgraduate course in International Journalism at City University in London. There, I noticed that having a different background from other journalists was not a disadvantage but a perk: having studied in a scientific field, I knew about statistics, doing research and working data, for instance using R - skills that are extremely useful for telling news stories as well! For the past five years, I have worked as a journalist, specializing in telling stories with data. I currently work at RTL Nieuws, a national television news programme, where I write online news articles. The target audience for RTL Nieuws is very broad. This is a challenge, especially for a data journalist, because many people are not immediately interested in data or numbers. I learned that I always need to find ways to make the data relevant, interesting and useful to my readers, because everyone is interested in stories that affect them on a personal level. I do this by creating visualisations that are easy to understand, by explaining complex stories clearly, and by creating interactive tools that enable readers to find the information that is most important to them. Back in 2020, I was the first in my country to create a dashboard showing daily coronavirus statistics, even before this data was easily available from official sources. I’m always looking to innovate and create new ways to explore data and tell the stories within. For example, I helped create an editorial ‘robot’ which can generate local news articles from large datasets. This year, we used it to create hundreds of local stories about the parliamentary elections results, available within minutes of the results being announced. I also like to experiment with new ways of storytelling. For a story about poverty, and the hard choices people with a low income need to make in the festive December month, I created a news game, where readers could see the dilemmas and gain an insight into the experiences of these people. Since the summer of 2020, I also work at the School of Journalism at the Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, where I teach several courses about data journalism, as well as fact checking and social media. Through my teaching, I try to inspire the next generation of journalists to better comprehend data, and make data journalism a tool that every journalist can use. I want to dispel the myth that ‘journalists simply aren’t good with numbers’. I believe that in the modern world, every journalist should have basic knowledge of working with data, and be able to use data to tell stories. It’s not always an easy mission, and of course not everyone will learn to love data. But there are great moments of seeing students or colleagues surprised by their own skills, or enthusiastically inspired by the many questions and stories that arise when looking at an interesting data set. In those moments, my mission is (at least a little bit) accomplished","Link 1: Covering national elections on a local level using real time automatically generated articles (translated pdf file) We used our editorial 'robot' ADAM (Automatic Data Article Machine), that I have helped develop back in 2019, to cover the national parliamentary elections in real time, on a local level. We dynamically generated news stories about the election results for all 355 municipalities in the Netherlands. Every time the results for a municipality were announced, an article was published within minutes. For this project I helped write the article templates, handled the real time data processing flow and created all graphs and charts Link 2: Example of an article generated for the project mentioned above (translated pdf file) Each article was unique and included charts and graphs. In every story, local results were analysed and compared to previous elections and national averages.  Link 3: Showing the effects of covid vaccines through one simple graph (untranslated to preserve interactivity) This story is proof of the power a simple data visualisation can have. In one glance, it's easy to see the profound effect covid vaccinations have in preventing hospital and intensive care admissions. I was the first to create a graph like this using the actual data from The Netherlands, and the image was seen by millions on our website and on social media. Link 4: Telling the story of poverty through a news game (untranslated to preserve interactivity) Families that are struggling to get by face excruciating dilemmas each month. But in December, because of the holidays, these hard choices are extra painful. How do you choose between making necessary repairs, saving money or buying christmas gifts for your children?  Sadly, this is reality for hundreds of thousands of families. To get across their lived experience to our readers, I created a news game, where readers were presented with some of these hard choices, and had to find out whether they were able to make ends meet. Link 5: How much will your energy bill increase? (Interactive tool, untranslated to preserve interactivity) In July, power companies were allowed to raise their prices, and many people without fixed contracts would face steep increases. Using power consumption data for different types of families and different living situations, I created an interactive tool where readers could estimate how much higher their energy bill would be. Link 6: Dutch covid situation compared to other countries in Europe (untranslated to preserve interactivity) I compared the available coronavirus data from the European Centres of Disease Control for 350 regions in the European Union, to find out how The Netherlands compares to our neighbouring countries. I told the story through a number of clear visualisations, including an animated map and graphs. Link 7: Can you recognize the birds in your backyard? (Quiz, untranslated to preserve interactivity) Data stories and interactives don't always have to be complex or serious: using a quiz can be a great way to make a story more relevant and interesting for readers. In this case, I wrote a story about common birds and the lack of species knowledge many people have. The story contains a quiz about some of the most common birds readers might see in their backyards. ",Dutch,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/sites/default/files/content/documents/2022/01/09/ADAM%20for%20elections%20-%20translated%20-%20Sigma%20Awards%202022.pdf,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/sites/default/files/content/documents/2022/01/14/Sample%20generated%20article%20-%20ADAM%20-%20Sigma%20Awards%202022_0.pdf,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5268635/cijfers-zoveel-ongevaccineerden-met-corona-ziekenhuis,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5271289/armoede-december-inflatie-game-interactief-ervaar-zelf,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5239499/stroom-duurder-geworden-hoeveel-energie-gas-water-licht-elektra,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/buitenland/artikel/5215637/nederland-corona-europa-vergeleken-vaccinaties-besmettingen,https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/5211441/tuinvogeltelling-vogels-tuin-balkon-spotten-quiz-mus-koolmees,,,,,,,,,,
India,Article-14,Small,Participant,,Snigdhendu Bhattacharya,"I am a 36-year-old journalist based in the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, writing on politics, policies, human rights, conflict, environment, religion and culture – with extensive use of data and history – since 2005. I have two books of socio-political non-fiction published from HarperCollins India – Mission Bengal: A Saffron Experiment (2020) that documented the functioning, ideological and structural spread of rightwing Hindu organizations, and Lalgarh and the Legend of Kishanji: Tales from India's Maoist Movement (2016) that dealt with Left-wing insurgency. Both of these books have been described as ‘must-read' in reviews that appeared in India's major media outlets. After working with the Hindustan Times in different capacities from June 2007 to June 2020, lastly as a special correspondent, I decided to become a full-time freelancer to pursue journalism with greater freedom, scope and flexibility. Since July 2020, I have been trying to bring out the fullest potential of my contribution to the society through journalism, having a special focus on combining investigative, field reporting with work on data. As a freelancer, my reports have been published in Mongabay India, Nikkei Asia, The Wire, Huffpost India, Caravan magazine, Outlook magazine, The Times of India, Deccan Herald, IndiaSpend, Newslaundry, Article-14, Live History India, News-18, The Print, Firstpost and News 9, among others. I am also serving as a ‘mentor' in the IDP-Newslaundry Data Journalism Fellowship for Bengali language. Despite the financial uncertainty involved in a freelancer's life, this period of working independently allowed me to pursue some stories that took from weeks to months. At the end, many of these in-depth, narrative pieces, investigations and data-oriented reporting were able to trigger debates and discussions, bringing new information to the fore. Going by the standard freelancer payment structure in the Indian media, the remuneration almost never compensates for such time-consuming investigations and data analysis. It's the passion for doing some meaningful work that keeps me going, like many other freelancers around the world. The series of two reports that I am submitting here converged analysis of a large amount of data on human trafficking with field reporting. It took several months. But the satisfactory thing is: my report resulted in the government acknowledging the data discrepancy on record by way of a ‘disclaimer'. I have been a believer in the sanctity of objectivity as against being neutral. A spade must be called a spade, but first it needs to be ascertained if it, indeed, is a spade. The journalist has to keep asking and searching for till she/he gets the clear picture, all loopholes blocked. No amount of pressure from political, economic, religious and social powers should deter the journalist from leaving her/his task unfinished/ compromised. Speaking of the state of affairs in the Indian media, India's rank in the World Press Freedom Index has remained between 136 and 142 out of 180 countries between 2013 and 2020 – it stood at 80 among 139 countries in 2002. According to Reporters Without Borders that is behind this rating, ""India is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists trying to do their job properly."" That being said, There are so many journalists who can be named for having produced exemplary work. But I draw my strength from the thoughts of the great cultural polymath Rabindranath Tagore, who inspired the mankind for a world ‘where the mind is without fear and the head is held high, where knowledge is free… that heaven of freedom.' Will not getting the award discourage me from doing what I think I am supposed to do? No. But getting it would allow me to aim","This is a series of two long-form, data-driven reports exposing how India’s annual data on human trafficking was getting underreported by three times since 2017 and how this data gap impacted the fight against modern forms of slavery. They appeared in Article-14, one of India’s prominent independent media organizations. It was at the end of 2020 that activists working towards the prevention of human trafficking told me how they felt India’s annual data on human trafficking did not reflect the ground reality. This prompted me to study the country’s voluminous annual publication on crime data, titled Crime in India and published by the National Crime Records Bureau, from its 2013 edition to the edition for 2019. This took more than three months, as the volumes run into hundreds of pages, sometimes exceeding a thousand. Till then, every media outlet and even Indian parliamentarians and ministers were quoting figures from the summary section for human trafficking in the Crime in India publication to refer to the scale of the problem. I decided to verify the figures given in the summary. Therefore, I started checking for the details of every penal provision that deals with human trafficking – six sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the special law of Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act, or the ITPA. A thorough study revealed that the Crime in India publication made a change in its reporting format in 2016: it stopped adding the number of cases filed under ITPA in the summary. ITPA is among the most frequently used penal provisions, further studies revealed. There were more discrepancies: even the total number of cases filed under the six IPC sections did not add up to the total given in the summary. The data was in absolute mess. Following a fresh look at the entire data set and extensive conversation with people engaged in activities to prevent trafficking, I deduced that the mismatch was because the publication, from 2016, was giving in its summary for human trafficking data only the number of cases registered with anti-human trafficking units, a special policing unit that neither had presence all over the country nor received all the complaints in places where they existed. When I informed the National Crime Records Bureau of this discrepancy and sought their response, the NCRB director initially said they would “examine and revert” but the reply never came, despite repeated reminders from me. My report, titled ‘The Govt Assumes 3 Times Fewer Indians Are Trafficked Than They Actually Are’, was published in August 2020. In September 2021, the publication of the Crime in India’s 2020 edition validated the points I raised when they added a disclaimer to the data set in the summary section – the data reflects only the cases lodged with the anti-human trafficking units. This resulted in my second report, published in September 2021, titled ‘How Latest Crime Data Set Back The Fight Against Modern Indian Slavery’. It explained the data discrepancy, its implications and consequences, with greater detail. It also gave a clear picture of what India’s human trafficking data actually looks like. This is the only set of reports that the global community has in getting a clear picture of the scale of human trafficking in India.",English,https://www.article-14.com/post/the-govt-assumes-3-times-fewer-indians-are-trafficked-than-they-actually-are-6110b1b921501,https://article-14.com/post/untitled-614bea15ce778,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
India,ThePrint,Big,Participant,,"Neelam Pandey, ThePrint","I am a Delhi based reporter with over 15 years of experience, currently working with a digital platform, ThePrint in New Delhi. As the second wave of Covid-19 hit India, ThePrint decided to take stock of the healthcare situation in the southern parts of India while focusing on data. I was willing to undertake the task (with all safety measures in place) despite the fact that I had not received my double dose of vaccination as I wanted to bring out the real picture. ThePrint is also one of the very few organisations that sent their reporters across the country to report on the pandemic.  Also, this is not the first time that I had ventured out to cover human interest stories amidst the pandemic. My organisation — ThePrint — had sent me on a special 16-day assignment to report from the ground how Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are dealing with the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 too. I travelled over 3000 kms from Delhi to Uttar Pradesh and covered Bihar too. During this period not only was travelling next to impossible the fact that everything was shut meant requesting people to allow us to use their washrooms! In my 15 years of journalism I have covered a variety of topics from homelessness, civic journalism, women safety, child labour, politics, education, crime and the list goes on.  Before joining ThPrint, I worked as a Senior Assistant Editor with Hindustan Times for ten years. In my 15 years in journalism, I have also covered politics, and policy apart from writing on various other social issues concentrating on women and children.  I was recently awarded a PhD from Jamia Millia Islamia on Feminist and Dalit Publishing Houses. I was also a part of “The Economist” newsroom as a 2015 Chevening Fellow, London.  I completed my Masters and Bachelors in English (Hons) from Jamia Millia Islamia and Delhi University post which I pursued MPhil in English Literature. I was awarded the Ramnath Goenka’s “The Prakash Kardaley memorial award for civic journalism” (awarded to team HT) for coverage of the Commonwealth Games in 2010 and was also the recipient of Shreshtha Award for reporting on homeless in Delhi from the “Indo Global Social Service Society, a non-profit organization. There were many challenges that I faced while covering these stories. At the same time, these stories were done at a time most mainstream media were reluctant in travelling to far-flung areas.  As a lockdown had been imposed in the state, right from finding hotels and cabs was a difficult task. As a journalist I wanted to focus on the rural areas armed with data, something which was being ignored by the mainstream that focussed largely on the cities. Wearing double masks and shields, it was quite a task to travel in the interiors and get information as many restrictions on travel were imposed by the government too. From visiting villages, crematoriums, hospitals, primary healthcare centres, the project involved focusing on numbers so that we could let data speak for itself. The hardest part of the project was to witness death, devastation and grimness all around and still focus on collecting data claad in a PPE kit. Equally difficult was to visit the hospitals at a time where the risk of contracting Covid-19 was the highest.  I strongly believe that the stories that I have covered helped in shifting the focus on the rural areas.     ","This project was carried out at a time when India was battling the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic which was much more devastating than the first wave. ThePrint decided to take stock of the healthcare situation in the southern parts of India while focusing on data. The country was facing an immense shortage of hospital beds, medicines and even oxygen. This was a time when non-essential traveling had almost come to a halt.    While vaccination had started, journalists were not included under the essential workers and hence I was not vaccinated when I was asked to undertake this project. As I chalked out the plan to cover the rural areas in Karnataka which was witnessing a huge spike in cases I managed to get the first dose. A number of doctors had then advised not to travel immediately after getting the first dose of the vaccine. But I did. As a lockdown had been imposed in the state, right from finding hotels and cabs was a difficult task. As a journalist I wanted to focus on the rural areas armed with data, something which was being ignored by the mainstream that focussed largely on the cities. Wearing double masks and shields, it was quite a task to travel in the interiors and get information as many restrictions on travel were imposed by the government too.

The hardest part of the project was to witness death, devastation and grimness all around and still focus on collecting data claad in a PPE kit. Equally difficult was to visit the hospitals at a time where the risk of contracting Covid-19 was the highest.    The Karnataka government’s handling of the Covid-19 spread at Hallegere village in Mandya was an unflattering microcosm of its efforts in tackling the pandemic in rural areas where cases were surging. The government had simply reduced testing. The health centre we visited used to conduct 200-300 tests every week in April but was reduced to 50-60 in a week in May.    All the stories that have been submitted from Karanatka were reported by me with photographs from Praveen Jain.    The Karnataka government’s handling of the Covid-19 spread at Hallegere village in Mandya was an unflattering microcosm of its efforts in tackling the pandemic in rural areas where cases were surging.

When ThePrint visited the hospital on 14 May, there were around 54 patients admitted in three of the several Covid-19 wards. But each patient had an attendant right beside them, in clear violation of all Covid-19 treatment protocols. The fact that this was the state of affairs of hospitals in the south too, was quite alarming.     We had to make rounds of the healthcare centres and hospitals to collect data manually. However, to ensure the data was analysed properly it used to be fed into our excel sheets. At the same time, mobile phones were used to shoot videos to show the current situation. This was important as it also served as evidence of our ground work in case of any dispute.      ","English, Hindi",https://theprint.in/health/why-karnatakas-hassan-home-of-gowdas-is-among-indias-top-covid-hit-rural-districts/660613/,https://theprint.in/health/karnataka-hospital-is-so-short-of-staff-covid-patient-relatives-are-forced-to-stay-with-them/661492/,https://theprint.in/health/the-young-are-driving-mandyas-2nd-covid-wave-45-of-its-cases-are-in-21-40-age-group/665980/,https://theprint.in/health/in-this-rural-karnataka-belt-covid-cases-are-rising-but-tests-have-dipped-to-just-10-a-day/663687/,https://theprint.in/india/bengaluru-residents-go-80-km-for-covid-shot-as-medical-hub-just-doesnt-have-enough-vaccines/656996/,https://theprint.in/health/funeral-service-worker-in-bengaluru-buried-covid-bodies-but-died-waiting-for-o2-bed-himself/657708/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj7j6da1b-8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q67rAz2_970,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qm9W4s0t6jE,,,,,,,,
Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Shortlist,,Stephanie Adeline,"I am a journalist for The Straits Times digital graphics team. Since I joined the team in 2020, I have dedicated my time to understanding large, complicated datasets and presenting them through simple, comprehenible charts, maps and other creative visualisations.  My goal as a journalist is to detangle complex issues and explain them in a way that is accessible to our readers. In 2021, one of my focuses was visualising the urgency of climate action.  My biggest project of the year, “Saving Singapore’s Shores,” was a data story on sea-level rise in Singapore. We visualised different sea-level rise scenarios using 3D simulations and Singapore’s iconic landmark, the Merlion, as a scale. It was the fruit of several months of sifting through climate reports, discussions with researchers and finally building the 3D models and going through numerous revisions to ensure accuracy.  Throughout the year, I have successfully led the team in many quick-turnaround projects, despite working remotely and being based in a different country than most of the team. At the start of the year, I was able to set up Covid-19 vaccine trackers quickly. When Singapore’s decennial census report came out, I led the team in producing a data report in just two days. When the IPCC report was released, we also published our data story within a week of the report's release date.  Over the past year, I have acquired a number of new skills in my toolbelt. From honing my design skills, learning new tools for data analysis, debugging errors much faster, to improving my writing skills, I have become a more well-rounded data journalist. I have also participated and spoken at several data journalism events and workshops this year.  I have also worked with several interns on our team, welcoming them and guiding them through, for many of them, their first experience in data journalism. It is also through interacting with them that I picked up new skills such as video editing, animating illustrations and creating 3D graphics.  One of the most biggest lessons I learned this year is the importance of collaboration. In order to produce compelling, visual data stories, a data journalist cannot work in silo. They need the help of beat reporters who are well-versed in their topic and the expertise of researchers in academia who dedicate their lives to the area. And of course, to get a project off the ground, journalists need the help of an exceptional team of designers, developers and editors. I look forward to working on more collaborative, innovative data and visual stories in 2022.","Saving Singapore's Shores: An interactive 3D exploration of sea level rise as a  result of climate change, it's impacts on Singapore and possible solutions.

United States,The Marshall Project,Big,Shortlist,,Weihua Li,"To the Judges:  This part of your application must explain why you think you should be considered for this award. Tell us about your career path, number of years in the field, inspiration, ideas and mentors. If you are submitting the portfolio of an organization, tell us the same information about the organization.  Weihua Li’s data reporting investigates the criminal justice system, challenges mainstream myths about crime and punishment, and empowers community members to use data to hold the powerful accountable. Li’s journalism journey started when her college professor sent their class to cover the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the brothers responsible for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. For someone born and raised in China, the idea that she could just set foot in a federal courtroom and report on one of the most high profile cases was unimaginable – and addictive. Li graduated from Boston University with degrees in journalism and political science. She joined the inaugural data journalism program at Columbia Journalism School, where she studied under respected journalists like Giannina Segnini and Mark Hansen.  Her masters’ thesis focused on the school-to-prison pipeline in the New York public school system, where her analysis and reporting on the school disciplinary data showed children with disabilities — especially those who came from poor families — are far more likely to be disciplined because the school staff cannot accommodate their emotional needs. Since joining The Marshall Project three years ago, she has used data to help our readers to make sense of the criminal justice system. The work has always been meaningful, but the combination of the unfolding crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, racial justice protests sparked by the murder of George Floyd, and the surging homicide rate have made her criminal data analysis more important than ever. Over the past year Li analyzed how the surge in homicide disproportionately affects communities of color, debunked the myth about police officers leaving the profession in droves, led a deep dive into the striking disparities in how many Black girls are hurt by the police, and built an interactive database that shows where people are incarcerated across the country, which empowered many local reporters to investigate their own communities. In myriad ways, Li’s data storytelling has deepened our understanding of criminal justice trends.  For providing nuanced data-storytelling that is accessible to communities grappling with questions around what safety means to them, and for helping individuals who have experienced injustice place their experiences within broader contexts, I am proud to nominate Weihua Li for the Sigma Portfolio Award.  Sincerely, David Eads Senior Data Editor","Weihua Li's 2021 portfolio—in some cases as lead data reporter in larger projects, in others creating her own stories—shows a rare level of breadth and creativity. Her personal projects were impactful and forward-thinking: Her investigation with Ilica Mahajan comparing a common law enforcement narrative to what labor statistics show about police employment was one of the most well-read pieces on The Marshall Project website with more than 100,000 unique visitors. The story, co-published by Time Magazine, led to coverage by NPR, NBC, and more, and was widely cited and debated. It was also our best-performing stor on social media in 2021. Her fresh take on evidence of an uptick in anti-Asian harassment was translated into Chinese in local New York City publications and elicited a statement from Andrew Yang, then a candidate for mayor. Even a straightforward story about decennial census incarceration was accompanied by a data release that has led to at least three more local stories in other outlets. Li also acted as lead data reporter on several of The Marshall Project's signature investigations in 2021. Her work was a foundational element of these stories. She brought sophisticated geographic analysis to show the scale of shootings by police in rural communities. As a complement to a larger project, she developed an original data product and data release to show whether your state takes federal benefits intended for foster children. Both the story and data are driving reform. Michigan banned the state from pocketing federal benefits owed kids in foster care, while lawmakers in Nebraska, Montana, and Texas are taking a critical look at the practice in their jurisdictions. Our data also is being used by reporters to examine what is going on in their states. The Philadelphia Inquirer, for example, used findings from our investigation to examine their city's record—and found that Philadelphia had pocketed $5 million meant for local kids in foster care. Li requested, scraped, and joined data from several states that served as the spine of a series of stories about life without parole. For example, the data showed that nearly a quarter of people serving life without parole in the United States are imprisoned in Florida—13,600 people. One reason is a two-strikes law which requires maximum punishment for people who commit a felony within three years of leaving prison, even for burglary or other nonviolent crimes. Finally, she cleaned, normalized, and analyzed data from five police departments to investigate the use of force on children. One of the big challenges with this data were many issues with quality that created serious limitations. She not only had to wrangle and report the data, but manage expectations and find creative editorial approaches to the many things the data did not show. As her editor, I also want to point out that she accomplished all this as a new mother during a pandemic. These are challenging times, and she met those challenges with great skill and good cheer. More than anything, Li's work asks deep and critical questions: What is justice and how do we measure it? What are the harms caused by the system? Are the stories we hear about crime and criminal justice true? How can we deepen a polarized and politicized discourse with evidence? The great 19th century physician Rudolf Virchow once wrote, ""medical statistics will be our standard of measurement: we will weigh life for life and see where the dead lie thicker, among the workers or among the privileged."" Every day, Weihua applies that philosophy to the U.S. criminal justice system and her work in 2021 shows how skillfully she is able",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/04/08/murders-rose-last-year-black-and-hispanic-neighborhoods-were-hit-hardest,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/04/20/nypd-hate-crime-data-fails-to-capture-harassment-against-asians-65-or-over,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/05/17/these-states-take-money-meant-for-foster-children,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/08/13/shooting-first-and-asking-questions-later,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/09/01/police-say-demoralized-officers-are-quitting-in-droves-labor-data-says-no,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/11/02/police-hurt-thousands-of-teens-every-year-a-striking-number-are-black-girls,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/11/11/two-strikes-and-you-re-in-prison-forever,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/09/20/there-are-fewer-people-behind-bars-now-than-10-years-ago-will-it-last,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/06/07/jail-populations-creep-back-up-after-covid-19,,,,,,,,
Singapore,Reuters,Big,Shortlist,,Reuters portfolio,"Reuters tell their most important stories visually. Many pieces follow a narrative driven expressly by visual journalism, whether that is unique data gathering techniques, charting and data walk-throughs, satellite journalism, explainer illustrations or immersive presentations. Regardless of subject matter, project size, or reporting methods, data journalism plays a major role in delivering stories. Making data understandable One of our missions is to make complex or difficult data sets easily digestible to tell stories. Design is a key component of making difficult data accessible. For example, our project explaining ""What's in the skies over Kabul"", combines complicated subject matter and thousands of flight data points to clearly explain how different types of aircraft worked in unison to evacuate the Afghan capital. Our project on summer temperatures at the Tokyo Olympics also leverages large amounts of historic data to clearly explain the concerns around extreme heat at the games. Public service Getting timely information about the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine and putting the mountain of statistics in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. Our COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker is a global effort to track the vaccine rollout plans of over 80 countries and all 50 U.S. states. Readers can see global and regional trends, dig deep into their own country, or read the statistics and headlines generated by our algorithm, fed by constantly changing data. Another example is the “Anatomy of a Death Threat” project, a data investigation which shows how Trump supporters waged a campaign of intimidation against the state and local officials who administer U.S. elections.  Innovation The Reuters Graphics team is continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information, such as our coverage of the Kabul crisis and the series of projects looking at sand mining. The team is constantly experimenting with striking ways to deliver our stories too. Take our project on rainforest deforestation for example. Animations show the actual scale and speed at which we are losing rainforest globally. Strong emphasis on project design Reuters pays careful consideration to the tone and subject matter as expressed through the design of the story. Reuters strives to forge a visual connection between audience and content before they have read a single word. The design and feel of each piece often reflects the tone and subject matter. This can be seen across a range of our work, such as the Eurovision project and the piece looking at bats and the origin of virus outbreaks.  Breaking news coverage When major news breaks, such as natural or unexpected disasters, colleagues from all aspects of the newsroom join forces to work with the graphics desk. Data, deep reporting and powerful presentation create insightful explainers that give the reader everything they need to know about the situation. Our job is to tell stories, and to further understanding of the news. We believe data, design, and narrative need to connect with the reader to bridge this. Reuters strives for this balance in every piece of visual journalism we undertake.","Bats and outbreaks As the WHO reached its findings on the origins of the novel coronavirus, Reuters explained why bats make such ideal hosts for disease-causing viruses. We visualised the universe of bat species and connected the dots to show the history of viruses they harboured, the intermediate hosts and connection to humans.   Flights over Kabul A Reuters analysis of flight data explained the rush to evacuate Kabul following the government collapse and Taliban takeover. We revealed how helicopter activity shifted from embassy evacuations to movement around a secretive CIA base. The analysis revealed how aircraft played different roles in the complex effort. This in-depth analysis was produced on deadline as events were unfolding.   Reuters Vaccine Tracker Reuters launched a global effort to track the vaccine rollout plans of over 80 countries and all U.S. states. We collected, verified and updated information on availability and eligibility as plans were announced and implemented around the world at a level of detail that has only been collected by Reuters to date. In addition to the data feeding our tracker page, Reuters partnered with Amazon to make the data available to Alexa users, giving answers on their local rollout.   Devoured This project is part of a series of visual stories examining how a construction boom is driving unregulated sand mining around the world – eroding rivers and coastlines, disrupting ecosystems and hurting livelihoods. Satellite-derived data revealed the scale of destruction at China’s largest freshwater lake. Reuters were able to visualise the millions of tonnes of sand sucked from the bed and shores, devastating the lake’s ability to function.   Death threats Reuters collected over 850 threatening messages sent to election workers. This visceral piece looks at the language and legality of these threats across a variety of forms: audio, charts and maps as well as an interactive quiz component to enforce the nuances in determining what is prosecutable and what is considered protected speech. This story is an unparalleled look at a targeted campaign of fear against election workers.   Ethiopia dams A Reuters analysis explained the critical issues surrounding the building of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in the headwaters of the Nile River. The reporting and data traced how the project near Ethiopia's border with Sudan has ignited decade's old water rights issues.   Rainforest deforestation Tropical rainforests are home to at least half the world’s living species, yet humans are destroying it faster than any other type of woodland. This data-driven story uses 3D animation and graphics to visualise the scale of loss since 2002.   Eurovision Every year more than 200 million viewers watch the EuroVision Song Contest. In its 65th year, Reuters investigated how the contest changed with the times. Using the Spotify API, we analyzed hundreds of EuroVision tracks for their mood, energy and more. We traced the shifting arc of the contest, from the dance-happy hits of the '80s, to the power ballads of the '90s.   Summer Heat The Tokyo Olympics were held in a historically hot period for the host city. This rich data-driven analysis looked to highlight how the heat and humidity of Tokyo could put athletes at an elevated risk for heat illness.   500,000 lives lost To mark the terrifying milestone of 500,000 lives lost in the U.S. to COVID-19, Reuters created a single long visualization to represent every single death. This story uses elegant design and heartbreaking detail to humanize a tragedy of unimaginable scale. Other newsrooms had to choose between showing the complete cost of the disease or highlighting the individuals behind the story. The visualization in this piece manages to do",English,https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/BATS/qzjpqglbxpx/,https://graphics.reuters.com/AFGHANISTAN-CONFLICT/KABUL-AIRPORT/zjpqkkwmypx/,https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/vaccination-rollout-and-access/,https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/SAND-POYANG/qzjpqxxabvx/,https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/THREATS/mopanwmlkva/,https://graphics.reuters.com/ETHIOPIA-DAM/movanmkbmpa/,https://graphics.reuters.com/GLOBAL-DEFORESTATION/RAINFOREST/klvykzrbxvg/,https://graphics.reuters.com/MUSIC-EUROVISION/FINAL/rlgvdyeqzpo/,https://graphics.reuters.com/OLYMPICS-2020/SUMMER-HEAT/bdwvkogrzvm/,https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-CASUALTIES-CHRONOLOGY/xklpyomnrpg/,,,,,,,
Australia,SBS News,Small,Participant,,SBS News: Australia And The Pandemic (COVID-19 Interactives),"SBS News (digital) is part of the Special Broadcasting Service, Australia’s multilingual broadcaster and one of the most trusted media organisations in the country. 


Australia is a multicultural country. More than a third of Australians were born overseas or have a parent born overseas, and it is our job to inform and educate all Australians with newsworthy, accurate information that is easy to understand.



With COVID-19, we knew our audience would want to know:

The facts (particularly in a time of such misinformation)
What was happening in their own backyard (localised infection rates, hospitalisations, vaccination rates) and
How Australia compared on the world stage (and, eventually, where they could travel to internationally to see loved ones).
And so we set about creating interactives that would do just that.


The result was a 10-part+ series of COVID-19 interactives and ‘click-through’ infographics, mostly published between February 2021 (when Australia’s vaccine rollout began) to late 2021 (when the Omicron variant hit).


At least two pieces of work; How many COVID-19 cases are there in each Australian state and territory? and How to show proof of your COVID-19 vaccinations in Australia, were translated into at least 8 other languages with help from SBS’s Audio & Language division. 


These 3 were among the top 30 best-performing articles of 2021:

What are the COVID-19 vaccination rates in your local area?
Where are you in Australia’s coronavirus vaccine queue? and
How many people are in hospital with COVID-19 in Australia?

Belgium,De Tijd,Big,Participant,,2021 | Datajournalism @ De Tijd Beyond Covid,"2021 was the year in which our datateam at De Tijd proved itself as a stronghold within the newsroom of De Tijd. In its current formation, De Tijd's datateam exists since 2018 consists of 4 people within a larger newsroom of approximatly 100 in total. Historically a purely financial newspaper, the medium broadened it scope in recent years and now covers a wide array of topics while keeping true to it's quantitative and rational approach.   Although these principles align well with the nature of datajournalism, the task of embedding a datajournalism within the larger newsroom is challenging. We submit our portfolio because we believe that during the past year we were able to let our team grow while further integrating our activities within the newsroom.  While the covid pandemic in 2020 allowed us the prove the importance of data driven journalism to the rest of the newsroom, 2021 was the year in which we were able to reaffirm that position. We broadened our scope beyond covid-related topics and applied some of the quantitative methods we learned during the past years to a wider array of themes. We made it our goal to tackle all of the major news topics and searched for ways to approach these themes with original and innovative entries. ——  Members Thomas Roelens, Datajournalist focussed on data-analysis (Head of datajournalism since October 2021) Thomas Segers, Designer and creative coder specialised in data visualisation Raphael Cockx, Newsroom developer with a strong knowledge of javascript and node.

Russia,Important Stories,Small,Shortlist,,Alesya Marokhovskaya,"My name is Alesya Marokhovskaya, I am 26 years old. I have been doing data journalism and investigative journalism in Russia since I was 20 years old. I used to work in the data department of Novaya Gazeta, now I run the data department in Important Stories. This is a young media created by investigative journalists (Roman Anin, Olesya Shmagun). I've been working in Important stories since the beginning. And I see a special approach to data stories: they should always be about people, no matter how much data you have studied for this. You can see this approach in my stories. In addition, I know several programming languages. I especially like Python, and JavaScript for visualizations. Now it is difficult to engage in investigative journalism and data journalism in Russia. The Russian government invented the status of a ""foreign agent"" to silence independent media. Important stories and I am personally recognized as a foreign agent, but I want to believe that people in Russia and in the world can still see and appreciate our work.","In this portfolio, I tried to collect the most important works for me, where you can see interesting work with data (by the way, if we see that we can share our skills and tell how we did this project, then we are shooting a lesson for our Workshop — https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVZy5a_8sMo4ncI6XBb5iMQ ), interesting data visualizations (for example scrollytelling technique and, of course, an interesting story about people.

Sweden,Newsworthy,Small,Participant,,Newsworthy's local climate journalism,"Newsworthy source local news from big data. In 2021 we did a big push to bring data-driven climate journalism to local newsrooms. How will climate change affect local communities? And are these communities transitioning fast enough? The coverage includes stories on car electrification, changing air travel behavior during Covid-19, industrial greenhouse gas emissions, carbon budget, snow forecasts, heat waves, and much more. These stories are broken down to municipality level and presented in hundreds of local editions, semi-automatically created from carefully curated data. With automation we are able to bring high-end data journalism to newsrooms with scarce resources. Impact Newsworthy's primary audiences are local journalists, local public officials, and politicians. Our reporting reaches people with the power to change local policies, and set local agendas. Climate reporting is often data-heavy, and might feel daunting for many news reporters. That makes it hard for many smaller newsrooms to get started. Newsworthy makes it possible even for low-resourced publications to do locally relevant climate reporting, by finding relevant angles to the data for each of Sweden's 21 counties and 290 municipalities. During 2021, we have had on average around 100 mentions/month from local and national media outlets, who are either using our stories as a base for going even more in-depth, or are simply republishing our articles (source: Swedish media archive Retriever). We have also noticed some un-credited republishing, but these are naturally harder to measure. To increase the outreach and impact we collaborate with established national outlets – broadcasters, daily newspapers and magazines. The partner newsroom typically publishes a national version of the story, while we publish the local versions on our website.   ","Methodology: Newsworthy uses statistical modelling and text automation to make this possible, with statisticians, developers and journalists in the team. Data is collected and analysed in Python and R (with R doing the heavy lifting in more complex statistical analyses). Texts are generated by journalists, but assisted by robots. We are automating not to replace human writers, but to empower them. We use a custom-built text templating toolset, making use of grammar rules from CLDR, dictionary data from the university of Gothenburg, and in-house language-technological databases.  Three lessons learned: 1. To automate the right things. We are working in a space between traditional journalism, and the automated text robots that have become popular over the past decade. We involve humans to define newsworthiness, to add interviews for context to data and in-depth analysis. And robots enable us to create hundreds of articles from a small set of human-created templates.  2. To use data to connect the global with the hyperlocal. How does the record-breaking heat wave in your town last week fit into the bigger picture of climate change? How much more common can we expect such heat waves to become? How will it most likely affect that town?  3. Data journalists should start monitoring climate in the same way we are monitoring covid cases, vaccinations and deaths. We need countinous eyes on the key cliamte numbers. Are we transitioning fast enough?

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Shortlist,,elDiario.es data team,"elDiario.es is a digital news site which has become a major reference in current affairs for a new generation of Spanish readers, and also a pioneer in high quality content and innovative business model worldwide. Launched in the middle of the financial crisis in 2012 with no big investors or corporates backing it - just a bunch of journalists and their savings - elDiario.es has developed a community-based journalism model reaching mainstream audiences with scarce resources. Among the dozens of new digital projects born in the past decade in Spain, elDiario.es stands out. More than 12M unique users per month (ComScore Mmx) now read eldiario.es and that figure grows every month. And elDiario.es is the most widely read native digital media outlet in Spain, according to the Spanish Sociological Research Center. The key business innovation is the 'membership program' - more than 60.000 people (""socios"") already give financial support to elDiario.es in order to strengthen our editorial and economic independence. But it is not a paywall: the ""socios"" of elDiario.es do not pay to read the news, they pay for the information to be freely spread and thus gain social impact. They pay to belong to a community of citizens sharing values like equality, democratization, social justice and more importantly, the need for independent journalism.  Our business model has remained the same since our foundation, but when the coronavirus crisis hit, the media experienced financial difficulties. In order to handle this situation,  we decided to bearly change our business model and make an evolution of it always keeping our foundational principles: elDiario.es will continue to be free for those who cannot pay but it will be necessary to be a member to read elDiario.es regularly.   In a world where manipulation and propaganda advance, we do not want our journalism to be left behind a wall that excludes people based on their income. This evolution in our business model has brought to our community 18,000 new members and thousands of existing readers stepped in. Thanks to them elDiario.es is also a profitable company. Nowadays, our community represents more than 50% of our annual income. And in order to be fully transparent with their contribution, we annually publish our financial accounts. This good practice has become an expected date for the audience who perceives us as a trustful and reliable newsroom. Since its inception, elDiario.es has opted for data journalism as a way to create quality content for subscribers and also to reach new audiences in Spain. Since 2015, our data team has always been a small data unit with at least two journalists who have based their work on constant collaboration with the entire newsroom. Now, the data journalism team is formed by 3 journalists.  This year, our Covid-19 and vaccination coverage proves that this team has had a public service role. First, using data analysis, interactive narrative, and visualization of complex issues to make them understandable, and second, as an early warning of the evolution of the epidemic for our readers. In fact, the 3 most read pieces of news of the year in elDiario.es were created by the data team: our covid trackers.  And also this year we published big investigations and visual stories beyond Covid-19 about employment, social inequalities, climate change and urbanism. Precisely, our work philosophy has always been to visualize and explain things in the simplest way to the reader and collaborate with all the journalists in the newsroom to search stories and do better, accessible and understandable data journalism.  ","This is the 2021 coverage by the data unit of elDiario.es, formed by Raúl Sánchez, Ana Ordaz and Victòria Oliveres, of the first year after the COVID-19 pandemic. All the pieces that integrate this portfolio have been carried out working from home in 3 different cities, a challenge that has ended with a rewarding and useful result for the public. In fact, only our COVID-19 trackers sums around the 2% of elDiario.es total views in 2021. The team's work during the year has been conditioned by tracing the pandemic. We have continued to update every day and every week of the year the visualizations of the evolution of the new waves of cases and deaths in Spain and the world, always improving the pieces according to the informative interest of each moment. This year, we also included our tracker on the vaccination campaign against Covid-19. The coverage of the vaccination campaign by the Data team of elDiario.es wasn’t limited only to following the numbers as public service role but we also published great explaining stories of how mortality was plummeting thanks to the inoculation and dozens of stories denouncing global inequality in the distribution of vaccines between rich and poor countries. In addition, we also published exclusives where we had to fight the Government for accessing data such as the first mortality map in Spain at the municipality level. Tracking the coronavirus crisis conditioned our daily workflow but it did not prevent us from being able to publish great in-depth investigations and visual reports. For example, our special project ""Spain lives in apartments"" that analyzes and maps the footprint of more than 12 million buildings in the country to explain why Spain is one of the countries that has built the highest and most dense cities compared to other metropolises of the world. Also the analyzes that we publish on the labor market that remained after the pandemic, where we reveal exclusive data obtained by transparency of the levels of temporary employment in Spain that suppose the creation and destruction of an average of 100,000 jobs every day or the gaps that exist in the unemployment rate depending on your gender, age, region or educational level. The team also prepared the coverage of the regional elections in Madrid and Catalonia, including the maps and live visualizations for election night and also publishing analysis stories or visual reports on the political exclusion gaps between rich and poor neighborhoods. Much of our work was dedicated to compensating for the lack of transparency and accessibility of data published by public administrations. In addition to correcting and compiling figures related to Covid-19, the team extracted from thousands of PDF pages the list of assets registered by the Church with irregular processes in Spain to publish the database to the public and facilitate claims. Apart from the Covid-19 data and the other investigations, we also monitored the summer heat waves and published a tracker of how the temperatures of all the Spanish capitals evolve day by day, in a bet to create content of personal interest for readers and also as an early warning.  ","English, Spanish",https://especiales.eldiario.es/spain-lives-in-flats/,https://www.eldiario.es/datos/desigualdad-desempleo-consulta-tasa-paro-brecha-demografia-juvenil-genero-sur_1_8428008.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/vacunas-edades-desplomando-casos-hospitalizaciones-covid_1_7980936.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/vacuna-covid-mapas-graficos-proceso-vacunacion-espana-mundo-enero-3_1_6782953.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/iglesia-puso-nombre-patrimonio-15-000-pisos-fincas-aparcamientos-espana-gracias-ley-aznar_1_7249317.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/espana-temporal-maquina-crea-destruye-100-000-empleos-dia_1_8527925.html,https://www.eldiario.es/datos/provincias-calentamiento-global-verano-calido-2015-2020_1_8174524.html,https://www.eldiario.es/datos/primer-mapa-mortalidad-covid-municipio-muestra-desigual-impacto-pandemia_1_7274498.html,https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/resultados-elecciones-4m-madrid-municipios-distritos_1_7897633.html,https://www.eldiario.es/internacional/radiografia-fabricacion-vacunas-35-paises-concentran-produccion-principales-dosis-coronavirus_1_8006149.html,,,,,,,
Tunisia,inkyfada,Big,Participant,,"The Covid-19 Pandemic in Tunisia, in Numbers","Dear members of the jury, It is with great pleasure that we present you with our data-journalism work on the Covid-19 pandemic in Tunisia. Founded in 2014 by a team of journalists, developers and graphic designers, Inkyfada is an independent non-profit media based in Tunis. It serves the public and collective interest. Inkyfada aims to reveal, show and make accessible what is hidden, participating in a better understanding of the world through investigation, data journalism and the realization of long term reports, portraits, explanatory articles and contextualization. Inkyfada fully assumes its role of counter-power, with a real impact on the public debate, fighting against the impunity and opacity of the powers that be and against all forms of injustice that result from it. Within an editorial team where journalists collaborate closely with developers and graphic designers, it is part of a larger group of alternative media, innovative and resolutely turned towards the future. It will regularly give its readers an idea of what is best in terms of journalistic storytelling, visual experience or development of new tools. As with everywhere in the world, Tunisia has been hit hard by the pandemic, threatening an already weakened health system.Thanks to inkyfada's journalists, designers and developers, we were able to gather figures on the pandemic (daily number of new cases, hospitalised people, number of deaths, etc.) and integrate them into an interactive dashboard. As soon as the vaccination campaign began, we went through the same procedure with the available figures on vaccinations. Obtaining some of this information proved to be difficult. For example, we faced difficulty compiling data on the number of resuscitation beds across the country, as many impoverished and neglected areas had none at the beginning of the pandemic. Beyond simply communicating the Covid-19 data, we were able to provide access to information that is oftentimes ambiguous and inacessible. In addition to communication failures, the Tunisian Ministry of Health does not consolidate data related to the pandemic. They are shared in non-usable formats and the authorities often change their logic. In fact, they are not accessible to the general public. By giving access to these data, by consolidating them and by carrying out this visualization work, inkyfada has carried out a public service work instead of the ministry. Our aim was also to see if the government would respect its objectives with regard to vaccinations. In addition to compiling the official figures, we also developed a projection feature for the upcoming months to see when and whether the government's targets would actually be met. This feature allowed us to understand how far behind the vaccination campaign was compared to its objectives. This portfolio is comprised of both data journalism and analysis. Given the lack of communication from authorities, this work is essential to understand the magnitude of the health crisis and the threats it presents. In accordance with inkyfada’s transparency values, we have made all the data available in ‘open data’. We hope that this work will interest you, Sincerely, The inkyfada team","This portfolio is composed of 3 data articles:  ""The Covid-19 Pandemic in Tunisia, in Numbers"".  This article tracks all the data of the Covid-19 pandemic in Tunisia: number of deaths, hospitalisations etc. It also lists the measures imposed by the government to fight Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, as well as the number of oxygen and resuscitation beds available. Data on number of cases compared to other Maghreb countries is also available. All of these infographics are interactive and enable the viewer to follow the evolution of the pandemic according to month and/or week. The data is updated daily and dates back to March 2020.  ""In Numbers. Follow the progression of Covid-19 vaccinations in Tunisia""  Similarly, this article compiles all of the data on vaccinations in Tunisia. The number of people registered, the number of people vaccinated with either one or two doses, available vaccines etc. Projections over the coming months were also conceptualised based on the vaccination rate since the beginning of the campaign. Lastly, an interactive map and a presentation of the international ranking of the number of people vaccinated made it possible to see how Tunisia compared to other countries.  ""5 graphs to better understand the magnitude of Covid-19-related deaths in Tunisia""  The summer of 2021 was particularly deadly in Tunisia. To understand the magnitude of the fatalities, inkyfada published 5 interactive graphs, allowing for a death toll comparison with other countries, as well as the lack of screening policy and the saturation rate of hospitals in the country.","English, French, Arabic",https://inkyfada.com/en/2021/02/26/dashboard-covid-19/,https://inkyfada.com/en/2021/06/21/vaccination-covid-19-tunisia-number/,https://inkyfada.com/en/2021/08/02/covid-19-number-of-deaths-tunisia/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The jury also commended ProPublica for its continued commitment to collaboration with local news organizations, bringing resources that local newsrooms otherwise wouldn't have access to.",ProPublica and Partner Newsrooms,"With a team of more than 100 journalists, ProPublica investigates a range of topics including government and politics, business, criminal justice, the environment, education, health care, immigration and technology. We focus on stories with the potential to spur real-world impact. Among other positive changes, our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws; reversals of harmful policies and practices; and accountability for leaders at local, state and national levels. One thing core to the work we do is the belief that data journalism is a key way in which we can hold power to account and shine a light into dark places. In 2021, we published -- frequently working with partner newsrooms around the country -- a range of stories and interactive pieces that do just that.","The projects we’re included were some of the biggest we produced this year:   We showed how 250,000 people living in hot spots of industrial air pollution may be exposed to levels of excess cancer risk that the EPA otherwise deems unacceptable -- and lets readers see the dangers near them.   We used the greatest trove of heretofore secret financial information on the ultrawealthy in the U.S. ever made public to reveal how they pay tiny amounts of federal income taxes   We used EPA air sensors to monitor pollution in a south Florida community blanketed with ash from sugar cane harvesting   We used genomic sequencing data to track an ongoing salmonella outbreak and created a mobile tool that let shoppers look up salmonella rates for the plant that processed the chicken at their supermarket.   We built an interactive video presentation that let readers watch the events of January 6 unfold as though they were present at the insurrection. This project, which published hundreds of videos for the first time, was cited as evidence in impeachment of former President Donald Trump, and in dozens of court documents charging participants with crimes.   We also published urgent, data-driven projects about the police department in New York City, one of the largest in the Country, on police union contracts in New Jersey, and on home-improvement lending.

I have worked on several data driven reports and investigations, and I believe my work is worthy of recognition, to motivate me to do more work with data journalism.","will present on two topics from published reports supported by data:

Restrictions on fishermen in Yemen
First, for months, I have been working on a data-driven investigation into the situation of fishermen in Yemen, and the effects of restrictions preventing them from accessing some fishing areas in eastern Yemen.
Yemen has a long coastal strip (more than 2000 km), and more than 120 thousand people work in fishing, representing the source of livelihood for their families.
Fisheries in Yemen have been affected by the war and division, and the damage has been exacerbated by these restrictions, which the investigation deals with, was published in the Arab network ARIJ + DW, and dozens of media outlets and websites.

Second: Education in Yemen
In light of the countless damage to education in Yemen, I worked on preparing a data-driven journalistic investigation about charging additional fees for children in schools, while addressing data related to humanitarian aid provided to Yemen. The report includes important information and data, about the situation of education in general, and about the nature of external support provided to finance education projects through international organizations operating in the country.

Spain,RTVE,Big,Participant,,DatosRTVE,"This is the portfolio of a data team forged by a pandemic. RTVE is the Spanish public broadcaster, a big company that includes tv channels, radio stations and, lastly, a news website. As a public media, public service is truly in the core of RTVE. You can see it in its journalists, in its vision and you in many special contents that are broadcasted only here. 

But as legacy media, digital transformation and changing general dynamics in RTVE isn’t always easy. What if something inevitable, unexpected happened? 

At the beginning of March 2020, the situation started to get loose and a new, strong demand for information appeared. Inside RTVE.es, the online news platform, there has been the intention to promote data journalism inside the company. There had been collaborations with other profesionales, inside and outside, to develop data journalism projects; but in order to establish a permanente data unit, a booster seemed necessary. In the chaos of the pandemic and it’s ever-growing databases, the first data journalism team at RTVE took shape. 

Pandemic year number 1 was difficult for that incipient data team, whose members -all of them, already journalists at RTVE- didn't have much prior experience in data journalism. But they managed to provide the public service that was expected from them. They followed Spanish and international sources, checked regional and local data and kept track of all major indicator, becoming a usual source for the most noble parts of the company: daily TV news bulletins. 

By the end of the year, the head of the news website used that momentum to consolidate the team and strengthen it by signing an outsider data journalist. In January 2020, I arrived to what would become DatosRTVE with a purpose: to continue the venture that had started a few months earlier and to take the team to the next level.

Since then, DatosRTVE has continued serving the public with the latest information on COVID -we are even referenced as a source for Our World in Data’s covid data-, but also expanding its work to many other topics, from the climate crisis to cinema prizes, along with access to university or international commerce. 

We are still lack some profiles that can help as gro as a team -designers, developers-, but we’ve learnt and keep learning new skills that have allowed us to go further and tell better stories. We’ve also found the ways to collaborate with different departments of RTVE, making ourselves a key part in different RTVE projects. And we are ready for pandemic year number 3.","COVID has been a challenge for every media. We’ve faced challenges that in a great part had to do with covid. For instance, automating covid updates was before a challenge and is now a no-issue. That’s why I have included almost none of our varied covid trackers -Spain, world, national and international vaccine campaigns...-, but there are of course other covid articles in the portfolio.

The first example is a risk evaluation of covid celebrations. It’s is a good example of how we have been trying to answer society’s concerns regarding covid, paying attention to the current circumstances -how are vaccines changing that risk?-, using different sources -in this case, a MIT study- and with the added-value (and challenge) of working with other departments of RTVE, like the Design team, to make the story appealing.

As a public media, public service is our motto. That’s why we’ve kept doing some not-so-grateful work like keeping track of covid restrictions, region by region. After the first three months of pandemic, the joint efforts faded and each Spanish region went its own way, leaving citizens disoriented. Checking each official bulletin every day takes a lot of time from our team, but we take it as a duty and our second project link, the restrictions guide, has been one of the site’s most read pieces each day of covid waves.

In that sense, keeping track of the deaths in elder residences has been a trademark of the data unit at RTVE long before it even had a name. There was a huge crisis in Spanish residences, with politics passing the ball and no official national records. So the journalists made it their task to get that best data possible, going to each region to find the information. They did it so well that official organizations like ECDC and CSIC used it as a source. Our third project link is a tracker of the covid situation there.

The forth project in an example of how we've tried to shed some light to an issue in debate. Should children be vaccinated? We used data from a recent study, talked to the author and built a specific narrative.

The other five links are projects beyond covid. Some were specially challenging, like the supply chain explainer: the main idea of the headline -why aren’t there video games in the supermarket?- was only the catch for a wide story with a lot of data, expert voices and  visualizations to try and simplify what is actually an extremely complex issue. Or the tracker of active fires, for which we used data from NASA to build a real-time map and data from EU’s satellite Copernicus for extra context.

We've continuously asked ourselves questions -we even have a series called 'Questions for a decade';- and we've analyzed many different datasets, like the regional elections that took place in May in Madrid (and the first time we used scrollytelling, a tool that we promoted inside the company) or the explosions of La Palma's volcano. We've even built a tool to help future students know if they can access university studies. And we've experimented with other formats like video, as appears in the analysis of COP26.

Although RTVE.es doesn't have a massive audience, many of these pieces where the most read on the website when they were published. And they were, almost always, above the average reading time, a metric that seems more and more important as the attention goes down and down.",Spanish,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211223/riesgo-contagio-covid-cenas-comidas-navidad/2239722.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20220105/mapa-confinamientos-espana-coronavirus-restricciones/2041269.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211231/radiografia-del-coronavirus-residencias-ancianos-espana/2011609.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211002/dilema-vacuna-ninos-riesgo-beneficio/2177920.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211124/crisis-cadena-suministros-explicada/2231820.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20220105/incendios-ultima-hora/2162540.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20210604/ciudades-futuro-urbanismo-sostenibilidad-datos/2097794.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211219/tecnologia-cambia-estudio-volcanes/2239980.shtml](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211219/tecnologia-cambia-estudio-volcanes/2239980.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20211101/negociacion-paises-cumbre-clima-glasgow/2206380.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/notas-de-corte,,,,,,,
Nigeria,"International Center for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), Sahara Reporters, Cross River Watch, Solacebase",Small,Shortlist,,Elijah Akoji,"As a data journalist whose focus is targeted at accountability and a corruption-free system where the procurement laws will be well respected and properly followed, It's my 5th year in the practice of journalism since my university days a mass communication student on a campus where we report campus stories. My inspiration in the field of journalism by the racketeering and unending corruption in the Nigeria system, where contracts are awarded to unqualified contractors without executing the contract. My ideals basically come from studying the Nigeria budget of every year and how this money is been released to the different contractors, the ideas also come from news report by government officials where they give out false claims to the public of executed projects which was never executed.

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,Participant,,Mark Doman,"My journalism career started more than a decade ago in Australia’s outback where I was a radio reporter covering everything from Indigenous land rights battles to the expansion of some of the world’s largest mines.

While my early years as a reporter was in broadcast journalism, the second half of my career to date has been focused on digital journalism. This is where I developed a passion for telling stories in creative and innovative ways.

Currently I work in a team with the ABC called, Digital Story Innovations. The team is made up of data journalists, developers, a designer and video and social media specialists. We are a visual journalism team specialising in the production of data-driven, interactive features and investigations.

While I personally work across an array of topics, my passion lies in telling and investigating stories using satellite and geospatial data. Over the years honing my skills in this field I’ve produced pieces identifying re-education camps in remote China, mapping the territorial demise of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and using remote sensing data to plot the disastrous impact of record breaking droughts on Australia’s water supplies and the towns that rely on them.

By combining largely open-source satellite imagery and data together with more traditional styles of reporting, I’ve been able to tell stories from the front line of battlefields and from some of the most remote, hostile parts of the world. 

Being part of a team that is constantly looking to innovate and evolve the way we tell stories, in 2021 I took a more ambitious approach to telling these stories. I experimented with more in depth analysis and data preparation using QGIS, a program for working with geographic data. I explored new, more immersive ways to bring readers into the story. I experimented with new ways to bring 3D data to life in the browser, using Webgl technology and even teaching myself how to use the 3D software Blender to create complex elevation models.

These techniques have struck a chord with our readers. The average engagement time for these pieces is much higher than our site average, meaning our audience is sticking on these stories for longer.

But as I have done throughout my career, I am constantly learning, seeking out new ways to improve the way we tell stories. I get inspired by the amazing researchers who constantly come up with new ways to use remote sensing to better understand the Earth.","This portfolio is a series of mapping and geodata-based projects that I completed in 2021, featuring a range of different techniques including 3D terrain modelling, open-source investigative techniques using satellite imagery.
The first project ‘Lawless’ Loggers used high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation data, that we uncovered through Freedom of Information Laws. The data allowed us to investigate claims the state-run timber company VicForests was conducting widespread and systemic illegal logging in vital water catchments. 

The researchers, who we worked with, used the terrain data to calculate a slope for every pixel in the digital elevation model. My role in this project saw me use the open-source software QGIS, to analyse, style and prepare this slope data. I then exported all of our geospatial data, (slope rasters, digital elevation model, vector boundary data) to create a 3D model of one of the worst affected regions in our investigation.

I created the model in Blender using an add-on called BlenderGIS which allowed us to work with georeferenced rasters and vectors in a 3D animation project. I used Blender to build a sequence that stepped our audience through the research and investigation.  This tricky process involved overlaying satellite and vector data onto a highly detailed mesh of the terrain. 

As a result of our investigation into VicForests, the Victorian government announced it would be enforcing tougher regulation of the logging company and they would face greater oversight by the regulator. The accusations revealed in the story were also referred to the state’s corruption watchdog. 

The next project in the portfolio was a quick turnaround investigation of a landslide, and subsequent flood, in the Himalayas that killed scores of people and wiped out critical infrastructure.  The piece ‘Tracing the path of destruction in India’s Himalayas’ used open-source investigative techniques to piece together what had happened in the aftermath of the landslide. I geolocated videos from social media and matched that up with the damage that could be seen from satellite data I had sourced from the commercial satellite operator Planet Labs. This painstaking process involved me scouring satellite imagery up and down the Dhauli Ganga River to identify where these videos had been captured.
I researched and wrote the story, georeferenced the videos, sourced the satellite images, styled everything in Illustrator and compiled the story in under 24 hours.

Some of my recent work has focused on tensions along the China-India border. As part of our research, we got wind of China’s plans to construct what would be the biggest hydroelectric dam on the planet. The stretch of river where the dam would go is one of the most geologically active places on earth, in the world’s deepest gorge and in one of Earth’s tallest mountains. To convey just how treacherous and complex construction of this dam would be, I worked with our developer Katia Shatoba who used Webgl technology to create a 3D model of the terrain. This allowed readers to get some sense of the rugged terrain. I complimented this using spatial datasets to create visualisations of earthquake activity in the region, China’s love of dams, as well as custom hillshade wide maps of the region.

Other projects in the portfolio that are similar in style include examining the breaking up of the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica, mapping New Zealand’s Alpine Fault line and customising a 3D sequence of Earthquake modelling scenarios, and further investigation of potential illegal logging in Victoria.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-24/hi-res-elevation-data-pinpoints-outlaw-logging-in-forests/100626640,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-11/satellites-capture-scale-of-indian-glacier-collapse/13137924,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-25/chinas-plan-to-build-mega-dam-on-yarlung-tsangpo-brahmaputra/100146344,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-05/satellites-capture-birth-of-brunt-ice-shelf-antarctic-iceberg/13208776?nw=0&r=HtmlFragment,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-22/nz-racing-to-be-ready-for-magnitude-8-on-alpine-fault/100134024,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-30/vicforests-accused-of-failing-to-regenerate-logged-forests/100652148,,,,,,,,,,,

Thailand,"Bangkok Post, SE Asia Globe, South China Morning Post, Vientiene Times, Viet Nam News, Nguoi Dothi, VOA Cambodia, FM100 CMU",Big,Participant,,Mekong in Deep Water,"Mekong In Deep Water is a data-driven special that digs into the data to reveal the secret forces at work driving decisions about dams, droughts and diplomacy in Southeast Asia. Each story analyzes complex dynamics that drive environmental destruction, the impact of decisions that put livelihoods at risk and political and economic drivers that ultimately foreshadow irreversible damage to local communities, economies and ways of life.The project was managed by the Internews Earth Journalism Network, led by local data evangelistis, reported by teams of local reporting fellows from the region, and published by leading media houses. It harnesses data to understand how these political, environmental and economic forces play out, with dramatically divergent results, in different countries and communities. 
The five countries covered by the stories share one of the world’s great rivers, the Mekong, as their main ecological artery and a similar vacuum in accountability and governance mechanisms to protect it. Environmental and socio-economic issues intertwine and span across their borders: dams upriver in Laos affect health of fisheries and mangroves in Cambodia and Vietnam; while electricity demand from rapidly developing Thailand incentivises the building of more dams in neighboring Laos. However, due to historic disparities between these countries in levels of economic development, systems of government, levels of press freedom, and language barriers, collaborative data reporting by journalists from Mekong countries on cross border issues is rare. Our project put particular emphasis on bringing together local environmental journalists and local open data evangelists who worked together to exchange contextual knowledge about neighbouring countries’ environmental issues and data sources that are available only in local languages.

In addition to the environmental challenges that span the region, the space for press freedom is also rapidly disappearing in these countries and the project harnesses public data to push for accountability where traditional reporting on the same issue would likely be censored. In 2021, after years of democratic backsliding and outright coups, all five countries are under authoritarian governments that are hostile to independent journalism that is critical of those in power. Nevertheless, the stories published in our project investigate infrastructure projects that benefit business and political elites, the disparities between officially published statistics and realities on the ground, and how well-intentioned but misguided policies are strangling ecosystems.

Globally, much of the challenge of mainstreaming data-driven accountability reporting is reluctance by media houses to invest resources and take editorial risks. The project prioritized multi-platform production in local language media houses that would reach both policymakers and impacted communities. For example, a radio piece on coal exploitation ran in Thai on a station that reaches those who live in the shadow of the coal plant and a story on Laos energy price rigging ran in one of the most widely read newspapers in the capital. When a story was deemed too sensitive for local media, it was published in regional media such as the South China Morning Post or Southeast Asia Globe and when possible, republished locally.

In order to grow a sustainable data journalism community, the project formalized relationships between traditional environmental journalists and local open data evangelists through a process of training and co-production. The partnership focused on fostering data literacy among journalists working for mainstream media through intensive training and mentoring following a proven hypothesis-driven approach to data storytelling. Transparency, reproducibility and accuracy were vital in an environment where journalists engaged in accountability reporting run an enormous risk of legal retaliation by the government and business interests. All data sources are available on the project site both to encourage wider use but also to safeguard against libel charges.","Stories focused on issues that are difficult to investigate through traditional journalism due to the governments’ political clout over media, including resource extraction and economic inequality, the transboundary nature of environmental issues, and the impacts of local environmental mismanagement by the government. In many cases, the only reason the journalists felt they were able to evade censorship is because the stories are based on data. Many stories ran in both English and the respective local language. 

The major challenge for all these stories was the lack of access to accountability data. Though we requested over a dozen disaggregated data sets over the course of the year, the most we received were summary tables. Thus, data findings were able to measure the extent of the problems and their impact on livelihoods, but find shortfalls on who to hold accountable and who exactly the “winners” are. However, many stories were still able to shine a light on policy shortfalls by comparing data findings to human stories on the ground and comparing locally produced public datasets to global ones. This was one of the highlights of the project, an outcome of the close collaboration between the local data evalengalists and reporting fellows. 

Driven in large part by economic interests of elite enterprises from both the state and non-state sectors, many stories shine a light on a landscape of sacrificing people and progress for profit. In Locked in – Why Thailand buys electricity from Laos, Wanpen Pajai from Thailand explains how Thai firms reap profits from cheap imported hydropower, energy that citizens pay for under rigid contracts that divert risk to Thai citizens & environmental damage not only to Laos, but also to countries further downstream. Similarly, on the other side of the border, Ekaphone Phouthonesy reporting for the Vientiane Times in Laos, finds that despite Laos’ huge growth in hydropower energy production, tight market control by commercial interests, driven in large part by private investments, keeps electricity prices high for Laos citizens. Along similar topics of prioritizing profits over people, Kannikar Petchkaew from Thailand produced a series of episodes on a local radio show where she tells the story of continuing Thai investments in coal power in Laos, where Thai firms reap profits from cheap imported coal power and Laos suffers the environmental damage. 

In addition to cross-border stories on energy and infrastructure, journalists contributing to this portfolio also developed stories that use data to track the impact of transboundary environmental issues. Sokummono Khan writing for VOA Khmer explores how despite official statistics showing increasing fish catches in the Tonle Sap Lake, the livelihoods of Cambodian fishers are under threat due to the overall decline of the natural river ecosystem, a problem that is exacerbated by upstream dams that impede crucial seasonal floods and rich sediment flows and commercial overfishing. In Mekong Fishermen Struggle to Survive published by VietNam News Van Nguyen brings attention to plummeting fish catches in the Mekong Delta caused by climate change and dams restricting water, leading hundreds of thousands of fisherfolk to migrate. 

In other cases, fellows opted to focus on local environmental accountability, using data to bring communities’ attention to whether their natural environment is being managed effectively or not. Pratch Rujivanarom for the Bangkok Post finds large irrigation dams in northeastern Thailand fail to account for climate change induced floods and droughts, causing loss of rice harvests as extreme weather becomes the norm. Le Quynh writing for the Straits Times & Người đô thị shows that Ho Chi Minh’s mangrove forest is dangerously sick, shrinking & mismanaged by the local government, compromising its ability to clean air and store carbon.","Vietnamese, Thai, Cambodian",https://earthjournalism.net/mekongdata,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/locked-in-why-thailand-buys-electricity-from-laos,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/cambodias-fish-catch-numbers-dont-add-up-for-fishers,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/unraveling-the-mystery-of-laos-u-turn-from-renewables-to-coal-to-power-the-battery-of,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/thai-military-feels-the-heat-over-plan-for-solar-farm,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/alarm-bells-ring-for-mangroves-in-unesco-recognized-reserve-in-vietnam,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/what-does-the-data-tell-us-about-electricity-pricing-in-laos,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/mekong-fishermen-struggle-to-survive,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/cambodias-mismatch-of-solar-potential-and-energy-harvesting,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/in-thailand-dams-fail-to-ensure-water-security,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,,The Economist,"My career in journalism began roughly the same time as this pandemic did. “Boring” is a word that may spring to mind for many people when I try to explain what I’ve been doing since: If you are interested in calculating confidence intervals, methodologies, the importance of saying “I am really unsure”, and the difference between knowing what to expect for a group and what to expect for a person of that group, you are probably an outlier. But even if you are not, please read on anyway. What I’ve spent much of my time doing - statistical modelling - may not be worthy of a thriller in terms of the action it entails: mostly thinking, sometimes codin. But the journalism it has enabled me to create is, at least to me, as important and exciting as anything.
Short bio: I joined The Economist in February of 2020. Before that I was at Princeton University (PhD research, completed in December of 2020), and before that I did a BA at NYU.","I am the author of all the linked projects. That means I did the writing, research, and modelling. Visuals (include interactives), were created - in my view masterfully - by our designers and visual data journalists based on the data I provided.  
This submission has links from two big projects, both about the pandemic, and two small.
The first is a covid-19 risk estimator, with an associated article and methodology. The estimator is an online tool that enables people to fill in pre-existing conditions (e.g. asthma, diabetes and hyperlipidemia) and get the risk of hospitalization and death by age and gender should they be diagnosed with covid-19. Anytime someone uses the tool, a machine learning model running in the cloud is used to generate a prediction. This tool, and the data used to construct it, was also the basis of an investigation into covid-19 illness. 
The estimator has been used by academic researchers at Brown, Harvard, New York and other universities, as well as the American Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Researchers at NYU Langone are currently, together with me, exploring how to use the tool to optimize allocation of booster doses of vaccine. These researchers turned to us, because, as far they knew, no better tool was available. 
The second is my estimate of covid-19’s true death toll for every country and territory. This includes an article, a methodology, an online interactive (that updates daily), and an article centered on South Asia (with reporting). This project aimed to estimate and show a more accurate representation of the pandemic’s true death toll. The effort has been widely praised by international organizations, receiving a thank-you from the WHO, who called it ‘heroic’, a letter from the UN praising it as “exemplary”, and used as the basis for analysis by the World Bank, as well as acknowledgement from the Global Fund, one of the largest distributors of pandemic aid. Researchers at the University of Oxford call it: “the most comprehensive and rigorous attempt to understand how mortality has changed during the pandemic at the global level.” 
The project’s estimates have also been widely used, and even become part of the covid-19 “data” tracked by Our World In Data. I also know that at least one of the world’s largest aid organizations have used them in discussions of how to allocate pandemic aid. They are also being used by the World Health Organization. Upon request, I’m also regularly advising the WHO on related questions, joining their working group on the topic. I think it has been important to show the death toll in developing countries: using official numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, both dependent on testing, means underestimating the severity of the pandemic in precisely the places with the least resources to fight it. This enables people to do better.
This project has a link to a github repository as well: both projects are 100% open source. 
Finally, there are two smaller projects to show breadth. The first, “the beef with beef”, looks at climate change, and how by cooking so many cows, humans are cooking themselves, too. The second, “coming clean”, looks at how Twitter’s algorithm favors politicians on the right, and unreliable media.

France,Libération,Big,Participant,,Libération,"Libération is a national french newspaper founded in Paris by Jean-Paul Sartre and Serge July in 1973. In 2021, three data driven journalists in Libé gathered to launch the project of a daily chart with a strong visual identity.
Here is the team : Alice Clair started as a graphic designer specialised in branding before integrating a datavisualisation studio in 2015. She joined Libération’s infographic team in 2020. Julien Guillot has been working as a data journalist in different infographics studios including BiG and joined Libération in 2014. Savinien de Rivet is a data journalist and developer who joined Libération in 2016. Our main inspirations are the work of Edward Tufte and David McCandless (especially Beautiful News) and all our fellow data journalists and data visualisation designers out there (FT, The Economist, the Pudding…)","Our project is called «Data du jour» and consists in a daily chart about a news subject. 
They are square shaped for the most part in order to be equally readable on mobile and desktop screens. We called our visual identity Bora-Bora© because of the use of the whole surface of the chart from edge to edge (bord-à-bord in French). This way the visual representation of the data uses the most part of the chart with few visual clutter. We use colour gradients and coloured backgrounds to enhance focus on important data and also make our charts more appealing.
For the most part, «Data du jour» charts are published in PNG format with a short article, but we also use interactive charts when it is relevant, like in our Morphocarte©. 
On the homepage of Libération’s website, the image associated with the article is made of pure data, without any typographic element of the full chart. Our «Data du jour» is easily shareable on social media and draws a lot of attention. Sometimes our charts are even used on the front page of the printed newspaper.

Indonesia,Tirto.ID (republished on Climate Tracker),Small,Participant,,Made Anthony Iswara (Tirto.ID),"I believe that the combination of my comprehensive data collection, engaging interactive visuals and immersive storytelling are the reasons why I should be considered for this award. I have written 700+ data-centered articles and analyses on Indonesia's The Jakarta Post (newspaper and online) and Tirto.ID (online) that translate qualitative and quantitative data into error-free writings, specializing in socioeconomic topics. I won 5 awards and obtained 1 international fellowship in the last three years, including an award for the data-oriented in-depth data reporting titled ""A land without farmers: Indonesia's agricultural conundrum"" in 2020 and Climate Tracker’s COP26 Climate Justice Journalism Fellowship. I have 3 years of experience as a journalist altogether, including 2 years at The Jakarta Post and 1 year at Tirto.ID. I primarily get ideas by talking to people, read new studies and explore datasets. A few of my mentors and inspirations include former The Jakarta Post Managing Editor Esther Samboh, Tirto.ID Research Manager and award-winning novelist Farida Susanty, and Interactive Data Journalism Professor at Multimedia Nusantara University (UMN) Utami Diah Kusumawati. My mission is to bridge research (including via data journalism), communication, and development economics to influence policy-making on poverty reduction.","Project Link 1 titled ""Can Underprivileged Communities Access Higher Education?"" (translated from the Indonesian Title) depicts the problems of inequal access to higher education in Indonesia, especially for the poorest Indonesians. The story combines anecdotes, researchers' calculations and national data on how socioeconomic conditions may affect one's chance to attend higher education, complemented with an interactive scatter plots, a donut chart, and a bar-line combination chart. The story shines a light on facts and issues that is often ignored. Indonesian President Joko Widodo has repeatedly emphasized his vision to build reliable human resources through good-quality higher education yet the fact remains that underprivileged communities still struggle to enter higher education. The Google Docs link attached below is the translated document to the original Indonesian article published on Tirto.ID on July 16, 2021.

Project Link 2 titled ""Tug-of-war between Indonesia’s Commitments to Reducing Deforestation"" is republished on Climate Tracker (as a result of a fellowship) and translated from the Indonesian article published on Tirto.ID. The story exposes a lesser known fact that there are ""covert"" deforestation behind Indonesia's drastic decline in deforestation rate that the Indonesia government has boasted in multiple occasions. Finding reliable deforestation data was challenging as the data are scaterred in various reports. However, my experience in delving into public records have eased me to know what data to search for via the search engine and which report I should use as my reference. The data compiled combines secondary research and interviews from my live reporting at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, completed with data visualizations.

Similarly, Project Link 3 titled ""The Chaos of Electricity Financing To Get Rid Of Coal Dependence"" (republished on Climate Tracker and translated from the Indonesian article on Tirto.ID) aims to explain in the elephant in the room when it comes to financing coal: it's difficult to phase out coal entirely without the proper funds to support it. As coal financing becomes a larger issue at this year's COP26 negotiations, this piece explains important information to the public at how achievable are the commitments to phase out coal by 2040 in Indonesia, considering that many Indonesians depend their living on coal while electricity generation heavily depends on coal. The article includes COP26 live reporting, data analysis and visualizations (area chart, a donut chart, a column chart).

Egypt,Masrawy.com,Big,Participant,,Maha Salaheldin,"My name is Maha Salah El-Din, a digital and data investigative journalist at an Egyptian digital press organization. I am considered one of the first Egyptian and Arab journalists in the field of data journalism, as I started to take an interest in this field since 2014, I started taking training courses, in infographics, and what is available in Egypt, and then started taking more advanced courses in data journalism online, and outside Egypt.

Until I specialized in this field since 2017, and obtained a professional diploma in data journalism supported by the Knight Fellowship for International Journalists, and Arij Network for Investigative Journalism. I am the first journalist to win ARIJ award for the best data-driven investigation in the Arab world in 2018.

In addition, I am the recipient of many local, Arab and international awards, in digital and humanitarian journalism, investigative reports, and specialized awards such as the European Union Award for Migration Issues. Currently, I am a nominee for the International True Story Prize, which will take place in Switzerland in June 2022.

All of these awards were earned through data-driven and digital projects, using various data processing techniques.

In addition, I decided to specialize in data science and study statistics as an academic postgraduate study at Cairo University.

In this cycle of the award, I wanted to present a summary of my work to establish the first unit specialized in data journalism in Egyptian newsrooms, with an individual effort, by sending data-driven project models, of varying sizes, between large projects, in-depth reports, and daily reports, in all fields, to make The idea of ​​having a unit specialized in data journalism in Arab newsrooms is a possible idea, and it is not limited to serious or elitist sections.","As one of the first journalists specializing in data journalism in Egypt, I worked during 2021 to establish the first unit specialized in data journalism in Egyptian newsrooms, with an individual effort, starting with the idea, and data collection, through modern technologies, such as data scraping, data cleaning, analysis and interrogation. Then the simplification and writing, and the visual and interactive representation of the data.

During that year, I fed all departments of the organization with data-driven stories across the fields: politics, economics, gender, climate change, culture and tourism, crime, sports, and art.

The stories varied, between large projects about Egypt's adaptation to climate changes, through the use of solar energy to light the Egyptian oases.

And in-depth reports, such as measuring the impact of the first wave of Corona on various areas of the Egyptian economy through data, which was reflected in the improvement of those sectors later.

Murders of women against the backdrop of so-called honor, analysis of the speeches of the political leaders who took over the leadership of Egypt after the 2011 revolution, reports that monitor the neglect of historical heritage in Egypt, through data and satellite images.

In addition to data-driven reports and projects in the fields of art and sports, we can ensure that data-driven journalism can be used in all fields, and is not limited to only serious sections.

In addition to daily reports, on trending topics is an analysis in only one chart, under the name (the ranker) in all areas, so that we can assure that data journalism, can enter into the daily work of press organizations, and not a requirement that those projects take Long weeks and months.",Arabic,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/11/23/2128377/%D9%85%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%A3%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%B3-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%A3%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/1/30/1961263/-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AB%D9%82%D8%A8-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/3/15/1987795/%D8%A5%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B8%D9%86-%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%83-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%88%D9%83%D9%87%D8%A7-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%A9-70-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%81,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/3/27/1994795/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AB-%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%AD-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%81%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%82%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/10/8/2102318/%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%82%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-6-%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/11/25/2129872/%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B4-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82-%D8%A3-%D9%86%D8%B4%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A2%D9%85%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AD%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/9/2/2082918/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AF%D8%AE%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE-%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9,https://www.masrawy.com/crossmedia/bayanat/,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/12/8/2137599/%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8016-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7-10-%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2021/12/10/2138794/the-ranker-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%B0%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%89-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%B4-%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%804-%D8%B3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA,,,,,,,
Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Shortlist,,Kontinentalist,"Kontinentalist was founded in four years ago with the mission of changing the world's conversations about Asia. But the way to do so wasn't always clear. Initially, we'd considered and experimented with various ideas—for example, being a massive repository for Asian data. It was only more recently that we've clarified our abilities and method: we strive to elevate the conversation about Asia, and to do so through data-driven stories, bridging the gap between research and the public. 

Firstly, we do this by partnering with organisations like think tanks, humanitarian organisations, conservation and activist collectives, who provide expertise and valuable lived experiences to make the stories real and grounded in expertise. Basically, we try to unlock the potential for insight by working with these organisations whose data might otherwise go untapped. We then lend our data visualisation and narrative skills to the issues, investigating and presenting it in a fresh and engaging way that's rarely seen in this part of the world. 

Secondly, as we're aware we and others in the region operate in a media environment that's sometimes challenging— e.g., our regional voices are under-represented in global media institutions, data access and literacy is low, other challenging sociopolitical contexts—we run many initiatives that strive to address these challenges. For example, we speak with and profile Asian data practitioners to raise their profile, and we contribute what we can to public education via talks and data literacy series and workshops. In this way, we go far beyond the remit of a traditional newsroom. To truly enhance the power of data journalism, we not only make worthy data stories, but also strive to build a wider community to be more receptive and to be more active producers of these stories. 

Thirdly, in terms of inspiration and mentors, the data visualisation and journalism community has so many wonderful people to learn from, it's hard to single out any. We've definitely benefited from just absorbing the incredible data journalism work that exists out there, and it's probably shaped the work we can do on a subconscious level and by expanding our imagination of what's possible. Overall, however, there isn't any other organisation of similar size and regional context that does exactly what we do in terms of our mission and the various initiatives we run. 

In all, I believe Kontinentalist should be considered for special recognition because: (1) We're truly pushing the envelope for innovative data journalism, both in the content itself but also in how we work—bringing entirely new communities into this field and helping them realise the potential of their data too, which also benefits our communities. (2) Despite being much smaller, we're doing more than producing data stories, as we try to nurture the field and community. (3) We're quite unique in the combination of all that we do and why we do what we do, and we hope it inspires people all over the world to chart their own path too.","Kontinentalist is a node for many collaborative data stories in Asia. We work with all kinds of organisations, from think tanks and international humanitarian organisations to smaller grassroots activists and citizens. This means most of our stories include collaborators but generally the workflow is such that Kontinentalist does the bulk of the work for every project: the collaborator might share some data or insights; we'd supplement with our research, query and clean the data, storyboard, design, draft, develop, and iterate. 

In terms of challenges, there's the familiar one of lack of easy data access and more generally a culture of journalistic freedom and awareness where we operate. As we're not a full-time newsroom, we also don't have capacity to exclusively produce data stories as much as we're passionate about doing so. Other challenges tend to be more specific to each individual project, for example, cleaning unstructured data or coordinating multiple actors. 

How we overcome these challenges: We prioritise the topics that we feel would have the greatest societal impact, by filling in an information gap or covering an angle that hasn't been done before in the existing conversation. We also get very creative in terms of what counts as data sources and persistent in searching for leads. We are disciplined in making sure data is actually central to the topic, making sure to marry the story with the form rather than just having ornamental visualisations. Thus in the portfolio projects you see, they're of topics that are pressing and we felt weren't sufficiently covered by regional journalism, we had good data sources and key collaborators to provide valuable insight, and the data was central to the narrative and would help illuminate the public on important matters.

As for other operational issues like capacity and coordination issues, we try to restructure where sensible or move things around. At all times, however, we abide by our values and commitment to ethical knowledge production: 

Innovative yet rigorous storytelling
We believe story dictates form, not the other way round
We strive to move beyond today’s digital storytelling techniques
We prefer slow thinking to chasing news cycles 
We research and fact-check everything
We’re transparent about where we get our data and how we handle it
We change our minds when new or better evidence emerges

A principled approach
We’re all about cultural context, because facts don’t live in a vacuum
We refuse to exoticise Asia, and resist Eurocentrism in all its forms
We treat myths, legends, and local knowledge with respect
We stand for freedom of speech
We care about our environment and saving it for future generations

Unique and unheard voices 
We support diversity in identity and worldview
We believe that each individual brings something unique to the table
We tailor our work to give meaningful voices a platform
We thrive on collaborations and feedback
We only work with partners who value openness, constructive criticism, and working together on challenging issues",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/sexual-assault-and-abuse-in-singapore-need-more-than-the-law,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/otters-are-cute-but-endangered-and-trafficked-as-pets-in-asia,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/the-rise-of-tech-women-in-asia,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/a-cultural-history-of-han-chinese-names-for-girls-and-boys-in-china,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/who-trees-dont-shield-from-the-urban-heat-island-effect,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/hepatitis-c-kills-as-asia-struggles-to-get-treatment,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/how-do-boomers-millennials-and-gen-z-feel-global-warming-differently,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/is-foreign-investment-sustainable-for-cambodia,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/clothes-swapping-and-upcycling-in-singapores-eco-friendly-fashion,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/hepatitis-c-kills-as-asia-struggles-to-get-treatment,,,,,,,
Spain,La vanguardia,Big,Shortlist,,Laura Aragó,"It’s challenging, demanding and frustrating (sometimes). I felt data journalism was a bit like this 8 years ago when I made my first steps as a recent graduate student and I still feel quite the same about it. And somehow it’s part of the magic: each article is an opportunity to explore new techniques for turning data into stories. The precision offered by the data, stills seems to me the best way to explain the changes in our society. And most important, to report what consequences it has on citizens. 
I have dedicated almost my entire short professional career to data journalism. Most of it working as a full-time employee at La Vanguardia, a Spanish newspaper based in Barcelona. Founded in 1881 it is considered one of the oldest newspapers in the Iberian Peninsula and currently has about 200 hundred journalists on staff. Despite its long journey in paper format, it has a short history -almost 2 years- as a first digital newsroom.
As the only member of the data unit in the newspaper the last six years have been an endless roller coaster: I have learned how to be a better journalist, how to code (or at least try it) to offer some kind of interactivity to articles, how to get the most out of data analysis, and how to convince managers that it was necessary to invest more resources in data journalism. 
During these years a network of excellent professionals around the world, always willing to help, and a constant flow of wonderful examples of data journalism have been an engine to continue learning. Whenever possible, I have tried to turn numbers into human stories that help potential readers to better understand what a bunch of numbers mean. And I have found in cartography a powerful tool to locate these stories about the territory.","In almost all articles I’ve used public data from institutions; R and QGis to download, process, clean and analyze data; html and javascript to make the data visualizations. Described below:
Demographic imbalance: The most populated square kilometer in Europe. Demographers say that talent always emerges in the most populated places. If the concentration of population is synonymous with creativity, then the neighborhood of Florida, in L'Hospitalet, and that of Clignancourt, north of Paris, are its greatest exponents. Florida and Clignancourt, the two most populated places in Europe, live parallel realities a thousand kilometers apart: more than 50,000 inhabitants in just one square kilometer, a community of neighbors that perfectly embodies the melting pot of cultures that coexist in Europe and the same soundtrack, the drill. Tools: R, javascript, mapbox and datawrapper
Public transport vs private: The car continues to be the most effective means of transport in the large Spanish cities. Thousands of citizens choose, every day, to leave aside public transport and move around in a private vehicle. And it's not surprising: economic reasons aside, in the big Spanish cities you can get almost ten times farther by car in 15 minutes than by public transport. Urban areas are stuck between an insufficient public transport network and a network of roads clogged with cars. In a context of climate crisis and energy emergency, the commitment to public transport is running late and the time to build a network at the level of the great European capitals is running out.

Smothered renters: one in four have trouble paying rent. There is a broad consensus that establishes that a family should not spend more than 30% of their income on rent in order to cover the rest of the expenses with a minimum of comfort. When this figure exceeds 40%, families enter a situation of risk and high residential stress. In large cities, such as Madrid and Barcelona, ​​a quarter of the population lives in areas where rent eats up, on average, more than 30% of household income. Tools: r, mapbox, scrollama, javascript.

The Generation gap. Stopper generation: the broken axis of the social elevator. There are two generations - the X and the millennials- who have difficulties developing their lives due to the existence of a previous generation that acts as a buffer: they concentrate decision-making positions in companies, administration , universities, unions and the cultural world and, as a consequence, slow down the professional promotion of later generations and artistic, intellectual and political renewal.
Campaign against Covid: The WHO global vaccination target will not be met until 2030. To reach 70% in the summer of 2022, the current rate of vaccination should be multiplied by nine. Tools: excel, rstudio, datawrapper. Conducted with Carles Villalonga (writing and analyzing) and me (analyzing and data visualizations).
2021 closes with twice as many deaths from Covid than in 2020. At least 3.5 million people have died from covid throughout 2021. It is the balance left by this second year of the pandemic and doubles the figure for 2020, which was around 1.8 million deaths. Tools: r, svelte, javascript, datawrapper

Germany,Zeit Online,Big,Shortlist,,Zeit Online,"Which mask should I wear? Have I contracted the coronavirus? Where are the infection numbers highest? In the year when the whole world was looking at something you can't see, visualization is everything. 

When the number of cases rises rapidly in the spring, it quickly becomes clear that it's not just the absolute number of cases that's important. It is the development that is crucial - and at the same time difficult to understand. Exponential growth, doubling times, the reproduction number R: How can we present all this as simply as possible for our readers? 

The knowledge department immediately joined forces with the interactive and data departments and has been working closely together ever since. Not only are the known Sars-Cov-2 infections researched directly in the counties, but also complex scientific relationships are visualized as simply as possible. With graphics, maps, animations, interactive calculators or illustrations, the team tries to prepare all information in a way that is understandable for their readers.","With the onset of the pandemic, our focus shifted - suddenly all editors, programmers, data journalists and designers were working on one topic and on how to best shape the coverage of a global emergency. Science journalism and the visualization of it faced a new challenge that had to be tackled together. ZEIT ONLINE pooled all its capacities for this purpose and accompanied the developments of the pandemic for a year in graphics, maps and illustrations. 

The evaluation of complex data sets, their processing, presentation and explanation are among the important tasks in the global exceptional situation. Science and data journalists, as well as visualization experts, have a crucial role to play here, because they communicate the knowledge of researchers to society. They provide orientation in a situation that is unprecedented - and changes almost daily. ZEIT ONLINE's Corona reporting is an example of exactly what this can look like: always up-to-date, always comprehensible, always close to what moves a society, always in the best possible form of presentation.

Brazil,Nexo Jornal,Small,Shortlist,,Nexo Jornal,"Nexo Jornal is a Brazilian newspaper, centered in context journalism. It was founded in 2015 and since then has received attention for the quality of its production and, specially, for its data visualizations.
 
Graphics are essential for Nexo's coverage: we try to use data visualization for everything, from covid-19 and economics, to music and sports. 
 
Our entire work is collective but our team is also divided in two sub-groups: one dedicated to design, and another to data science. Recently, we had a new addition of a web developer. In total, we are 7 people.
 
We are a very young team (mean age of 25 years old) but really committed to improve our work every day.","This year our team, as every other newsroom in the planet, strived to maintain the delicate balance of reporting on the covid-19 pandemic with the care and attention the matter requires, while not neglecting other emerging crises, and also, as we call internally, lighter subjects, such as pop culture, music and sports. The selection below aims do showcase just that.

We managed our efforts and successfully covered large events like the Olympics and COP 26, while maintaining two daily charts with national and global covid figures in our newsletter.

Our portfolio is a selection of some of our best weekly work. Every Monday the whole team gets together to brainstorm ideas and decide on the week's tasks. These meetings are fueled by discussions of themes such as politics, current events, science and culture
.
Most of our stories start as a team member putting up a dataset or report for discussion. We then weigh how relevant or interesting the data presented are against how robust is its methodology and how feasible it is to work with. 

Once we approve an idea, usually a data scientist starts delving into the data and writing up the text and general structure of the piece. They then pass the text and raw charts on to an information designer that realizes the story on the page, deciding the layout and visual identity of the piece. 

The first version is then shared with the rest of the team, who comment and double-check the charts, figures and text before passing the revised version to our editor (who is also one of our data scientists).

The tools used by our data scientists to analyze and plot data are mainly R, via RStudio with special focus on the [tidyverse] packages. Google Sheets and Flourish are used for more straightforward and time sensitive work. 

The information designers, in turn, work mostly with Adobe Illustrator to create illustrations and highlight the most important aspect of the visualizations. They also make data visualizations in Flourish when needed.

Romania,"Panorama.ro, Are.news",Small,Shortlist,,Edit Gyenge,"I’ve been working with data all my life, starting with my first job as a journalist 16 years ago, during the period I worked as a consultant, and until this day when I managed to transform my passion for data into a business. It never felt more important and fulfilling than it is right now. 
As a TV journalist, I learned the rigors of news broadcasting. Classic, but strong rules that were taught by experts who had been trained in international TV stations. Rigour, correctness, and a hint of creativity, just enough to color inside the lines when it comes to daily news broadcasting.  The downside of television is that you need footage to complete a story. A simple spreadsheet isn’t enough, neither are words. When working, years later, for a newspaper things were slightly different. Didn’t need the footage, but still needed pieces to tight up the story. 
It seemed like the data always needed a second or third party element to complement it, to make it visible. I first discovered professional data visualization 5 years ago, even though I have been playing with charts and graphs all my life, and fell in love ever since. My job never felt more important and with such a huge sense of accomplishment like it is today. When visualizing data, the only second or third element is your own creativity, vision, and knowledge. Of course, there are rules, things that make the difference between amazing data visualization and a bad representation. There is also a huge responsibility not to lie with charts and not to be biased by the data itself, but the outcome can lead to so much more than a simple journalistic story. Data visualization is a tool for communities,  it’s a map of understanding the world in a data polluted environment. It’s a dictionary for building future knowledge by translating present facts. It means educating and offering insight.
It’s been 4 years since I’ve been building visual representations of data for national and international media outlets, NGO’s and companies and with each year I come to accept the fact that even though there are amazing people out there sharing their knowledge and offering guidance, even though I bought each and every single book ever written by data visualization gurus, it still is a solitary experience. With every new chart or infographic, I feel that there is so much to improve and so much to talk about, so many possible correlations. There is a lot of personal work and self-improvement in this field that seems to be aging, but it never gets old. Even with simple forms of representation like line charts and bar charts there still are lessons to be learned and things to improve. It’s a journey of continuously trying to make the data visible, visual, and valuable.
Making a difference never felt so achievable and at the same time so challenging. I firmly believe that achievements in this field are little pieces from which others can benefit from and that is a mission that I try to accomplish with every data visualization.","Link 1

It presents a project aimed to explain why Romania was the second country in the EU with the lowest vaccination rate. In cooperation with Andrei Luca Popescu we tried to follow 5 possible scenarios that can explain this result. 
1. The effect of the fear of death due to Covid on the intention to vaccinate (low excess mortality determines a low vaccination rate)
2. Conspiracy theories (where do Romanians stand when it comes to conspiracy theories?)
3. Level of education and understanding (are Romanians educated enough or self-sufficient?)
4. Distrust in authorities and the health system (do Romanians trust doctors?)
5. The contribution of extremist parties to the anti-vaccine discourse (is it possible that extremist parties' discourse contributed to a general mistrust in vaccines?)

Our team combines storytelling, human-centered design & deep technical capabilities to build data-rich digital projects. The common thread throughout our data projects and story-telling work is the idea of visualizing a better world through meaningful collaboration, partnership, and service. We view our data visualization toolkit and work as a hedge against misinformation and the showcasing of stories around the most impactful issues of our time. As displayed in our portfolio of work in 2021, we have delivered on work in the areas of COVID19 and Public Health, Equity in Education, Gender Disparities, Sustainable Cities, Climate Change, Digital Infrastructure and Development, and Conservation Technologies.

Nathaniel Pearlman, Graphicacy’s president, has been visualizing data for more than two decades; his interest goes back as far as his first statistics class with Edward Tufte in 1988. Nathaniel majored in computer science at Yale and he finished all but his dissertation in MIT’s political science doctoral program. Outside of academics, Nathaniel is an experienced entrepreneur. He founded NGP Software, Inc. in 1997 (now NGP VAN, Inc.) to join his interests in politics and technology and grew that company into the market leader in fundraising and compliance software for progressive political campaigns. Nathaniel served as Chief Technology Officer for the Hillary Clinton for President campaign in 2007-8. In 2009, Nathaniel founded Graphicacy for information graphics consulting and services. 
Since 2009, the company has been growing rapidly. Graphicacy is a small, adaptive, and creative group of ten data-savvy designers and communicators. With varying technology toolkits, the team is aligned in our focus to deliver timely and targeted visualizations to help bring clarity to a noisy informational landscape. What we lack in numbers is made up for in our ability to strategically partner and collaborate with mission-driven organizations. This fact has made us resourceful and collaborative, which is at the heart of our view of good storytelling work.

We believe that data alone is meaningless, and the unearthing of insights and visual display of information to our readers and audiences is a pivotal part of our success. Our goal is to empower readers and audiences to explore and interrogate data and information and ask better questions about the world around them. While we may not consider ourselves a data journalist newsroom, we think deeply and genuinely about the power of data, good journalism, and thoughtful design. 

We appreciate the opportunity to be considered for the Sigma Awards because we believe in the importance of a united and galvanized community of people working together in the data journalism space. We want to play our part and contribute to building relationships with people and organizations using data journalism as a tool for social change.","In a year when fiction often passed for fact, Graphicacy had the privilege of helping mission-driven organizations share important, engaging, and profound stories built on data for audiences worldwide. Whether raising awareness, shaping policy decisions, or driving action, the data visualization projects our team worked on in 2021 covered a spectrum of goals and issues. We drew tremendous inspiration collaborating with professionals devoted to improving the human condition on so many fronts. The described project links highlight our year of work.

COVID-19 and Public Health: Our relationship with Johns Hopkins University expanded in 2021 with updates of two projects launched in 2020 focused on the coronavirus response. As the pandemic evolves in our lives, the JHU Coronavirus Resource Center, which TIME magazine dubbed “2020’s Go-To Data Source,” continues to allow users to explore the current conditions of COVID-19 in their state and track progress via charts or map-based visualizations.

With the VIEW-hub data visualization platform for the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, our team worked to increase the focus on fast-moving COVID-19 vaccine research. In November, The New York Times used VIEW-hub data as the basis for its article on waning vaccine effectiveness. 
 
Equity in Education: We transformed research from the Postsecondary Value Commission into an interactive Equitable Value Explorer for the Institute for Higher Education Policy, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. According to a Forbes article from November, the tool aims to “help higher education leaders ‘know their numbers’ so they can implement evidence-based policies promoting economic mobility and social equity.”
 
Gender Disparities: With their RUN/51 initiative, Vote Run Lead strives to establish female majorities in every state legislature by 2031. We developed an interactive scrollytelling tool that shows users how long it will take their states to achieve that majority based on current data. 

Sustainability: Graphicacy helped the World Resources Institute’s Ross Center for Sustainable Cities paint a vivid picture of the urban services divide with the Seven Transformations for More Equitable and Sustainable Cities. 

Conservation: We had the honor of working with the WILDLABS team to visualize their first-ever State of Conservation Technology Report. A December article in The New York Times called out the many ways technology teaches us about nature and the WILDLABS data.  

Digital Development and Infrastructure: On the global level, we also worked with the United Nations Foundation’s Digital Impact Alliance to create an interactive online Catalog of Digital Solutions. With this tool, the world’s development community can learn about digital technologies to aid their efforts and see how others have applied them in specific use cases.

United States,NASA Earth Observatory,Small,Shortlist,,NASA Earth Observatory,"The Earth-observing satellites that orbit our planet generate dozens of terabytes of data each year. While much of this data is downloadable and freely available to the public, interpreting it can be extremely challenging. Only some researchers, data visualizers, and data journalists have the expertise and bandwidth to do it well.

The NASA Earth Observatory is charged with making such data and observations accessible to the public. Founded in 1999 as an educational outreach project, the website has grown to become NASA's flagship for breaking Earth science news, imagery, and data visualization. Over our 22-year history, we have published more than 11,000 stories and generated hundreds of millions of pageviews on our website alone. News organizations and scientific institutions regularly expand our reach by reusing and amplifying our stories.   

We continually gather and evaluate new observations collected by satellites and Earth scientists and put data at the heart of a new story every day. Though we work within a science institution, we have been given great autonomy and responsibility to apply journalistic principles to our storytelling, and that has helped us build trust with our readers. With tens of thousands of daily visits to our website and millions of followers on social media (10.7 million on Facebook, 2.5 million on Twitter, and 1.5 million on Instagram), our visuals and stories routinely influence the national and international conversation about key environmental issues. 

Over the decades, astronauts have looked back at Earth and noted that international borders are not visible from space. We try to live that. Though our team is based in the United States, our content and outlook has a strong international component. We routinely share images and stories from around the world that are overlooked by mainstream media outlets in the U.S. Our readers notice and appreciate that: About half of them reach our website from abroad. Only one-tenth of our social media followers are based in the U.S. 

Whether the topic is rising global temperatures, Amazon deforestation, or the impacts of hurricanes, wildfires, or illegal fishing, our team strives to offer a big-picture perspective. In some cases – such as tracking fire activity or deforestation in remote or less developed areas – satellites are the only feasible way to track changes over time and across borders. Our imagery and analysis fills an important niche in the information ecosystem.  

Our team is small – two data visualizers, four science writer-editors, a data archivist, and a web developer – but we have more than 110 collective years of experience that help us bring depth, rigor, and science literacy to these stories. We have academic and professional experience in cartography, library sciences, computer science, graphic design, remote sensing, science journalism, and Earth sciences. Every story we produce requires visualizers, editors, and writers to work closely with each other and with subject matter experts to ensure that stories are scientifically sound, appropriately contextualized, and readable. Text and visuals must fit together and advance the same concepts. If they don't, we spike that story. 

We are probably an unusual entrant in this competition, but we believe we occupy a special place in science communication. At a time when our planet is stressed, we provide unique insights into how it is changing and why. But lest we be too dour and serious, we also remember – and regularly remind readers – that data is beautiful, and so is our planet.","While Earth Observatory covers all Earth sciences and many types of natural events, we have selected a series of stories from 2021 that highlight the human fingerprint on environmental changes and challenges. 

Chief among these is global warming and climate change. NASA scientists are the keepers of one of the most widely cited analyses of global temperature trends in the world, and our team plays a critical role in producing visuals about global warming and its effects on sea ice. As we reported in ""2020 Tied for Lowest Year on Record"" and ""Sea Ice Highs and Lows,"" the bad news about these indicators continued in 2021.  

After fires and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in 2019 inspired intensive and sometimes misleading media coverage, our team began publishing a series of stories about the history and nuance of deforestation trends in the region. Our story from February 2021 (Fires Raged in the Amazon Again in 2020) details something that most outlets overlooked: the 2020 fire year was worse than 2019, even if fewer people were tweeting about it. The visualizations in this story were designed specifically to address some misconceptions that had surfaced in public conversation about the Amazon. 

Others stories in the portfolio created buzz for less predictable reasons. In February 2021, we published a story highlighting a striking photo of gold mining in Peru (Gold Rush in the Peruvian Amazon) that led to articles in CNN, BBC, and several other outlets about Peru's ""rivers of gold."" Later that year, we followed up with a more substantive story (Finding Gold Mining Hotspots in Peru) that detailed how teams of researchers have developed a satellite-based tool to identify illegal gold mining hotspots. 

Other stories – using satellite observations of nighttime lights to identify illegal fishing (Arabian Night Lights), investigating the causes of megafires in California (What’s Behind California’s Surge of Large Fires?), or tracking garbage in the ocean (Mapping Marine Microplastics) – did not break records for pageviews or media mentions, but perhaps they should have. In each case, the stories used remote sensing data to highlight environmental problems that would be a challenge to conceptualize in the absence of a satellite perspective.",English,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147946/fires-raged-in-the-amazon-again-in-2020,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147973/a-deadly-debris-flow-in-india,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149017/hunting-milky-seas-by-satellite,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148307/arabian-night-lights,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148908/whats-behind-californias-surge-of-large-fires,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149163/mapping-marine-microplastics,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147794/2020-tied-for-warmest-year-on-record,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148767/hurricane-ida-batters-louisiana,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148194/sea-ice-highs-and-lows,https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/148439/finding-gold-mining-hotspots-in-peru,,,,,,,
United States,The Texas Tribune,Big,Participant,,The Texas Tribune,"The Texas Tribune’s mission is to raise the level of engagement in the second-largest state through public service journalism. Data is one of the foundational tools we used to help Texans understand a whirlwind one-month special legislative session in the fall of 2021 when lawmakers redrew the state’s political maps. The process of redistricting is opaque and inaccessible but impacts every resident, including the millions of Texans of color who are the main force behind the state’s population growth. Making this process more transparent for readers is a key part of our mission.  

The Tribune’s data visuals team in the fall of 2021 consisted of an editor, Darla Cameron; deputy editor, Chris Essig; two developers, Carla Astudillo and Mandi Cai; and fellows Jason Kao and Kalley Huang. We’re lucky to work with the Tribune’s politics reporters, especially voting rights beat expert Alexa Ura. Our work is supported by editors, designers, engagement journalists and engineers. 

Our redistricting coverage was designed first and foremost for average Texans, people who will vote in a dramatically different political landscape for the next decade. We use technology to make it easy for them to find the information that they need. The capstone of this portfolio is a tool that allows readers to search their address to see how the new districts will affect their community. Every state should have a resource like this, and the Tribune welcomes copycats (in fact, the Tribune gives away all of our stories to be republished for free). With our permission, encouragement and advice, SpotlightPA (https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pennsylvania-redistricting-house-senate-districts-lookup-tool/) published a very similar redistricting comparison tool for Pennsylvania’s new legislative districts a few months after ours came out. 

The entire redistricting project required very careful planning and coordination across teams. We worked with politics editors and reporters to plan every part of this project, from the original analysis questions to the final presentation. Our audience team was invaluable for sharing the resource far and wide, and our engineering team helped debug the more technical aspects of the lookup page. This portfolio illustrates how a data team has to be closely integrated with the entire organization — we’re stronger together.","In one month in 2021, Texas lawmakers redrew political maps for the state’s congressional, House, Senate and Board of Education districts. The maps were drawn to keep Republicans in power for the next decade. The maps entrench rural, white electoral power — despite new census numbers pointing to Texans of color as the main force behind the state’s population growth.

This portfolio highlights The Texas Tribune’s work to cover every part of this process. We analyzed data, wrote stories and created graphics to help Texans interpret the new maps. Redistricting is a story about data — legislators use detailed census counts to draw maps with surgical precision. Here’s how the Tribune built a data analysis process to support our work. 

First, data reporters, editors and reporters developed an analysis framework to evaluate each proposed map when it came out. To save time, we set up a Klaxon alert bot to alert us when a new map was released for analysis. We built a parser in Python to get the state’s strangely formatted files into a more legible format. This means we could get data into user-friendly, easy-to-compare spreadsheets for reporters within minutes, and use these files to answer their questions on how the districts changed over time. All this work enabled us to write analysis-packed breaking news stories as soon as the new maps were released.

After those initial stories, we wanted to work with reporters to explore specific places where the lines were redrawn in problematic ways. For this, we made a reporter-only Mapbox dashboard that allows them to see how the demographics of the districts changed in the old and new maps. This helped direct our focus for large and detailed one-off maps of noteworthy districts (such as where one district completely encircles another, like a doughnut), which we built using Datawrapper or Illustrator.

All this led to our district lookup page. This is a very reader-focused tool: We assume almost no one knows their state House, Senate or congressional district numbers, but everyone knows their address. It's powered by an address-to-district conversion API that we previously used for election results pages. The lookup also has all of the demographic data that we analyzed earlier — in simple HTML charts, because not all geographic data needs to be mapped. The maps in the project were created with Mapbox.

The map lookup page drew more than 200,000 page views so far. Reader feedback included a tweet that said ""This is so much better and more user friendly than the state’s map. Bless you Texas Tribune 🙌.” Other people on twitter called this ""great"", and still others said it was ""fantastic work"", ""well executed"", a ""great tool"", ""excellent tool"",  ""incredible tool"", and ""really, really helpful."" And the coverage isn’t over — we’ll keep tracking the story of these maps as they are litigated in court and keep promoting the page as the maps are used in 2022. This is how we fulfill our mission with public service journalism.",English,https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2021/texas-redistricting-map/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/20/texas-redistricting-special-session/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/24/texas-congressional-redistricting/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/09/30/texas-house-redistricting-map/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/12/texas-redistricting-doughnut-fort-hood-bell-county/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/15/texas-redistricting-dallas-fort-worth/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/20/texas-redistricting-race-discrimination/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/25/2021-texas-redistricting-explained/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/22/texas-redistricting-congressional-asian/,https://www.texastribune.org/2021/12/13/latinos-texas-redistricting-dallas/,,,,,,,
Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC),Big,Shortlist,,"Digital Story Innovations team, ABC News","The ABC’s Digital Story Innovations team is a collection of journalists, developers, a designer and social media and video specialists. The team is focussed on data-driven, visual storytelling for Australian audiences.
 
Since its inception in 2017, we’ve used data to investigate and visualise stories on a broad range of issues from political donations to illegal logging, to tracking Australia’s vaccine rollout and telling the story of how Australia’s battle with the disease unfolded in its first year.
 
The DSI team’s 2021 portfolio showcases how data-driven techniques can be used across the full spectrum of story creation -- from discovery to research, analysis and presentation -- to either break new terrain or deepen public understanding of familiar topics.

The portfolio demonstrates how innovative storytelling techniques - such as data-driven investigation, graphics and interactive design - can be seamlessly blended with traditional person-centred storytelling to powerful effect. 

It includes ground-breaking investigations based on public data (vaccine tracker), exclusive access to tightly-held datasets (political donations), in-depth analyses of spatial datasets (Lawless loggers) as well as innovative use of publicly available datasets (coronavirus and vaccine stories).
 
Each project demonstrates a commitment to rigorous, meaningful and transparent use of data while being unique in concept and execution.","Our series ""Hitting the Jackpot"" is the most comprehensive and detailed examination to date of the money flowing from Australia’s gambling industry into the political system.
Our project adopted a new approach to this problem, expanding on previous analyses to trace political payments from more than 370 gambling-related businesses and individuals over 22 years.

As part of our story about logging, we obtained high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation data which allowed us to investigate claims the state-run timber company VicForests was conducting widespread and systemic illegal logging in vital water catchments. Using the data, the team was able to show large areas of forest had been logged in breach of the law. 

""Anatomy of our battle against COVID-19"" was published on the anniversary of Australia’s first documented cases of COVID-19, uses the ABC’s national dataset of every confirmed coronavirus case to tell the story of how Australia’s battle with the disease unfolded in its first year.

""Untangling Australia’s vaccine rollout targets"" traced every twist and turn in the short, confusing history of the rollout program’s first three months. To compile the timeline of targets, we combed through government media releases, press conferences videos, news stories and broadcast interviews, transcripts of questions and statements to parliament and rollout planning documents. 

We paired this with data on actual vaccinations (collated by our team from multiple sources as national data was not available until five months into the rollout) to show how far the government had fallen short of its (many) promises.

""Tracking Australia’s COVID vaccine rollout"" is a real-time database that visualises the state of play in Australia’s much-criticised vaccine rollout which began in early 2021. It has been expanded and updated as new data has come to hand.

""How quickly is COVID spreading in your neighbourhood?"" used an automatic data feed to provide a hyperlocal perspective of the the rapid spread of Delta infections. At the time, the state government was scrambling to contain the outbreak by using tough lockdowns. These were imposed neighbourhood by neighbourhood, based on how quickly infections were spreading. 

This story allowed residents to access and understand the data that was driving the government’s daily decisions and public health directives. The story text was updated every few days to highlight the latest trends in the numbers.

The article ""Tracing the path of destruction in India’s Himalayas"" used open-source investigative techniques to piece together what had happened in the aftermath of the landslide. We geolocated videos from social media and matched that up with the damage that could be seen from satellite data we had sourced from the commercial satellite operator Planet Labs.

In our story about the Chinese plan to dam a Himalayan river, we used Webgl technology to create a 3D model of the terrain to convey just how treacherous and complex construction of this dam would be.

Other projects in the portfolio that are similar in style include mapping New Zealand’s Alpine Fault line and customising a 3D sequence of earthquake modelling scenarios.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-14/how-the-gambling-industry-cashed-in-on-political-donations/100509026,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-23/how-gambling-industrys-biggest-political-donors-influence-votes/100592068,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-25/covid-19-spread-through-australia-over-year/13078574,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-02/charting-australias-covid-vaccine-rollout/13197518,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-28/untangling-australia-s-covid-vaccine-rollout-timetable/100156720,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-25/how-quickly-is-covid-spreading-in-your-nsw-postcode/100402830,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-24/hi-res-elevation-data-pinpoints-outlaw-logging-in-forests/100626640,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-05-25/chinas-plan-to-build-mega-dam-on-yarlung-tsangpo-brahmaputra/100146344,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-02-11/satellites-capture-scale-of-indian-glacier-collapse/13137924,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-22/nz-racing-to-be-ready-for-magnitude-8-on-alpine-fault/100134024,,,,,,,
Spain,Maldita.es,Small,Shortlist,,Maldito Dato (Maldita.es),"Maldito Dato is the section of Maldita.es specialized in data journalism and FOIA.

It is a benchmark in Spain in terms of the use of the right of access, transparency and open data.

During the pandemic, it has done a great job via FOIA to obtain a multitude of databases and information unknown to the public. Thanks to all this information and the subsequent work of data journalism, he has been able to tell a great multitude of relevant information.

Maldito Dato has already been recognized in Spain with the GO! Award of FOIA and Transparency in the media category (both in 2020 and 2021) and with the Open Data award from the Junta de Castilla y León in the data journalism category (2021), among other recognitions for his related work in this field. In fact, the fundamental basis of Maldito Dato is clear: data journalism and right of access. They are the two main tools that Maldito Dato tries to use to tell stories and do good journalism. And in 2021, obviously, we have tried to use it especially to focus on the pandemic.","During 2021 Maldito Dato has published an investigation on Spanish hospitals in the pandemic and has revealed the capacity and daily occupation of all of them.

We has also revealed via FOIA who has attended the meetings between the regional governments and the Government of Spain during the pandemic. This information has been hidden throughout the pandemic despite the demands of civil society. Maldito Dato obtained it via FOIA and was able to create and analyze a dataset to see that governments such as Catalonia or Melilla were missing on many occasions.

Via requests we have also been able to reveal during this year that almost 400 workers from the Murcian health department jumped the vaccination line, how in February 2020, before measures were taken in Spain, emergency calls were already triggered due to the coronavirus or the data on infections and deaths among health workers that the Government did not publish.

We were also able to tell the story of retired doctors and health workers who had not finished their degree who were being hired or the vaccination of the regional Health Councillors.

They are just some examples. But Maldito Dato has been clear about the importance of fighting via FOIA for information of public interest that citizens had the right to know during a time as serious and relevant as the pandemic.",Spanish,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211104/investigacion-hospitales-pandemia-ocupacion-coronavirus/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211231/10-informaciones-periodisticas-maldito-dato-transparencia-2021/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211229/Gobierno-Murcia-vacuna-377-trabajadores-no-asistenciales/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211202/asistentes-consejo-interterritorial-autonomias-covid/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210518/llamadas-sanitarias-112-summa-comunidad-madrid-estado-alarma/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210421/sanitarios-hospitalizados-fallecidos-pandemia/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210514/inicio-pandemia-comunidades-contratacion-extraordinaria-profesionales-sanitarios-estudiantes-jubilados/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20211020/vacunacion-consejeros-sanidad-coronavirus/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20210204/consejo-interterritorial-sanidad-comunidades-coronavirus-actas/,https://maldita.es/tag/transparencia,,,,,,,
Chile,La Tercera,Big,Participant,,La Tercera,"La Tercera is one of the most important legacy newspapers in Chile, and during the past years, has been going through an important digital transformation. As part of this process, the Interactives Narratives area was created, being one of their main tasks to create and develop multimedia, graphics, interactive products for La Tercera. Although we cover all kinds of topics and areas of journalism (from sports and investigative), data-driven content has become part of our core.
We’re a very small team, with no more than 4 people regularly. We don’t even have inside our team a full-time designer or developer, of course, no data scientist. At first glance, this seems like a disadvantage, however, as allowed us to grow partnerships with different areas of the newsroom and also other areas of the paper. We like to think that we have helped them in return to learn more about digital journalism, audiences and product.
Being a small team has also pushed us to develop a lot of different abilities beyond our original areas and that has been fun and motivating. We do a lot of different stuff and we work a lot. Is not always entertaining but we feel very proud of what we bring to the organization.
During the three years of existence of the Interactive Narrative Teams we’ve developed around 30 features, interactives, multimedia specials and help in a lot of other stuff, like newsletters, live shows and a long list. It has been fun!
Why we should be considered for this award? Like a member of our team would say, because it’s impressive the kind of things we do with such little time and resources. Our competitors tend to think we are a gigantic team with a lot of opportunities but most of the time is not the case. However, the quality of our work tells another story.
We push the limits of the organization and always try to be innovative despite, sometimes, some resistance. So yes, we deserve recognition without question. We know a lot of folks out there do really impressive things, but we also do cool this, we a lot of impact, mostly because of our determination of doing it.","We begin our project with one question: how we could help our audiences to understand the constitutional process and get to know the candidates that aspired to write the new Chilean constitution (and their positions on key topics).
So we started by building a dataset with detailed information of all the candidates to the Constitutional Convention, even before the official data was published. There were almost 1500 candidates, most of them normal citizens who wanted to participate.
We also created, with an expert panel, a questionnaire about the most important topics regarding the new constitution. Then, we contacted every one of the candidates to apply an online survey. It took about three months to have around 90% of the candidates' answers. We used this same method of data gathering later with the presidential and Congress candidates, our Electoral Match.
We chose to play with the concept of ""make a Match"" -from dating apps like Tinder- with the candidate which had more in common with every person, crossing the answers of every candidate with the answers from the users. It paid off. The audience connected very quickly with the idea and even made memes around the Match.
After people discovered who their Match was, they had the opportunity of looking at the page we built for each candidate with their full profile, so they could get to know them. We developed detailed bios for each one, so throughout that these pages have become an ""alternative Wikipedia"", and for a lot of the conventionals elected is the first page that shows ups in a Google search.
It was a success, but we had the new challenge after the election: to analyze the data to profile the Constitutional Convention and let to know people which were the main tendencies.
We did this in two stages. First, on the very next day of the election, with a more simple page, with graphics and illustrations made with our designer and iconographer. It worked like a charm and was very viral. But on the day the constitutional convention started, we launched a data visualization build with D3, where we showed all our data and made a crossing between the answers of the conventionals and different characteristics in detail. Months later, we improved this same exercise with the data of the elected Congress.
By the time the presidential election was coming, we had to upgrade our game, so we made an alliance with the data scientist Jorge Fábrega. People then could discover their Match in the candidates for the presidency, the Senate, and the House of Representatives, checking how many answers had in common with the candidates, and later could find out in which part of an ideological map there were located, between the candidates. To do this, Fábrega used the scaling method NOMINATE, visualizing this in a one ax graphic for the Congress, and two axes -like the classic Political Compass- for president.
Overall, we had 12 million pageviews in the profiles of the candidates, a 1 million in the Constituent Match and also 1 million  in the Electoral Match.
We have been iterating this products for more than a year now and we're very proud with the result. We created an interactive, intuitive and entertaining tool to help people be involved and participate in such an important election process we had during 2021. At the same time, we built datasets with information that no other media have and that let us publish relevant and interesting analyses about the elected bodies and the possible political outcomes of these elections in the future of our country.",Spanish,https://www.latercera.com/the-match-project/,https://interactivo.latercera.com/candidatos-constituyentes/,https://interactivo.latercera.com/tu-match-constituyente/candidatos-constituyentes/,https://www.latercera.com/investigacion-y-datos/asi-piensa-la-nueva-convencion/,https://interactivo.latercera.com/tu-match-electoral/,https://interactivo.latercera.com/como-piensa-el-nuevo-congreso-2021/,https://www.latercera.com/investigacion-y-datos/noticia/como-piensan-las-listas-de-la-convencion-constitucional/2WKACYWFUNGXXLLYIE45RNI2NA/,https://interactivo.latercera.com/tu-match-constituyente-los-elegidos/,https://interactivo.latercera.com/tu-match-presidencial-edicion-primarias/,https://interactivo.latercera.com/tu-match-constituyente/con-quien-compartes-tus-ideas-de-pais/,,,,,,,
