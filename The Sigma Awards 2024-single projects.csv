Bangladesh,Netra News,Small,Winner,"Body Count is an exceptional data journalism effort where the numbers paint a gruesome story but it really is the combination of data crunching and field work that made this project amazingly impactful. We have to thank the unnamed journalists working and risking it in Bangladesh, a country where investigating the intelligence agencies and the law enforcement is extremely dangerous, for bringing this story to light. This effort is a sign of a future where cross border data journalism can protect reporters in unsafe environments while at the same time uncovering extremely important issues.",Body Count: Extrajudicial Executions in Bangladesh,13/11/2023,"Investigation, Database, Illustration, Chart, Map, Politics, Human rights","Animation, D3.js, JQuery, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap, OpenRefine, Scrollama","""Body Count: Extrajudicial Killings in Bangladesh"" is an in-depth investigative report by Netra News, analyzing over a decade of extrajudicial executions in Bangladesh since 2009. It documents 2,597 killings by security forces, revealing patterns of targeted violence, especially during election years. We built a sophisticated database searchable by name, location, and the security agency involved, such as police, army, and containing descriptions for each case. We used interactive maps to demonstrate, for example, disproportionate impact on opposition strongholds and Rohingya refugees who live in the country’s southern border area.","While the “Body Count” story did not lead to immediate, explicit changes in Bangladesh's highly censored political landscape, it complements a broader effort by Netra News and other organizations. Their collective reporting drew U.S. attention to certain security agencies' roles in human rights abuses. Notably, this advocacy influenced the Biden administration’s unprecedented 2021 decision to sanction officials from the Rapid Action Battalion, a move that has been widely credited with reducing such killings in the country.

Immediately after the story was published, Foreign Minister Abdul Momen warned that “journalists should not harm the country’s image just for accolades and awards.” 

Adil Sakhawat, a human rights defender with Human Rights Watch, privately provided the following testimony upon request: “In countries like Bangladesh, the very act of documentation is a giant leap towards ensuring justice. Therefore, the ‘Body Count’ story — a first-of-its-kind story in Bangladesh’s history — will advance the pursuit of accountability for extrajudicial killings in Bangladesh under the country’s authoritarian regime. It has laid the crucial groundwork for rights defenders and investigators to continue documenting the abuses. International actors can rely on the analyses to build the case for why the perpetrating security forces deserve serious censure.”","In recent years, Bangladesh has been termed a variant of autocracy, marked by dwindling press freedom and widespread self-censorship. The report in question was feasible only because its publisher, Netra News, operates from exile, and its reporter, Nazmul Ahasan, was abroad. Although blocked in Bangladesh, the website remains accessible through mirror sites powered by Google that authorities hesitate to block. Netra News’ team faces numerous legal challenges, including sedition and defamation.

The project faced significant resource constraints. Ahasan, a UC Berkeley graduate student, worked voluntarily, leveraging university resources for data processing. The dataset, provided by rights groups, was notably inconsistent and disorganized, requiring extensive effort for cleaning and verifying each report of extrajudicial killing.

“I don’t remember to have ever worked with a messier or more disorganized dataset than this,” Peter Aldhous, a professor at UC Berkeley at that time, said of the dataset.","A group of Bangladeshi human rights defenders tracked individual cases, leading to the Capital Punishment Justice Project compiling them into more than 100 different spreadsheets. These spreadsheets, not uniformly formatted, were refined using OpenRefine and manual efforts, and were combined into a dataframe using the R package called readxl.

For mapping, the tidyverse R library generated coordinates against sub-districts. We then retained coordinates with a high confidence level (98%-100%) and manually adjusted outliers. The data was visually depicted using hex grids on Bangladesh’s map, which we calculated using the R package called SF, with vertical bars indicating casualty counts in each region. We used OpenMapsTiles to visualize the map. 

Additionally, JavaScript libraries such as D3 and jQuery were utilized for creating charts and managing a table with over 2500 collapsible rows.","From the project, journalists can learn about the importance of meticulous data gathering, even from varied and inconsistent sources. The use of advanced data processing and visualization tools, such as OpenRefine, R libraries, and JavaScript, is crucial for presenting complex information in an accessible manner. Additionally, the project -- which continued for more than a year before being published -- exemplifies the need for perseverance in investigative journalism, especially in challenging environments where information is restricted or censored.",English,https://interactive.netra.news/extrajudicial-killings-bangladesh/,https://gijn.org/stories/editors-pick-top-10-data-journalism-projects-from-2023/,,,,,,"Nazmul Ahasan, Tasneem Khalil, Peter Aldhous, Soo Oh, Yoli Martinez, and five unnamed journalists and researchers based in Bangladesh.","Nazmul Ahasan is currently a reporter for Bloomberg News, but he tackled the project as a graduate student at UC Berkeley.

United States of America,Grist,Big,Winner,"In a beautifully presented, powerfully developed investigation, Grist reporters Naveena Sadasivan and Clayton Aldern told the story of a Koch-owned chemical plant along the Gulf Coast of Texas and how plant managers shut down certain kilns or turned down fans depending on which way the wind was blowing near an air monitor, artificially making it appear that the plant wasn’t dispersing toxic fumes above legal limits. This project, produced in collaboration with The Houston Chronicle and The Beaumont Enterprise, clearly laid out how the company took advantage of a loophole in the Clean Air Act, and let the community suffer from the facility’s toxic emissions. The reporters did a great job of blending data analysis with narrative and visual detail for a compelling and important story.",Grist_Any Way the Wind Blows,16/02/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Environment, Health","Adobe Creative Suite, R, We used R programming and a variety of statistical techniques—including temporal downsampling, random forests, and cross-validation—to build a model of organizational behavior. We also used R, Tableau, Adobe Illustrator, JS/HTML/CSS.","On the edge of Port Arthur, Texas, a majority Black and Hispanic community along the Gulf Coast, sits Oxbow Calcining. Owned by William “Bill” Koch, the facility purifies petcoke, a petroleum byproduct, and in the process emits more than double the sulfur dioxide of an average U.S. coal-fired power plant. Grist reporters got access to a trove of legal documents that laid out years of Oxbow’s internal operations. What they found was even worse than we expected: A corporation committed to exploiting a loophole in the Clean Air Act, and a community left to breathe in the toxic consequences.","For years, residents in Port Arthur have complained about the high levels of air pollution coming from the plant, but with no results. They often wake up to find their cars covered in a thin coat of yellow dust. And the asthma rate in the residential neighborhood surrounding the plant is 70 percent higher than the national average.

Tapping into more than 2.5 years of internal Oxbow operational data, Grist found clear evidence that Oxbow Calcining manipulated its operations, shutting down kilns to lower sulfur dioxide emissions, only when wind blew in the direction of fence line air monitors. The activity created a false profile of Oxbow’s pollution levels, allowing the company to avoid penalty and to pump vast amounts of sulfur dioxide, which can increase the risk of strokes, asthma, and hospitalization, into a neighborhood that is 90 percent Black.

When Grist senior staff writer Naveena Sadasivam and senior data reporter Clay Aldern presented their findings to a former EPA enforcement official, that expert became convinced they had uncovered a clear ""criminal violation of the Clean Air Act."" The EPA has promised to follow up on their findings.","Beyond the rigorous data analysis and reporting, this piece also enabled Grist to pursue comprehensive community engagement. We partnered with the Houston Chronicle and the Beaumont Enterprise, the closest paper to Port Arthur, cutting down our 6,000-word investigation into a 1,500-word version that appeared on the front page of their Sunday papers. 
We also designed and sent postcards to every household and business in the same zip code as the plant, alerting them to the reporting and giving them an avenue to get in touch with any questions or story tips. We were able to place the feature in a 9-minute segment on NPR’s Here and Now. Finally, we hosted a virtual town hall event in late May, bringing together residents, activists, and legal advocates to discuss the community’s path forward in light of Grist’s findings.","Our data analysis relied on underutilized public records from previous legal proceedings. To build a statistical model of Oxbow’s kiln operations, we filed FOIA requests, extracted and cleaned data from the resulting PDFs, and scraped meteorological information from a nearby weather station. Our final dataset included wind speed, wind direction, sulfur dioxide readings from the closest air monitor, and time-locked organizational behavior (i.e. indications of which kilns were on and off at the petcoke plant) at a 5-minute resolution. Using the R programming language and a variety of statistical techniques — including temporal downsampling, random forests, and cross-validation — we were able to build a model of organizational behavior that performed much better than chance.

In doing so, we were able to demonstrate a big effect of southerly winds, higher wind speeds, and the derivative of wind direction on the probability of Oxbow’s kilns being off. Accordingly — and via additional statistical tests and visualizations — we were able to argue that the relationship in question was causal: namely, that operators were modifying the plant’s behavior when the wind was blowing in the direction of the air monitor. We visualized our data using R, Tableau, Adobe Illustrator, and JS/HTML/CSS.","In analyzing large datasets from diverse sources using advanced statistical models, we demonstrated how detailed, data-centric investigations can reveal critical insights into environmental compliance and pollution. Our approach of integrating machine learning techniques with on-the-ground and public-records reporting serves as a blueprint for journalists aiming to investigate local environmental issues with global relevance. Furthermore, our commitment to transparency, by sharing our methodology and data publicly, encourages collaborative and reproducible journalism.

United Kingdom,The Financial Times,Big,Winner,"It's not a secret that the Chinese government detained hundreds of thousands of Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang. The Financial Times was able to find an innovative way to showcase an even broader suppression of Islamic culture in China. The team behind ""How China is tearing down Islam"" built a database of 4,450 buildings and manually reviewed each one of them for accuracy. Many reporters based in China pursued this story at great personal risk. This investigation is the first to document the scale and the spread of the Chinese government's policy to remove Arabic-style features from the street. This entry successfully combined photos, videos, data visualization and coherence page design to tell a powerful story.",How China is tearing down Islam,27/11/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, OSINT, Satellite images, Culture, Human rights","Drone, Scraping, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Node.js","China’s oppression of Ugyhur Muslims has been widely documented in Xinjiang. But the government is increasingly restricting Islam across the country, altering or destroying mosques in a bid to reduce the visible presence of religion in public.

The FT examined thousands of mosques using satellite images, finding nearly three-quarters of those with Arabic features have been altered since 2018. The investigation — the first to document the scale of China’s policy — found renovations and demolitions in nearly every province. On-the-ground reporting corroborated this analysis, with FT journalists speaking to communities across the country who are feeling the pressure of Beijing’s crackdown.","The project was a hit with FT readers (one of our most-read visual investigations of the year) and was widely shared: among Chinese-language communities, by human rights groups, and on BBC Radio 4.

While earlier reports have documented specific cases or regional examples of religious repression in China, this is the first time anyone has comprehensively measured its scale. The project documents how these isolated incidents actually underpin a troubling trend — and the importance of paying attention to the infringement of religious freedoms of far more Chinese Muslims than were previously known. The story is an important piece of analysis and helps frame how researchers, scholars and NGOs should approach the subject of religion in XI's China.","This project involved significant behind-the-scenes technical work to identify locations where we might find mosques, count those with Islamic architecture, and look for changes to the buildings over time. The published story is only the tip of the iceberg of reporting and analysis that went into it.

The story required a painstaking manual review of the architecture of 4,450 buildings. We had to guarantee the accuracy of every mosque we counted, a process which involved hundreds of hours of human labelling aided by multiple custom-built tools.

We also didn’t want individual stories to get lost in the data. The FT sent our reporters to visit mosques, speak with community members, and understand how this policy was felt on the ground. We also sent photographers to capture details of the modifications with drone and handheld cameras, helping readers see the changes more clearly for themselves. As with most journalists in China, our in-country staff pursued this story at great personal risk: from past statements and conduct, the government has made clear that it does not want the media covering this policy.","We built an initial dataset of 4,450 potential mosques across China by scraping search results from Baidu Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Google Maps — creating a more accurate and up-to-date list than the official Chinese census. Next, we built a tool to collect satellite imagery for each of these mosques from Google Earth and Planet Labs, aiming to collect a series of images capturing each building at different points in time.

We explored using a machine learning model to classify the architectural styles and/or destruction of each mosque, but concluded any model would have an unacceptable error rate — even if its accuracy was a best-in-class 95%. Instead, we built a labelling tool with a user interface that allowed FT staff to carefully inspect each site over time, spreading the work across a number of reporters and cross-validating their findings.

In total, we identified 2,312 mosques with Islamic architecture. Of these, 1,714 (74.3 per cent) had Arabic-style features removed between 2018 and 2023. Examples of renovations to mosques small and large were found in every region, and in both rural and urban areas.","The project illustrates the importance of human judgement in computational journalism: even when technical tools like AI models can work faster than people, there are many cases where the accuracy of manual data collection is irreplaceable. Instead of racing to implement (often error-prone) machine learning, newsrooms should aim to build tooling that speeds up human workflows but defers to their judgement. We could not have collected this national dataset by manually looking up each mosque by hand — but the combination of data scraping, image collection, and a well-designed labelling interface made it possible to work at greater scale without tradeoffs in accuracy.

The design of this project also demonstrates how good storytelling works at both macro and micro levels: the story is more impactful because it highlights the voices of individuals and communities affected by the policy it documents. Many good data stories can offer a 10,000 foot view, but the truly great ones help readers both see the big picture and imagine themselves in the shoes of the people involved.",English,https://ig.ft.com/china-mosques/,,,,,,,"By Peter Andringa, Irene de la Torre Arenas, Max Harlow, Sam Joiner, Joe Leahy, Lucy Rodgers, Eva Xiao, Yuan Yang, and Sun Yu.

United States of America,Bloomberg News,Big,Winner,"The work helps shine a light on the importance of generative AI bias through smart visualization of the issues, and a clear statement of the methology and results, helping the public better understand the issues.  It also highlighted the need to audit new AI systems effectively.",HUMANS ARE BIASED. GENERATIVE AI IS EVEN WORSE,09/06/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form","Animation, AI/Machine learning, Python","Bloomberg conducted a months-long data investigation that found Stable Diffusion—one of the most widely used AI image generators—exacerbates racial and gender stereotypes. We prompted the text-to-image model to create more than 5,000 images of workers with various jobs, as well as people associated with crime, and compared the results with US government data on race and gender. The analysis revealed that not only does the AI model replicate real-world stereotypes—it amplifies them. Through data visualizations and AI-generated photographs, the story explored how these systemic biases in generative AI have the frightening potential to exacerbate real-world inequalities.","This story has been cited and shared extensively – by other media organizations, on social media, and by academic researchers, institutions and governing bodies as important analysis to consider when developing AI safeguards. It spurred serious discussion among AI leaders, catching the attention of Stability AI’s CEO and many other key players in the world of tech, international policy, and AI ethics, like Dr. Buolamwini. 

One startup began developing a generative AI model trained specifically to address racial bias – its founders said our story underscored the need for their approach. Companies like IBM have cited our story in their bias guides. It’s also been cited in reference to AI-policy recommendations for the city of Boston, as well as in official documents about AI risk from the UK government, international bodies such as the United Nations and IMF, and NGOs like Amnesty International. Nicoletti was invited to present findings at the UN HeForShe Summit and the ChangeNOW Summit. The story was cited by several academic research papers and used as a main reference for AI-best practices at dozens of institutions like MIT and University of Toronto. The story was followed by other outlets including the Washington Post and Rest of The World.","Generating thousands of images with a diffusion model can be very expensive if run in the cloud through a third party. As such, we ran Stable Diffusion locally, which is very computationally expensive. To generate our dataset, we ran our script for several weeks.

Another challenge was to make sure that the analysis itself would be as free from bias as possible. Measuring gender and racial bias in images is difficult: before any analysis can be conducted, each image must be labeled with a gender and a skin tone — pinpointing race from an image alone is impossible. With images of real people, this task would be time consuming but straightforward, assuming we could speak to each individual depicted and ask about their identity. The fact that our images were AI-generated added even more complexity – if the subject of an image is not real, how can we accurately label their perceived gender and race? This concern led us to extensive consultations with leading academics, lawyers, and AI ethics experts for a review of the methodology, the use of cutting-edge computer vision techniques, and to the eventual manual review of all 5,100 images by Bloomberg reporters.","Bloomberg’s methods for this experiment were inspired by the groundbreaking work of Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru on the research paper Gender Shades. 

Data collection: Bloomberg used Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Python to generate 5,100 images.

Gender labeling: Given the well-documented inaccuracies of gender classification models, a team of eight reporters reviewed and labeled every image according to the perceived gender of the subject pictured. 

Skin-tone classification: Using Python and the YCbCr algorithm, each image was cropped to the subject’s face and classified which pixels represented skin. Using the average Red Green Blue (RGB) value of skin-pixels, we calculated the Individual Typology Angle (ITA), a statistical dermatology value that relates inversely with the melanin index. ITA was mapped to one of the six Fitzpatrick skin types using an equation developed by Bino and Bernerd. The average skin color was converted from RGB to grayscale to calculate the overall lightness or darkness value on a scale of 0-255.

Average faces: All 300 images generated for a given category were combined using Facer, an open-source Python package.

Homelessness: How LA’s Scoring System for Subsidized Housing Gives Black and Latino People Experiencing Homelessness Lower Priority Scores,28/02/2023,"Investigation, Infographics, Chart, Human rights","CSV, Python, We used the popular Python data analysis library pandas to run several statistical tests.","A Markup investigation, also published by the Los Angeles Times, confirmed what advocates for the unhoused had long suspected: For years, the scoring system for allocating housing on the basis of vulnerability rated unhoused Black people as less vulnerable than White people and, as a result, deprioritized their candidacy for permanent housing. 

The Markup was the first organization to obtain breakdowns of more than 130,000 “vulnerability” scores assigned to unhoused people in LA, going back to 2016. Our data analysis found a persistent discrepancy in scores between Black and White people experiencing homelessness.","Our article helped lift the deliberate veil of secrecy around this scoring tool, making public the questions asked and the scoring system itself—previously, case workers were specifically instructed not to tell unhoused people they were being scored.

Our published stories included tips for how unhoused people could get re-scored and what criteria case managers consider when deciding whether to re-score someone. We also partnered with the Los Angeles Times to help ensure wide distribution in the communities that care about and are impacted by the scoring system.

After publication, sources told us that specifically because of our reporting, Los Angeles city regulators are making progress on a way to address the problem.","For years, people have known that the scoring system used in Los Angeles to decide who receives subsidized housing likely had troubling racial disparities. But the evidence remained largely anecdotal. 

In August 2021, a Markup reporter in New York, Colin Lecher set out to change that and sent his first public records request to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA), asking what scores people received, what help they ultimately received (if any), and whether race played a factor in how people were scored and got help. 

Over the next 18 months, Colin teamed up with Markup data reporter Maddy Varner, and after more than a year of back and forth with the authority, became the first to obtain 130,000 scoring surveys going back to 2016. 

The resulting investigation confirmed that the system had for years rated unhoused Black people as less vulnerable than White people, giving them lower priority for permanent housing. 

In discussions with the Los Angeles Times, their lead homelessness reporter said that this was a story that they had been wanting to do for years, and the Times ran Colin and Maddy’s story on the front page of the paper.","A substantial portion of the data work on this project involved persistently seeking information from LAHSA (Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority). It took several months of back-and-forth with the agency to identify which of LAHSA’s databases held the relevant data, and several more months to figure out the actual definition of the data’s labels and categories.
 
The data we used came from vulnerability assessments of people experiencing homelessness. We sorted individuals into one of three groups based on their score (also categorized as “low,” “mid,” “high”) as the agency does. We then analyzed what percentage of White, Black, and Latino adults were categorized in the high vulnerability group.

To determine if the differences in those percentages were statistically significant, we ran a chi-square analysis of vulnerability groups by race. To check whether these disparities might be explained by other variables in the dataset, we performed a series of logistic and linear regressions. We also conducted a linear regression with the total vulnerability score as the dependent variable as well as a logistic regression in which the dependent variable was whether someone’s score put them in the high acuity group. For full details, see “How We Investigated L.A.’s Homelessness Scoring System.”","1. Find as much documentation as possible

Although the data we were looking for wasn’t publicly available, we found blank surveys on the website of the relevant government agency, which gave us details to ask for when we crafted our public records request.

2. After putting in a request, don’t fear the follow‑up

When we first started reporting, we filed a simple data request that asked for a fraction of the data that we ultimately ended up using in our analysis. The more we reported, the more detailed our questions—and requests—became. By the end of our investigation, we followed up to ask for more records at least a half-dozen times, either formally or informally

3. When in doubt, ask the people who use the data every day

We spoke with people who interacted with the scoring system at the center of our story: case managers who administered the surveys, matchers who used the results to determine housing placements, and the people who were surveyed themselves. They all helped answer our questions about the data, since they were experts in its nuances and shortcomings.

United States of America,"Streetsblog NYC, The New Jersey Monitor, Motherboard",Small,Winner,"Ghost Tags has many reasons to be on the list of best journalistic productions of 2023. The first and most important reason is: it is excellent material, far above the average standard of daily productions. The social relevance is notorious: deaths (or were they murders?) occurred because of this legal loophole, which only became public - in a robust way - through consistent work.

The state structure was neither prepared nor capable of containing this scandal, revealed by professional journalism, which allowed shady deals to be carried out and people to get rich by committing a crime - which ended up being punished mildly, with low fines.

The text is objective, incisive, direct. One particularity stands out: the investigation in classic/conventional ways, with an emphasis on interviews and sources. And this excellent work comes from a vehicle that competes, in terms of quality, with large press companies.",Ghost Tags: Inside New York City’s Black Market for Temporary License Plates,03/04/2023,"Investigation, Database","Microsoft Excel, CSV","This seven-month, data-driven investigation exposed a widespread scheme in which New Yorkers exploited weak regulations in other U.S. states to open sham car dealerships, access government systems for producing temporary license plates, and sell large numbers of those tags illegally in New York City.

Streetsblog NYC, a small nonprofit newsroom, showed how motorists relied on these fraudulent license plates for anonymity while dodging tolls, driving without insurance, and committing more serious crimes. So-called temp tags have been used in shootings, robberies, and hit-and-runs.

Streetsblog further revealed the failure of regulators to stop the illicit trade in these government documents.","The impact of this reporting has been substantial. In New Jersey, legislators unanimously passed a bill to reform the state’s temp tag system, and policymakers unveiled a regulatory overhaul that could shutter dealer compounds identified by Coburn as illegal temp tag mills. Lawmakers in New York City and Georgia also proposed new laws on the issue in the wake of Coburn’s reporting. Auditors shut down dozens of dealerships for temp tag fraud, including some that were highlighted in the series. Other alleged temp tag sellers uncovered by Streetsblog are under criminal investigation.","Dubious paper license plates from far-flung states became ubiquitous in New York City during the pandemic. But, outside of Texas, there had been little substantial reporting of the issue prior to Streetsblog's investigation. No news outlets in New York had figured out who was producing all these paper tags or how they were getting away with it.

To answer these questions, Streetsblog analyzed four years of data on 10,000 car dealerships and combed through 1,000 pages of motor vehicle agency records obtained through public records requests. Streetsblog also interviewed more than fifty people, securing on-the-record accounts from temp tag sellers and buyers who admitted to their crimes.

Streetsblog faced significant resistance to this reporting. Our reporter was barred from a major dealer compound, faced intimidation and legal threats from dubious car sellers, and encountered a wall of silence from industry regulators. Our newsroom has just four reporters and two editors. Overcoming these obstacles and publishing this series is the most significant project we have ever undertaken.","Streetsblog submitted nearly 50 public records requests to obtain data and records on temporary license plates issued by car dealerships in New Jersey and Georgia, two states whose temp tags were especially prevalent in New York City.

Streetsblog used Microsoft Excel to build multiple databases based on that data and those records. The databases contained:
* the temporary license plates issued by every used car dealer since 2019 in New Jersey and Georgia.
* every car dealership in New Jersey and Georgia that had been caught fraudulently issuing temporary license plates since 2020
* the car dealership and temporary tag regulations in five states: New Jersey, Georgia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut
* the basic temporary tag regulations in 41 U.S. states (nine states did not respond to Streetsblog inquiries)

This data analysis became the foundation of the series by revealing its main findings. First, no-name car dealerships were issuing thousands, even tens of thousands, of temp tags each year while conducting no other discernible business activity. Second, while some of those dealers were getting caught fraudulently issuing tags, the fines they face were small compared to the large sums to be made selling tags illegally.","This project sheds light on the useful public data and records maintained by motor vehicle agencies, which could serve as the basis for many more journalistic projects. It also provides insight into the techniques that reckless motorists use to evade accountability on the road -- a problem that is likely to become only more prevalent as more and more cities around the world adopt automated traffic enforcement tools.",English,https://www.streetsblogprojects.org/ghost-tags-index,,,,,,,"Reporting and writing: Jesse Coburn,

In summary, it’s a rich multimedia experience.",The year of the Shahed,17/09/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Audio, Politics, Human rights","Animation, Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap","In the first year of their usage in Ukraine, nearly 2,000 Shahed drones were launched into Ukrainian territory by Russian forces, according to data-focussed investigation by Airwars. Using open source, traditional and visual journalistic methods, it showed how Russia turned a cheap Iranian suicide drone into a vital component of its war.

By tracking every reported Shahed launch over 12 months, Airwars' investigation - in partnership with Der Spiegel - illustrated that while the Shahed first emerged as part of the Russian arsenal a year ago, the tempo and intensity of attacks across Ukraine escalated significantly during 2023.","The impact of this article was significant in the short term, and we believe that there are ongoing projects which this investigation will contribute towards. This article reached a wide audience online – the accompanying publication with Der Spiegel was the most read on their website for that entire weekend. It was retweeted and shared widely on Twitter / X, with several prominent drone experts and commentators praising its findings. It was also re-published, in a different format, with Dagbladet Information, the daily Danish publication. 

Sanjana Varghese presented the findings at the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights on a panel discussing the development of a new human right: safety from above. We have also worked with a group of lawyers seeking to pursue various civil and criminal litigation routes to hold Iranian manufacturers to account for their role in the war in Ukraine. This has involved providing the underlying data and trends analysis for our public reporting to lawyers intending to file a case in the United States in early 2025. A number of academics have also reached out to gain access to the data for their research.",N/A,"The investigation utilised open source tools, such as geolocation on Google Earth Pro and flight and ship tracking, to find and corroborate information. Through producing a unique dataset, we developed a unique way to measure the impact of the Shaheds, which had attracted significant media attention since it was first used due to its Iranian origin. We also corroborated this with native-language reporting and incorporated audio into the article, centering civilians' personal experiences of how the Shaheds impact daily life.

We also used specially-created animations, as well as satellite imagery, to demonstrate where these Shaheds were being launched from and where their component parts originated. We monitored flight tracking and ship tracking software to correlate potential weapons deliveries with dates of launches / usage, as a method of corroboration. Through a combination of open-source reporting, interviews with Ukrainians, trade data and in-depth analysis, we produced an original investigation with a human element.","We believe that there are several methods used in this project which could be replicated to great effect in other newsrooms. This article used innovative, open source reporting methods to investigate the pervasive use of a particular weapon to terrorise Ukrainian civilians. The format of the article, as an immersive multi-media feature, brought readers into understanding this now ubiquitous weapon in a completely novel, experiential fashion. For example, we used information gathered via open source methods to produce a novel dataset, taking a step back from daily news coverage of the Shahed to provide a larger picture. We also spoke to citizens on the ground in Ukraine using voice notes, and incorporated their actual voices into the article, rather than just as text. This helped ensure that a data-focussed story felt human and had the desired powerful effect on the reader.
This investigation helped us demonstrate how to marry traditional reporting skills, such as incorporating human and expert voices, with open source intelligence, to demonstrate how innovation around these tools within a newsroom can actually enhance traditional journalistic practices, not overpower them.","English, German,",https://airwars.org/investigation/shahed-year-russia-ukraine-iran/,https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/russland-setzt-auf-iranische-kamikazedrohnen-im-ukraine-krieg-ein-jahr-drohnenterror-a-05333ab2-4705-407f-8a4e-10b7f12ec257,https://airwars.org/investigations/the-new-russian-drone-linked-to-iran-backed-factory/,,,,,"Sanjana Varghese, Nikolaj Houmann Mortensen, Julia Nueno, Azul de Monte, Joe Dyke, Rowena de Silva (Airwars)

Netherlands,"Lighthouse Reports, WIRED, Vers Beton, OpenRotterdam",Big,Winner,"In “Inside the Suspicion Machine,” Lighthouse Reports, WIRED, Vers Beton and Open Rotterdam gained rare access to the algorithms used to choose subjects for welfare fraud investigations. After nearly one and a half years of negotiation, the reporters obtained the underlying computer code used to flag Rotterdam’s residents, which could cut them off from services and even target them for raids. By studying and testing the risk scoring algorithm, they learned that it did only marginally better than random chance, and targeted people based on their native language, gender and even how they dressed. From there, the reporters followed two archetypes, as typified by more than 300 characteristics, to show audiences the arbitrary, and at times prejudiced, logic of the system.",Inside the Suspicion Machine,06/03/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","Suspicion Machines is a four-part series co-published by Lighthouse Reports, WIRED and Rotterdam metro paper Vers Beton. The series unpacks the disturbing scale of automated decision making systems across Europe. The centrepiece of the series, Inside the Suspicion Machine, investigates a machine learning model deployed by Rotterdam to predict which welfare recipients are committing fraud. The story is based on a rigorous statistical analysis we conducted after obtaining unprecedented access to the system’s code and training data. Our investigation revealed that the algorithm is biassed against the young, women, single parents and non-native Dutch speakers, and does not work.","After publication, Rotterdam halted plans to replace the system, which was currently under review, and city council members questioned the mayor. In June 2023, the Dutch Data Protection Authority opened an investigation into the city. 

The investigation was noticed by key figures involved in the European Union’s AI Act, landmark legislation meant to reign in high risk AI technology. Kim van Sparrentak, one of the rapporteurs for the AI sent, sent questions based on our investigation asking how the Act could implement provisions that would prevent Rotterdam-like situations.

The investigation made the case that journalists should redouble efforts to scrutinise black box algorithms deployed by governments. The Markup described the level of access we obtained as a “small miracle.” Algorithm Watch’s Nicholas Keyser Brill described it as“a new milestone in algorithmic accountability reporting” after ProPublica’s landmark Machine Bias investigation that “sets a new professional standard for audits of black-box systems by third-parties.” 

After publication agencies across Europe have decided to share the underlying code of similar systems. We have teamed up with European newsrooms to investigate systems in their own countries, which so far has resulted in major investigations with Le Monde in France and El Confidencial in Spain.","Journalists have struggled to obtain access to the underlying code and data that power predictive machine learning algorithms like the one deployed in Rotterdam. After filing requests in dozens of countries and two years of negotiations, our team was able to use freedom-of-information laws to obtain unprecedented access to the source code, machine learning model and training data of Rotterdam’s algorithm. But this presented an enormous challenge, because journalists had never gained such complete access to be able to audit a public algorithm — we needed to design a methodology from scratch. 

It was important to us that our results were reproducible and our methodology was bulletproof. We convened an eight-person academic panel that reviewed first our experimental design and then our and our results and complete methodology. The panel included experts from the social sciences, computer science, law, and public policy. It also included Jeff Larson, the data journalist behind ProPublica’s landmark Machine Bias investigation. Each expert provided feedback on methods and framing that were incorporated into each step of the experiment.","A unique characteristic of Rotterdam’s machine learning model is that it’s highly non-linear. Variables are not given a single, static ‘weight’ that adds or subtracts from the score. Rather, each variable’s (ie. gender) effect on the scores is dependent on an individual’s unique composition of traits. In other words, variables affect an individual's risk scores in dramatically different ways. 

We wanted to make sure we conducted both controlled and uncontrolled statistical tests. Creating a controlled experiment for a non-linear model proved particularly challenging and there was no journalistic reference point we could look to. We ultimately designed a test that made identical copies of the training data, changed one variable, and then calculated a new risk score for each individual. For gender, for example, we made one copy of the training data with everyone set to female and another with everyone set to male. We then compared scores to determine the average impact of variables. 

Finally, we tested the interaction of multiple variables, allowing us to see how vulnerabilities intersected in ‘profiles’, like single migrant mothers. 

We also analysed the representativeness of the training data and the system’s performance. We produced a fully anonymized synthetic training dataset to ensure reproducibility.","It was a top priority for us that readers know not only what we found, but also understand how we found it. We believe that the public has a vital role to play in algorithmic accountability, but can only fulfil this role if they understand how systems work. The interactive design and use of two archetypes’ journey through the system is designed to educate the public in the choices made when choosing inputs, the vital role of robust training data, the ways complex models obfuscate and legitimise discriminatory technology and the ways that discrimination manifests at scale.

To achieve this, we dedicated a large amount of time and resources to putting together a team that could produce a human-centred narratives, a visual and editorial explainer, and accessible materials to empower other journalists to take on more of this reporting. We needed to build a multidisciplinary team with community trust, which is why we brought together a global media brand, WIRED, with a local newsroom, Vers Beton.

Brazil,[InfoAmazonia](https://infoamazonia.org/sobre),Small,Shortlist,,"Despite lawsuit, Casino Group still sells beef from an Amazonian Indigenous land",16/01/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Chart, Map, Environment, Human rights","Scraping, QGIS, Python, Microsoft Power BI","The report found that the French Casino Guichard-Perrachon continued purchasing meat from cattle raised on Brazilian indigenous lands for their stores, despite a complaint under France's so-called Vigilance Law. This law mandates large companies to prevent serious human rights, health, safety, and environmental violations by their subsidiaries and contractors. Analysis of 500,000 cattle movements from two JBS slaughterhouses supplying Casino supermarkets revealed meat from illegal farms within the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous Land. JBS admitted to the illegalities and suspended these suppliers. Cattle ranching in this region has led to violence and risks the extinction of isolated indigenous groups.","This report was republished by more than 20 organizations in Portuguese and English and prompted debates about the invasion of indigenous territory by cattle ranches. The report's evidence and JBS's confession that animals raised in the protected territory ended up in the Casino Group's stores discount the arguments of the French group, which has informed the French courts that it maintains strict monitoring of its suppliers. 

The report was also cited by different organizations, such as Mighty Earth and Rainforest-Action-Network, in complaints calling for the cancellation of JBS's IPO on the NYSE, pointing out that the meatpacker's activities are related to human rights violations and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.

Following the publication of the report, the Coordination of Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB) said it will take the evidence to the French courts to prove that the Casino group violated its country's laws by buying JBS cattle from illegal ranches,","The Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous Land has been one of the hardest hit by the huge global demand for meat. The invasions of the Indigenous Land to supply large meatpacking plants, as we have shown, have the strong support of local politicians who have been pressuring the indigenous people for years. In 2020, indigenous leader Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau was murdered. Although the indigenous people linked the case to the invading farms, the Federal Police ruled out a link between the crime and cattle ranching. The indigenous people continue to be threatened and surrounded by invaders with the support of local politicians and businessmen.

The evidence for this report was only possible after we managed to structure the data on animal movements, which is hidden by both the companies and the Brazilian government [which owns 25% of JBS shares](https://infoamazonia.org/2023/05/24/principal-acionista-da-jbs-bndes-ignora-desmatamento-na-producao-de-carne-enquanto-pune-produtores-menores/).

The data work required a lot of technique to sort out who bought from whom until we were able to prove that the ranches inside the indigenous land sold to direct suppliers. JBS only confirmed the illegalities after we showed them all the evidence.

During the investigation of this report, JBS tried its best to hinder our work, questioning the veracity of the information.","The key information for this investigation was the data from the [Rural Environmental Registry (CAR)](https://www.car.gov.br/publico/imoveis/index) provided by the producers at the time the animals were transported. With the CAR data marked on the animal transportation documents (GTAs), I was able to georeference each movement and find out from which farm the animals left. 

For this work [we used the Python and applied the Pandas library](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ly85k2kcJk-QNAonTwNQbEsXXgAnyjgw#scrollTo=feo-luVJjxbM) to organize the data and [reassemble the supply chain](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/REkvFfmLM5v9j2qP1cUuLp_yc21UGRU-haF1oShOjC52xo10pIw3YrErenhof3TEkQBMLQrFGSO52i_9I7TipUSbebf9x3fVfIG8Igm7Fsm52jKeeHQgUwP80Tlh3Hj2qMG7X6j45dIkhnmbpaALR5A) of the farms, linking who JBS bought from and who JBS's supplier bought from, and so on.

After structuring the data, we put together a PowerBI, which is also available on our [transparency](https://infoamazonia.org/2023/06/29/como-investigamos-a-cadeia-de-fornecimento-do-grupo-casino/) page (in Portuguese), so that readers could see how the information was structured. This database brings together 500,000 cattle movements and is a rich source of new research, since we only focused on ranches on indigenous land. It is possible to identify ranches in other protected areas on this database (which could generate new reports).

For the geospatial analysis [we used the QGis tool](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/noKk2QuNjdAnRtKHdXADNZMv8RklJeRG-xnDQk1KXa9tzmw_Xm02Xuu1kEsdoHzhNUIXQKRS059ihUublcTvN1ZvqZaOsorloiKiz4SIlBKmeuDouljqxkR80Q70mpeYxhhsJB7Kasbkxar4UBIqE3g), with the data from the CARs identified and overlaid on the indigenous land, and cross-referenced with information on deforestation and environmental embargoes, to broaden the context of each property.","Este trabalho mostra como o jornalismo investgativo guiado por dados pode se valer de diferentes técnicas para a construção de uma narrativa.

* Adobe Acrobat Pro","Through detailed analysis of electoral data and in depth interviews with stakeholders, this two-part project uses the detailed results of Malaysia’s 15th general election to examine the growing influence of an Islamist-conservative political coalition at the polls. 

It not only dissects the election results down to each polling station, but also allows users to analyse the results of their own local areas, review the data by voter demographics and predict the outcome of the upcoming state elections, giving them access to the data at a level never before possible.","The series generated more than 240,000 views. They also have high engagement rates, with readers spending about five minutes on the page.
 
Two forums in two states were held to discuss the projects and it attracted a full house audience of about 100 participants each, not including live stream audience. We were also invited to speak on multiple TV and radio programmes following the publication, or contacted by other newsrooms to collaborate for future elections.

In our view, the biggest impact has been the democratisation of electoral data. The data cost almost double the median salary in Malaysia, and for the first time, the public could access it for free (in Bahasa Malaysia) or for a small fee of RM60 (USD12.90) for three months access (in English and Chinese). Since publication, many have shared their own analysis of electoral data on social media, using our project.

In a media interview, an electoral watchdog cited the project and said it showed the value of each vote. He noted that since many seats were marginally won, our widget showed how election results can change completely if as little as 10% of voters stayed home.","While it is public data, the only way to access the election results down to each polling station is by purchasing the data from the Election Commission. The Kini News Lab paid RM4,426 (US$951) for the dataset. This is close to double the median wage of formal workers in Malaysia, and is therefore inaccessible to most Malaysians and Malaysian newsrooms. 

Despite the hefty price, the data did not come in a form which is easily used for analysis. As such, we had to spend more time and funds converting the data. 

We were also operating without a UI/UX designer, so faced the challenge of converting the complex data into something easily used by people who are not ‘election nerds’.

The investment was, however, worthwhile for Malaysiakini because the analysis would provide tremendous insight into what might be the outcome of the then-upcoming six state elections. 

Further, the insights were important because the 15th general election resulted in a hung parliament, and the subsequent government was formed through political negotiations. Understanding the likely trend which led to this, and seeing if this trend is likely to persist, gives deeper understanding into the political instability which lies ahead.","We utilise Adobe Acrobat Pro to convert more than 2200 pages of PDF files to Excel as Tabula, Microsoft Excel, and Camelot led to duplicated entries. We also used Python to clean and convert the data.

For building the webpage, we employ React Nextjs and the Tailwind framework, along with various libraries like Mapbox, Highcharts, and react-scrollama.

We used JavaScript to develop a simulation calculator enabling users to predict election results by manipulating turnout and voting preferences.

A challenge we faced involved dealing with a large map file. To address this, we simplified the geojson file using mapshaper. To ensure smooth loading, especially on mobile devices, we merged all election data with the geojson, compressed it using tippecanoe, converted it into a tileset, and uploaded it to Mapbox.

Additionally, we integrated a temporary geocoding API from Mapbox, allowing users to search for their location and access election results at the polling district level.","One of the biggest obstacles of procuring data in Malaysia is the cost. This project taught us that for some projects, the investment is worthwhile.

As we had made a significant investment to purchase and analyse the data, we felt the urgent need to make sure the project has a greater reach outside the traditional Malaysiakini audience. As such, we invested in organising public forums, as well as allocated time to do media interviews on radio and television. We also leveraged on our networks to pitch to other media, to alert them of what we’re doing and that we are open to being interviewed on air about our work. 

As we did not have additional funding to ‘market’ the project, we also started curating a Whatsapp mailing list and recruited the help of the entire newsroom to share the link to influential individuals like politicians and civil society members, who we feel would be interested in this topic, and would likely share with their peers. As a result, we managed to recoup the expenses paid through new subscriptions, and grew our audience base. 

Since this project, we have tried to employ all these learnings on subsequent projects to considerable success.","Bahasa Malaysia, English, Chinese",https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/greenwave-state-polls/en/,https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/greenwave-generational-gap/en,https://www.bfm.my/podcast/evening-edition/inside-story/understanding-state-election-predictions-and-why-every-vote-counts,https://en.syok.my/podcast/episode/103738,,,,"Andrew Ong, Aidila Razak, Ooi Choon Nam, Hariz Mohd, Emylia Rosli, Pia Ernadya, Raveena Nagotra, Syariman Badrulzaman, Noor Rahmat Shah Haron, Mahen Manickam, Lee Weng Keat and Tan Hong Kai.","The Kini News Lab is a team specialising in data journalism and visual storytelling.

United Kingdom,"The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, The Guardian, Le Monde",Big,Shortlist,,The Bruno and Dom Project: More than 800 million trees felled to meet Amazon beef demand,02/06/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Infographics, Map, Environment",We used official satellite monitoring programmes (Prodes and Deter),"To continue the work of the murdered Indigenous Peoples activist Bruno Pereira and British Journalist Dom Phillips, The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) produced new figures for Amazon deforestation linked to foreign beef demand. It was our contribution to Forbidden Stories’ Bruno &amp; Dom Project, published on the anniversary of their deaths. 


We calculated that at least 800,000,000 million trees in the Amazon’s top beef producing states were lost between 2017-2022. Centering on abattoirs owned by Brazil’s ‘big three’ meatpackers that shipped internationally in the period, the investigation tangibly and originally linked Amazon deforestation to foreign consumption of beef.","The Guardian launched the Bruno and Dom project with a front page splash that trailed our beef investigation, raising the visibility of the specific threats to the Amazon and those reporting on them. As well as reaching hundreds of millions of readers across participating media, shortly afterwards and referencing the project, opposition MP Tanmanjeet Dhesi told the UK parliament: “it is important that while we protect our environment and the people, we also prevent those excellent environmental activists, journalists and indigenous activists who are fighting the good fight— not just on their own behalf, but on behalf of all of us—from coming to harm.” 


Members of the European Parliament, inducing those working on proposed supply chain due diligence legislation, were also alerted to our investigation and told us of its importance and leading environmental NGO Mighty Earth said it was a “Really impressive piece, that seems to have really resonated globally”. 


We also shared the data we commissioned with journalists in other countries, allowing them to link deforestation to their own domestic markets. Le Monde and Der Spiegel were among those to produce country-specific investigations based on our dataset.","President Jair Bolsonaro (2017-2022) cut funding for Brazil’s environmental protection agencies and publicly questioned satellite deforestation monitoring programmes. Under his presidency, which largely enjoyed the backing of agribusiness, forest loss and threats to Indigenous Amazon communities surged, as did the intimidation and the persecution of journalists, brought home chillingly by the murders of Bruno and Dom. But killing the journalist won’t kill the story, as is Forbidden Stories’ guiding statement. 


In this context, and with the government introducing restrictions on access to information that enables researchers to map Brazil’s beef supply chains, we shed new light on the specific threat of deforestation posed by cattle ranching – the number one driver of forest loss – in states both had spiked. 


Our research used widely accepted methods for calculating deforestation risk and was rigorous. But that didn’t stop the big meatpackers trying to delay and derail the story by questioning our methods.","We used official satellite monitoring programmes (Prodes and Deter) to calculate deforestation in the areas of top beef producing states that lie within the Amazon biome. We then plotted abattoirs owned by JBS, Marfrig and Minerva that were known to export internationally (using shipping data) to calculate the deforestation on farms within their “buying zones” the area (in square kilometres) within which the companies could reasonably be expected to source cattle, based on transport links and other factors. 


Comparisons of land area employed by journalists often rely on cities, countries or football pitches. So to bring our new firgure to life, and make the figure more tangible we used a method employed by Amazon research institute Imazon to calculate the number of trees that exist within a square kilometre in the biome – finding conservatively, that some 800,000,000 had been lost.","Collaborate.

 RAG method","Odin links investigative journalism with social media trends to provide automated content that brings context to the Cuestión Pública (CP) audience. Investigative media outlets must stay relevant to the media agenda while undertaking their investigative pipeline. Covering current events interrupts proper investigative journalism (IJ) in concentration and time. Over five years, CP through two comprehensive data-driven investigations (Game of Votes, We Know What You Did Last Legislative Period) compiled 4,230 entities —companies, individuals—. Odin connects current events with our databases to generate happening content enriched with IJ and enhances the workflow efficiency of the team using LLMS and AI technology.","Odin, an ambitious platform developed at the AI in Journalism Challenge (AIJC), stood out as a top 5 finalist, selected from 12 newsrooms among 113 global applicants. Cuestión Pública, the team behind Odin, earned an honorable mention at last year's Splice Beta Journalism Festival in Thailand.

The Odin Project utilizes large language models and generative artificial intelligence technology to enhance the creation of current events content enriched with investigative journalism context. This initiative is a unique approach to ""zero waste"" in investigative journalism, aiming to make the most out of the available information and data. The customers of Odin are the investigative reporters of Cuestión Pública. 

In Odin's first implementation stage target in 'X, ' the system reduced the production time of CP threads in our newsroom's X social media from two hours to 15 minutes. Cuestión Pública journalists saved time on investigative reporting while improving workflow (over 100 threads sample). CP engagement increased 4% during H2 2023 thanks to improved coverage of current events. We're refining Odin's tone and voice on ‘X’ and adjusting the integration system with our database. In the next stage, we aim to transform this content for multi-platform use.","CP, specializing in investigative journalism, takes months for in-depth investigations. Over four years, it's broadened coverage to include breaking news and current events linked to these investigations. This strategy has improved audience insights into key political figures, merging timely news with thorough reporting, leading to audience growth, media recognition, and enhanced brand value.

In 2023, the outlet intensified its social media activity, particularly in covering current events, leading to greater versatility among its investigative journalists. However, this shift caused longer investigation times due to diminished focus. To address this, CP developed the Odin interface to streamline journalists' coverage of current events.

Collaborating with Pulse AI, Cuestión Pública faced technological hurdles in developing Odin. A significant challenge was organizing and cleaning data (4.230 entities) related to the news apps ""Game of Votes"" and ""We Know What You Did Last Legislative Period,"" spread across over 85 Google spreadsheets. The task involved unifying disparate entities (companies and individuals) and identifying duplicates, leading to potential gaps in Odin's current results.

We faced challenges in adjusting Cuestión Pública's tone and voice in 'X' threads created by Odin. Initially using few-shot learning, we're shifting to fine-tuning to improve results.","Through streamlined technology, Odin aims to enhance Cuestion Publica's productivity and media visibility.

We used the few-shot learning method to train Odin's AI platform. We connected to the Open AI API and used the generative AI model ChatGPT to do this. Additionally, we employed transformer architecture to process the text from our databases of journalistic investigation facts, fragmenting it to obtain a vectorized database (using embeddings).

We used ElasticSearch technology to store this data. We employed the RAG (retrieval augmented generation) method to extract relevant information.

For the next version, we are implementing a fine-tuning method to improve Odin's AI in generating content tailored to the voice and tone of Cuestión Pública in the final output accuracy.

Our technical approach has allowed us to develop an efficient and accurate AI platform. David Caswell and Bahareh Heravi supported Cuestión Pública and the Pulse AI team during weekly meetings to advance the Odin AI model for the AIJC program.","Through the approach of 'zero waste' in investigative journalism, the Odin project aims to help independent media focused on investigation leverage their deeply researched content previously published over the years and their databases consolidated through investigative efforts to connect it with current events in their countries. This approach will increase their team's productivity and its media visibility. 

Investigative journalists no longer have to wait months to publish their work and gain public attention. Connecting previous data and information to current events can help investigative media outlets stay relevant and improve their presence on the public agenda. Odin automates the process of investigative journalism teams of these outlets, optimizing their time and eliminating manual work.
 
Odin plans to create multi-format content (video, audiogram, IG's carousels, comics) on various social media platforms in the next version, with increased resources and development.

It is the result of collaboration between Princeton University's Program on Science &amp; Global Security, Nuclear Princeton, and Columbia University’s School of Journalism, published in partnership with Scientific American. The project combines large-scale computational simulations of the consequences of nuclear war with ethnography and journalism to explore and shed light on the remaking of the US’s nuclear arsenal from multiple scientific and social angles.","The project maps the consequences of a concerted nuclear attack on US land-based nuclear missiles that are meant to serve as targets in a nuclear war. We found that nearly the entire population of the contiguous US and the most populated areas of Canada, as well as the northern states of Mexico, could be at risk of lethal fallout, depending on the weather conditions at the time of an attack. We identified communities most at risk, including the Three Affiliated Native American tribes of North Dakota – the only tribes hosting nuclear weapons in the United States, and investigated how the US Air Force was presenting its project to deploy new nuclear missiles on their reservation for the next 60 years.

The project was well received by the public, academics, and at-risk communities, including members of the Three Affiliated Tribes. The authors have been presenting their findings at leading universities, think tanks, the United Nations, and on Capitol Hill to members of Congress as well as on the Fort Berthold Reservation. The data was released in an interactive format that other journalists, researchers, and members of the public can use and the project has already been included in course syllabi.","Five US states, Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska, Montana and North Dakota, are home to 450 nuclear armed land-based ballistic missiles, kept on continuous launch alert and intended to deter nuclear attack by a foreign adversary. Over time, it has come to be understood that these sites would be a “sponge” for a foreign attack, as an adversary would need to focus their efforts on hitting all these sites simultaneously to avoid a retaliatory strike. As part of current $1.5 trillion plans to modernize the US nuclear arsenal, existing missiles at these sites are intended to be replaced with new versions and infrastructure refurbished. However environmental impact reports have not assessed the risks associated with an actual attack.

We reviewed thousands of pages of Air Force environmental impact documents. We conducted dozens of interviews in Washington DC, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska, and New Mexico with nuclear weapon experts, military officials, and members of the public, including those living amid the nuclear missile silo fields. We performed hundreds of fallout simulations to show the risk to local populations as well as people across North America, including predicted fatalities and radiation exposure, to a level of detail never previously possible.","A concerted nuclear attack on the missile silos in the U.S. heartland would generate radioactive dust that travels with prevailing winds. We used high spatial and temporal resolution archived weather data to simulate the paths of the resulting plumes for 48 hours, by when most of the dust settles. Because wind directions change daily, we computed fallout dispersal from an 800-kiloton warhead detonating simultaneously at each of 450 silos on any given day of 2021. This required developing custom code to create input files for the US NOAA Hysplit atmospheric transport software and post-process terabytes of output data. To accommodate the unprecedented size of the grid covering North America at a 1-km resolution, simulations were run in parallel on 128 cores with 1 terabyte of RAM. Our results map for the first time the areas most at risk of fallout and the worst case weather-dependent scenarios for the United States, Canada and the northern states of Mexico. We then combined our fallout data with 1-km resolution population and building height density to calculate the resulting fatalities accounting for sheltering. Depending on wind directions, a nuclear attack on the missile silos could kill several million people.","This project brought together scientists, journalists, scholars, and editors at Scientific American to study and report on the environmental and societal risks associated with the largest US nuclear military program since the Cold War. It took two years from beginning to publication. More than twenty people worked together on producing the data at the core of the project and the associated multi-media package, including a webstory, a documentary short, an interactive map, a five-part investigative podcast centered on Native American communities, and two additional long form reporters and half a dozen editors also contributed to a special report by Scientific American (December 2023 issue).

This project benefited from a combination of strong editorial support at the onset, built-in scientific expertise, large computational resources, Native American researchers and reporters, experienced photojournalists and filmmakers, media innovation scholars, as well as data scientists and visualization experts. The biggest challenge was the project timing and management involved in releasing all the assets simultaneously.

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,Shortlist,,Selling the Green Dream,14/12/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Environment, Business","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","In Australia, retirement savings contributions are compulsory and the funds that manage this money are required to publish where it’s being invested. Some of these funds market themselves as green or offer portfolios described as “sustainable” or “ethical”.

Our investigation focused on funds promising to limit investments in industries like fossil fuels, alcohol, or gambling.

We painstakingly compiled the disclosure spreadsheets from every sustainable-labelled retirement saving option in Australia. We then developed a methodology for checking how the fund’s claims stacked up against the reality of their investments. 

We found almost $1.2 billion invested in fossil fuel industry shares.","The story was read by hundreds of thousands of people, well above average for ABC News stories with strong engagement time.

Shortly after the story went live, one of the largest providers we investigated overhauled its website. They removed the slogan “Save the planet, by saving for your future” and the green marketing that had featured prominently was removed and replaced. At least one other superannuation provider, updated the fine print on its website to clarify its holdings. The financial regulator, ASIC, told us it would be pursuing any companies whose marketing did not match up with the fine print of their portfolios.

For the community, the story provided Australians with a tool that allowed them to easily assess and compare the share holdings of sustainable-labelled funds and to see how their retirement savings are being invested. This was one of the reasons we wanted to tackle this project, because for the average member of the community comparing the offerings of different funds is an onerous task, to say the least.","The wrangling of the data and coming up with a robust way of classifying, for example, a fossil fuel company were two big challenges.

There is no requirement for funds to publish disclosures in a consistent format. The spreadsheet structure changes between funds, assets are named inconsistently and columns, like unique identifiers for stock, are often missing. That meant we had to manually clean and copy over the data from each portfolio into our master spreadsheet. 

We then needed to develop a way to compare the shareholdings in the disclosures with a list of public companies globally that report revenue from fossil fuels, tobacco, gambling, alcohol, uranium and weapons manufacturing and military contracts. To do that, we needed a common identifier between the two datasets to join them. We first tried to match by stock name, but even after cleaning and simplifying the names, it didn’t produce robust results. Through our research, we came across the ISIN. A globally consistent, unique code for publicly listed companies. We sourced ISINs from public databases including stock exchanges around the world and matched them to our data. An arduous process that often required us manually researching companies to find the code.","Because there were usually 2 sometimes 3 people working with the spreadsheets at any given time, we kept all of our data in Google Sheets. We then hooked this into R, specifically R studio, for most of the data wrangling, cleaning and analysis.

We used chat-gpt to speed up the process of writing scripts for some tasks in R.

Because so much of the data entry was done manually, we used Tableau Prep in the final stages to spot check and interrogate our datasets for any inconsistencies against the original disclosures.

To visualise the data, the team used a combination of D3, Svelte and various in-house tools.","There are two key takeaways for me:

The first is the power of collaboration. The story combined the ABC’s data team with its investigations unit. Through this collaboration, we were able to not only interrogate the data but also dive into the reasons why this was an issue in the first place. It also afforded us more resources to track down people who had invested their retirement savings with some of these funds to get their reactions to our findings. The result meant we were able to produce an accompanying 10-minute video investigation as well that aired on the ABC’s 730 current affairs program.

The other is embracing the unknown. With this project, we knew the general approach we needed to take: if we could compile the disclosures and classify the public shareholdings by industry type, we could calculate how well super funds were living up to their promises.

Some cases, like the recent disappearance of Gabby Petito, capture overwhelming media attention, while the hunt for missing persons is a staple of TV shows. While these shows often emphasize stories of police solving cold cases, the reality is often starkly different in Chicago, the third-largest city in the U.S., as our two-year data-based investigation shows based on groundbreaking machine learning and community engagement techniques. Journalists found deep racial disparities and heartbreaking individual stories hidden within the data.","In the two months since the investigation was published and website launched, reporters Trina Reynolds-Tyler and Sarah Conway have testified in front of a task force created by the state legislature to study the issue of Missing and Murdered Women in Chicago, presenting on their findings for over and hour and then taking questions from state representatives. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s staff has also reached out about inviting both reporters to testify in front of Chicago City Council in the coming weeks. Additionally, the investigation reached a broad audience of Chicagoans through the Chicago Reader’s 60,000-copy print run and through a dedicated mini-site, which garnered over 4,300 unique visitors. Finally, the reporting made a direct impact on policymakers who bear responsibility for Chicago’s troubled handling of missing persons cases. Former CPD superintendent Eddie Johnson apologized for his handling of a prominent missing persons case where he linked the disappearance of two young Black women to their alleged involvement in narcotics. Both were eventually found murdered. “Just [because of] who they are or where they come from or their lifestyle, that doesn’t mean the police shouldn’t take it as serious, because we should,” he told our team. “Somebody loved that person.”","Of particular relevance to the Sigma Awards, this investigation grew out of Beneath The Surface (BTS), a groundbreaking data journalism project of the Invisible Institute, headed by director of data Trina Reynolds-Tyler. To develop BTS, Trina partnered with the Human Rights Data Analysis Group to build a machine learning model that analyzed 30,000 Chicago police complaint files and identified buried patterns of misconduct, including a hidden cluster of cases centering around the mishandling of missing persons cases. Our team has years of experience working with CPD data, but the BTS model’s approach unearthed sets of cases we had never seen before.

Our team also built consistent community engagement into our data process and our reporting, holding five major community events and engaging 200 volunteers to review and classify complaints in order to train the machine learning model. This innovative work directly informed many findings in the series about the poor quality of CPD’s data, and led reporters to multiple anecdotal cases explored in the series. Further information can be found at https://www.btsurface.com/.","To access the police misconduct records, our documents pipeline team used OCR software to scrape the narrative text from specific report types. After gaining access to the documents we utilized R and python is cleaning the data and building the classifier. When training volunteers to label the training data for our classifier, we utilized google sheets. 

Our technique for training volunteers leaned heavily on restorative justice practitioners toolkits. We established community agreements and cultivated a space to discuss heavy topics. We followed a strict agenda with space to check in at the beginning of each session, time apart to label data, and then allocated approximately 30 mins to share out. Our hands-on approach with volunteers also meant that their feedback helped inform the data reporting, helping the team refine tags and identify new topics.","The work of Beneath the Surface to unearth stories hidden within administrative data, obscured by difficult-to-pinpoint decisions that serve the furtherance of police impunity, can directly inform the work of other journalists using public data. In particular, the team demonstrated a clear use of machine learning for sourcing stories from complicated and text-heavy datasets where relying on official categories obscures important trends. Second, the team’s insistence on building community input into the data process is a model for journalists using ML or data reporting. That input strengthened the data journalism, especially by providing a sounding board of community members who had lived experience.

The role of FOIA in that data validation can also inform others. Rather than end at one request that produces a dataset, journalists should look for ways to validate their findings by obtaining a mass of individual case records and interrogating how the “truth” contained in the narratives and other documents conflicts with the “truth” in the raw data. That process is how we were able to make the finding that official data showing that 99.8% of missing persons cases between 2000-2021 were closed as “non-criminal” obscures hundreds of missing persons cases that were improperly classified.",English,https://chicagomissingpersons.com/,https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/chicago-police-missing-persons/,https://thetriibe.com/2023/11/families-of-the-missing-speak-out-about-stigma-police-and-closure/,https://southsideweekly.com/who-goes-missing/,,,,"Trina Reynolds-Tyler, Sarah Conway","Trina Reynolds-Tyler, Director of Beneath the Surface at the Invisible Institute, and Sarah Conway, Senior Reporter at City Bureau, partnered to investigate patterns of how police respond to missing Black women and girls in Chicago.

Through more than 500 requests for transparency addressed to the Ministry of Education, the National Human Rights Commission and the prosecutors' offices in the 32 states, we were able to identify the profile of almost 100 aggressors. 

We built a tool that allow to review the protocols published by the 32 states of Mexico to combat sexual violence at the schools.","The database was the most current information on child abuse perpetrated by school workers in Mexico. It is the first time that journalists offer a complete landscape of the problem of elementary school and middle school to the audience. 

After the publication, Congress approved a ruling to modify the General Law on Women's Access to a Life Free of Violence in order to grant the Ministry of Public Education new faculties to develop and apply protocols for the prevention, attention, punishment and eradication of gender violence at all educational levels. In Mexico City, Congressman Carlos Joaquin Fernandez met with Daniela Guazo and Alejandra Crail in order to learn about the investigation in detail and to promote initiatives in favor of the victims of sexual abuse in schools. Civil society organizations have taken the work as a basis for academic research on this issue. Likewise, the teaching community has held virtual dialogue tables to address this hidden reality in the country's schools.","The number of cases of abuses perpetrated by school workers reported by the press has increased in recent years. These public alerts have shown the inefficiency of the school authorities, who had been protecting the abuses deliberately or as a way of protecting themselves. Despite of this, authorities deny constantly that this is the reality in the schools of Mexico.

One of the biggest challenges of this project was to obtain the data. In Mexico 32 different institutes process the information in their way. The result was that most of the scholar authorities tried to block access to the complaints against school workers. Some institutes didn't give the data, others gave information in images and we had to read several complaints written by students, their parents or other school workers to obtain more data.

We had to made a strategy to avoid the blocking of the information and at least have all the statistics about this felony. 

We also had a big challenge in terms of testimonies. All the families were afraid for their childrens, so we teamed up with a group of women lawyers who are in charge of child protection.","The Nuxt.js javascript framework was used to develop the microsite. The home section displaying the testimonial documents in 3D was achieved with the Three.js library, while the data visualizations were developed with the D3.js library.

This will allow you to create your own database, but with official statistics.

Often overlooked is the long history of censorship in prisons and jails. To address this, The Marshall Project investigated the challenges incarcerated people face in accessing and retaining books.

We published [reported essays](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-new-york-florida-censorship), a [searchable database](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-list-find-your-state), an AI-powered analysis of [state-level publication policies](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/03/16/prison-banned-books-policies-what-we-know), an [in-depth look at Ohio](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/06/20/ohio-odrc-prison-book-ban-java-hitler), an investigation into how [drug smuggling policies can turn into de facto book bans](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/10/18/prison-drugs-overdoses-book-banning), and a [reporting recipe](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/10/03/banned-books-prisons-how-to-report) so that other journalists can build on our work.","Among the project’s achievements:

* Turned the banning of books in prisons into a national issue and established The Marshall Project as a leading newsroom on the issue.

* Our data and reporting were central to a report from PENAmerica that kicked off the inauguration of their Prison Banned Books Week; thousands of articles were written about it.
 
* The American Library Association invited us to events to discuss our work with carceral librarians and other information scientists. They used our reporting and data to inform their upcoming Prisoner Bill of Rights with regards to access to information.
 
* The Texas Department of Criminal Justice rolled back their controversial drugs policy thanks to our story even before our story about book bans driven by drug smuggling concerns even published.
 
* Started a mailing list for The Banned Books Project that now includes around 70 people who have either expressed interest in our coverage or who work on the issue of banned books.
 
* Attracted industry attention for our approach to generative AI, which Andrew Rodriguez Calderón captured in write ups for industry publications, conferences, and ultimately helped spur the creation of The Marshall Project’s innovative AI Working Group.","We used collaborative design to place affected individuals at the center of our reporting and product. We employ [generative AI to distill bureaucratic text into concise summaries](https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/decoding-bureaucracy-5b0c1411171). The result is an innovative, evergreen package that examines the issue from the inside out, and demonstrates how to hold systems accountable while centering the information needs of people closest to those systems. 

The project represents significant innovation in making information accessible for the people most affected by the criminal justice system. As a package, this project expanded The Marshall Project’s audience more than any other project in 2023. 

Beyond our site, there were at least 40 stories in at least 30 publications, including the AP and numerous local publications. Reporters from The Marshall Project were interviewed for a multitude of radio and TV stories.

The investigative journalism of the (near) future will be persistent, multi-channel, and driven by engagement and data techniques that center audiences and meet information needs, empowering them to gather, verify and distribute local news and information. The Marshall Project’s coverage of prison censorship is a model for that future.","The data posed significant technical challenges on a state-by-state basis. There were many states with mixed values in different columns, some with no columns at all, just long strings of information, and others with information scattered across multiple sheets that had idiosyncratic formatting.

We also received many PDFs with lists that needed to be converted into text, extracted and transformed. In addition to the typical mix of data processing tools we often use to clean and consolidate data, we used AI to help us analyze state book ban policies.

We built an initial extract-transform-load pipeline ourselves using Python. We then contracted with Aaron Williams, an engineer at Netflix with a background in journalism, to improve our processing pipeline so that it’s easier to add and process new lists. 

ChatGPT helped us process and summarize state publication policies.

United States of America,"The Washington Post, The Examination",Big,Shortlist,,The food industry pays ‘influencer’ dietitians,13/09/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Video, Lifestyle, Culture, Health","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Google Sheets, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js","An investigation by The Washington Post and The Examination found that the food and beverage industry has enlisted “influencer” dietitians to shape the eating habits of millions of social media users, encouraging them to eat more junk food and ignore public health nutrition advice. The influencers, many of whom are trusted registered dietitians, often failed to clearly disclose the industry groups or companies that were paying them.

We analyzed more than 6,000 pieces of social media content to determine the extent of industry influence, and found paid campaigns from the sugar and beverage industry trade groups and dietary supplement makers.","Two months after the story published, the Federal Trade Commission for the first time announced warnings against the two major food and beverage industry groups named in our initial story, and against the dozen nutrition influencers we named. 

The crackdown represented more aggressive enforcement of the FTC’s rules than had been previously enacted, and signaled that the agency was working to set a new precedent for holding both influencers and industry accountable for social media marketing campaigns. The action has the potential to dramatically change how influencers use social media; a review the reporting team did in December weeks after the FTC action found that everyone cited had removed older advertising posts — and had begun clearly marking paid and sponsored content. A lawyer in the e-commerce field told reporters that companies across all industries working with social media influencers were adapting their practices in light of the federal enforcement, and had started to update their contracts with influencers to detail proper disclosure standards.

A number of other news organizations — including CBS News, The Associated Press, NBC and Gizmodo — have followed with stories of their own based on the Post’s initial reporting and the FTC action.","Dealing with large quantities of social media video is always a challenge. Data reporter Caitlin Gilbert had to search across platforms to find users with specific phrases or words in their bios, find libraries that would download and transcribe large tranches of video, deal with metadata from two distinct sources, and had to find a way to access content such as Instagram Reels, which are substantially different from Instagram posts. Social media sites like TikTok and Instagram are built to prevent scraping, so Gilbert had to write scripts and use tools like puppeteer to circumvent rate limits and issues with lazy-loading content. At different points in the analysis, she used JavaScript, Python and R to approach specific technical challenges. 

Another component that made this story unique was the effort to ensure the investigation found it's audience -- the TikTok and Instagram users who were the targets of the industry’s influence campaign. The Post's Well + Being team published a TikTok explaining the investigation and its findings. That video went small-scale viral, generating over 100,000 views and 12,000 likes. When the FTC took action, the team created another TikTok about the crackdown. These were immensely important in driving traffic and conversation.","Caitlin Gilbert used puppeteer/node.js to grab the pertinent video links that met our standards, and then a bash script used the yt-dlp package to download the videos and faster-whisper, an AI-based package, to transcribe them. Analysis was done in R statistical software, and Google sheets were used for manual data entry/labeling to identify promoted content.
Because there was some concern that influencers would trying to avoid public scrutiny by pulling their videos from social media platforms when or before the story published, reporters also preemptively captured metadata and archived all video posts that the team directly reported on, both so that a record of the problematic content would be preserved but also to be able to compare old posts to newer versions, should the users edit posts or improve disclosures.","Working with social media video as data is technically tricky but can pay off with impactful stories that can shine light into largely unregulated corners of the world. In this case, we wanted to look at the intersection of the ever-growing world of ""influencer"" marketing and how it influenced our nutrition and eating choices. While nutrition influencers are a huge presence on social media, we purposely kept the scope of this project tight to increase accountability from both the industry and health profession standpoint.",English,https://wapo.st/3vER9MN,https://wapo.st/429Ow1K,https://wapo.st/3vER9MN,https://www.tiktok.com/@washingtonpostwellbeing/video/7278432035381824799,,,,"Caitlin Gilbert, Anahad O’Connor, Sasha Chavkin","Caitlin Gilbert is a Well+Being data reporter at The Washington Post.

While politicians and developers suggest solving the housing crisis by building new apartments, there is an underlying problem: not only are rent prices rising, so are land prices. 

Where can affordable housing be built? Who owns unused land? What amount of public land has been lost to selloffs? A team of investigative, local, and data journalists examines these 'ground control' dynamics in European capitals. They're analyzing land price trends, ownership structures, and more, using satellite and aerial images to reveal urban development patterns and increase transparency in urban politics.","The kickoff of our half-year-long project, which started in November, featured 7 articles across five media outlets. By then, we had amassed over 100,000 views across these platforms. The stories were shared several hundred times on the media outlets' social media channels, including Instagram, X, Bluesky, and Reddit, to name just a few. 

Up until the deadline of this award, more than 15 stories on this topic have been published, indicating increasing reader interest and underscoring the importance of housing reportage. Furthermore, all outlets have gained new subscriptions for their publications. 

We are sure that subsequent publications in January and February are expected to have even greater impact, as they will include our findings from satellite analysis and more investigative work. We have already received several requests from politicians and housing activists for access to our collected data on land sales.","There is a significant lack of transparency regarding land ownership and prices. Some members of the urban journalism network have already worked on increasing transparency in the rental markets of Europe and now face a new challenge in the realm of land ownership. So far, there hasn't been any comparable data on land prices or ownership. 

The responses to our FOI requests vary from city to city. While some administrations provide data on their cities' sell-offs of public land, others, like Berlin, deny access to documents regarding public land sales. The German team is considering legal action. 

The difficulties many project partners have faced indicate that the topic of land ownership is worth further investigation. In off-the-record conversations, experts and politicians agree that public land sales are a key area with potential for corruption. 

Committed to utilizing as many innovative technologies as possible, we are collaborating with experts in computer vision, satellite analysis, and AI to analyze and compare urban developments in cities.","Firstly, all visualizations are created using a custom-made graphic management system, enabling every project partner not only to translate the graphics but also to use custom font colors according to each partner's corporate design. The backend was developed using Django and Postgres, while the frontend was implemented with Svelte. 

With the help of two satellite companies experienced in working with journalists, we leveraged the latest computer vision technology to detect new buildings in aerial images. For our satellite analysis, we used impervious surface data to identify urban changes. 

As an initial approach to analyzing spatial data without the need for coding skills, we often use the open-source tool QGIS.","The project is a great example of how collaborative investigation unravels the lack of comparable data. Our research reveals that even the European Union lacks comparable data on land prices. 

We learned to quickly find alternative methods for research, investigation, and storytelling when official sources are uncooperative. 

Furthermore, knowing how to use technology can lead to achievements beyond initial expectations. Many local stories are hidden in large shapefiles on various open data servers. The ability to read and analyze these files is invaluable. For journalists, QGIS is an excellent starting point, with numerous online tutorials available for those with limited technical knowledge.","English, German, Czech, Polish, French, Hungarian, Flemish",https://urbanjournalism.org/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/ausgebaut-berlins-explodierende-bodenpreise-machen-wohnungsbau-unbezahlbar/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/wem-gehoert-der-boden-wo-berlin-noch-berlin-gehoert/,,,,,"Editorial and research coordination: Gaby Khazalová

Portugal,PÚBLICO,Big,Shortlist,,Faça o seu ranking,16/06/2023,"News application, Chart","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Svelte","Há mais de 20 anos publicamos aquilo que ficou conhecido como o “Ranking das Escolas”. Aquilo que começou por ser uma ordenação das escolas com base na sua média evoluiu com os anos, aumentando a sua complexidade e criando outros rankings dentro do ranking para parâmetros como superação face ao contexto social. Também por isso, todos os anos, este suplemento é criticado por algo que é muito familiar a jornalistas de dados: analisar dados implica fazer escolhas. Por isso este ano decidimos dar essa possibilidade aos nossos leitores: se fosses tu a desenhar o ranking das escolas, que critérios escolherias?","O trabalho teve um enorme impacto porque este é um tema “quente” todos os anos, com muitas críticas aos jornais por divulgarem estes dados - que, tendencialmente, mostram os colégios privados em primeiro lugar. Mas aqui tínhamos um algoritmo que permitia articular os pesos que os leitores achavam que cada um dos seis grandes indicadores das escolas merecia: classificações nos exames nacionais, classificações internas, a capacidade de superação face ao contexto socioeconómico, a taxa de conclusão no tempo esperado quando comparada com alunos do resto do país com perfil semelhante e a oferta de planos e actividades extra-curriculares de cada escola, assim como a respectiva localização geográfica.
Esta possibilidade oferecida teve um impacto enorme, especialmente porque mostrou que há milhares de “rankings” possíveis, mas, acima de tudo, de que é ok que assim seja, porque cada pai/encarregado de educação valoriza coisas diferentes.","O trabalho foi metodologicamente complexo de realizar porque é sempre difícil encontrar uma forma estatisticamente correcta de misturar dados que não estão dentro da mesma unidade. Optamos por recorrer, por isso, ao número de desvios padrões face à média que determinada escola estava em cada um dos indicadores. Mas isso obrigou a um longo script e de uma análise detalhada de cada um dos indicadores, bem como uma discussão com inúmeros especialistas na área da educação e na estatística para chegar a um algoritmo que considerássemos correcto e justo.
Outro desafio foi encontrar uma forma de tornar um trabalho complexo, que na prática permitia “jogar” com 41 variáveis e subvariáveis, em algo simples e de fácil utilização. Como uma grande parte dos cálculos estavam a acontecer no frontend, foi também um enorme desafio fazer com que a página fosse leve e veloz como desejávamos.
O trabalho com a directora de arte do jornal foi fundamental, principalmente quando encontramos os desafios impostos pelo mobile.","A análise de dados recorreu à linguagem de programação R, bem como ao Excel, que é sempre o ponto de partida do Ranking das Escolas pela necessidade de vários jornalistas trabalharem em cima dos dados. Tudo o resto foi feito com recurso a Svelte. Quisemos tirar partido da sua reatividade porque o que tornava o exercício interessante era precisamente perceber o que acontecia ao ranking a partir do momento em que alteramos um indicador. Mas essa reatividade acabou por ser também um desafio que fazia com que os cálculos fossem executados no frontend diversas vezes. Tivemos que encontrar algumas estratégias para evitar problemas relacionados com isso.","Como jornalistas tendemos muitas vezes a menorizar a capacidade da nossa audiência, nomeadamente quando o tema envolve números e estatística. E sim, a literacia estatística, numérica e visual da nossa audiência pode ser um forte aliado. Mas por vezes a audiência não precisa desses conhecimentos para entender que se valorizar diferentes coisas, aquilo que é uma lista ordenada - e nós, jornalistas, tendemos a adorar uma lista ordenada porque esta dá-nos um título e um lead - pode mudar. Ou, se quisermos complexificar a linguagem, que dar diferentes pesos a diferentes coisas num algoritmo dá-nos resultados muito diferentes. Mas acima de tudo acreditamos que criamos um instrumento muito útil para pais e educadores.",Português,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/faca-seu-ranking/,,,,,,,Rui Barros,"Rui Barros: jornalista de dados licenciado em Ciências da Comunicação.

This is the Ferrogrão project (EF-170), a monumental undertaking that is the brainchild of major soybean and maize producers in West-Central Brazil, which promises to bolster the new outflow route through the country’s Arco Norte and reduce costs. Exclusive survey reveals a much greater impact than estimated by agribusinesses. Ministry of Indigenous Peoples shows concern and demands consultation, but Lula’s minister of transport is optimistic about project launched by Bolsonaro.","Published simultaneously on the websites InfoAmazonia and O Joio e O Trigo, the publication reached 4,466 views. In addition to being reproduced by 21 Brazilian websites, with emphasis on Sumaúma, Brasil de Fato and Correio Braziliense, the report was translated by the NGO Madre Brava in a campaign focused on Cargill owners and the impacts of the company's activities worldwide. The project was selected as a finalist in two Brazilian awards: the Cláudio Weber Abramo Award for Data Journalism, in the Investigation category, and the National Transport Confederation (CNT) award in the Transport and Environment category.","The dialogue with the indigenous peoples was fundamental for the development of the analyzes presented in the report and account for the human dimension of these impacts. We worked on the hypothesis of an area of influence of the railway greater than that considered in the original project, based on a technical paper prepared by an indigenous association that represents communities of the Kayapó and Panará peoples. The analysis took as its starting point public data available on the websites of the Ministry of Transport and the Institute National Space Research Institute (Inpe) and has the consultancy of Inpe scientist Luís Maurano to verify the analysis of deforestation data from the Satellite Monitoring Project for Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (Prodes). This data-driven investigation follows the principles of transparency. The original databases and those that resulted from the analyzes carried out by the report, as well as the documentation of the journalistic process, are available on the transparency page published along with the article. This is a social commitment to the reader and also guarantees replicability and use by anyone who wants it. Participate in the process, journalism professionals, data scientists, editors and designers.","This investigation used geoprocessing with QGIS software. To calculate the impacts of the railway, we drew a 50-km buffer along the route published in the Transport Information Database of the Ministry of Transport - determined as the project’s zone of influence - and overlapped it with indigenous lands (ILs) and conservation units to calculate the affected area. Including a 10-km buffer zone around the territories, considered as a protection zone, the railway will have an impact on more than 7, 300 km² of indigenous lands and more than 48,000 km² of conservation units. In the project's zone of influence (50-km buffer) we calculated the deforested area along the planned route based on the deforestation data of the Satellite Deforestation Monitoring Project in the Legal Amazon (Prodes) of the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe), for the period from 2008 to 2022. The report survey found that, in this period of 14 years, more than 95% of the deforested area affecting the territories is concentrated around the municipality of Altamira, and affects the Baú (582.69 km²), Menkragnoti (159.38 km²) and Panará (23.11 km²) ILs, which are home to more than 80% of the indigenous population impacted by the project in the region.","Other journalists can learn from this project to carry out investigations into the impact of large infrastructure works on indigenous populations and conservation units, through the use of geoprocessing tools, such as QGIS, and public databases. The step-by-step investigation and data analysis methods were detailed on the report's transparency page, which allows other professionals to have access to this data and can both learn how the report was made, as well as replicate it in new investigations. The transparency page also lists all the sources that were consulted for the report and explains in what context each of them was approached, which can help other journalists to navigate the topic. This page also points out the limitations of the analysis used, which allows other journalists to make progress on these points in future reports.",Portuguese / English,https://infoamazonia.org/2023/07/05/ferrograo-afetara-pelo-menos-seis-terras-indigenas-17-unidades-de-conservacao-e-tres-povos-isolados/,https://infoamazonia.org/en/2023/07/05/ferrograo-railway-line-will-affect-six-indigenous-lands-17-conservation-units-and-three-isolated-tribes/,https://burninglegacy.org/evidence/ferrograo-railway-line-will-affect-at-least-six-indigenous-lands-17-conservation-units-and-three-isolated-tribes/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jt2fxG25Cc,,,,"Directed by: Juliana Mori

Veja locais que seriam soterrados por rompimento de barragens,05/04/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Google Sheets, Mapbox","Oito anos após o rompimento da barragem da Samarco em Mariana (MG), que deixou 18 mortos, e quatro anos após o desastre da Vale em Brumadinho (MG), cuja avalanche matou 270 pessoas, dados obtidos com exclusividade pela Repórter Brasil mostram todas as áreas do país com risco de ficarem submersas no caso de rompimentos semelhantes.

O mapa interativo mostra que 178 municípios de 15 estados têm quase 700 áreas suscetíveis à inundação. Enfileirados, os terrenos inundáveis formariam um rio de lama com cerca de 7.000 km de comprimento, a distância de Porto Alegre ao México em linha reta.","Um ativista de Congonhas (MG), cidade destacada na matéria, contou que, após a matéria das barragens, a prefeitura instalou correndo umas placas em um dos parques do município com orientações sobre a rota de fuga. E que fariam simulados de rota de fuga no local. Diversos pesquisadores procuraram a reportagem para dizer o quão fundamental foi a divulgação dos dados para os estudos deles. O Mapa da Lama foi republicado no UOL atingindo grande audiência e reportagens de outros veículos, como o Le Monde, divulgaram o Mapa. Somente no mês de sua publicação, a Repórter Brasil teve mais de 32 mil visualizações nas páginas do mapa e reportagem.","Apesar de dois grandes desastres ligados ao rompimentos de barragens no Brasil, ainda assim as populações que moram perto de áreas de exploração da mineração não tinham acesso às áreas que ficariam submersas em caso de rompimento, ou seja, uma informação fundamental para a sobrevivência dessas pessoas ficava escondida. Além disso, a reportagem denunciou que mesmo após uma determinação da Agência Nacional de Mineração, de que as empresas devem fornecer os mapas de suas estruturas, sejam elas monitoradas ou não pela agência, com identificação das Zonas de Autosalvamento e Zonas de Segurança Secundária, nem todas enviam os dados completos. E 113 sequer apresentaram informações.","Durante 4 meses, a reportagem trabalhou em cima dos dados recebidos em formato shapefile. Primeiro, começou o desenvolvimento do Mapbox onde todas as informações seriam aplicadas e disponibilizadas para consulta pública. Após isso, fizemos o cruzamento de dados para saber o tamanho da extensão da lama e, ainda, a análise análitica da situação, selocionando quatro casos em que bairros residenciais, escolas, rios e terras indígenas correm risco de destruição nos municípios de Congonhas (MG), Brumadinho (MG), Presidente Figueiredo (AM) e Jaguarari (BA). Foram diversas conversas com pesquisadores, procurador e possíveis atingidos.","Os colegas podem aprender, primeiramente, que é preciso solicitar incansavelmente aos órgãos competentes informações de interesse público. No Brasil, temos a Lei de Acesso à Informação que nos garante esse direito e, mesmo que o órgão negue, é possível justificar o interesse público na questão, método que foi necessário para termos os dados. Também podem aprender que é possível fazer reportagens inteiras em cima de dados de georreferenciamento. Com mapas, é possível cruzar inúmeras informações como o risco para indígenas. Esse é o caso de Presidente Figueiredo (AM). Caso a barragem se rompa, uma terra indígena vizinha será atingida. Nessa história pudemos ver que a mineradora já coleciona algumas acusações de derramamento de minérios que têm atingido rios utilizados pela população indígena que ali vive.",Português,https://reporterbrasil.org.br/2023/04/voce-esta-na-rota-da-lama-veja-locais-que-seriam-soterrados-por-rompimento-de-barragens/,https://reporterbrasil.org.br/mapa-da-lama-confira-se-sua-casa-seria-soterrada-pelo-rompimento-de-uma-barragem-de-mineracao/,,,,,,"Hélen Freitas, Marina Rossi e Hugo Nicolau Barbosa de Gusmão","Hélen Freitas é jornalista premiada pela Agência Nacional de Águas e Saneamento Básico (ANA) e finalista do Prêmio Jornalístico Vladimir Herzog de Anistia e Direitos Humanos, ambos com o especial Mapa da Água, publicado pela Repórter Brasil.

The 110,000 artifacts from Ukraine found in two Russian museums.",19/09/2023,"Investigation, Infographics, Map, Arts, Culture","Scraping, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Python, ai2html","In this study, we talked about **110,000 archaeological pieces of Ukrainian origin, which are kept in two Russian museums** - the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg and the Russian Historical Museum in Moscow.
Icons, jewels, weapons, books, valuable artifacts — all of this was taken out of Ukraine by the Russians for centuries. By taking these artifacts from Ukraine, the Russians tried not only to demonstrate their connection with Kievan Rus, but also their deep historical roots. They continue to do this recently, by taking away valuables from museums in the occupied Ukrainian territories.","Our investigation got wide publicity, first of all within Ukraine, but worldwide too. In Ukraine we detected reprints and publications in at least 20 other media outlets, and up to 10 from abroad.
The project was granted to a[ TOP-10](https://gijn.org/stories/editors-pick-top-10-data-journalism-projects-from-2023/) data-journalism projects of the 2023 by GIJN.
""The Ukrainians"" project published [an interview ](https://theukrainians.org/povernuty-vse/) with the author on how this project was born.
""Ukraine: The latest"" podcast by The Telegraph also broadcasted [a talk with Inna Gadzynska](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/moscow-ramps-up-attacks-how-ukraines-treasures-ended/id1612424182?i=1000634793854) about the project. 
21,000 views on website; and about 125,000 in social media.","In October 2023, a month later, National Agency for Preventing Corruption of Ukraine (NAPK) launched new component ""Stolen Heritage"" within its web project Art&amp;Sanctions: https://sanctions.nazk.gov.ua/en/art/stolen/ . _The values stolen by the Russians are used for the propaganda purposes of the Russian Federation, in particular, to fuel the ""Russian world"", demonstrating the so-called ""rich Russian culture""_, the NAPK emphasizes. This fact confirms the high-level of relevance of the TEXTY project ""The stolen treasures"", which gives clear view on the scale of the problem.","The research was complex and lengthy - first we wrote a special algorithm that scraped all the information about the online exhibits of the Hermitage and the Historical Museum of the Russian Federation. Next, our journalists and data researchers manually ""cleaned"" this data to select only those that were moved from the territory of Ukraine. For the most part, finding museum pieces originating from the territory of the modern Ukraine was riddled with difficulties. Firstly, the majority of exhibits have missing data under the headers “Place of Discovery”, “Excavation Site”, “Country of Origin” etc. Although the “Country of Origin” information may simply say “Byzantium”, “the Roman Republic”, “Bosporan Kingdom'' or “Eastern Europe”, this may as well mean that the treasures were brought from Crimea and other parts of the modern Ukraine. Russians tend to name Ukrainian locations under Russian Empire titles. Since the locations could not be filtered automatically, it had to be done manually. To show where exactly in Ukraine the treasures and artifacts were found and where they were taken from, we added approximate geodata to each find.","_Inna Gadzynska_, the author, read about many jewels moved from Ukraine in different historical periods in the monograph of Ukrainian historian Serhiy Kot, which she found on the Internet in the late fall of 2021. In the 900-page work on restitution problems, it was described in detail how Ukraine lost its cultural values in different historical periods and what role Russia played in this. In february 2022 Russia started full-scale invasion in Ukraine and Inna returned to the topic of stolen cultural values only in April 2023 and had a plan to talk with Serhiy Kot. However, it turned out that there is no one to write or call. Serhiy Ivanovich Kot died suddenly in March 2022. 
But TEXTY didn't give up and tried to find and understand something on their own by researching Russian museum funds. Actually, the story about 110,000 arifacts in two Russian museums is an attempt at such a systematization.","Ukrainian, English",https://texty.org.ua/d/2023/stolen_heritage/en/,https://texty.org.ua/d/2023/stolen_heritage/,https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/moscow-ramps-up-attacks-how-ukraines-treasures-ended/id1612424182?i=1000634793854,,,,,"Inna Gadzynska: idea, analytics, text;

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,,Tracking conflict from space,23/02/2023,"Investigation, Breaking news, Open data, Infographics, Map, Satellite images","AI/Machine learning, Sensor, Scraping","We used satellite imagery and modelling to gain new insights into the conflicts in Ukraine, Sudan, and Israel/Gaza; tensions around Taiwan; as well as the aftermath of natural disasters. To do so we developed two techniques based on open-source satellite data. These allow us, and others who use our tools, to track the location and intensity of fighting and the damage it causes: mapping war in near real-time, and its destruction building-by-building. This enabled us to cover conflict in an entirely new way, and also benefited others in the open source community, academia, and humanitarian organisations on the ground.","These projects have been key elements of our reporting in some of the year's biggest stories and have updated continuously since they were launched: our Ukraine “war-fire” tracker since June and Gaza building damage tracker since October. 

Academics in Germany, Norway, Italy and the United States use our “war-fire” models to track conflict, some applying the models we have developed to new conflicts (e.g. in Somalia). In Sudan, local refugee-aid groups have used our maps of likely fighting to direct efforts to provide mental health aid. At least one British NGO—Insulate Ukraine— uses these maps to direct aid. 

Our map of building damage in Gaza has served as a cornerstone of our coverage of the conflict, and on October 19th, we provided the first quantification of buildings damaged in Gaza, a metric used by most major news publications covering the conflict. Both tools have been cited in academic articles.","We would like to gratefully acknowledge the way in which our methods draw on the work of the world-wide OSINT community. For instance, many there have used thermal anomalies to investigate individual conflict events-from which we draw inspiration for our automated system covering entire countries. The UN has previously published work on how to use SAR to track urban damage after natural disasters which provided the framework for our analysis of wartime damage to cities. We also would like to acknowledge help from academics who we have consulted on these projects, including Daniel Arribas-Bel and Francisco Rowe at the University of Liverpool and Ollie Ballinger at University College London. 

While this entry highlights our efforts to cover conflicts in Ukraine, Israel/Gaza and Sudan, we have used similar or other satellite methods to cover tensions around Taiwan, as well as the aftermath of natural disasters in Turkey and North America.","Our fire data comes from NASA’s FIRMS system, a satellite-based system set up to detect wildfires. This detects temperature anomalies, whether they are caused by wildfires, war, farming or industrial processes. We trained an ensemble of machine learning models to automatically mark which of the fires FIRMS detects are likely to be related to military activity. We then use this system to automatically categorise tens of thousands of fire events (updating daily). We have before and since verified that these “war fires” line up well with other reporting on the state of conflicts over time, where available. 

Our building-damage analysis is based on synthetic-aperture radar imagery collected by the ESA Sentinel-1 satellite. We used a pixel-wise t-test to compare images collected after the war or natural disaster event, with those taken before. We then merge this map of signal change with building footprints data from Microsoft Buildings or OpenStreetMap to calculate a probability that each building has been damaged. In Ukraine and Gaza we have calibrated this to visual surveys of damage in conflict zones conducted by the UN. Our infrastructure-damage analysis pipeline was developed with the help of Ollie Ballinger at UCL.","When a war breaks out, or a natural disaster strikes, collecting accurate data is hard. The few numbers coming out of conflicts or disaster zones are often difficult to verify and quick to change. However, such data is crucial: both to understand and respond to conflicts and their aftermath. Satellites offer significant advantages in covering wars: the data they present is regular and consistent, and can provide visibility over an entire conflict zone—all things that are very difficult to achieve when reporting from the ground. They cannot themselves provide a comprehensive view of the conflict but can provide a useful supplement to other, more traditional, reporting techniques (as well as to other open-source intelligence methods). To help other journalists, we have made our data and methods open source where possible. We hope this will enable more organisations to use open-source satellite data to cover conflict better.",English,https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/02/23/data-from-satellites-reveal-the-vast-extent-of-fighting-in-ukraine,https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/ukraine-fires,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/07/20/data-from-satellites-suggest-violence-has-surged-in-much-of-sudan,https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/10/17/israel-gaza-map-hamas-war,,,,"Ainslie Johnstone, Sondre Solstad, Andreas Moor, Filippo Teoldi, Rosamund Pearce.","Ainslie Johnstone is a data journalist based in London.

Because of this privilege, it is difficult for workers to seek legal remedies. Documents and reports obtained by Rappler showed that even when the diplomats were charged and courts ruled in favor of the workers, nongovernmental organizations have noted that enforcing judgments remained difficult.","This report created a database of reports of incidents of abuse of migrant workers done by their diplomat employers. Prior to this, there were only separate news reports, court records, and legal journals. We consolidated these accounts into one database, and further enriched it by doing a digital investigation by looking at other available information online.

Spotx","""Forest Thieves"" is a one year-long investigation published by The Intercept Brasil from November 2023 to April 2024 and which revealed the gears of the land grabbing industry in the Amazon. In this four story series (plus a video-explainer) we showed that it is not a random phenomenon, but a well organized business which involves many actors and a lot of money. We showed who was behind the largest deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, who are the land grabbers' engineers, how illegal loggers profit over public lands and how Bolsonaro's government gave up protecting 8 million hectares.","After the publication of the serie, in 2023, the Federal Police started a raid against land grabbers in Pará. Among the targets of the investigations were Bruno Heller, mentioned in one of our stories as one of the land grabbers of BR-163 area, and Bianor Dal Magro, the land grabber engineer we revealed in our second story. Even though we can not assure the raids had a connection with our investigation. 

The innovative way in which I combined different databases in this investigation also led me to present my work at the International Journalism Festival, in Perugia, the GIJN 2023's conference, in Gothenburg and the congress of the Brazilian Investigative Journalism Association, in São Paulo. In December 2023, I received an offer to work as a full-time reporter in Mongabay. 

Regarding audience numbers, the stories had 33,731 page views in Intercept's website, 1,797,871 summing Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. The video resuming all the investigation had 9,700 views on Youtube, 65,247 in Instagram and 1,328 pageviews in the website.","This series was produced during Bolsonaro's government, who diminished the repression to environmental crimes and encouraged land grabbers and illegal miners in the Amazon, creating a hostile environment to journalists. Our fieldwork happened a few weeks after the murder of The Guardian's correspondent Dom Philips and of the indigenist Bruno Pereira, which forced us to implement an ever more strict security protocol. We spent most of the trip undercovered, which didn't avoid us being intimidated while taking photos of a sawmill in Rondônia. We had to be even more careful about our local sources, who only could be interviewed off the record and should not be seen in our company. We spent most of the time in small villages in the Deforestation Arch, where the whole economy revolves around land grabbing and illegal mining, and where it was impossible to go unnoticed. Once we were back to the office, we faced legal threats from two of the individuals that would be mentioned in the stories. From the innovation's perspective, we definitely innovated in our third story in which CCCA could estimate the volume of wood illegally taken from the forest in João Bento's glebe.","I used QGIS to analyse geospatial data, specially by crossing the deforested areas with the shapefiles of land registers and environmental fines. That is how I found out who was behind the largest Amazon deforestation, for instance. I also used QGIS to prepare my fieldwork and my security plan, by finding the best routes. During the fieldwork I used geolocation apps like Geotracker and Avenza to guide myself to the specific farms I was investigating and also to track my route and not get lost. I also used the geotracker equipment Stopx to share my location with my editors in real time. I used Open Refine to analyse large data sets like environmental fines, and I read many lawsuits to understand how a particular area was deforested or the history of exploration of a certain area. Social media were also sources of information about the individuals and their role in their communities. Finally, high resolution satellite imagery was crucial both for reconstituting the story of a deforested area (from selective logging to large-scale deforestation and the use of fire) and for estimating how much wood was taken from João Bento's glebe.","They can learn how to tell a story having only a particular area in the map as a starting point. As you add different layers of information on the top of this area, you can get to the individuals and the details that will make that a relevant story. Something that could be treated as just one more deforestation case can become a live illustration of a whole phenomenon like land grabbing, as we did on our first story. I believe the series is also an inspiration to colleagues looking for new ways of covering the same issues. One of them is to dive into the entrails of these dynamics, showing the importance of actors that may pass unnoticed but without whom crimes such as land grabbing couldn't happen. That was the idea behind the second story, in which we showed how ordinary professionals, like a real broker and an engineer, play crucial roles in the land grabbing industry. My work is also an example of how to associate hard data work with traditional reporting techniques. Without the fieldwork and the dozens of interviews I would never get to tell these stories.",Portuguese,https://www.intercept.com.br/series/ladroes-de-floresta/,,,,,,,"Fernanda Wenzel, reporter and project creator

The ""data-mining"" algorithm is ostensibly used to prioritize fraud investigations, but our work revealed it targets the most vulnerable. We analyzed thousands of lines of code to demonstrate discrimination against parents, low income households, and people with disabilities. On December 4, Le Monde and Lighthouse Reports published an interactive that presented the results of our analysis and the consequences of being flagged for investigation.","Our portrait of a single mom who lost her benefits due to a control triggered by the algorithm was the most visited of our series with more 75,000 unique visitors.

Our publication saw significant secondary coverage, including a column from French economist and author Thomas Piketty that denounced the latent “anti-poor ideology” of the algorithm. Seine-Saint-Denis, the poorest département in mainland France, appealed to the French ombudsman (Défenseure des Droits) to investigate if the algorithm was discriminating against its residents. ATD Fourth World — one of France’s most prominent civil rights organizations — called on the CNAF to halt use of the system. 

In parliament, French MPs called for an investigation and the Minister of the Disabled was forced to answer questions about the CNAF’s use of the system.","Our work has benefited greatly from the efforts of ""La Quadrature du Net"", which has been fighting for years to obtain the code and documents relating to the algorithm. 

The French law very clearly specified that code is a document that can be obtained through FOIA law. But the law is poorly understood and not well enforced. 

Despite the opinion of the French Commission for Access to Administrative Documents (CADA), CNAF still refuses, to this day, to transmit all the variables used by their algorithm, as the CADA's decision is non-binding. We have had to take our case to the administrative court to enforce our right to information, but this will take a year at best.","Having obtained most of the penultimate version of the algorithm, we first had to translate this code from SAS, a language we didn't know, to vanilla Python. Our experience in artificial intelligence enabled us to quickly identify a logistic regression, a very standard algorithm. Each variable could then be taken separately, and its impact analyzed for each of the possible values. We transferred all these coefficients to a Google spreadsheet, so that each member of the project could play around with the model.","Analyzing algorithms can be intimidating. The administrations that use them often exaggerate their technicality and hide the actual code at all costs. Authorities are often reluctant to accept that their algorithms, although mathematically correct, are not neutral. They often refuse to conduct bias studies on the pretext that they would be useless, and yet deploy these solutions in every aspect of a citizen's life.","French,English",https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/visuel/2023/12/05/how-an-algorithm-decides-which-french-households-to-audit-for-benefit-fraud_6313254_8.html,https://www.lighthousereports.com/methodology/how-we-investigated-frances-mass-profiling-machine/,https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2023/12/04/dans-la-vie-de-juliette-mere-isolee-precaire-et-cible-de-l-algorithme-des-caf_6203803_4355770.html,,,,,"Soizic Penicaud (Lighthouse Reports), Justin-Casimir Braun (Lighthouse Reports), Gabriel Geiger (Lighthouse Reports), Daniel Howden (Lighthouse Reports), Eva Constantaras (Lighthouse Reports), Adrien Sénécat (Le Monde), Manon Romain (Le Monde), Maxime Vaudano (Le Monde), Jonathan Parienté (Le Monde), Elsa Delmas (Le Monde), Léa Girardot (Le Monde), Thomas Steffen (Le Monde)","Adrien Sénécat, Soizic Pénicaud and Gabriel Geiger did research, met with sources and conducted interviews.

This is what ""Les Jours"" counted in a work as unique as it is exceptional. Name, first name, age, nationality, migratory route, circumstances of death, photos... For several years, we searched and compiled all possible information on the exiles who disappeared along this maritime border. Our “Calais Memorial”, to be discovered below, lists the victims so that they are not forgotten. Interactive datavisualisation, infographics and video mapping: 3 different formats have been created for this unique project.","A lot of reactions on the political level because as is often the case, what is not counted does not count! So being able to document these deaths precisely and over a long period of time was a shock in France. It was also recognition of the field work carried out every day by NGOs in this particular area around Calais.","This is a unique project because no one has ever taken the time in France to create a precise database on these men and women who died on the Franco-British border. Beyond nationality, ages and sexes give indications on the types of populations pushed into exile. But above all, the location and context of their death clearly illustrates the fortress that Calais has become, pushing these refugees to take greater and greater risks. By datavisualizing these lives, we also illustrate a policy of closure that often goes unnoticed.","We choose to offer 3 different types of visualizations and therefore we relied on several technologies:
- interactive directory of deceased people in HTML/CSS
- summary dataviz of all the people documented in Illustrator
- animated video mapping with CineDataMap, a video mapping tool created in-house","In the era of Big data and open data which puts millions of pieces of data within reach of editorial staff, it is important to remember that the manual work of investigation, the collection of information person by person, certificate of death by death certificate, interview by interview still remains very valuable for monitoring, reporting and giving substance to phenomena that political powers do not want to see, or even want to hide.",french,https://lesjours.fr/obsessions/calais-migrants-morts/ep1-memorial/,https://wedodata.fr/productions/lesjours-morts-calais#,,,,,,"Maël Galisson, Elodie Cassignol, François Prosper, Karen Bastien, Clément Thorez","Maël Galisson, journalist specialized in stories of exiles and borders

As data journalists at AJLabs, our mission has always been to tell the human stories behind the data. As of writing this, more than 24,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks on Gaza. These are people with stories, dreams and hopes for the future. 

Know their names is a data/visual story, with a searchable database, that documents the thousands of people that have been killed during Israel’s most recent military campaign.","This story, which was published in English, Arabic and Bosnian has been one of the most widely circulated stories on the continuing Israel-Gaza war.

Rather it’s through the nuanced presentation of the human stories weaved within the visuals to help people understand the scale of the attacks.,"Given this was a breaking news story, speed played a huge part in publishing this story. It took a team of three people three days to storyboard, translate, analyze, produce and edit the story.

Figma","Rubber, Race, and Colonial Exploitation explores the historical significance of the rubber industry in Singapore and its deep-rooted impact on the present discourse surrounding migrant workers in the country. The article highlights how European dominance in rubber supply, discriminatory land policies, rigged quotas, and labour systems have led to enduring inequalities, shaping the socio-economic landscape of modern Singapore. The legacy of such exploitation is traced through generational wealth disparities, particularly affecting the Malay population, and the continued reliance on migrant labour.","This story has become our top story on our website, and we think it’s because it showcases an element of Singapore history that is rarely talked about. We even received anecdotal evidence that it was used in the History exam paper for one of Singapore’s local secondary schools. 

Singapore’s and Malaya’s historical rubber trade is often written about in glorified ways, in terms of its role in enriching the country and building the generational wealth of many still-prominent families in Singapore and the region. Our angle of highlighting the discriminatory practices that existed, and connecting them to systemic injustices that continue to today bucks that prevailing perception and helps people think more critically about history and how it continues to impact us. 

The story received 7,475 views, with an average engagement time of 34 seconds. It also got 1,188 likes and 292 shares on Instagram.","As recent as July 2023, migrant workers continue to live and work in Singapore under a similar system that is deeply disadvantageous to them, with poor living conditions and employment rights. This article uses historical investigation to highlight how this system of exploitation is systemic and historic. It underscores the need for empathy, understanding history, and addressing systemic inequalities to mend the divisions in contemporary Singaporean society.

This historical investigation was laborious to produce. It first started with tedious research in the form of two decades of colonial office records in microfilms. Each annual report spanned more than a thousand pages, and it took a lot of time to sift through it to look for the relevant records. We retrieved data on wages in different regions, volume of migrants, the breakdown on their demographics were sourced from these detailed colonial office records. The story was further supported with supplementary research from journal articles, oral interviews, and further secondary data—this part spanned almost half a year. One of the key visual pieces was also the manual conversion of a historical print map of the spread of rubber plantations in Malaya into digital geospatial data that could be rendered into a map-scrolly.","Because the story was dense in historical fact, we needed a visually-driven and impactful narrative to bring the various components together. There were also multiple smaller stories, such as the different treatment of racial groups by colonisers that needed to be unpacked. To do so, we used large form, comic-style illustrations as the centre of the story, to bring empathy and life to a topic that was hard for laypersons to relate to. The visualisations were largely executed on Flourish and Mapbox, using a variety of dot plots, bar charts, treemaps, and scale comparisons to draw active comparisons across racial categories and business owners.","News isn’t always just about unfolding stories or contemporary events. Historical archives are rich in material, and it’s important to contextualise and look at structural factors when covering issues, especially those concerning minority rights. Historical material is also a great treasure trove in environments where data access and availability is poor, as in the case of Singapore.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/rubber-race-and-colonial-exploitation,,,,,,,"Writer / Loh Pei Ying

It is also a criminal operation, widely dependent on captive deckhands, illegal fishing, and state-sponsored forced labor from North Korea and China’s repressed Xinjiang region. The Outlaw Ocean Project, in partnership with The New Yorker and two dozen other news organizations around the world, published a series of groundbreaking exposés that prosecuted the case, drawing on four years of reporting conducted aboard Chinese ships on the high seas and inside Chinese seafood plants.","After our investigation, EU lawmakers passed two laws concerning [illegal fishing](https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/impact/#eu-lawmakers-passed-china-transparency-resolution) and [import controls](https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/impact/#samira-rafaela-comments-on-eu-legislation) on products tied to forced labor. The CEO of a major seafood company abruptly [resigned](https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/impact/#high-liner-foods-ceo-resigned) after being presented with findings of illegal practices tied to his company’s plants, and several major seafood companies severed ties to the plants and ships we had revealed were using forced labor. A bipartisan commission created by the White House and Congress held a hearing based on the investigation and demanded documents and answers from federal agencies such as NOAA, Customs and Border Protection, and the Department of Homeland Security—and from companies such as Costco and Albertsons. Nonprofits filed legal petitions to the U.S. and Canadian government seeking a ban on imports from companies cited in our reporting. 

Our reporting triggered extensive coverage within the industry press and spurred debate on op-ed pages globally, including in the _[Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/13/fish-caught-processed-uyghur-forced-labor)_, _[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/10/11/us-seafood-china-human-trafficking-uyghur-forced-labor/71127786007/)_, _[Chicago Tribune](https://cdn.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china/pdf/coverage/chicago-tribune--op-ed-is-the-seafood-you-buy-connected-to-worker-abuses.pdf)_, and _[Globe and Mail](https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/reach/#the-globe-and-mail)_. Our work got vastly more traction than such reporting typically does, because of the collaborative way it was [disseminated](https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/reach/): in 12 languages, 30 countries, and more than 140 news outlets. Articles based on our reporting attracted a combined readership of over 200 million.","Our work stands out for its scope, complexity, and reach. For four years, we investigated more than 700 Chinese ships, creating a public database that traced their entire supply chain from catch and crime to consumer. No western journalists had ever reported from onboard Chinese ships or traced how seafood caught and processed with forced labor moves through the supply chain to consumers. No journalists, advocacy groups, or academic researchers had ever documented that Xinjiang and North Korean forced labor were being used so extensively in the seafood exported to most of the world’s biggest grocery chains and restaurants—and to the U.S. federal agencies that supply public schools, military bases, and food pantries. 

When we launched this investigation, we focused on China for two reasons: first, because it has become the undisputed superpower of seafood, with more ships and more processing capacity than any other country; and second, because its open-water fishing fleet engages in more abuse and criminality than any other country’s. These factors made China an unusually tricky journalistic target but a uniquely important one. Our investigation tied 357 of the 751 ships we studied to human-rights or environmental violations.","We used a full arsenal of tools, techniques, and technologies to do our reporting. We used satellite data to locate Chinese fishing vessels on the high seas, we spent extensive time on the water searching for them, and when we found them we deployed remote submarines and infrared drones to film them. When approaching them, we initially communicated by radio, often using translators. When captains got spooked and fled the scene, we trailed them in fast skiffs until we got close enough to throw aboard plastic bottles containing pens, cigarettes, hard candy, and interview questions, which allowed deckhands to quickly read our messages and understand our mission. In turn, they would write replies and toss the bottles back to us.

For our land-based reporting on China’s seafood-processing industry, we culled information from cell-phone footage, state media reports, and company newsletters. Additionally, we visited grocery stores around the world to extract codes from seafood packages, which we tied with export reports to trace them to processing plants in China. We also used trade data to tailor individual stories for a dozen countries and partnered with major outlets in those countries to produce stories that would speak to their audiences.","This investigation offers many lessons for reporters. They include: How to connect the dots between crimes at sea and consumers on land. How art can help diversify and amplify journalism. How it’s worth trying to collaborate with as many news outlets as possible, even if those collaborations take time to develop. How to use open-source content, such as cell-phone footage posted to social media, to get eyes into places that are otherwise difficult to access. How to afford yourself greater credibility when presenting your findings, by making full-text versions of all of your interviews available, and by publishing explanations of your methodology. How to avoid demoralizing readers with your reporting by offering them empowering guidance for action suggested by experts and advocates. And, finally, how—by creating an “Impact” page—to enable other reporters, lawmakers, and law enforcement to track the outcomes of an investigation and even advance it.","English, French, Korean, German, Uyghur, Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatian, Vietnamese, Turkish, Greek, Chinese",https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/a-fleet-prone-to-captive-labor-and-plunder/,https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/the-uyghurs-forced-to-process-the-worlds-fish/,https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/bait-to-plate/,https://www.theoutlawocean.com/investigations/china-the-superpower-of-seafood/discussion/,,,,"Ian Urbina, Joe Galvin, Maya Martin, Susan Ryan, Daniel Murphy, Austin Brush, Jake Conley and the staff of the Outlaw Ocean Project","Ian Urbina is the founder and director of The Outlaw Ocean Project.

The project, sparked by a leak of emails from the Colombian prosecutor’s office, allowed OCCRP and 40+ media outlets to look into how criminal gangs are innovating and evolving their business models in the face of new opportunities to feed one of the world’s busiest drug highways: Latin America to Europe. 

This collaboration posed unprecedented data challenges that had to be solved in order to ensure the security of the transnational team and the integrity of the data.","80+ media outlets from around the world republished the stories from the project in different languages, giving the stories widespread visibility. The NarcoFiles project was one of the most visited in the history of the OCCRP website. The project team will continue to investigate the findings in the leak and more stories will be published throughout the year. 

NarcoFiles represented a significant milestone in investigative journalism: it is the first global cross border collaboration originating from Latin America focused on organized crime and a keen example of what can be done in the region. The network created by NarcoFiles is a seed for further Latin America-focused collaborative investigations.

Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro, recognized the project during the ceremony for the 132nd anniversary of the National Police, explicitly mentioning the work carried out by Colombian outlets such as Vorágine and Cuestión Pública. 

Journalists who were involved in NarcoFiles conducted a workshop at the Latin American Conference of Investigative Journalism (COLPIN) in Mexico in December 2023. This opportunity to share knowledge &amp; experiences with other media professionals showcased the regional influence and the international implications. NarcoFiles was covered by a range of media outlets, including a VICE interview and the Latam Journalism Review.","The sensitive nature of the data made the project one of the most complex in OCCRP's history. The size of the database - almost double that of the Panama Papers - required meticulous coordination between different teams at OCCRP and our partners. In addition, our team also tailored meetings and responses for the most complex stories / regions, customized digital and physical security protocols for the most sensitive stories, centralized and coordinated more than 40 FOIA requests and rights of reply (more than one dozen) so as not to compromise local journalists.

The political context was also challenging. The current Attorney General's Office is not transparent and did not address the findings of the NarcoFiles investigation. The NarcoFiles exposed the seriousness of the attack and the sensitivity of the data that was compromised. In addition, the Attorney General’s Office attacked some journalists for disclosing information of public interest.","OCCRP, the Centro Latinoamericano de Investigación Periodística (CLIP), Vorágine, and Cerosetenta / 070 gained early access to 5tb of data from two organizations, Distributed Denial of Secrets and Enlace Hacktivista. The dataset, with more than seven million emails from the Colombian prosecutor’s office, included audio clips, PDFs, spreadsheets, and calendars, dated to 2001. OCCRP collated and cleaned the data, getting rid of problematic content, which was tedious process. We identified patterns and did a lot of number crunching on the backend across the dataset to give the investigative team the necessary leads to follow. OCCRP brought in 40+ media organizations from 23 countries across the Americas and Europe to analyze the contents. The team also filed more 40 FOI requests in 21 countries and conducted data analysis on the responses, which in combination with interviews with sources, and hundreds of public and private documents, allowed OCCRP and partners to build compelling interactives to show how organized crime has become more globalized than ever. For the interactive, our team used 3D (Blender), Gridsome (web frontend framework base on Vue.js) and GSAP for animations.","The lessons from NarcoFiles offer valuable insights for other journalists. Managing a massive leak from Colombia's Public Prosecutor's Office, with 5 terabytes of data, required technological infrastructure for secure data storage and efficient navigation to sift through this sea of information to find what truly mattered to the public. Effective use of OCCRP's data platform, Aleph, proved vital in this challenging process.

It was also a challenge to confirm the authenticity of the information in the leak. Reporters had to cross-reference court data, public records, and other databases. They also submitted public information requests, reviewed documents, and interviewed experts.

The sensitive nature of NarcoFiles made necessary security strategies, both digital and physical, to mitigate risks of violence against involved journalists. Developing protocols was also critical for protection of undercover agents and informants within the leaks.

Coordinating over 40 media outlets worldwide posed a monumental challenge, including overcoming cultural differences and language barriers, especially with non-Spanish speaking countries, underscoring the need for effective management strategies and seamless communication to ensure collaboration in such complex transnational journalistic projects. These learnings emphasize the importance of security, ethics, strategic collaboration, and efficient technological use in conducting large-scale journalistic investigations.","English, Spanish, Danish, Bulgarian, German, Dutch, Czech, Polish, Swedish, Lithuanian, French, Portuguese",https://www.occrp.org/en/narcofiles-the-new-criminal-order/,https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/starting-in-latin-america-narcofiles-brings-together-journalists-from-23-countries-to-reveal-new-global-organized-crime-networks/,https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkax7n/narcofiles-papers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrBe46R-r1s,,,,"Journalists: Allan de Abreu (piauí), Samuel Aguilar (El Universal), Iván Alamillo (Mexicanos Contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad), Johanna Álvarez (Unidad Investigativa de Noticias Caracol), Tatiana Antolínez (Cuestión Pública), Carmen Aristegui (Aristegui Noticias), Ernesto Aroche (El Universal), Anastasia Austin (Insight Crime), Claudia Báez (Cuestión Pública), Mayra Báez (CLIP), Valeria Báez (Cuestión Pública), Antonio Baquero (OCCRP), Aldo Benitez (La Volanta), Lars Bové (De Tijd), Scott Bronstein (La Prensa), Edier Buitrago (Cuestión Pública), Àngela Cantador (CLIP), Abel Cárdenas (Ojo Público), Rigoberto Carvajal (CLIP), Brecht Castel (Knack), Aramis Castro (OjoPúblico), Daniela Castro (OCCRP), Jacqueline Charles (Miami Herald), Rosa Chávez Yacila (OjoPúblico), Alejandra Crail (El Universal), Juliana Dal Piva (CLIP), Antonio Delgado (Miami Herald/El Nuevo Herald), Douwe den Held (Insight Crime), Claudia Julieta Duque (Cuestión Pública), David Espino (El Universal), Juan Omar Fierro (Aristegui Noticias), Brian Fitzpatrick (OCCRP), Casey Frank (Miami Herald), Marina Gama Cubas (CLIP), Enrique García (Ojoconmipisto), Jody García (Plaza Pública), David González (OCCRP), Eduardo Goulart (OCCRP), José Guarnizo (Vorágine), Daniela Guazo (El Universal), Kevin G.

Three thousand reports citing the data were published across Brazil in six months across media outlets of all types, sizes, and regions. We reached 5k new subscribers in our newsletter days after revealing the data. Also, we won two important data journalism awards in Brazil, from School of Data (Open Knowledge Brazil) and Livre.jor. Because of our complaint the Office of the Comptroller-General ruled that these documents should be made automatically public at the end of every Presidential mandate.","Our primary resource for obtaining the data was the FOIA. The Brazilian legislation stipulates that expenditures of sitting presidents are confidential but can be made public immediately after the end of their term if someone requires it. We obtained the breakdown of corporate card expenses for former presidents, including Bolsonaro, just days after he left office. The government responded directly to our demands and made the data available proactively in an unprecedented manner. However, we went further and requested the invoices. Access was granted for the first time in history, but it required consulting thousands of physical files in Brasília, the capital. We hired freelancers and partnered with media outlets to open processes and photograph receipts, but it seemed like an impossible mission facing the volume of documents - uncountable boxes and folders. We decided to buy a scanner, hire more people, partner with more journalists, and managed to digitize about 13 thousand pages in a few weeks until the government blocked our team's access. The work needed to be supervised by a public servant to mark personal data in the processes before making them available for digitization. Then, they promised to digitize the files on their own.","The primary catalyst for our success was the ""Lei de Acesso à Informação"", the Brazilian equivalent of FOIA. The expenses of former presidents become public after the end of their term, but we realized that this transparency did not happen automatically—it required proactive requests. We strategically leveraged the law, filing our request at the opportune moment and promptly sharing the data just days after Bolsonaro left office. In terms of technology, advanced OCR and document-analysis-specific platforms were essential to make the millions of scanned pages useful. Generative AI was also essential, and we used Document Cloud´s ChatGPT Turbo feature and Microsoft Copilot to get summaries of documents that amounted to over 14 thousand pages. Finally, REGEX was necessary to find specific data that could identify ID numbers and other information required to categorize and group information.","A crucial lesson revolves around the power of collaboration in journalism. The seamless cooperation with colleagues from various media outlets played a pivotal role in unearthing compelling narratives. Without the collective effort in scrutinizing the data and uncovering stories, this groundbreaking release of information would have held little relevance in the public discourse. The project underscores the significance of journalistic collaboration as an indispensable force for driving impactful and meaningful reporting. Certainly, other journalists can use the techniques and tools for analyzing large volumes of documents that we apply in this project, as all the tools are free software or have free versions. In addition, specially Brazilian journalists and investigators, but even professionals from other countries, can use our database to discover stories, as already happened, because our collection is available for free.",Portuguese,https://fiquemsabendo.substack.com/p/exclusivo-acessamos-as-notas-fiscais,https://fiquemsabendo.substack.com/p/veja-quais-foram-os-gastos-do-cartao,https://bit.ly/3O5q8IH,https://bit.ly/3tUZVFM,,,,"Luiz Fernando Toledo

United States of America,Reuters,Big,Shortlist,,The Bat Lands,16/05/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Covid 19, Health","Animation, D3.js, Three.js, QGIS, Canvas, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","The Reuters project “The Bat Lands” relied on a groundbreaking statistical model and reporting on six continents to pinpoint where outbreaks of bat-borne viruses with epidemic potential are likeliest. The model, developed by Reuters reporters, analyzed natural and human-driven conditions surrounding previous outbreaks and identified where similar factors exist worldwide. Reporters mapped more than 9 million square kilometers – about 6% of the Earth and home to some 1.8 billion people – where conditions are ripe for a lethal bat virus to emerge. The human population in these areas grew by 57% over two decades, boosting chances of a new pandemic.","The Bat Lands analysis has proven its predictive power, and health experts have cited its value for preventing epidemics. 

One group involved in pandemic treaty discussions emailed the project to all negotiators, saying it shows the urgent need for global measures to prevent spillover – a pathogen’s leap from bats or other animals to humans.

Identifying areas with high spillover risk, like we did, helps companies and governments develop prevention and response strategies, two World Health Organization officials told us.

Our model has shown its predictive accuracy. Since 2020, the endpoint of our data, more than two dozen outbreaks have occurred in places we identified at highest risk. They include:
* [A deadly outbreak](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-prevention/) in October 2023 of the brain-swelling Nipah virus in a rapidly urbanizing region of India where our reporter dodged urine from bats flying overhead. 
* [Ghana’s first known outbreak of Marburg virus](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-jumpzones/), in 2022, near farmland littered with half-eaten fruit dropped by bats that can carry the pathogen. Farmers sometimes eat or feed the scraps to livestock. 
* [Fatal Nipah cases in early 2023 in Bangladesh](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-spillover/), where health workers with megaphones urged people not to consume date-palm sap. Bats contaminate vats that collect the syrup.","Aside from the complexity of the topic itself, requiring time-consuming reporting and data analysis, some significant hurdles turned this project into a multi-year undertaking. 

With 8 billion data points, computing power posed a challenge. Even with powerful servers, it took days to retrain the model and generate predictions each time we made changes.

Because we reported the project on six continents during the COVID-19 pandemic, illness and travel restrictions repeatedly interrupted our work. 
It took the Indian government four months to approve a journalist visa allowing us to report in Kerala for our [deep dive into the concept of spillover](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-spillover/).

It’s also notable that we were reporting in a crowded field. Other news organizations have published stories about the role of bats in pandemic risk. But none did a deep data analysis of that risk, a public service that offers the world a specific roadmap to areas that require stronger oversight and spillover prevention.

[ProPublica conducted its own machine-learning analysis](https://www.propublica.org/article/ebola-spillover-machine-learning-methodology-nigeria?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter#:~:text=Random%20forests%20are%20a%20popular%20and%20versatile%20technique%20that%20has%20been%20used%20widely%20in%20academia%20and%20journalism) around the same time we did and included a link to our May series to support its own work published three months later. ProPublica’s stories were limited in focus to Ebola outbreaks in Africa.","We developed [our own methodology](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-methodology/), a groundbreaking statistical model that used an artificial intelligence tool to predict where bat-borne virus outbreaks might happen worldwide.

We began with data from Boston biotech Gingko Bioworks listing spillovers from 2002 through 2020. We did extensive reporting to verify and geolocate each case and added documented spillovers to expand the dataset.

For the same period, we built a spatial database, mostly from satellite imagery, of [56 environmental, social and economic conditions linked to spillover](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/global-pandemic-bats-methodology/BatLandsCovariates.pdf). The 8 billion data points we amassed spanned the Earth and included temperature, precipitation, estimated number of bat species, deforestation, livestock estimates and urbanization.

Linking the 95 documented outbreaks to the conditions data created a profile of factors that existed where past spillovers occurred. We fed that information into a random forest model, a machine-learning tool, generating a score that told how closely each 25-square-kilometer section of the globe resembles areas with known outbreaks. The score predicts how prone each area is to spillover. We called the riskiest areas, those in the 95th percentile and above, “jump zones.”

This analysis formed the project’s backbone, showing us where to send reporters and driving graphics that illustrated the risk worldwide.","“The Bat Lands” is a monumental work of science journalism. Our reporters dove deeply into complex zoonotic and epidemiological concepts, reviewing hundreds of academic papers and interviewing more than 100 [scientists]https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/assets/global-pandemic-bats-methodology/BatLandsScientists.pdf). They then conducted their own scientific inquiry.

The most important lessons, we think, are: Don’t shy away from original inquiry, and find experts to help. Review existing research and develop a deep understanding of your topic. Then find scientists and statisticians willing to help journalists explore new territory. We could not have done this project without their help.

Another key takeaway: Visuals, visuals, visuals. Our favorite response to The Bat Lands was: “I read your story. Well, more accurately, I experienced it.” That should be your goal. Think of visual elements as an integral part of the storytelling, and involve visual people from the start. We knew video, photos, maps and illustrations were critical to frame narrative spines for our stories and help readers digest the science and data. Before each reporting trip, we went over the goals of the mission, including the visuals we hoped to get on location. We also conceived and revised the visuals and text in tandem. This helped us tighten and focus the storytelling.",English,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/global-pandemic-bats-overview/,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-jumpzones/,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-spillover/,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/global-pandemic-bats-spread/,,,,"Ryan McNeill, Deborah J.

Heat-Health Organization wet bulb globe temperature calculator
Airtable","An experiment with delivery drivers in Paraguay’s capital, one of the hottest areas in Latin America, reveals health and safety problems due to rising temperatures aggravated by the climate crisis. The research makes an innovative use of core body temperature monitors to measure heat stress in these urban workers. Reporters combined the findings with weather data to evaluate health risk due to heat. A leading scientist in heat and work studies helped interpret the data. The reporters also gathered scientific literature, public information and carried out interviews to show how high temperatures affect workers’ health and their work performance.","Our project accomplished impact on three levels. First, it engaged the main sources of research in meaningful ways. Five delivery drivers voluntarily agreed to put on core body temperature monitors during their work hours. They did so because they wanted to back up with data their demands to have access to drinking water and resting spots in the city during heat waves. It is worth mentioning the collaboration with one of the leading scientists in heat and work studies. Andreas Flouris became interested in our research and willingly suggested ways of improving our methodology. 

Second, we managed to convene a multi-stakeholder space to present the findings of our work. Delivery workers, representatives from the Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of Health, a senator, two deputies, a doctor and two urban designers gathered in our newsroom for a two-hour conversation where they discussed preventive and mitigation measures. 

Third, the Labor Ministry issued safety measures for workplaces during heat waves just a few weeks after the release of our findings. It is the first such warning we are aware of from a government entity. The warning was released by the office of the director who attended our multi-stakeholder space.","Although Paraguay is one of the most vulnerable countries in South America to the impacts of climate change, El Surtidor is the only news outlet that has had specialized in-depth coverage of the issue for at least four years. In this context, extreme weather events like heat waves may not seem unusual in the public agenda. But we put all of our efforts into unveiling how they are not normal. We do so by choosing angles to our stories that manage to bring the issues of the climate crisis closer to people and show them how its effects can affect their daily lives. 

It is worth mentioning the relative accessibility of the technology we used to measure the impact of heat on health and work performance. While newsrooms are scrambling to see how to incorporate AI technologies into their work, our focus remains on putting the issues that are relevant to our audience at the forefront of our decision-making processes. We also want to be strategic and choose technologies that are within our reach and are useful to answer the questions of our research.","Our experiment had two phases. In the first phase, we measured delivery workers’ core body temperatures by putting monitors on their chests. We wanted to see if they suffer heat stress during their work hours on hot days. The monitors are usually used by athletes, but they have become more common in some industries like construction work to prevent heat injuries. 

In the second phase, we measured the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT). According to scientists, it is the best way to measure health risk due to heat. We did so by requesting historical weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed and radiation) to the Weather Services on the same days the delivery workers carried the monitors. We used a tool by the Heat-Health Organization to calculate the WBGT. 

With the data from the monitors and the WBGT we confirmed that the urban workers are exposed to highly and extremely risky heat while working and that their bodies are in danger of short and long term injuries associated with high temperatures.","Our research is an example of how the coverage of the climate crisis can connect to people’s daily lives with data. It is key that newsrooms find ways to narrate probably the most important issue of our time to the public, and they can do so by looking at the aspects that people care about like work and general wellbeing and how these will be affected by climate change. 

The study also shows how to move beyond reporting on the problems and help contribute to thinking about the possible solutions. The work not only summarizes the effects of climate change on health and labor. It also proposes ways of addressing those impacts. 

Our work serves as a reference of how journalism and academia can collaborate to expose the dangers of climate change in a rigorous, innovative manner. A lot can be done with accessible, cheaper technology to measure data that otherwise would not be available. Finally, journalists can learn from our effort to spark dialogue around the findings of the work with key stakeholders.",Spanish,https://elsurti.com/futuros/especial/el-trabajo-en-riesgo-ante-un-calor-que-no-es-normal/,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/work-risk-face-unseasonable-heat,https://elpais.com/america-futura/2023-11-21/ser-repartidor-un-trabajo-de-riesgo-en-un-planeta-cada-vez-mas-caliente.html,https://elsurti.com/fotorreportaje/2023/11/20/como-es-trabajar-en-una-de-las-ciudades-mas-calientes-de-sudamerica/,,,,"Editorial direction and reporting: Jazmín Acuña

Spain,Civio and El País,Small,Shortlist,,Invisible queues at Social Security: not even a robot can find an appointment,31/03/2023,"Investigation, Database, Chart, Politics","Scraping, D3.js, CSV, R, RStudio","This investigation explores the difficulties encountered by individuals in Spain seeking Social Security appointments, specifically for pensions and the Minimum Living Income benefit. Using a robot, we systematically searched for available appointments. Despite consistent efforts over two weeks, our findings revealed that out of 414 offices, 43 lacked appointments for pensions, rising to 63 out of 394 for the Minimum Living Income. Even when appointments were available, half the time they were scheduled at least two weeks later.","Long after covid, some things remain the same in the administration, such as the requirement to make a prior appointment at social security offices. The inability to go to the office for a consultationwithout it was a real problem for people with tight time limits for receiving social benefits. The investigation we presented for this prize showed that in some cities it was almost impossible to get such an prior appointment. However, shortly after publication, the head of Spain's Ministry of Inclusion, Social Security and Migration told, in the Congress of Deputies, that the need for a prior appointment to access social security offices was fake news. We used social media to debunk the claim, showing how the social security website reaffirmed the denial of assistance without an appointment. Two days later, the message on the social security website was removed and the administration was now taking people into the offices without prior appointment. 

The investigation was published simultaneously on the websites of Civio and El País. On the day of publication it had 25,000 readers on each site. It was later republished by Cadena SER, Telemadrid, COPE and in regional media in Asturias, Aragón, Cataluña, Navarra and País Vasco.","Despite the Spanish government's introduction of several social benefits, a considerable number of potential beneficiaries remain underserved. At Civio, we delved into an investigation centering on two critical benefits: the Minimum Living Income, designed to aid low-income families, and pensions. The application process for these benefits is known for its bureaucratic complexity, primarily designed for online submissions with stringent deadlines. Unfortunately, some families lack the means or ability to navigate this process accurately, leading to a failure in accessing their entitled support. In this context, face-to-face administrative appointments can be very useful to fill the gap, so we opted to scrutinize the genuine accessibility of these appointments. Seeking national-level data on appointment availability from public administration would have proven laborious and contingent on the administration possessing such information. So we did our own research: among the 414 offices, 43 lacked available appointments for pension-related matters, and this figure increased to 63 out of 394 for the Minimum Living Income. Additionally, when an appointment was accessible, half the time it was scheduled at least two weeks later.","For this investigation, a Ruby web scraper was used to extract appointment data from the Social Security website across all regions of Spain (17). Data was collected three times a day from 6 March to 19 March, with gaps identified on 13 and 19 March at 17:00. A complete list of social security centres was downloaded to account for missing offices. The resulting data was visualised using D3.js in Observable, showing open offices according to the Social Security list and including five offices with available appointments that were missing from the extraction. Data cleaning in R ensured consistent records for each office. The final visualisation, created using JavaScript and D3.js, depicted delays in appointment availability. The graph ranked offices or provinces from worst to best taking into account delays and lack of availability.","In certain scenarios, journalists face challenges in proving the effectiveness of public administration initiatives. The process of obtaining data directly from these bodies tends to be time-consuming, potentially hindering reporting on the functionality of the policies being implemented. In such cases, web scraping emerges as a viable solution, as illustrated by a recent research project.

At Civio, we pride ourselves on fostering a collaborative environment that seamlessly blends diverse professional profiles. Our team includes individuals with expertise in both journalism and technology, facilitating the intersection of these disciplines.

Geojson.io","With the effects of the pandemic, the cost of living crisis and inflation hitting us all, we wanted to quantify the direct impact to the Scottish high streets and vacancy rates of retail spaces.

The only problem is that no data existed.

We therefore got out on foot in four cities and completed a census and then created hand drawn maps of every retail unit as well as interactive floor plans of every shopping centre.

We then analyse the data and publish regular reports on the health of our high streets.

And now we use the date to drive change.","Since launching we've heard from multiple sections of our community:

* our tracker articles all include a callout for crowdsourcing and we've had great engagement from readers and local business owners wanting to be involved in the project and keep the data up to date.
* we've heard from local government officials and council leaders within our patch telling us that their planning and urban development departments had been using our data.
* we've heard from local government officials outside our circulation area looking for support and advice on setting up similar projects in their area.
* we've heard from charities and community groups telling us they've been using our data.
* we've heard from school pupils asking to use our data in geography classes and looking for support and advice to complete similar projects on a smaller scale.
* we've heard from academics asking to use our data in Government reports.
* we've heard from university staff looking to use our data for teaching purposes.

We have a summary report available internally with up to the minute data for reporters to provide context for the regular articles they produce regarding store openings and closures and the comings and goings of the high streets across our patch.","This data does not exist elsewhere. There may be small snapshots of data on vacancy rates, and there may be some held privately, but there is no freely available up to the minute data. The number of people who have contacted us since releasing it, tells us that this was a problem.

Whilst we may technically qualify as a large newsroom, the data team is three individuals and resources are very limited.

This project is very resource intensive for such a small team - for each of the four cities we completed a census of the 1,809 retail units across 41 high streets and 8 shopping centres. After the initial census we complete a census once per quarter to quality assure the data and receive regular updates from reporters when they report on store openings and closures, in order to keep the tracker articles as up to the minute as possible.

For the vacant units across our patch we collated data on how long they have been vacant, which involved trawling through our archives, Companies House records, various social media accounts, speaking to estate agents etc in order to compile the best available data.","The base map data of units were hand drawn in Geojson.io. The Geojson was then imported to google sheets where the data for each unit was collated, and then Flourish pulls through the data from google sheets to create the interactive maps.

Interactive floor plans were drawn and edited in Figma. The associated data for the shopping centre units was collated to the same google sheet as above and SVGs of the floor plans were pulled through to Flourish and joined to the data from google sheets.

Google sheets was used to analyse all of the data and create aggregate data. Data from here was drawn through to Flourish to create all associated charts.

QGIS also helped us to map the logging permits granted by the Ministry of Forests from 2015 to 2021. Our analysis revealed that companies sanctioned for illegal logging, according to the ""sommier des infractions"" have obtained the largest areas of logging permits in Cameroon over the last six years.
We also used Planet imagery to show forest change over years in areas where timber was illegally harvested. Among other tools, we used datawrapper, flourish to visualize our data.","Trust is our keyword. 

The trust collaboration, newsroom included, is the key. To produce a collaborative work like ours, journalists need to be willing to work together and share everything. 
For an investigation on illegal logging, going on the field is important. But to do it, it is very important to prepare all the aspects, from people to meet to the security of the team. That last point is essential. To do it, having a trusted local journalist/source can help. 

After the testimonies of the populations, sources on the field, it is important to cross-reference with accurate documents/data/sources that can prove the denunciations, accusations or information. 

Then, as journalists, we need to read a lot of reports from the government, NGO or other organizations. Journalists also need to have a strong network of trusted sources and experts that could share information/data with them in a secure way. 

It is also essential to build a trusted relationship with sources involved in illegal practices and carefully listen to them. This helped us to get enough information on the global system of illegal timber trafficking and humanize the sources rather than demonize them.","English,French",https://infocongo.org/en/cameroons-undeterred-illegal-loggers/,https://infocongo.org/en/how-illegal-wood-escapes-control-circuits-in-cameroon/,https://infocongo.org/en/forest-communities-complicity-with-illegal-loggers/,https://infocongo.org/en/caught-between-conflicting-interests-of-govt-and-business-forest-communities-in-cameroon-squeezed-out/,,,,"Authors: Josiane Kouagheu and Madeleine Ngeunga

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Shortlist,,How Spanish victims of gender-based violence likelihood to be protected changes depending on where the complaint is lodged,29/11/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Chart, Map, Women, Crime","Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, JQuery, CSV, R, RStudio","Will the judge protect you? This investigative journalism project sheds light on the stark inequalities faced by women seeking protection from gender-based violence in Spain. Our analysis, drawing from data obtained from over 500 courts handling violence against women cases, unveils a concerning reality: the likelihood of a judge granting protection varies dramatically based on the location of the complaint. The staggering disparity, ranging from 24% to 100% in the approval of protection orders, underscores the influence of individual judges' positions, case overload, and the shortage of resources and awareness in the judicial system.","We unveiled the protection order rates for every specialized court in Spain, providing women in Spain unprecedented access to data that exposes systemic inequalities in the Spanish justice system. In fact, making this data available was the main goal of this project. By presenting comprehensive data, including interactive cartograms, graphics and maps, we aimed to equip women with valuable insights into the system inequalities they face when denouncing gender-based violence.

Our findings have not only empowered women to make informed decisions but also initiated a self-reflection among judges because “violence is the same in any territory”, as one of our sources explained to us. For example, this investigation allowed judges from different courts to compare their protection rate with all other specialized gender-based courts of the country, their justice area or even their region, which could lead to change of justice policies based on data. 

The investigation reveals that 17 courts conceded less than 40% of protection orders between 2005 and 2022, an indicator that these judges are protecting less women who denounce in those courts.","The data was obtained using an automated process to extract records from all annual reports, using an R script to get individual data from each court. Obtaining detailed and transparent data on protection order rates for every specialized cour in Spain required navigating through the bureaucratic system and a complex understanding of technical nomenclatures of the Spanish judicial system. For example, we had to interview several sources from the statistical offices of the administration of justice to understand the regulatory and data storage changes during the last two decades.

The analysis leads us to prove that the probability of a woman victim of gender-based violence securing a protection order multiplies based on the court she chooses for denunciation. These findings reveal wide disparities of the protection order rate across jurisdictions.

In-depth interviews were conducted with senior judges with years of expertise and judicial experts to understand the reasons behind this gap between different courts among the country. Factors such as individual judges' positions, case overload, and resource shortages emerged as key contributors. We believe that shedding light on these disparities is a crucial step forward to get positive changes within the Spanish justice system.","We utilized a combination of tools and technologies to conduct a comprehensive analysis. R, RStudio, and Excel were employed for data compilation and analysis. Graphics and maps were programmed using D3.js, Canvas, and Javascript. For the creation of straightforward charts, we utilized Datawrapper.","This project shows how the information available in the justice system could be exploited in other countries to check if there are disparities in the decisions of the justice system depending on the court judge on duty. This project shows how detailed data analysis could lead to reveal disparities and inequalities in action of justice, access to health or geographic segregation in every country. 

In Spain, access to highly disaggregated government data is more the exception than the rule. A limitation that often prevents this type of data analysis and the discovery of inequalities in public action. 

The narrative of this investigation can serve as an inspiration for journalists worldwide, encouraging them to proactively request and analyze highly disaggregated data from familiar statistical sources. While regional disparities are acknowledged, this story prompts a critical question: do we truly understand the extent to which inequality multiplies within specific contexts, be it educational centers, healthcare facilities, courts, or administrative centers? This inquiry invites a broader exploration into the nuanced landscape of disparities that may exist beyond regional boundaries, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of societal inequities.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/espana-protege-forma-desigual-victimas-violencia-genero-juzgados-rechazan-70-ordenes_1_10727651.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/buscador-ordenes-proteccion-violencia-genero-conceden-juzgado-juzgado_1_10729564.html,,,,,,"Raúl Sánchez, Marta Borraz, Ana Requena Aguilar, Victòria Oliveres","Raúl Sánchez: Spanish data journalist covering stories of inequality, gender, health, taxes and urbanism at elDiario.es.

United States of America,The New York Times,Big,Shortlist,,Alone and Exploited,25/02/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Open data, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Politics, Business, Immigration, Health, Economy, Employment, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Python, Node.js","This data-based series exposed the astonishing resurgence of child labor in the United States and revealed the profound policy failures that have led to this shadow workforce. Drawing on nearly two years of on-the-ground reporting and hundreds of thousands of rows of data about migrant children obtained through a federal lawsuit, The New York Times revealed a hidden workforce of children who fled impoverished homelands only to be trapped in grinding, dangerous jobs in America.","This work had immediate impact. Two days after the first piece was published, the White House launched a sweeping crackdown. “The New York Times story is heartbreaking and completely unacceptable,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. The Labor Department ramped up child labor enforcement, doubling the fines it collected. HHS substantially increased support for migrant children, including legal services and case management. ICE launched a new docket system for migrant children who may be victims of exploitation.

After Dreier’s article about missed warnings, Congress held oversight hearings with the heads of HHS and the Labor Department. Top Biden advisor Susan Rice resigned her post, one of the highest-level departures of Biden’s administration. 

Congress members from both parties introduced more than a dozen child labor bills. 

The reporting spurred lasting change at the state level, too, with at least six states passing enhanced child labor laws.

Global corporations named by The Times imposed stricter hiring standards for U.S. suppliers and began requiring auditors to visit hundreds of factories unannounced and scrutinize night shifts. 

As New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait said, “Hats off to a reporter for breaking a scandal so big the political system feels compelled to respond immediately.”","To find a hidden workforce of migrant children, we developed a new approach to analyzing federal data.

HHS shelters children when they arrive, but after releasing them to sponsors, doesn’t track them further. New York Times reporter Hannah Dreier’s early reporting suggested that children released to distant relatives and strangers were most likely to be put to work. So she filed multiple FOIA requests with HHS—and eventually sued—to obtain 550,000 rows of ZIP code-level data showing where children had been released to nonparent sponsors. We overlaid this with U.S. Census population density data to pinpoint areas with high concentrations of these children.

Dreier also used court records from PACER and state courts, as well as documents from dozens of FOIA requests to the Department of Labor and state agencies to hunt down other outcomes the government does not track. She built a database of migrant children killed on the job, including a 15-year-old who fell on his first day roofing and a 14-year-old who was hit by a car while delivering food. Another database showed how rarely the government prosecuted child labor trafficking cases. Another detailed the crushed limbs and seared lungs migrant children suffered in workplace injuries.","After months of back and forth, HHS gave us its data in an extremely messy format. 

In one case, HHS provided about six years of data as 70 individual files, one for each month, with merged cells, macros, special characters and other issues that made them not machine readable. Each file required manual cleaning just to ensure that the first row was the header.

Some of these problems were careless errors such as typos, but many were political in nature. For instance, many fields initially contained the term UC, for “Unaccompanied Child.” The Trump administration changed this to UAC, for “Unaccompanied Alien Child.” Biden then changed it back. These changes meant the data had references to UC and UAC scattered throughout in inconsistent ways.

We wrote a Node.js script to analyze and collate the cleaned headers. We used OpenRefine to cluster cell values and manually reviewed aggregate counts to find outliers. We found that thousands of rows with seemingly accurate but incomplete data were actually erroneous by checking column totals against other sources. 

We did our analysis in a few different ways and employed R, Python and mapshaper.org, as well as Node.js.","This project was an exercise in making due with non-ideal data. In one case, we asked HHS for county-level data, but they gave us ZIP codes instead. To turn this into a county-level database, we used GeoCorr from the University of Missouri Census Data Center, which provides equivalency tables based on Census populations. We then used a Node.js program to turn our ZIP code data into a county-level map. From there, we could decide where to deploy for on-the-ground reporting.

After intensive cleaning, the thousands of pages of documents obtained through our FOIA lawsuit allowed us to report on a host of government failures. Among other findings, we were able to report the staggering statistic that HHS could not reach more than 85,000 children just weeks after they were released to sponsors. 

After Dreier wrote a piece explaining her process, congressional staffers, academics, journalists and even Labor Department officials requested access to our database. As part of our commitment to helping others investigate, The Times made this data public.

Here are detailed data analysis methodologies that explain step-by-step what we did:
https://www.propublica.org/article/pandemic-outbreak-guinea-forest-propublica-analysis 
https://www.propublica.org/article/ebola-spillover-machine-learning-methodology-nigeria","ProPublica wondered what governments and international health agencies were doing to prevent the next pandemic. In this series we exposed an overlooked cause of outbreaks: deforestation. We applied real world data to a theoretical model, examining sites of previous Ebola outbreaks and showing how they are at higher risk than they were when their outbreaks occurred.

We trained a machine-learning model to determine if places where Ebola had never emerged had similar characteristics to outbreak locations. The model considered millions of locations in 27 countries, and identified 51 locations with patterns of tree loss similar to the previous Ebola outbreaks.","We blended on-the-ground reporting and photography in West Africa with statistical modeling and an original analysis of satellite imagery to examine risky patterns of forest loss. 

It’s easy for Western readers to blame local residents — to blithely say, just stop cutting down the forest. That’s why it was important to let readers hear from residents of Meliandou, the village where the world’s worst Ebola outbreak began. They told us that they have no choice but to keep chipping away at the forest in order to grow food or they’d starve. We found farming experts with ideas that could help villagers increase their yields and break the pattern of constant deforestation. The world has produced more than 40 reports on what went wrong during that epidemic, yet a top Guinean rice expert we interviewed said none of the authors of those reports ever asked him or his colleagues for advice. A story we reported from Madagascar detailed more solutions that few global-health authorities had considered.

Our machine-learning model identified 27 locations concentrated in Nigeria, a country that has never seeded an Ebola outbreak. Reporters found a lack of outbreak preparedness there – spotlighting areas that could benefit from funding and attention.","We traveled to Meliandou, Guinea, to show how this tiny village surrounded by forest is emblematic of the short-sighted global public health system. Meliandou is where a virus that once lived inside a bat found its way into the cells of a toddler, setting off the world’s worst Ebola outbreak. Health care workers clad head to toe in protective gear rushed to West Africa to treat the sick and extinguish the epidemic, an effort that took more than two years and cost at least $3.6 billion. Then, the foreign doctors packed up and the medical tents came down.

We wondered what the world had done to keep disaster from striking again. Reporting in Meliandou, we found that if Ebola were to emerge from the forest again, there’s little to stop the virus from ravaging this village and spreading beyond its borders once more. Residents there still rely on a clinic with no electricity or running water. Patients wash their hands in the same bucket. It’s staffed by a single midwife who has none of the head-to-toe PPE she’d need. “We are suffering,” village chief Jiba Masandouno told us. “The government has forgotten us. The international community has forgotten us.”","We brought the science to life by taking a theoretical mathematical model and applying real world data to it, examining sites of previous Ebola outbreaks and showing how they had changed. To get a sense of the current risk of spillover from deforestation in Meliandou and other sites of Ebola outbreaks, ProPublica consulted with a dozen researchers for its own analysis. We applied data on tree loss from historical satellite images taken between 2000 and 2021 — the most recent year that was available at that time — and tested tens of thousands of infection scenarios. That’s how we determined that sites of prior outbreaks are at higher risk than before.

As a companion piece, we created an interactive page that guided readers through the science, allowing them to cut down an imaginary forest and see how creating more and more patches increases the opportunities for humans and wildlife to mix. 

We also developed a machine learning model that looks for the same troubling patterns of deforestation in locations where outbreaks have never before been caused by spillover. This model was based on the same historic satellite images, as well as data about human populations in these areas.","We found one academic paper after another saying that deforestation is linked to outbreaks. But we also found that global health leaders aren’t acting on this information, preferring instead to focus on responding to epidemics already underway. The science shows that computational tools can help people take preventative measures to prevent an outbreak. So we decided to adapt the science to show readers exactly how deforestation might lead to the next big epidemic.

With powerful narratives, immersive photography, animated graphics and an unprecedented use of statistical modeling and satellite imagery, we translated complicated science into stories that explained why we need to act now, if we want to prevent the next pandemic.

Often, public health funding goes through a cycle of panic and neglect, with urgent calls for action during an emergency, then attention fades and people move on. Now is the time when post mortems of the COVID-19 pandemic are still underway, and governments are actively discussing how to spend funds to prevent the next one. Our hope is that through this explanatory series, we can help deepen the conversation about the root causes of outbreaks and help the public as well as policymakers explore new paths to prevention.","All stories were in English.

United States of America,STAT,Big,Shortlist,,STAT Obesity Drug Tracker,12/09/2023,"Database, Open data, Chart, Health","Json, Node.js, Airtable, Svelte, Git","Novel drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy began a wholesale transformation of obesity treatment in 2023. In conjunction with our series covering this “Obesity Revolution,” STAT developed a unique data tool, the Obesity Drug Tracker, to provide an early look at even more powerful or targeted applications that companies hope to develop for consumers. The tracker is based upon meticulous analysis and curation of clinical trial data, analyst notes, press releases, and original reporting. It offers an up-to-date snapshot of dozens of new drugs under development in this rapidly expanding, highly competitive sector.","STAT readers were effusive in praise for the utility and innovation of this tool. One staffer in the U.S. Senate called the tool “head and shoulders above every other resource,” and said that this database would be instrumental in informing policymakers as they navigate this complex topic. In one month, the tool racked up over 15,000 visits and led directly to 33 new subscriptions to our premium service STAT+, with readers spending over 200 seconds on average on the page, all well above median values for typical posts on our site.","Building this tool required a great deal of reporting leg work as well as leveraging expertise from sources as well as STAT reporters and editors, in finding, interpreting, and parsing complex technical information from a wide array of sources. Few media outlets would be prepared to undertake such a reporting challenge. Meanwhile, it was a significant challenge to design the underlying database to be performant, flexible, and easy for non-technical reporters to use.","We designed a complex database with a custom editing interface powered by Airtable that allows reporters to quickly input and edit entries and cross-reference them with companies, drug categories, and development statuses. Node.js was used on the backend to power a microservice that pulls data out of Airtable and into a version-controlled repository that’s then mirrored on our CDN. A fully custom frontend was developed using the Svelte framework to both compute and visualize statistics about the data as well to allow readers to explore and filter the full dataset on their own.",Readers and the public can often be served by publishing versions of what would otherwise be only internal reporting materials. That collaboration between developers and reporters can turn such internal reporting into robust tools that are equally useful to reporters and to readers.

Vue.js","The ‘Test Político’ is a data-driven application based in the vector theory that acts as an affinity test. 

By answering 17 questions, the user discovers which of the presidential pre-candidates is most in line with their ideas. 

Our algorithm weighs each question with different values and, as the questionnaire progresses, relocates the user's position on both the vertical axis and the horizontal axis of the political compass. 

At the end, the reader may compare themselves with the candidates, whose ideologies were determined through exhaustive research. Its objective is to inform and entertain the audience by focusing on campaign proposals.","It was the production with the most pageviews of 2023 in LA NACION, with a total of 3.5 million visits, and it is the most read feature in the newspaper's online history. 

On the day of its publication alone, the article had more than 1 million pageviews and registered, on average, 10 responses per second. It remained on the homepage for more than 160 consecutive hours.

The project created a lot of engagement among politicians and opinion leaders from all political areas. Even the candidates themselves took the test and published their answers on social networks. One of them was the candidate and current president of Argentina, Javier Milei. 

Additionally, other candidates played it live on TV or mentioned it as a topic in the presidential debates.

And its impact did not end there. LN’s quiz went viral and became a topic of conversation among families and friend groups. 

Social networks were flooded with people sharing the results, comments on the development and even memes. The project became a trending topic on Twitter/X. In turn, it was replicated by other portals and entertainment shows.","Several challenges were faced for this production. Firstly, to define how we could convert a political response into mathematical logic. What does “closeness to a candidate” mean? How does it translate into a number? What weight is assigned to each question? What movement should each one create? This process required several iterations between journalists and data analysts until we reached a solid product.

Another challenge was Argentina's fragile political, social and economic context: 40% poverty, over 160% year-over-year inflation and distrust in traditional political parties. This translates into a strong apathy toward political information and increases polarization. In this context, LA NACION managed to captivate the audience by offering a more entertaining and disruptive proposal for political coverage.

Establishing the political positions of the candidates on some issues was a challenge for the journalistic research in a context of empty electoral platforms, contradictory statements and ambiguous positions. After its publication, the production was spread by leaders of every political party, which shows that the research was serious and accurate.","For the backend development of the project, different AWS services were used: API Gateway is the endpoint through which our audience accesses the interactive application; Lambda was used to execute the code that stored information in the database and created the response output; the WAF service provided the security layer to prevent massive HTTP attacks; RDS was used to open a PostgreSQL database that represented our data model and where the information was persisted; and S3 was used to make the already-processed data available in JSON format to the frontend. In turn, we used Python. 

Regarding the frontend, we used several JavaScript libraries. The application was made in vue.js and the graphics were built in d3.js. To animate the visualization we used three.js, which uses the computer’s video card to allow for a more fluid user experience. 

During the development of the application, we used Google Sheets, which allowed flexibility in the interaction between the development and journalistic teams. Once that process was completed, a static file was created in node.js to run faster. 

RStudio was used for the internal analysis of the almost 2 million unique questionnaires.","We believe that part of the success of this production was the simplification and gamification of political information, and the personalization of the final result. At the end, it created a shareable product, which challenged the user and made them want to share it with other people in networks or know how it had gone for others.
A second lesson learned: the importance of being UX-friendly. We incorporated small incentives such as a progress counter and messages to encourage the reader to reach the end.

As a third lesson, we highlight the journalistic decision to infer the candidates' answers to position them ideologically. We avoided interviewing them personally to avoid bias in their answers or the possibility that the project would be affected if any of them did not respond. The research task was crucial in this aspect.

Brazil,Estadão,Big,,,BBB 23 e IA,09/01/2023,"Chart, Culture","AI/Machine learning, Python","A reportagem usou técnicas de reconhecimento facial para calcular o tempo de tela de participantes da versão brasileira do reality show Big Brother (Big Brother Brasil). Utilizando recursos de Inteligência Artificial (IA), foi possível estimar o protagonista entre os 26 participantes escolhidos para edição 2023. Ao todo, 90 episódios foram percorridos pela ferramenta, em 89 horas de programa avaliados.","Ao experimentar o uso de IA e reconhecimento facial em uma reportagem jornalística no Brasil, a iniciativa abre novas perspectivas para a análise – e visualização – de dados não-estruturados.

Isso porque a reportagem não apenas forneceu informações sobre os participantes do reality, mas também evidenciou, de forma pioneira nacionalmente, como recursos desta natureza já são uma realidade. 

Serve como aceno para o uso responsável de ferramentas de IA dentro de rotinas jornalísticas, além de mostrar que é possível utilizar dados para materiais culturais com o mesmo rigor que outras coberturas. Nos propusemos a plantar a semente para inspirar outros profissionais a explorarem o poder da tecnologia em suas próprias narrativas.

A reportagem conquistou o 1º lugar do Prêmio Cláudio Weber Abramo de Jornalismo de Dados - a maior premiação da área no Brasil -, na categoria de Inovação e Experimentação.","Ao iniciar o projeto, as referências jornalísticas para saber se era possível trabalhar neste caminho eram poucas. A produção de notícias brasileira ainda não tinha abraçado a IA como ferramenta e os exemplos estrangeiros que encontramos possuíam um escopo maior e mais investigativo do que seria possível aplicar dentro das limitações da nossa equipe (somos três: dois jornalistas de dados e um designer).

Por isso, está incluído no tempo de produção deste material (que durou um mês e meio) também o tempo para aprender a tecnologia, tão inédita para a equipe até aquele momento quanto foi para o público na publicação do material. 

Ao escolher o Big Brother como foco do nosso projeto, consideramos não apenas sua popularidade, mas também os desafios enfrentados em uma tarefa tão complexa. O reconhecimento facial, uma técnica pouco usada no jornalismo brasileiro, tornou-se mais gerenciável ao ser aplicado em um programa de entretenimento como este. 

A escolha estratégica de abordar um ambiente descontraído permitiu uma atenção mais detalhada à técnica do reconhecimento facial, minimizando possíveis erros.","Utilizamos técnicas avançadas de Deep Learning para desenvolver um software de reconhecimento facial personalizado, permitindo a identificação e análise dos participantes do BBB 23 em cada frame. 

Ferramentas Python como OpenCV e Face Recognition foram fundamentais na implementação dessas técnicas, permitindo que algoritmos de visão computacional fossem empregados para processar grandes volumes de dados visuais. 

Treinamos um modelo CNN para identificar 128 pontos faciais, utilizando diversas imagens dos mais de 20 competidores no processo de pós-treinamento. O modelo calcula a semelhança facial, possibilitando a medição do tempo de tela de cada participante em cada episódio do reality show.

Com o script pronto, processamos as quase 90 horas de vídeos da edição do BBB 23 exibidos na TV aberta, no canal da TV Globo de Televisão. Cada vídeo precisava de 3 vezes mais tempo para ser analisado pelo nosso software, o que resultou em mais de 10 dias em que o script precisou ser rodado no computador da redação, de forma ininterrupta. 

Para as visualizações presentes na reportagem, utilizamos gráficos estáticos e dinâmicos produzidos por meio da ferramenta Flourish.","Este projeto serve como um guia inovador para jornalistas interessados em explorar as fronteiras da IA no jornalismo de dados. Demonstra a viabilidade e relevância do uso de reconhecimento facial para análise de eventos midiáticos, abrindo caminho para a incorporação de técnicas de Deep Learning em outras narrativas jornalísticas.

Os profissionais podem aprender a adaptar essa abordagem para diferentes contextos, enriquecendo suas reportagens com insights valiosos obtidos por meio da IA.

Fertility is lost as a result of over-exploitation. The population is consequently getting hold of forest areas to make fertile fields and is threatening the boundaries of parks and forests. There is wildlife predation and the use of practices such as slash-and-burn agriculture. These farmers’ new fields are weakening rivers such as the Rusizi in Burundi. In the DRC, migrations to the rainforests are no longer solving the problem of the fields.","The project inspired the First Lady to organise the High-Level Forum of Women Leaders on population growth in Burundi, land reduction and family planning as a solution. It has also inspired other media to increase coverage of environmental issues in the DRC and Burundi that were being subtracted locally.","We'd like the jury to know about the environmental, social and economic challenges posed by land scarcity as a result of population growth.","Through data visualization, investigations and photos, we have shown how land scarcity is pushing farmers to take over fertile land in the forests with the complicity of the forest guards. 
As a result, wild animals ravage the fields, leading to human/wildlife conflicts, traps to protect crops and the disappearance of wildlife and destruction of vegetation. In addition, these fields flagify the banks of rivers. We have also shown how land scarcity is at the root of land conflicts and the migration of the population of the DRC into the forests in search of arable land and the rise in malaria.

United Kingdom,The BMJ,Small,,,#MeToo in Medicine,23/05/2023,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Women, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","We aimed to reveal the prevalence of sexual assault in the English health service (NHS) by collecting data on the number and nature of reports made to hospitals by staff and patients. We sought information on what systems were in place for preventing, recording and managing such incidents within hospitals. Shockingly, we found around 35,000 cases of rape, sexual assault, harassment, stalking and abusive remarks recorded between 2017-2022. Only 10% of trusts had a dedicated policy to manage the problem. We created a landing page to showcase the content, including a striking infographic, individual testimonies (video) and opinion articles.","Extensive coverage in the British media, from BBC networks to national newspapers. The BMJ ran a well-attended webinar for doctors where experts discussed how NHS trusts could do better. In the wake of the investigation, medical trade unions, royal medical colleges and UK political parties called for an urgent independent inquiry into the matter. In Parliament, Daisy Cooper, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, called for government action.
A month after publication, NHS England, which runs the health service, told hospital chiefs to review their policies for handling sexual safety incidents and to consider adopting dedicated policies on sexual safety. In August, the General Medical Council (GMC), which regulates the medical profession in the UK, issued explicit guidance to doctors, saying they “must not act in a sexual way towards colleagues.” In September, NHS England asked trusts, general practices, and medical royal colleges to sign up for a sexual safety charter aimed at eradicating sexual harassment in the NHS. A lawyer quoted in the story is also developing a training course on managing sexual safety for hospital trusts in light of the findings.","Anonymous accounts from female surgeons of sexual assault by male (usually senior) colleagues collected by the group Survivors in Scrubs indicate that there is a misogynistic culture in medicine. These victims often do not report the assaults because they fear it will affect their career. Where cases have been reported to the GMC, women report a lack of support, or a successful outcome. We asked all regulators of health professionals for numbers and outcomes of reported cases, and the GMC persistently refused to provide these data - the only regulator to do so.
We faced resistance from hospitals to freedom of information requests. The FOI Act in England includes a cost limit of £450 (18 hours of work) for public authorities which severely restricts the amount of data they have to release. Data has been collected to show there is a problem with sexual assault in the NHS previously, but over a shorter period and fewer sources. It took us 8 months and 5 rounds of freedom of information requests to collect the information reported.","We wanted to collect data on a large number of incidents over 5 years from NHS trusts, plus details on how trusts handled these incidents and their sexual health policies (if any). Aware that the FOI Act in England limits the work required by public authorities, therefore restricting the amount of data released, two BMJ journalists combined forces with two Guardian newspaper journalists to collect different aspects of the data. We shared the data, but pursued separate angles and separate stories from staff and patients affected. 
We also asked for extremely detailed data for the same period on sexual assaults reported to and acted upon by the police. These data showed not only the number of cases recorded by the police was much smaller than reported to trusts, but also gave us more detail about the victims, suspected perpetrators and offence types. Unexpectedly we found police forces had recorded multiple cases of gang rape on NHS premises, including of children.","Tenacity: Many of the trusts and police forces rejected our FOI requests, some multiple times. We created armouries of responses to cover all potential reasons for refusal which could be combined easily to challenge rejections. 
Multiple data sources: This enabled us to gain a fuller picture of the extent of sexual assault in the NHS and how it is handled.
Collaboration: Combining forces with The Guardian to collect data enabled us to collect a greater volume and more detailed data as we could circumvent the cost constraints of the FOI Act to some extent. 
Comprehensiveness: Where organisations refused to provide data over the full period due to cost constraints we scoured their FOI logs for responses to similar previous FOI requests and used that data. As a result, we have collected the most comprehensive data on sexual assaults over an extended period.
Detail: By asking for full anonymised data from the police, as well as case numbers, we gained a greater understanding of the victims and the perpetrators, and discovered multiple unexpected types of incidents, such as gang rapes.",English,https://www.bmj.com/me-too-investigation,https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/381/bmj.p1105/F1.large.jpg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JIy86ufyuU,https://www.bmj.com/content/381/bmj.p1117,,,,"For The BMJ Adele Waters, Ingrid Torjesen, Will Stahl Timmins, Madlen Davies, Duncan Jarvies, Leticia Amorim

United States of America,"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ProPublica",Big,,,With Every Breath: Millions of Breathing Machines. One Dangerous Defect.,19/12/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Video, Health","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","In a series of stories that prompted a federal government investigation of the FDA and immediate calls by top US senators for a criminal probe, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and ProPublica reporters exposed how global powerhouse Philips Respironics concealed thousands of complaints about a dangerous defect in its popular breathing machines over the course of a decade. The FDA has since logged more than 370 reports of deaths and thousands of cases of cancer tied to the devices that were meant to save lives.","Federal lawmakers immediately responded, calling for investigations of Philips by the Department of Justice and the FDA. Calling the stories “explosive,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the FDA and DOJ “must urgently use all of their authorities to protect current and future patients by investigating these allegations thoroughly, taking the strongest enforcement action possible, including criminal charges.”

The Government Accountability Office launched an investigation of the FDA’s oversight of medical devices following the Post-Gazette and ProPublica story that revealed the agency had received hundreds of warnings about the defective machines in the years leading up to the Philips recall, but never launched an investigation or halted the company from selling the devices.

“It now appears that FDA missed several opportunities to mitigate the harm done to the millions of patients who have used these recalled medical devices,” the senators wrote. “It is not clear whether or not FDA took action to inform hospitals, health care providers, and patients about the potential risks.”","The reporting was largely based on data that medical device manufacturers are required to submit to the FDA after they receive complaints about product malfunctions or patient injuries and deaths. But the FDA’s Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience, or MAUDE, tracking system is cumbersome and difficult to navigate. MAUDE has few analytic capabilities – essentially, it’s only possible to view one complaint at a time. Even calculating aggregate numbers is impossible.

It took reporters months to identify the nuances in the MAUDE reporting system and find a workaround to the many gaps and inconsistencies. Longtime public health advocates, academics and researchers are now using our data analysis to conduct their own studies.","Over the course of months, reporters used Device Events (a private company aggregator of FDA data) to pull more than 100,000 reports about the recalled machines. Because the records include the date the company received each complaint, reporters were able to determine how long it took Philips to submit them to the FDA. Our investigation found that Philips failed to submit more than 3,700 complaints about the recalled machines – in some cases, waiting years before turning them over to the FDA.

Reporters also used data to track lax oversight by the FDA, which regulates the medical device industry. Last year alone, 1 in 8 reports – more than 232,000 complaints – were submitted past the 30-day deadline, leaving regulators and the public without badly needed safety information.

The analysis also exposed the troubling use of an FDA directive that instructs manufacturers to change the dates they first became aware of potential defects, making it appear as if they only recently learned about breakdowns that occurred months or even years earlier. Reporters identified the practice after using web scraping to compare original dates in Device Events to those currently appearing in the government’s public-facing MAUDE database.","Since the massive recall of breathing machines by Philips Respironics in June 2021, we found that other news outlets — such as the New York Times and Washington Post — had already reported on the company’s efforts to pull its defective machines off the shelves. But because we were based in Pittsburgh, the headquarters of Philips Respironics, we knew there was much so more to this story from our sources on the ground. 

What helped us separate our work from the competition was a deep dive into the data, which showed that Philips was routinely hiding complaints about the dangerous defects, depriving critical information (and warnings) from millions of patients that something was radically wrong with these machines. The data also helped us track the death and injury reports associated with the devices.

Never underestimate the power of data; it can make all the difference. Our analysis, in addition to interviews we carried out with key sources in the Pittsburgh area, led to the most comprehensive and hard-hitting investigation of the massive recall. Ultimately, our work became a vital source of information for patients around the world.",English,https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24361936/with-every-breath.pdf,https://www.propublica.org/article/philips-cpap-recall-documentary-video,https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/philips-respironics-cpap-defect-recall/timeline.php,,,,,"**Primary Reporters:** Michael D.

Custom JS","Unsettled Debt: Africa, The Climate Crisis &amp; You is an interactive data story which was published in the lead up to the United Nations COP28 climate conference. It is designed to highlight the inequalities of the climate crisis in Africa: contextualising the need for debt relief and funding for renewable energy, as a necessary part of the broader global activity to reach Paris Accord targets for reducing the impacts of the climate crisis. Sub-Saharan countries spend a large amount of their own resources dealing with the consequences of a changing climate, despite producing little in the way of greenhouse gas emissions.","Africa Data Hub’s audience primarily consists of journalists and researchers from across the continent, and as a result initial readership of the article is targeted. We are measuring its impact over time, but largely as a resource for use by other journalists both for inclusion in their own work and as a showcase for the potential of data-driven journalism to engage readers across Africa on climate issues. It seeks to advance the SDG Goal 13, which demands urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

It was well received and shared among activists in the Climate Action Network in the run up to and during COP28, through the Earth Journalism Network and a private Signal group for co-ordinating communications. Work on the feature has helped to pave the way for future collaborations, for example with Debt Justice and the University of Exeter.

It has received a positive response from several academics who have expressed an interest in using it as a teaching tool to highlight the importance of global solutions to climate issues, and the interconnected nature of resource exploitation, historical debt, environmental issues and human development.

It has been used in three workshops hosted by OpenUp.","This project is part of ongoing collaborative work to support African journalists reporting on climate-related issues through the use of data-driven storytelling techniques. Our work began in 2023 with the Africa Climate Observer (https://www.africadatahub.org/data-resources/climate-observer), which for the first time makes comprehensive historical climate data for African locations accessible.

As documented by the Reuters Institute, audiences and news organisations in the Global South often do not prioritise climate coverage over other pressing issues. Audiences in the Global North, meanwhile, may not be aware of the financial burden carried by Global South countries in dealing with the impact of a changing climate that they didn’t cause.

To address these gaps, we demonstrate the connection between climate solutions and human development/economic growth, and conversely show the negative impact of debt run up to fund fossil fuel extraction. We highlighted the historical responsibility of the Global North to fund climate solutions, and the importance of enabling human development in a sustainable way. African leaders often use the phrase: “We do not come as beggars” to discuss climate financing, which provided a useful motif to introduce a solutions-driven element to the reporting, and help to make complex issues more accessible for journalists and their audiences.","We employed a combination of tools and techniques. Leveraging Webflow for all of the front-end implementation, we designed a scrollytelling data story which prioritised responsiveness but also the seamless integration of captivating and creative narrative elements.

The backbone of this project was custom-built animations, hand-crafted using Webflow’s animation library, JavaScript, RAWGraphs and custom SVG charts that allowed us to represent our data in a compelling, interactive and responsive way. Our goal was to create narrative blocks that could stand alone and, due to their responsiveness, be faithfully represented on mobile devices and easily repurposed for social media and marketing. 

As a non-profit organisation, one of the other requirements we had was to keep our hosting, subscription and maintenance fees as low as possible for this project. We wanted to make sure that the outputs of our work could be exported and hosted as a standalone website with no ongoing fees. As such, our entire tech stack was free-to-use software and we did not leverage any subscription based mapping or data visualisation software. This also means that the project is replicable for the purposes of including it in training materials, and of better reference for our target audience of African-based journalists.","Key outcomes for this project were to inspire and train other journalists from across Africa to incorporate data-driven storytelling into their reporting. Several of our own surveys over the last few years have attempted to understand why they do not already do so when it comes to climate reporting. 

The first key obstacle is availability of data - we believe we have shown that not only is good data available, but we have made it more accessible through this and related projects. 

A second obstacle is around the cost of tools, which we believe we have shown to be a secondary concern. We also believe that we have demonstrated effective ways to publish across multiple channels with data interactives, by taking specific sequences and animations from the main story and reusing them as social media stories.

While we do not expect all journalists who pass through our training courses or follow Africa Data Hub and OpenUp’s work to be able to replicate the complexity of Unsettled Debt, we do believe that we have created an aspirational example of data-driven storytelling that future trainees and the Africa Data Hub readership will be inspired by in their work.",English,https://unsettleddebt.africadatahub.org/,https://openup.org.za/blog/how-we-made-the-interactive-about-climate-debt-justice,https://www.africadatahub.org/data-resources/climate-observer,,,,,"Adam Oxford, Matthew Stark, Yuxi Wang, Dirk Meerkotter","The team that created the project are based at OpenUp, a South African civic tech and media organiastion that supports journalists and journalism organisations with training, design, development, dashboard and data collaborations.

This became as much a story about transparency and differing levels of access to information as the funding itself. Without transparency it becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to see what this funding is going towards and whether it really is into research that supports the ecological transition, as is often claimed.","Post-publication there was a lot of interest from colleagues asking about our methodology and wanting to apply this to foia requests to universities in their countries. There is scope to scale this project up, but also apply it to other areas that industry funding to research can be seen as influential. 

We found that accessing this information varied greatly in different countries, some eg Spain, were more open than we'd expected. Others, eg Portugal, we received nothing. We found UK universities in particular receiving large sums of money, and while some of this goes to projects viewed as transitional, they are also often those that align closely with the aims of oil companies eg carbon capture storage. The story was published with media partners in the UK, in Spain, in Italy and on the IE website, Italy was a particularly interesting example as universities had been challenged by Greenpeace to release data that they had previously withheld.","In November 2023 we published a story that looked at the funding universities are accepting from fossil fuel companies despite many of them having committed to achieving net zero.

Without transparency it becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to see what this funding is going towards and whether it really is into research that supports the ecological transition, as is often claimed.","This story was totally reliant on freedom of information requests, or requests for environmental information in countries where this was more appropriate. While it was originally about the amount of funding universities receive from fossil fuel companies, it also illustrated, in many countries, a glaring lack of transparency and shortcomings in being able to access this information.

For those countries that were happy to share information, the data was collated, cleaned and anaylised, so finding the numbers in the data involved data journalism techniques.","We were immediately approached by other journalists either asking if we could share our data and/or the methodology. 

The methodology was easy to share as it was clearly documented and planned with the intention of both sharing and scaling up. 

The data we would have liked to have published and made available for anyone to use, but it was too dirty to be able to confidently do this. We were able to share some data and understand that further work is being done. 

The good thing about this project/ methodology, is that in addition to being scaled-up, it can also be applied to other areas where there is concern that funding from industry is going primarily to research that supports their interests.","Main story English, but also stories in Italian, Spanish and Norwegian",https://www.investigate-europe.eu/posts/european-universities-accept-260-million-euros-fossil-fuel-money,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/shell-bp-equinor-totalenergies-oxford-cambridge-bristol-ucl-big-oil-gas-fossil-fuels-158m/,https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/in-edicola/articoli/2023/12/04/quei-soldi-di-big-oil-agli-atenei-europei-si-fa-ma-non-si-dice/7372875/,https://www.infolibre.es/internacional/universidades-europeas-aceptan-265-millones-empresas-combustibles-fosiles_1_1652214.html,,,,"Juliet Ferguson (Investigate Europe)

United Kingdom,"The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, the University of Glasgow’s Urban Big Data Centre",Big,,,Hot Homes,05/12/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Environment, Health","Sensor, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap, Python, Google Forms, GroundSource, Smart Citizen Kit Sensor","Hot Homes was a collaboration between south London residents, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the University of Glasgow’s Urban Big Data Centre. 


The project explored how housing impacts people’s experience of heatwaves and what impact this has on their health. In the summer of 2023, 40 homes in the London Borough of Southwark – one of the hottest places in the UK – were fitted with temperature sensors. Such data has never been recorded before. 


Participants also recorded their experiences via weekly surveys, interviews, text messages, voicenotes, journals and photos.


The monitor data and participant testimonies revealed a stark situation.","After data collection, we arranged an event in Southwark and invited residents, local councillors and other interested parties. Participants expressed how much they got from the project. One said: “It's important to know that heat adaptivity is even being looked at, no-one seems to know about things that can help it and it feels very lonely.”


We published the open dataset so academics, policymakers and campaigners can use it. We also gave each participant a detailed summary of findings from their property so that they can use this as evidence with landlords etc to secure improvements to their homes. One has already said they plan to use the data to make a complaint.


The independent London Resilience Plan team will use our findings in its upcoming recommendations for the Mayor of London, and Southwark Council is using our work to inform its 2024 climate adaptations plans. Our findings are being used by architectural firms and we are feeding into research on how better to communicate extreme heat in the media. 


“The dataset is really useful,” says UCL’s Professor Anna Mavrogianna. “Adding to the evidence base … is a fundamental step towards increasing awareness, informing policy decisionmaking and identifying solutions.”","In 2019, the UK’s Climate Change Committee warned that UK homes “are not fit for the future” in terms of heat. But there has been little data gathered to show how people experience heat in their homes. 


Awareness is poor. “People in heating-dominated countries, such as the UK, may not fully consider risks associated with heat,” says Professor Mavrogianni. The media landscape doesn’t help. “It’s well documented that the narrative around hot summers in the UK are ones of beach holidays and ‘fun in the sun’,” says climate scientist Chloe Brimicombe. “The lack of stories and evidence of the impact of heat in the UK makes it more difficult for the risk to be understood and this is a barrier for creating evidence-based policy.” 


Meanwhile, research recently published by the Center for Countering Digital Hate warns that a new wave of denial about climate change is on the rise. And the UK government has rolled back on key green policies, some of them relating to housing. 


Against this backdrop, it was of huge importance to show the realities of what it’s really like inside UK homes in summer – and engage the communities directly on this issue.","We used a citizen science sensor called Smart Citizen Kit to measure the indoor environment. The sensor measures air temperature, relative humidity, light and sound levels, CO2 levels, volatile compounds and particulates in the air. We used Python to analyse the data and generate visualisations. Initial analysis code can be found in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/congying-hu/SensorEnhancedSurveyHeatInvestigation


We distributed participant surveys focusing on a different topic each week. The surveys were created in Google Forms and the responses were analysed via a system of thematic coding, allowing us to extract insights in addition to the quantitative data the surveys collected.


Throughout we used the text messaging platform GroundSource to communicate with our participants both en masse and individually. This allowed us to quickly and easily keep the cohort up to date with the project plans, gather responses to surveys, answer individuals’ queries, and collect some revealing personal testimony.


The use of these technologies were guided by overarching principles of community organising. Months before the monitors were installed, the project team spent time building links with local organisations and residents, in person and online – and this dialogue continued throughout.","This project was a pilot for an issue that affects people across the world. We’re already preparing to share our methodology and are talking to potential partners, including Thompson Reuters Foundation, about replicating this work in other regions. 

1. “That journalists and academics can be very effective partners and collaborators,” says Dr Qunshan Zhao, one of our research partners. “Journalists have the special eyes to find the best points to report and gain overall attention from the general public, and academics have the research and data analysis skills and capacities to provide robust scientific evidence … More collaboration is needed to address the common issues in this planet.” 

2. The value of working closely with a community to generate rich data that fills a data gap. Our surveys and engagement activities generated compelling testimony and data that reveals the extent of the health impacts. 

3. Doing the above requires proper time, resources, patience and good humour! Community-led reporting is a two-way street. 

4. Go the extra mile to make your findings truly useful.

It also visualized statistics of EV fires occurred over the past years, and the types and the total number of equipments owned by the National Fire Agency to prepare for such incidents.","EV fires have increased in line with a rising demand on electric vehicles. The same goes for the public anxiety about EV fires. This project compares the data on whether electric vehicle fires occurred in proportion to the number of electric vehicle registrations by year. In conclusion, it was shown that the proportion of EV fires was lower than that of vehicles using internal combustion engines.
Typically in the case of a EV fire, news reports explained how a fire is erupted in text, however, this project aims to visually explain how a fire breaks out on a EV by simultaneously showing the structure of the batteries and the insides of a EV.
As South Korea's key news wire, Yonhap provided the infographics to many other news outlets, so they can refer to it when writting stories of EV fires. The entire graphic, and parts were published in local media outlets.","In order to explain a EV fire, it was necessary to know about the structure of electric vehicles and its batteries. So I referred to special publications, and interviewed a number of experts, to create a visual representation easily understandable for the general public. We also refer to various video footage of such fires, and materials provided by the National Fire Agency. Additionally, in a bid to emphasize the dangers of such fires, we looked through published studies provided by the Environment Ministry, and international organizations such as the ILO, to come up with a new criteria to asses the hazards of EV fires based on data acquired through these publications.
 Especially difficult was acquiring data from the National Fire Agency. We had to persuade officials to provide us with the data, and explain how we plan to use them on our graphics. We eventually got permission to use their materials for public good, and was able to obtain rare materials that were not opened to the public.
This project focused on how people can react to fires, so that readers can take action when they experience a blast inside a EV. Also, this was made by a junior reporter.","I organized data on Microsoft Excel, refined them, and made storytelling infographics with Adobe Illustrator.
- The reporter selected necessary information, reached out to experts and government officials.
- Hand-drawn the layout, and used Adobe's isometric illustration to visualize them.","Other journalists could learn how to reach out to sources to gather relevant data, and how to approach issues from a comprehensive view. They could also learn how to convey facts to readers by using a story telling graphic.

The Indo-Pacific region is a key area in regards to the conflict between the United States and China, also known as the G2 countries. Its importance is receiving increasing attention as not only major countries such as the U.S., China and Australia, but also South Korea is trying to strengthening diplomatic relationship with countries in the region.","Interest towards the Pacific Islands has grown following the South Korea-Pacific Islands summit meeting held on May 29. But there weren't sufficient amount of graphic news contents introducing the countries in the region and why Korea is trying to strengthen ties with them. Since our readers in are relatively new to Pacific Island countries, we created an icon representing a key characteristic of each nation, and compared their scale of economy with that of Korea.
Using the map as a focal point, we explained the diplomatic strategies employed by the U.S. and China, as well as U.S. allies, such as Australia and South Korea, in regards to the Pacific Islands Nations, to provide readers understanding of the regions significance as a strategic point. Underneath the map is a Sankey Diagram, that summarizes these relationships in a more cohesive form.
As South Korea's national news wire, Yonhap News Agency provided the infographics to many other local media outlets, as a reference to help their future stories on the Pacific Islands. Parts of the infographics was republished in various local news papers.","At first, we intended to only include flags and overviews of the countries in the Pacific Islands. However, following team discussions, we came to realize the need to include escalating power conflict between the U.S. and China in the area. We conducted additional research and shifted the focus into developing a graphic news piece centered around the escalating Sino-U.S. rivalry in the Pacific. It was led by the youngest member and an intern.
To inform the significance of the Pacific Islands to the public as they were mentioned many times, we investigated various organizations to collect data on the Pacific Island countries. Due to the sheer number of nations within the region, it took a substantial amount of time to select necessary information and data to include in the graphic. It was difficult to designate the layout to help readers understand the vast amount of information at a glance.
Especially, as the graphic deals with a diplomatically sensitive matter, we needed a criteria that can objectively show the diplomatic dynamics in the region, and after much consideration, we decided to use the number of embassies opened to gauge how close each counties are with the nations in the Pacific Islands.","We used Microsoft Excel to organize the data, then created a map and a diagram using Adobe Illustrator.

Cuestión Pública created a universe inspired by Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment world, where citizens recognized the faces of corrupt politicians and businesspeople in Colombia through gamification.

In partnership with the NGO Transparency, chapter Colombia, we created an innovative News Application to help Colombians remember important information for longer periods of time, raise awareness about citizen participation in politics and promote transparency while discouraging corruption.","The Corruption &amp; Punishment application was named one of the top eight 2023 Best Investigative Stories from Spain and Latin America by the Global Investigative Journalism Network due to its innovative form and content.

Active dialogue on corruption and impunity was stimulated by C&amp;P regarding their relationship with the administration of justice in our audience. 

One of the national investigations made by Cuestión Pública business partners (Grupo Aval) of the corrupt Brazilian company Odebrecht received significant media coverage due to Grupo Aval was fined $40 million in the US for bribery in the Odebrecht case and for violating anti-corruption practices around the same time that the series was published. Our playful investigation and interactive series received significant media coverage.
 
Furthermore, we paid for digital advertising —Instagram &amp; Facebook— published in the regions where politicians investigated have an influence on the territory. Our information reached a young and average age audience between 18 and 45 years old.
Digital advertising obtained an average of 150 to 175 thousand impressions on social media. In addition, we advertised in two independent digital media outlets with more than 500K followers on Instagram, whose audience is composed mainly of young people.","In Colombia, frequent corruption scandals often overshadow each other, leading to a situation where the average Colombian tends to develop a short-term memory regarding corruption and its key figures. To combat this phenomenon, Cuestión Pública employs gamification and data journalism in their investigative reporting.

In the Corruption &amp; Punishment application, Cuestión Pública investigated two corruption cases at the national level in Colombia. One of them was focused on digging into who inherited the political influence of the paramilitaries, the powerful right-wing groups that emerged during Colombia's long civil conflict. The other exposed the impunity granted to Colombian business partners (Grupo Aval) of the corrupt Brazilian company Odebrecht. This company was involved in one of Latin America's largest corruption cases. 

Cuestión Pública turned these two investigations into interactive games inspired by the popular board games ""Guess Who?"" and ""Clue."" We collaborated with a local media outlet, 360 Grados Co, to investigate specific cases in the Caribbean region.

Through the game Corruption &amp; Punishment players-citizens are challenged to question the role of justice in Colombia's major corruption scandals and challenge their memory to resist the passage of time and prevent forgetfulness.","Corruption &amp; Punishment's games were created using Power BI, delivering an engaging experience to young audiences; Cuestión Pública pushed the limits of this tool by developing an innovative and pioneering way of using it for gamification. 

The databases for the games were organized in Google Sheets, ensuring seamless integration with data retrieval through Power BI.

The research database is connected to Power BI to display questions and answers in an engaging story that is kept online on a reliable and secure platform. Data is connected to Google Sheets and refreshed when necessary. The visualizations are a mix of HTML content, DAX language, and bookmarks that work together to create a system that asks and validates users' answers.
We used the Midjourney, a generative AI application, to create 173 images of congress members and business people, complete with character sketches and backgrounds.

The Corruption &amp; Punishment website was developed using HTML. Wireframes for C&amp;C were created in Figma. A UX/UI designer enhanced the platform's user experience.","The Corruption &amp; Punishment is an example of innovation and excellent use of gamification in journalism as a new way to reach young audiences. 
Other journalists can learn from the Corruption &amp; Punishment project how innovation, particularly through gamification, can revolutionize journalism and its impact. 

This project demonstrates that by creatively blending AI and analytical tools like Power BI, journalism can not only inform but also actively engage, especially with younger audiences. 

It serves as a case study in transforming complex data into interactive, user-friendly formats, making investigative journalism more accessible and appealing. 

This approach offers a blueprint for independent media to expand their reach and influence by making their content more engaging and relatable, thus bridging the gap between traditional investigative reporting and modern audience expectations.

Using advanced data scraping and screening, and applying intelligence gleamed from leaked datasets, reporters showed that Alpha helped install fronts (human and corporate nominees) at more than 800 UK-registered shell firms in the last six years. 

These firms were able to conceal their true owners despite the UK having a register of beneficial ownership. Ministers told the UK parliament these firms could not have hidden owners. They were wrong.","Police and financial regulators in the Seychelles raided the office of Alpha Consulting within hours of our project being published by the BBC, Finance Uncovered and Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation. 

Officers seized hard drives and other documents as part of these investigations.

Patrick Payet, who is both Secretary of State for Finance and chairman of the Financial Services Authority in the Seychelles, said officers were also engaging with law enforcement authorities in other countries. The probe remains ongoing.

Victoria Valkovskaya, the Russian national behind Alpha, confirmed the raid took place. 

In the UK, anti-corruption campaigners, members of parliament and legal experts have said UK laws need updating after our journalism demonstrated the government’s failure to properly understand and address this serious loophole, particularly shell firms that are set up as Limited Partnerships. 

Such LPs continue to be used to hide the identity of beneficial owners, including those engaging in sanctions-avoidance. Efforts to have the loophole shut down remain ongoing.

An article for this project on the BBC News website received almost 1m views. Followed-up reports weere published in multiple countries.","Our analysis of open source data from the UK corporate registry would not have been possible without intelligence gained from searching through thousands of unpublished files from the 2021 Pandora Papers data leak, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Leaked files also allowed us to name some of the hidden owner and establish that most hidden owners were based in the former Soviet Union, especially Russia.

Collaboration with reporters in the Seychelles allowed us to track down individuals used to front the UK firms and interview them. These nominees confirmed that they were paid a small sum to sign corporate paperwork for LPs, about which they knew nothing. 

This testimony was important because UK business minister Kevin Hollinrake had (incorrectly) insisted it was impossible, as a matter of law, for such LPs to have hidden owners. Our research showed it was not only possible, it was happening on an industrial scale with the help of Alpha. 

We also wanted to show why secrecy was important. We found several LPs variously linked to alleged large-scale corruption, a fugitive oligarch, Ponzi schemes, suspected sanctions-avoidance and an unlicensed online pharmacy selling prescription medicines.","We knew there was open source data on UK firms that interested us (Limited Partnerships) available at Companies House, the UK’s corporate registry. However, it was buried in PDFs that had no Optical Character Recognition. 

To confirm that Alpha had helped front more than 800 LPs in the last six years (and 927 in total) , we took a series of steps.

First, we downloaded a dataset of all firms in Companies House and filtered it to show only the class of LP we were interested in. 

We then used a Python script to request the filing history of each LP from Companies House’s API, determined the oldest document and downloaded it. This was always the registration document which might mentioned nominees connected to Alpha. 

We then used another Python script to send each registration document to the Google Vision API to use its Optical Character Recognition service to extract the text of each document. 

We returned this extracted text to a data table also containing each LP’s information from the Companies House API.

Finally, using an R script we detected whether each LP's registration document contained mentions of the individuals we knew to be connected to Alpha.","1. Journalists can easily overlook businesses that offer only sparse disclosures in hard-to-reach corporate filings. But these can be worth closer examination. For this project, we had a document leak that helped, but there are other ways of getting behind the secrecy veil, such as finding an insider who will blow the whistle.

2. If a heavily-briefed government minister says, in an official capacity, that something is not happening, he is probably correct. But not always! 

3. Since many corporate secrecy vehicles are multi-layered and multi-jurisdictional, a journalistic examination has to be able to take a similar approach. We did this through collaboration between media outlets. It was especially useful that our reporting partners in the Seychelles were able to conduct local interviews that brought to life the strong findings that emerged from our data analysis and open source work.

4. At first sight, enablers can look a less attractive journalistic prospect than their clients.

This technology, previously effective in reporting the 2020 municipal and 2022 presidential election results, involves comprehensive data extraction from official governmental databases. The process starts with a foundational text by g1, followed by data acquisition from the IBGE. Engineers and data scientists, aided by the Data and AI division, then format this data for reporting, integrating it with g1's publishing system. These reports, rigorously reviewed for accuracy and enriched with additional information, uphold the highest journalistic standards.","Globo's project to transform Brazilian Census data into accessible journalistic reports gains significance due to the pandemic-induced delay of the Census, which is conducted only every ten years. This delay emphasized the need for up-to-date demographic data, critical for understanding the geographic and cultural diversity of Brazilian society. The democratization of this data empowers Brazilians with essential insights into national demographic changes and trends.

The project's wide distribution, tailored to each state and presented in various formats, addresses the challenge of reaching Brazil's diverse population, spanning 5,570 cities. This ensures that detailed and regionalized Census data is accessible to everyone, from remote rural areas to large metropolitan cities, facilitating a broad understanding of regional disparities and requirements. This widespread access is vital for social policy-making, resource distribution, and community development, particularly crucial in the post-pandemic era.

Moreover, the project's commitment to high-quality journalism in presenting the Census data ensures its relevance and accuracy. In a country where such updates only happen in each decade, this initiative not only informs but also influences public opinion and policy, playing a pivotal role in a society where understanding geographic and population variations is essential for tackling both local and national challenges.","Esteemed members of the jury, this project serves as a notable example of adaptability and technological advancement., particularly in the context of the delayed release of Brazilian Census data. Our approach, which has proven its effectiveness during the Brazilian elections, employs advanced cloud computing for data engineering and mass publication. 

Our project's success in the Brazilian elections highlights our capability to handle and disseminate large-scale data efficiently. Using cloud-based solutions, we managed extensive electoral data under tight deadlines, a feat that directly informed our strategy for the Census project

A unique aspect of our project is the diversity of data formats we offer. Interactive maps, tailored videos for each Brazilian state, and dynamic graphics illustrate the demographic variations across the country. This multifaceted approach not only enhances public engagement but also aids in better understanding and visualization of complex Census data. 

In summary, our project exemplifies the power of technology in transforming the landscape of data journalism. By leveraging cloud computing and diverse data formats, we've set a new standard in delivering critical information, reaffirming our commitment to keeping the public informed and engaged.","To tackle this technological challenge, a complex data processing pipeline was developed, relying mostly on cloud technologies using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the advantage of this approach is the possibility of scale by demand besides the resilience of the operation. All the data was landed in the JSON format, and the buckets service from Google Cloud Storage was used to store them, the JSON files were converted to AVRO format which is a better format suited for querying and processing with Python scripts, and beyond that, the data is stored in Big Query tables to be consumed by front-end applications such as dashboards, the pipeline flow management is handled by the Dataflow.","The use of tools to automate the creation of news texts and videos can massively improve the speed and volume of a newsroom production while also allowing news organizations to offer customized content that otherwise would be impossible to make. That can prove to be especially relevant when there is a need to address many small groups of people with specific information, such as desegregating national Census data to a county level.",Brazilian Portuguese,https://g1.globo.com/economia/censo/noticia/2023/06/28/g1-reportagens-ibge.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/rj/regiao-serrana/noticia/2023/06/28/populacao-em-petropolis-rj-e-de-278881-pessoas-aponta-o-censo-do-ibge.ghtml,,,,,,"Coordination: Igor Costa, Ricardo Gallo, Guilherme Gomes &amp; Renato Franzini","The g1/Globo's data journalism team, composed of journalists, data specialists, and designers."

La investigación, que abarcó 17 países, encontró asesores que han creado campañas de desinformación y han repetido la fórmula con varios clientes, tanto de izquierda como de derecha. También encontramos operaciones de influencia internacional buscando impactar en políticas locales y grandes vacíos en cómo las plataformas de redes sociales enfrentan estos retos.","Mercenarios Digitales ha suscitado varias discusiones en América Latina alrededor de la desinformación en momentos electorales. Miembros de esta alianza han discutido los hallazgos de la investigación en lugares como El Hilo, uno de los podcasts de noticias más grandes en español, y en varios medios, tanto tradicionales como digitales. La experiencia también ha sido discutida en foros y conversatorios en Colombia, Costa Rica, México, El Salvador y Venezuela. Por otra parte, esta investigación levantó las alarmas de otros medios sobre consultores y políticos recurriendo a la desinformación. Por ejemplo, Mercenarios Digitales reveló la historia del argentino Fernando Cerimedo, quien mintió sobre los resultados electorales en Brasil, y luego fue estratega del ahora presidente argentino Javier Milei. Tras nuestra publicación, varios medios investigaron a Cerimedo. Por otra parte, en Costa Rica, el presidente Rodrigo Chaves tuvo que enfrentar preguntas en el Congreso y en ruedas de prensa sobre nuestro hallazgo de que había usado tácticas desinformadoras.","Si bien muchos de los artículos resultantes de esta investigación se lograron usando metodologías de fuentes abiertas, el proyecto enfrentó el reto de que muchos de los países de la región no son transparentes ni permiten un acceso fácil a datos públicos. En algunos casos, como en Bolivia, Guatemala y Honduras, es muy dispendioso acceder a esta información. En otros casos, como en Nicaragua y Venezuela, es imposible. Por eso tuvimos que innovar en nuestros métodos de investigación: buscando información relacionada en otros países, o haciendo triangulaciones a partir de pruebas digitales encontradas entre varias páginas y redes sociales. Por otra parte, algunos de los protagonistas de nuestras historias son responsables de los ataques constantes y violentos en redes contra algunos de los periodistas que hicieron parte de esta investigación. En particular los periodistas de Centroamérica reciben constantemente amenazas y burlas en sus cuentas de redes sociales simplemente por hacer su trabajo. Por eso desarrollamos medidas de acompañamiento para la seguridad digital de los periodistas de este proyecto: creamos un monitoreo digital para prepararnos para posibles amenazas, hicimos talleres sobre buenas prácticas de seguridad digital y creamos un comité para determinar respuestas a posibles amenazas digitales.","La investigación comenzó creando una base de datos a partir de takedowns reportados por plataformas de redes sociales, así como estudios hechos por Stanford y Oxford, que detallaban empresas y empresarios detrás de operaciones digitales coordinadas en América Latina. Esta base de datos fue ampliada usando buscadores de información corporativa, incluyendo la NINA, un buscador desarrollado por CLIP. Mapeamos toda esta información usando Kumu, para ver las conexiones y encontrar posibles historias. Tras esto, usamos Meltwater y CrowdTangle para identificar acciones coordinadas en redes sociales, así como para identificar cuentas borradas. También usamos búsquedas de DNS para probar que había una coordinación de ciertas páginas de internet y usamos búsquedas avanzadas de Google para probar que ciertas campañas políticas estaban usando herramientas desinformadoras en WhatsApp. Esta información, recopilada y procesada usando la metodología De Fuentes Abiertas, nos permitió asociar consultores con empresas y con operaciones coordinadas de desinformación en varios países. También tuvimos acceso a información privilegiada de algunas plataformas de redes sociales, gracias a los centro aliados digitales, lo que nos permitió explorar a fondo cómo funcionan los procesos de suspensión y eliminación de cuentas en dicha plataformas e identificar vacíos en sus políticas de moderación sobre contenidos desinformantes.","Este proyecto es un testamento al poder de la colaboración periodística. Buena parte de las historias de Mercenarios Digitales son internacionales y difícilmente se podrían haber realizado sin el trabajo colaborativo de equipos periodísticos de varios países. Por ejemplo, revelamos la historia de Neurona, una consultora que ha creado desinformación al servicio de campañas de gobiernos de izquierda en Ecuador, México, Bolivia y España. Esta investigación contó con periodistas de cada uno de esos países, quienes aportaron no sólo su investigación, sino además su conocimiento local, lo cual fue fundamental para poder develar la red de empresas y de páginas ligadas a Neurona. Además, Mercenarios Digitales reveló la importancia de indagar en los eslabones de la cadena detrás del negocio de la desinformación: este fenómeno no sucede en el vacío y cada vez es más claro que es necesario indagar y señalar a los responsables de crearlo, para así poder tener un ambiente de información más confiable, en el que la democracia pueda prosperar.

Japan,The Asahi Shimbun,Big,,,Visualizing the Hidden Dead of Covid-19,06/05/2023,"Investigation, Breaking news, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Covid 19, Health","QGIS, CSV, R","Some of the deaths not attributed to novel coronavirus infection were due to indirect effects, such as worsening of pre-existing medical conditions after infection and tight medical care. To determine how many more people died because of the pandemic, we can compare all deaths, including those who died from non-Covid causes, to the number of deaths that would have occurred in the absence of the pandemic. We analyzed data from a government research group and found that the number of deaths for the three-year period from 2020 to 2022 was 135,000 above the level of previous years.","The number of deaths in 2020, in the early stages of the pandemic, was 35,000 fewer than the number of deaths predicted based on previous years' levels. This is thought to be the result of people refraining from interacting with others and not contracting influenza or other non-Covid diseases. However, in 2021, when the outbreak spread, the number of deaths was 52,000 more than the previous year's level, and in 2022, it was 118,000 more than the previous year's level. This is thought to have been the result of people getting tired of the voluntary restraint of activities.
In addition, the number of deaths due to Covid was 57,000 over the three-year period, according to the government's summary. However, we have shown that the death toll from the pandemic is far greater if those who died from indirect effects are included.
Furthermore, the Japanese media often reported on the spread of the disease in areas with large populations, such as Tokyo and Osaka. However, when the number of deaths was divided by the population of each municipality, we showed that infections in remote areas with few medical facilities were actually more serious.","The number of deaths predicted from the level of previous years had been published by a government research group, but this data contained a certain margin of error. For this reason, researchers belonging to the study group were initially hesitant to make the definitive statement that the number of deaths over the three-year period was 135,000 more than in previous years. However, when we explained how we interpreted the data, showing heat maps and other charts, they agreed to make these definitive statements. Without this negotiation, the article would have had to be very confusing to the average reader, saying that the number of deaths was 30,000 to 200,000 more than in previous years, which would have had a much weaker impact.","The data obtained from the government research group were cleaned, formatted, analyzed, and charted using the R programming language. We presented these data to the researchers in the research group, continued discussions, and wrote the article after convincing them of our findings.","At the same time we published the article, we also published the process of analysis in R on GitHub. On Twitter, researchers of infectious diseases commented on this, saying that it was interesting. I was invited to a meeting of engineers interested in the R language and gave a talk about what analysis we did and how we did it. In Japan, distrust of the media is deep-rooted, and our articles are often treated as fake news. However, we believe that we were able to show that articles based on open data and published under the supervision of experts can be accepted and welcomed even by people with particularly strong critical thinking.",Japanese,https://digital.asahi.com/articles/ASR5577GCR4PUTFL00C.html,https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14902171,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DliUyL9oWyprs_W7jzNRJyAdrQ2TYeEL/view?usp=drive_link,https://ryomakom.github.io/exdeaths/,,,,"Tokiko Tsuji, Ryoma Komiyama, Keitaro Kato, Kenta Noguchi, Keisuke Yamazaki","Yamazaki and Komiyama are members of the dedicated data journalism team.

Diante do grande volume de publicações, foi aplicado um modelo de Inteligência Artificial capaz de classificar os textos segundo o tema abordado.","O trabalho revelou diferenças significativas na comunicação dos presidentes Lula e Bolsonaro. Além das divergências nos temas abordados, foi possível identificar estratégias distintas de engajamento e posicionamento institucional. Esses achados ajudam a entender a polarização ideológica no país e o espaço ocupado pela rede social como fonte de informação política.","Os 100 primeiros dias são considerados decisivos para um novo governo e costumam marcar a defesa de pautas determinantes para o presidente eleito. Na rede social, o próprio Lula destacou que usaria o período para ""voltar com todas as políticas públicas que deram certo no país"". Bolsonaro, por sua vez, tinha ficado conhecido pelas estratégias bem-sucedidas de engajamento, focadas em ataques à imprensa, críticas diretas a adversários e incentivo à polarização ideológica.

Taking inspiration from her reporting about the toll COVID-19 exacted upon Black Americans during the global pandemic, she sharpened her idea and embarked on reporting a five-part series. Driven by data and the experiences of several families, individuals and communities, “From Birth to Death” examines five health crises: infant and maternal health, childhood asthma, mental health, high blood pressure, and Alzheimer’s disease.",The series has generated at least hundreds of thousands of page views on AP digital platforms. Readers and medical professionals have praised the project and shared it widely. Some professors and teachers have plans to incorporate the series into their lesson plans.,"The genesis of the project began with a lot of reporting by Kat Stafford amid the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, which took a deep look at the disparate toll on Black communities across the United States. Stafford felt like there's more to this. How do we get to this point where we saw these disparate outcomes? That was the impetus for this project finding out and showing that the things that Black Americans encounter, even before they take their first breath of life, can really set the stage for the health inequities they will encounter from birth, literally to their final moments of life.","The reporters use data from a variety of sources which collectively helped to show the disparities in the healthcare system that leads to racial inequities. They also made an intentional effort to highlight the voices of doctors, historians, who are people of color, folks that have really been rooted in this work, to really lay clear why these disparities exist today. The key was looking beyond the usual voices to provide broader context.","While the data on racial disparities in the healthcare system has long existed, much of it was isolated. By putting this information together with people impacted by the disparities and experts who study the issue, but have not always been quoted in the media, the reporters were able to show that socioeconomic conditions and social determinants underscore a legacy of structural racism that continues to impact Black people regardless of their social economic status. The lesson is that even though this is a typic that has been covered before, by collecting data from various sources and expanding the field of sources, innovative investigative work can be done even on issues that have been explored before.",English,https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/from-birth-to-death/index.html,https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/from-birth-to-death/high-blood-pressure-covid-racism.html,https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/from-birth-to-death/mental-health-black-children-investigation.html,https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/from-birth-to-death/alzheimers-black-americans.html,,,,"Primary author: Kat Stafford

Initially, schools launched programs to find these kids. But a year or two into the pandemic, those efforts largely ended – along with related news coverage. 
AP’s journalists knew missing students were still out there. We led a groundbreaking analysis for the country’s first estimate of how many students were missing.
Then, AP brought the data reporting to life. Intimate narratives showed how forces ranging from the housing crisis to school enrollment policies to the everyday obstacles of poverty have kept kids out of schools.","The series received 1 million pageviews and was accessed by AP member newsrooms 5,300+ times. Two stories were AP’s top 2023 immersives.


The impact started locally. In advance, we contacted 70+ local and nonprofit newsrooms to share our data, analysis and story. In trainings, we invited them to publish their own stories – on missing students, or the hard-to-get homeschool and private school enrollment data in our analysis. This outreach resulted in three dozen local stories.
 
All the coverage required districts and states to address the issue publicly, and reset the national conversation. Our work has been cited by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times editorial boards, The Economist and ProPublica. It led the Axios PM newsletter and was featured on CNN and NPR. Our journalists have been on CSPAN, public radio and local TV. Our analyses have formed the basis for multiple peer-reviewed publications and inspired policy writeups, from the Center for Reinventing Public Education to the National Associated of State Boards of Education. Finally, the White House Council of Economic Advisers weighed in.
 
L.A. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho put it best: “It took a while, but the spotlight is finally on this tragic reality.”","We built extensive databases, which we then shared with all AP members and several nonprofit partners. These databases contain the most comprehensive information on public and nonpublic schooling made available by any news outlet, including enrollment numbers for public, private and homeschools, school-aged population totals, public enrollment by grade, private enrollment by grade, and ReadMe files with detailed notes on data sourcing. Much of this data was compiled by individual records requests to states or individually accessing state enrollment databases (twice over, as we updated the analysis for the latest school year).

The Pandemic’s Missing Students was reported, written and produced by AP. On portions of the analyses, AP partnered with Stanford’s Big Local News and economist Thomas Dee.","We used a residual analysis to estimate the number of missing students.
This required finding the total change in enrollments in public, private and home schools in each state from fall 2019 to fall 2021, plus the change in the school-age population (ages 5-17) from the Census. In theory, changes in public and nonpublic enrollment and population should all cancel each other out, leading to a “residual” of zero. 

We used the formula:
Residual = Change in Public + Change in Homeschooling + Change in Private – Change in School-Aged Population

A negative residual in a state indicates there are missing students, while a positive residual indicates more students than expected. (This could be perhaps because the Census underestimated the school-aged population.)

To calculate changes in nonpublic enrollment, AP’s Lurye requested records from all 50 states plus D.C., cleaning the data using R. Dee calculated changes in school-aged population using Census data with Stata. Mayo collected and cleaned data on public school enrollment, mostly from federal sources, using Python.

Finally, in updating the analysis for 2022-2023, Lurye collected public, private and homeschooling enrollment data herself (federal sources were not available) and updated the population change estimate. Dee reviewed the analysis for methodological soundness.","First, we hope other national journalists can see the impact of sharing data and reporting with local newsrooms. Reams of valuable AP data would never have made it into a story or reached a local audience if we hadn’t reached out to local reporters in states that stood out in the analysis. Many of these local reporters lacked the support, time or resources to request the data we had received or to compare it with other jurisdictions. By sharing freely and flexibly, AP widened the impact of the reporting. Together, AP and local journalists made this a truly transformative project. 

Second, this project came from the AP team’s drive to center kids who had largely gone missing from school policy conversations and American media coverage. We noticed the conversation at school systems had shifted from finding “missing students” to addressing “enrollment declines” – a faceless budget problem. We urge our colleagues not to stop at analyzing the numbers policymakers are using, or even quantifying something for the first time. Instead, use your data analysis as a springboard to center underrepresented voices – people who have slipped through the cracks of all support systems.","English, Spanish",https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html,https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-students-chronic-absenteeism/index.html,https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-students-housing/index.html,https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/pandemic-missing-students-school-enrollment/index.html,,,,"Sharon Lurye, Bianca Vázquez Toness","Sharon Lurye is AP’s education data reporter.

In an industry where time is money, certain applicants tend to move faster – sometimes much faster – than others in line for permits, even for projects that are comparable in price and scope. Some applicants’ projects sailed through the process in days or weeks while others languished for months or even years. Civil Beat’s data story examined not only whose projects moved faster and slower but also identified the underlying reasons why.","The story struck a nerve. It attracted approximately 13,000 readers — significant for Civil Beat — and attracted dozens of comments. 

As a result, there is an ongoing community conversation about how the permitting system got this way and what residents should demand to make it better. In Democratic Hawaii, political homogeneity can foster a sense among residents that they are not being heard and nothing will ever change. Our series has cut through that hopelessness and identified with clarity who the current system works for (a select few) and who it is failing to serve (most everyone else). We recently advertised an event to discuss the project and it sold out within two hours. Readers are now contacting our newsroom hoping we can squeeze them in, and we’re already planning future events. 

The story also inspired Keli’i Akina, president and CEO of the government reform group Grassroot Institute of Hawaii, to publish an essay in the Hawaii Filipino Chronicle: https://www.grassrootinstitute.org/2023/11/streamline-permitting-process-to-reduce-wait-times-favoritism/

“We must make the permitting process fair again. It is the only way to shorten wait times, reduce the stress on the department and kill permitting favoritism at its source,” Akina wrote.","The data analysis was conducted primarily by reporter Christina Jedra who is not a “data reporter” by title or training and had never endeavored to do a data project of this scale before. It took her 10 months to clean the data, devise a logical methodology and conduct an analysis of thousands of rows of data in four different categories representing different kinds of construction projects. 

It was a process of trial and error. 

In the beginning, Google Sheets kept crashing because the dataset was too big. Jedra also sought to compare all projects by permitting time, but it quickly became clear that wouldn’t result in an apples-to-apples comparison. For instance, you’d expect a new build to take longer than a renovation. She quickly realized she’d have to break the data into smaller chunks to avoid overloading Google Sheets and also to focus on comparing similar projects. We hired a freelance data expert to help us with that. 

In addition, the data was quite “dirty.” Some applicants were listed under variations of their names or different businesses. Some were misspelled. Jedra spent countless hours doing the best she could to ensure those various references were aligned under one common name.","We used OpenRefine to “clean” the data of duplicate identities of the same people (e.g. matching up “Bill Wong” and “William Wong”). 

Otherwise, we used Google Sheets for the data analysis. 

Because the dataset was so large, we narrowed it to capture projects from 2012-2022 and broke the data up into four categories representing some of the most common types of projects:
1. New building with electrical, plumbing and solar work
2. Alteration and addition with electrical and plumbing work
3. Alteration with electrical and plumbing work
4. Alteration with electrical work

From there, we further narrowed our search to applicants who had gotten 10 or more permits issued. We then calculated the differences between each permit application's ""created date"" and the day on which DPP finished its review. Using Google Sheet formulas, we compared each applicant against its competitors in the same category and at the same price point, and color-coded by speed. For example, those who got their work done in 50% of the average for that category were labeled in red. We saw some applicants consistently getting their work approved faster than the average.","Perhaps our biggest takeaway is that any reporter can do a project like this, with a vision for the story, a little help and a lot of persistence. You don't have to be a ""data reporter."" Jedra started this project with a question – “Whose projects move the fastest?” – and worked step by step to answer it. This story is also an example of having humility while reporting. Jedra was careful not to make sweeping conclusions and made sure to include caveats and context in her resulting story. The goal was not to use the data to accuse anyone of wrongdoing, like bribery, but rather understand who the winners and losers of the system are and explore why that is.",English,https://www.civilbeat.org/2023/10/some-honolulu-building-permittees-sailed-through-despite-long-waits-for-most-data-shows/,,,,,,,"Reporter: Christina Jedra, Honolulu Civil Beat, Graphics: April Estrellon, Honolulu Civil Beat, Data assistance: Kyle Ogilvie (independent)","Christina Jedra is an enterprise and investigative reporter for Honolulu Civil Beat.

Para isso, foram selecionadas as principais pinturas dos nove períodos artísticos de Picasso.","Esse projeto tem um impacto significativo ao apresentar a vida e obra de Picasso de maneira acessível e visualmente atraente. Ao integrar a análise das cores das pinturas com informações textuais, oferece uma perspectiva mais profunda sobre as escolhas estéticas do artista e sua relação com o contexto histórico. Essa abordagem inovadora enriquece a compreensão do público, tornando a narrativa mais envolvente e contextualizada.

Não temos métricas de audiência disponíveis por conta de uma transição para um novo CMS. Os gráficos foram adaptados para serem publicados nas redes sociais, ampliando o número de leitores.","Reconhecido como um dos artistas mais inovadores e influentes do século 20, a trajetória de vida de Picasso é notável não apenas pelo seu impacto na história da arte, mas também por estar intrinsecamente ligada a um período marcado por eventos importantes, tanto no cenário artístico, como as vanguardas europeias, quanto no contexto mundial, incluindo as duas grandes guerras. 

Nesse sentido, a análise dos padrões estéticos e tendências nas escolhas de Picasso não apenas proporciona insights sobre seu estado emocional e experiências pessoais, mas também revela sua reação diante de eventos históricos, movimentos artísticos e transformações culturais da época.

Como a proposta do Nexo para o material sobre o aniversário da morte de 50 anos de Picasso era trazer as informações sobre a vida e obra do artista de maneira simples, compreensível ao público em geral e visualmente atraente, optamos por explorar essa relação entre a trajetória de Picasso e o cenário histórico da sua época a partir de uma abordagem que integra a análise visual, combinando os dados sobre as cores das pinturas com informações textuais para criar uma narrativa mais rica e contextualizada.","Para a análise das cores das obras, a linguagem R foi utilizada, em especial, a função image_pal do pacote imgplar.

India,"Al Jazeera, The Reporters' Collective",Small,,,"In India’s strife-torn Manipur, narrative battle is fought on social media",27/10/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Chart, Video","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Google Sheets, Python","Manipur, a state in India’s Northeast has been witnessing an ethnic war between the tribal Kuki-Zo and the majority Meitei communities over the last eight months.

It's the longest-running ethnic feud in 21st century India. Replicating global patterns, a parallel narrative war has also been fought on social media, with a flood of information, disinformation and concerted activity. Despite an internet ban lasting months. 

With help from two tech research groups, my story uses large-data analysis, to reveal the patterns of engagement on X over the conflict. I analysed over 2,700 X handles and 2 million posts for this story.","The story was the first of its kind on the Manipur conflict. It remains so till date and had a two-pronged impact : 

First: The hard evidence based on large data analysis was revelatory because it showed the underbelly of the conflict, which was contrary to anecdotal views. As Roshan Kishore, a senior data journalist who works at Hindustan Times, said, ""The story has the potential to become pedagogical material"". Other journalists such as South Asia bureau chief of the Washington Post, Gerry Shih also praised the story. 

[https://twitter.com/gerryshih/status/1718240152386990127]

The story was valued by the involved communities, citizens at large and those working at the interface of tech, data and society. 

Second: The story brought together different actors in the conflict, who acknowledged the dubious role of online warfare in exacerbating the conflict. The Reporters' Collective hosted a Spaces conversation about the story that included prominent members of the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities as well as tech researchers — the first time that public leaders and intellectuals of the two sparring communities came on a public space. Over 5,000 listeners tuned into the session. 

[https://x.com/reporters_co/status/1719722535078736193?s=20]","The two communities at loggerheads since May 3 are the Kuki-Zos (an umbrella term for several tribes) and the majority Meiteis. Kukis predominantly live in several of the hill districts of Manipur while the Meiteis dominate the valley. After the conflict started, the Kuki-Zos, who live in the valley, ran to the hills and the Meiteis in the hills to the valley and as a result the entire state was divided.

Simultaneously, thousands of accounts started posting about the conflict.

In June 2023, we started collaborating with Joyojeet Pal of the University of Michigan and independent researcher Sheyril Agarwal, who had scraped a list of X accounts that had been posting about the conflict. To ensure data corroboration, we engaged the help of the Delhi-based Narrative Research Lab. 

Scraping for data often proved to be a challenge with the changing API restrictions. Different strategies and technologies were used to circumvent this problem.

The data that the Narrative Research Lab scraped, threw up over 2700 accounts which had been posting on the conflict.I spent many hours manually sifting through these accounts, identifying them as 'Kuki', 'Meitei' and 'Others' as it required an understanding of names and ethnic identities found in Manipur.","Free access to X's API was curtailed from June. But, the Narrative Research Lab, who was helping me access data on X, took advantage of the changing API offerrings and was able to scrape information of 2722 handles that had been posting on the Manipur conflict. The Lab also used artificial intelligence and analysed 2327 tweets to map the hashtags that were frequently used.

The finding: More than half of the Kuki-affiliated handles were created on or after May 3, when the conflict started. In the case of Meitei-affiliated handles, 40 percent were created on or after May 3. 

Meanwhile, Joyojeet Pal of the University of Michigan and independent researcher Sheyril Agarwal could pull data from X's API till June. They used the string matching method to pull the posts using keywords and hashtags like ""Manipur OR #Manipur OR Imphal OR #SaveTribalsinManipur OR #ManipurViolence"". From 1st May 2023 to 5th June 2023, they collected a total of 2,765,151 posts. They also compared the repost-to-impression ratio between the Kuki-affiliated accounts and the Meitei-affilitated accounts 

The finding: There was more concerted activity by the Kuki-affiliated accounts. Meitei-associated handles got into the narrative game later but quickly came up to speed.","From the Russia-Ukraine war to the conflict in Manipur to the Israel-Gaza conflict, social media is seen to have shaped public perceptions that at times have compelled policy makers into action. At the same time, and as illustrated in my story as well, social media has more often than not accentuated tensions. Disinformation campaigns and the creation of bot accounts have given a new dimension to the idea of manufactured consent. 

My story stands at this juncture of technology, data and political, economic and social realities. It sheds a light on how assumptions about events like the Manipur conflict are made and proliferated. For instance, at the beginning, the conflict was perceived as a fight between the majority Hindu Meiteis against the Christian tribal Kuki-Zos. This discourse was driven by X accounts. In painting one community as the absolute evil over the other, this narrative forewent the many societal nuances which exist in this small, multiethnic part of the country.

By carefully examining the social media handles, I could gauge the motivation of the social media actors, if online perceptions are spontaneous or synthesised and how it affects ground realities.",English,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/10/27/in-indias-strife-torn-manipur-narrative-battle-is-fought-on-social-media,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AclSTPEe0Y&amp;pp=ygUqcmVwb3J0ZXIncyBjb2xsZWN0aXZlIHNvY2lhbCBtZWRpYSBtYW5pcHVy,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ugvsN47W3y7WJJC5aGse1ZydtjhePzi8VWPUhkjN-M/edit?usp=sharing,https://www.reporters-collective.in/projects/manipur-social-media,,,,Angana Chakrabarti,"Angana Chakrabrati is an independent multimedia journalist based out of Assam, India.

La serie periodística muestra que más de la mitad de los alimentos analizados excedían los límites máximos de residuos de pesticidas y también permite conocer cómo grandes empresas de pesticidas venden en América Latina productos que tienen vetados en Europa y Estados Unidos.","Desde el Congreso se han impulsado dos proyectos de ley para prohibir la fabricación, comercialización y uso de plaguicidas catalogados como muy peligrosos por su riesgo para la salud y el ambiente.

El Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agraria del Perú (SENASA) trabaja en un reglamento para verificar, antes del ingreso de los alimentos a los mercados, si hay sustancias prohibidas o con residuos de plaguicidas que superan los límites máximos permitidos. 

El Consejo Nacional de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación presentó un informe con recomendaciones a las autoridades, empresas y agricultores para evitar que los alimentos lleguen contaminados a las mesas de los ciudadanos.","En Perú, las autoridades no informan a la población sobre los análisis que se hacen de la presencia de pesticidas en los alimentos que salen del campo a la mesa. Sabemos que tienen estos datos, pero no los divulgan. Además solo son conocidos los estrictos controles para la agro exportación. Por eso, Salud con lupa lideró un proyecto colaborativo con organizaciones civiles con las que creamos el Primer Monitoreo Ciudadano de Pesticidas en los Alimentos para crear información útil y relevante para la seguridad alimentaria. Como ciudadanos y consumidores empezamos a hacer análisis de residuos de pesticidas en los alimentos de manera periódica y presentamos las alertas al público sobre lo que se vende en los supermercados. En 2023, hicimos 2 monitoreos que abarcaron 24 supermercados en Lima y 4 regiones del país.","Se tomaron muestras de alimentos frescos de los supermercados en presencia de notarios públicos y siguiendo todos los protocolos de inocuidad. Luego se enviaron a dos laboratorios certificados para un análisis multiresiduos de plaguicidas, que permite identificar 800 sustancias. En más de la mitad de las muestras se hallaron altas concentraciones de residuos de agroquímicos, y también una molécula prohibida en el Perú: el carbofurano. 

Los resultados los trasladamos a una hoja de Excel que permitió identificar cada una de los pesticidas que superó los límites máximos permisibles.

Based on official requests, analysis and visualization of thousands of files, we identified 8,278 oil residues in the four selected countries. Nearly half of these are still not recognized as environmental liabilities by the authorities. Worst of all, governments have been able to identify just one-third of the responsible parties, and only 1907 toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. In addition, 670 of these are located within 50 indigenous lands and 15 protected areas.","Despite the economic and political influence of the oil industry in Latin America, there was no regional database that counted the amount of oil liabilities - most of which remain unresolved - or that geographically located them so as to clearly identify the main victims. In Colombia, this allowed two fishing communities, Puerto Wilches and El Llanito in Magdalena Medio, to use our database in a complaint against Ecopetrol that they filed with local and national environmental authorities. On the other hand, the investigation also prompted the authorities to take action. In Peru, Profonananpe, the agency in charge of the Contingency Fund for Environmental Remediation, requested a meeting with Mongabay Latam to present the status of the remediation process and to ensure that the cleanup of 170 contaminated sites would begin in early 2024. It also led Profonanpe to hold an international meeting with Colombia's National Environmental Licensing Authority and Ecuador's Ministry of the Environment, Water and Ecological Transition to address oil liabilities. 

The series of eight stories was read by thousands of people in the region, republished by more than 15 media outlets and commented on by key policy makers and indigenous leaders.","In recent decades, thousands of oil spills have been reported in the Amazonian regions of Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Colombia. Despite constant complaints from local communities and indigenous peoples, few companies have been denounced or sanctioned. Worse, most of these liabilities remain in the territories, contaminating water sources and affecting the health of thousands of people. 

The enormous political and economic power of the oil industry has not only silenced this reality, but also continues in the race to continue exploiting hydrocarbons, despite the scientific evidence of what this means for the climate crisis we are already experiencing. Most worryingly, while almost all states recognize the legal ownership of indigenous lands and protected areas, everything changes when oil is discovered in these territories. Legally, the land belongs to the indigenous peoples, but the subsoil is of ""national interest"". 

A previous investigation by Mongabay Latam found that more than 1,647 communities and 52 protected areas have between 20 and 100 percent overlap with oil concessions. In fact, many of these indigenous communities were not even aware that their land had been concessioned.","The research network integrated experts in databases, geospatial analysis, visualizers, audiovisual producers and illustrators. Responses to requests for information from eight public institutions made it possible to build a database after reviewing more than 8,000 files and establishing categories of analysis, a major effort to simplify the diversity of documents and the lack of data. Some countries, such as Ecuador and Colombia, have not recognized as liabilities oil spills that are more than half a century old. 

The data was geolocated using Arcgis. Then, with the help of a data verifier and a geographer, we located the liabilities, determine the extent of the impact, and accurately identify the indigenous communities and protected areas affected. We also georeferenced more than 2,897 kilometers of hydrocarbon pipelines - sources of the spills - that cross 65 protected areas and 140 indigenous territories.

With the results, we were able to build two free multimedia tools in Mapbox, using d3.js, JQuery and Json files and developed in html and css, that allow the public and affected communities to identify the liabilities, but also the details of each liability, such as the type of damage, the status of that damage, the company responsible, and the level of risk.","There are four key aspects that we hope other journalists can learn from: it is increasingly important to have a regional view of environmental problems, to understand them in their true magnitude and not just at the local level. Collaboration is the key to this. Only with journalists from different countries can we reflect a common reality that does not ignore the political and social particularities of each nation. We also believe that interdisciplinary work is important.

No entanto, há preocupações sobre a falta de parques em algumas áreas, afetando o acesso, especialmente para os moradores das periferias com menos recursos e tempo. Este trabalho destaca as alterações no plano e inclui perspectivas de ambientalistas, políticos e a Prefeitura para avaliar a gravidade da situação.","Desenvolvido como um trabalho de pós-graduação, o trabalho despertou o interesse de editores do jornal Valor Econômico, de São Paulo, uma das mídias especializadas em economia mais respeitadas do Brasil. O material foi publicado na forma de especial no caderno de assuntos sobre o país, com divulgação também no site do veículo.","O planejamento urbanístico de São Paulo influencia diretamente a distribuição de parques, podendo acentuar desigualdades socioeconômicas e afetar o bem-estar dos habitantes, especialmente os das periferias. A ausência de parques em certas áreas também pode prejudicar a coesão social e a qualidade ambiental, pois os espaços verdes desempenham um papel vital não apenas como recreação, mas na redução da poluição e no fortalecimento dos laços comunitários. Destaca-se a importância de o planejamento considerar não apenas números absolutos, mas também a equidade na distribuição dessas áreas.","Para a elaboração desta reportagem especial, empregamos uma série de técnicas e ferramentas específicas para tratar e apresentar os dados. Inicialmente, utilizamos ferramentas de Reconhecimento Óptico de Caracteres (OCR) para converter os dados em formato PDF, fornecidos pela Prefeitura, em arquivos csv. Esse processo foi seguido de uma revisão cuidadosa pela nossa equipe para assegurar a precisão dos dados.

Posteriormente, recorremos ao Python, uma linguagem de programação versátil, para tratar e organizar esses dados. Com Python, conseguimos manipular os conjuntos de dados de maneira eficiente, preparando-os para a visualização.

Para o desenvolvimento dos gráficos iniciais, optamos pelo Flourish, uma plataforma robusta para a criação de visualizações de dados. Os gráficos criados com o Flourish serviram como base para a apresentação dos dados na reportagem.

Finalmente, a equipe de arte do Valor Econômico desempenhou um papel crucial na adaptação desses gráficos à identidade visual do veículo.

Our investigations documented supply chains, crime, gender issues and environmental concerns. We illustrated how sand mining was a massive cross-border industry, often poorly regulated, leading to environmental damage, disruption of food production, displacement and even murder of community members who resist miners. The investigation involved 12 organisations with personnel spanning 12 countries who produced in-depth field reports, uncovered supply chains, data visualisations, photographs, a visual novel and documentaries.","Our collaborative story uncovered how Indonesia hides sand shipment data and how the lives of communities, activists and journalists were endangered by criminal syndicates involved in this lucrative and poorly regulated industry.

Three months after we published, Vietnamese authorities prosecuted 18 people - including a [high-ranking government official](https://https://thanhnien.vn/bat-pho-chu-tich-tinh-an-giang-tran-anh-thu-185230825143700604.htm) - in relation to illegal sand mining in an area which our story covered. Our Vietnamese partner Mekong Eye was the only publication [consistently reporting](https://https://www.mekongeye.com/2023/05/01/mekong-delta-sand-mining/) on the matter. 

Our Kenyan partners, who reported on how Kenyan farmlands was ravaged by sand miners, were invited to participate in an ongoing US-sponsored study on labour conditions in relations to the industry in their country intended for government perusal. Meanwhile, our partners from India, which documented the deaths of workers at the hands of “sand mafias” had their story shortlisted by Fountain Ink’s True Story Award 2024.

We have demonstrated how collaborative journalism can amplify the urgent need for global attention and action to address the human and environmental costs of sand mining.","“Beneath the Sands” is the result of six months of collaborative work where journalists and newsrooms from across the global south brainstorm collectively, share resources and contribute expertise towards investigating an environmental problem which is now increasingly cross-border in nature.

The collaborative nature allowed partners to adopt unique storytelling techniques which they would otherwise have no access to. For instance, we collectively decided to use visual novel elements to tell the story of how women in Cambodia, India, Kenya, and Indonesia are on the frontlines in the resistance against powerful sand mining operations. Both the techniques used and the topic was novel.

Our partners have reported great difficulty in pursuing their story due to [harassment, legal and physical threats, and restriction of access](https://https://www.beneaththesands.earth/we-cant-run-away). This made reporting and sourcing extremely difficult in some cases. As the coordinator of the investigations, the ERC provided lawyers to advise partners and training on safety.

One of our articles also relied on interactive “scrolly pages” and interactive maps to pinpoint the locations for [dozens of major sea reclamation projects](https://https://www.beneaththesands.earth/reclamation) - a major customer for the sand mining industry. This was supported by data visualisations to demonstrate the volume of sand required to reclaim ever more land.","A key component of our project was to use a visual novel to tell the story of how women in four countries were at the forefront of protests against illegal sand miners and syndicates. This style was adopted to provide our project with a unique flair and attract young audiences.

Secondly, our articles were complemented by several documentaries which gave audiences an opportunity to hear directly from the victims of the sand mining industry. 

Finally, our project involved Waypoints and Animate.css for “scrolly pages”, leaflet.js for maps, satellite imagery and Flourish for data visualisations.","Our project underscores the power of collaborative investigative journalism in environmental issues which are increasingly cross-border in nature. Journalists can seek out the ERC and similar organisations which facilitate such networks. 

Apart from covering supply chains and investigating the plight of victims, a unique feature of our project is we chose to investigate the gender angle, which is often overlooked on environmental issues. Our story showed how women had to resort to activism against the male-dominated sand mining industry in order to protect workers and their communities. 

And finally, we hope that our project would inspire innovation in using visual novel style for story-telling in journalism. Not only did this format help to lay down the facts, it was done to trigger an evocative response and relate to a younger audience.","English, Filipino, Chinese, Indonesian",https://www.beneaththesands.earth/,,,,,,,"Febriana Firdaus, Richa Syal, Karol Ilagan, Kuek Ser Kuang Keng, Krisna Pradipta, Vince Belser, Andy Lehren, Loh Pelying, Gwyneth Cheng, Dody Hidayat, Karol llagan, Felipe Salvosa II, Dilrukshi Handunnetti, Shihar Aneez, Daniel Otunge, Jungshin Ho, Sherry Hsueh-LI Lee, Shih Yun Chang, Paritta Wangkiat, Lam Le, Alan Parkhouse, Ajaya Bhadra Khanal, Lulu H, Andy Lehren, Ritu Sarin, lan Yee, Fiona Macleod, Lulu H, Philipus Parera, Felipe Salvosa II, Sindhuri Nandhakumar, Shamsheer Yousaf, Monica Jha, Krisna Pradipta, Yogi Eka Saputra, Budhy Nurgianto, Tharushi Pitigala, Sharon Atieno, Will Yang, Yian Lee, Haohsiang Ko, Yi Hui Chien, Chin Hsuan Hung, Pratch Rujivanarom, Teng Yalirozy, Lay Sopheavotey, Vince Beiser, Febriana Firdaus, Kariston Lapniten, Le Dinh Tuyen, Nabilah Sald, Ritesh Tripathi, Anita Zhang, Ye Yuan, Kenzi Abou-Sabe, Seitel Huang, Visarut Sangkham, Chhorn Sophat, Nyimas Laula, Kariston Lapniten, Le Dinh Tuyen, Shamsheer Yousaf, Sanskar Upadhya, Anita Zhang, Ye Yuan, Sharon Atieno, Ihsan Zahri, Robby Bachtiar, Nyimas Laula, Shamsheer Yousaf, Sanskar Upadhya, Siti Aishah Azmansah, Oijin Tay, Sunardi Alunay, Blanchi Dy, Leong Man Wel, Munirah Mansoor, Nabilah Sald, Zafirah Zein, Kuek Ser Kuang Keng, Richa Syal, Bianchi Dy, Leong Man Wei, Munirah Mansoor, Nabilah Said, Zafirah Zein, Ethan Kong, Griselda Gabriele, Moerat Sitompul, Joseph Luigi Almuena, Griselda Gabriele, Leong Man Wei, Heleena Panicker, Martha Teodoro, Cherry Salazar, Samira Hassan, Leong Man Wei, Sean Ho","Beneath the Sands is the collaborative work of 98 individuals spanning a dozen countries and comprising journalists, editors, video producers, data visualisers, photographers, developers, designers, illustrators, researchers and social media experts.

Os índices de criminalidade tiveram um impacto no começo, mas depois foi se estabilizando a redução.

Essa tese jurídica defende que os povos indígenas só teriam o direito de ocupar os territórios habitados ou disputados em 5 de outubro de 1988, data da Constituição brasileira. Sua eventual aprovação representava, portanto, uma ameaça à proteção legal de diversas reservas já demarcadas (o argumento acabou sendo derrubado posteriormente pelos ministros da Corte). Além disso, o contexto político inclui um acelerado avanço do desmatamento nos anos do governo Jair Bolsonaro, impulsionado pela expansão de atividades como grilagem, garimpo, extração ilegal de madeira e agropecuária. Em relação às Terras Indígenas, o ex-presidente chegou a declarar publicamente que não haveria mais ""nenhum centímetro quadrado demarcado"" para povos indígenas em sua gestão.","A reportagem utilizou dados oficiais do Prodes (Projeto de Monitoramento do Desmatamento na Amazônia Legal por Satélite), mantido pelo Inpe (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), além de bases cartográficas do IBGE (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) e da FUNAI (Fundação Nacional dos Povos Indígenas).

The project used primary sources and official documents to create the first-ever interactive map, incorporating the presence of armed groups and illicit economies in the border regions of six Amazon countries. To ensure the safety of our journalists, we developed a dedicated security protocol for reporting in the Amazon. We engaged with state representatives, community sources, and members of criminal networks to narrate the crime trends in the region.","Several major media interviewed or published about our project: BBC, NPR, CNN, The Guardian, El Pais, Al Jazeera, ABC Australia, Folha de S Paulo, France24, among others. [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-04087-y) also invited us to write an oped. 

GIJN featured us in their [Top 10 best data journalism projects of 2023](https://gijn.org/stories/editors-pick-top-10-data-journalism-projects-from-2023/) and, last November, we were awarded as the best data journalism investigation by the [Claudio Weber Abramo Award in Data Journalism](https://ok.org.br/noticia/conheca-os-finalistas-da-5a-edicao-do-premio-claudio-weber-abramo/), the most important of its kind in Brazil. 

We were invited to present the project in more than 50 events and meetings, among which we may highlight a [WWF and Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History event](https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/lovejoy-symposium), in Washington DC, and the [GI-TOC Global Conference on Organized Crime](https://oc24.heysummit.com/talks/8D/). We also presented the work to several UN agencies, the New York based Climate-Security Mechanism, and government officials in Brazil, Peru and Colombia. In some of these meetings we were told that the gathered data has strong potential as a tool for developing public policies in the Amazon and strengthening international cooperation to tackle criminal activities that threaten the rainforest.

The map is also already being used by NGOs and other media outlets to plan their field work in a secure manner.","The investigation took 1 year and 4 months. In the beginning, we had the intention to cover the complete Amazon region, but during the investigation we realized that it would be impossible to map the more than 1,000 municipalities in the rainforest in the timelapse of the project. So, we decided to focus on mapping the presence of armed groups in the border municipalities, since these places are strategic for the dynamics of the crime organizations in the region.

To gather information, we conducted interviews with primary sources in the territory and filed hundreds of petitions for information. The interviewees mainly consisted of people who have direct contact with armed actors and illicit economies. This diverse group includes Indigenous leaders, community members, church leaders, law enforcement officials, intelligence personnel, public prosecutors, local businesspeople, gang members and individuals involved in illicit economies. Official documents, including intelligence documents and reports from state institutions, were considered. Given the potential bias in politically motivated or poorly researched documents by state institutions, these sources were thoroughly vetted and approved before being added to the database.","The most complex part of this project was gathering the information from zero. Once the data was collected, the challenge was to define a criteria of which armed groups we would highlight on the map and, with that on mind, categorize the data. So, we defined that the most significant armed groups and criminal organizations (in terms of estimated number of members) are individually identified and represented, while smaller criminal outfits are grouped under the category 'others.' After having that defined, the actual database was built in a simple spreadsheet, that was then linked to Mapbox to build the published maps. 

In WordPress, we also used the Jeo plug-in that allows to build scrollytellings using maps. 

With support from the Pulitzer Center and Earthrise, attempts to develop an algorithm for detecting illegal gold mining barges faced challenges due to constant cloud coverage and the mobility of dredges risking double-counting. Opting for an actual flyover, we synchronized cameras with GPS units to map mining dredge locations and calculate associated revenues. Our findings also exposed the ineffectiveness of law enforcement crackdowns, as evidenced by Planet satellite imagery showing changes in river color, indicating miners hid barges before enforcement actions.","First of all, building this database and investigation would have been impossible if we were not in strong collaboration between the different newsrooms, freelance journalists and other specialists working in the project. 

Criminal organizations usually work cross-border exploiting different stages of the supply chain of illicit economies. The coca produced in Peru and Colombia is transported into Ecuador and Brazil, to finally reach Europe through different ports in the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It is almost impossible that a single journalist or even a team from one country can track and investigate this whole chain. So, it is key to have a collaborative cross-border team, working smoothly and intelligently using a mix of quantitative (database, maps) and qualitative (field work) techniques. 

In this matter, it is important to note that collaboration is not (only) a matter of mindset or willingness to be keen. A truly and successful collaborative investigation depends deeply on building processes, routines, dynamics and workflows strong enough that the entire team would trust and feel that it is worth sharing ideas, sources and information with colleagues because they see the result of the joint forces.","English, Spanish, Portuguese",https://amazonunderworld.org/,https://gijn.org/stories/how-they-did-it-investigating-organized-crime-networks-in-the-amazon-rainforest/,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/oct/09/criminals-without-borders-the-transnational-gangs-terrorising-the-amazon,https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/10-innovative-journalism-projects-that-made-an-impact-in-latin-america-in-2023/,,,,"Bram Ebus, Juan Torres, Barbara Fraser, Laura Kurtzberg, Leandro Barbosa, Jeanneth Valdivieso, Pamela Huerta, Jorge Benezra, María de los Ángeles Ramirez, Silvana Vincenti, Tatiana Escárraga, Beatriz Jucá, Mariana Rios, Alex Rufino, Emily Costa, Ivan Brehaut, Rodrigo Pedroso, Sam Cowie, Luiz Fernando Toledo, Rafael Duran, Mathias Felipe, Stefano Wrobleski, Joseph Poliszuk, Sinar Alvarado, Alejandro Gómez Dugand.","**Bram Ebus** was the lead journalist in Amazon Underworld.

Mexico,N+FOCUS (Comercialmente conocida como Triton Comunicaciones),Big,,,Desaparecidas e Ignoradas: El peligro de ser mujer en Nuevo León,06/03/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Video, Politics, Women, Human rights","R, Python","&gt; El caso de la desaparición y muerte de Debanhi Escobar Bazaldua puso a Nuevo León en el foco de la violencia contra las mujeres en México. Esta investigación muestra que aquel caso era la punta del iceberg de una ola de violencia feminicida (desapariciones y asesinatos) que se incrementaron alimentadas por la negligencia de las autoridades, más preocupadas por maquillar los datos que por resolver la crisis.","El reportaje tuvo un impacto notable en un contexto de protestas sociales contra la violencia hacia las mujeres en el estado de Nuevo León. A partir del día siguiente en que se dio a conocer la investigación, Nancy, madre de Jennifer Xiomara, desaparecida en 2022, y uno de los casos que se abordan en el trabajo, fue contactada por la fiscalía estatal para darle avances sobre el caso de su hija. Previo al reportaje, Nancy tenía 6 meses sin noticias de las autoridades. Desde la creación del reportaje se consultó a los más altos funcionarios relacionados con el tema, incluído el gobernador del estado. Tras la publicación de este trabajo, diputadas del congreso local exigieron a la secretaria de mujeres estatal, Graciela Buchanan, una disculpa pública por sus declaraciones en el reportaje, especialmente cuando asegura que en Nuevo León no hay desaparecidas sino que se trata de mujeres que se van voluntariamente o que están involucradas con el crimen organizado. Horas antes de la marcha del día internacional de la mujer y frente a representantes de colectivos feministas, Buchanan ofreció una disculpa pública por sus dichos en la nota.","La investigación se encontró con unas autoridades mucho más preocupadas por negar la evidencia que por dar respuesta a las víctimas. Durante semanas, el gobernador Samuel García se negó a ofrecer declaraciones a los reporteros, hasta el punto que hubo que buscarlo siguiéndolo en sus redes sociales, hasta encontrarlo cuando estaba comprando un vehículo Tesla el día de San Valentín (se trataba de un acto propagandístico ya que el gobernador tenía una fuerte apuesta para atraer esta fábrica a Monterrey). Por otro lado, la publicación del reportaje tuvo consecuencias directas para el medio. Posterior a que la investigación fuese emitida, el gobierno estatal canceló la pauta publicitaria que mantenía con Televisa Monterrey (la televisora perteneciente a N+ en Nuevo León), como castigo por haber realizado esta emisión.","El apartado de los datos del proyecto fue tratado a través de dos lenguajes de programación:
• R: Con esta herramienta se hizo el todo el flujo del análisis de datos y el cálculo de las tasas por cada 100 mil mujeres de los delitos de feminicidio, trata de personas y desapariciones, tanto a nivel nacional como por todos los estados.
• Python: Creación de visualizaciones de datos interactivas para que las y los lectores pudiesen explorar y comparar las tasas de delitos por feminicidios, trata de personas y mujeres desaparecidas en sus respectivos estados. 

Los datos que se usaron fueron:
• [Portal del Registro de Personas Desaparecidas y No Localizadas (RNPDN) de la Comisión Nacional de Búsqueda](https://versionpublicarnpdno.segob.gob.mx/Dashboard/ContextoGeneral): Se hicieron descargas manuales a través de esta plataforma para todos los estados de México.
• [Incidencia Delictiva del Fuero Común](https://www.gob.mx/sesnsp/acciones-y-programas/incidencia-delictiva-del-fuero-comun-nueva-metodologia): Se descargó de la base de datos y se filtraron los registros hasta el fin del 2022.","El principal aprendizaje de esta investigación es la permanencia. El caso de Debanhi Escobar, su desaparición y su muerte violenta en Nuevo León, se convirtió en uno de los casos emblemáticos que muestran la violencia contra las mujeres en México. Este trabajo va más allá y permanece cuando la atención mediática había desaparecido, lo que permite ver esquemas de impunidad y fallas sistémicas en las autoridades del estado que explican por qué las mujeres de este territorio sufren mayores índices de violencia. Más allá de los titulares, la investigación permanece sobre el terreno cuando el resto de informadores ya se ha ido. Eso permite un grado de profundidad y perspectiva que no se logra en el día a día. Otro de los aprendizajes fue la combinación del trabajo de campo con bases de datos de mujeres desaparecidas obtenidas por transparencia, con la reportería a través de redes sociales, lo que nos permitió llegar a víctimas que no habían tenido atención mediática pero que también tenían necesidad de que su caso fuera conocido.",español,https://vimeo.com/903547283,https://www.nmas.com.mx/nmas-focus/programas/nmas-focus/videos/desaparecidas-ignoradas-peligro-ser-mujer-nuevo-leon/,https://investigaciones.nmas.com.mx/desaparecidas-ignoradas-peligro-ser-mujer-en-nuevo-leon/,https://vix.com/es-es/video/video-4382789,,,,"INVESTIGACIÓN: ALEJANDRA BARRIGUETE Y ALBERTO PRADILLA CON INFORMACIÓN DE ITZEL CRUZ.

Mexico,N+Focus,Big,,,Desplazados climáticos: la migración que no vemos,26/06/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Google Earth Engine","Investigación que muestra el impacto de la emergencia climática en el desplazamiento forzado interno en México. Por una parte, se visualizan tres casos de migración causada por la sequía, el incremento de las temperatuas y la falta de lluvias y el aumento del nivel del mar en tres municipios mexicanos. Por otra, una investigación muestra el impacto directo de la emergencia climática, con un incremento de más de un grado en los últimos 20 años, un descenso de las lluvias del 20% y un aumento de la sequía del 16% al 77% del territorio.","El proyecto permite visibilizar un fenómeno oculto: el desplazamiento forzado causado por la emergencia climática. A pesar de que la ley reconoce este fenómeno, las autoridades siguen sin poner en marcha normativas para paliar este problema. En cada uno de los casos, las autoridades prometieron respuestas locales que lamentablemente no se llevaron a cabo. El trabajo también propone una metodología de apoyo a otros periodistas o activistas que quieran retomar los datos de la investigación. A través de una profunda revisión de datos, se elaboró una base que incluye los más de 2 mil municipios del país y se analiza cómo son impactados por sequía, falta de lluvias o incremento de la temperatura. Esto puede servir como base para arrancar futuras investigaciones partiendo de los datos ya estructurados, tanto en relación con la migración climática como con otro tipo de variables que se incluyen en la investigación.","México es uno de los países más vulnerables a la emergencia climática según funcionarios del Instituto Nacional de Ecología y Cambio Climático. Sin embargo, la certeza del impacto de las condiciones climáticas sobre la población no vino acompañada por medidas de apoyo, y ese es un elemento clave. Por primera vez, un trabajo une tanto los datos duros que muestran hasta qué punto la acción humana impacta sobre los habitantes del país, como muestra ejemplos claros de esas consecuencias. Se trata de casos como la comunidad El Bosque, en Tabasco, que lleva varios años viendo cómo sus casas se hunden por el incremento del nivel del mar, como la laguna de Metztitlán, en Hidalgo, que se secó en dos ocasiones en los últimos tres años, o Pinotepa Nacional, en Oaxaca, donde la sequía condena a los pescadores a migrar a Estados Unidos. En todos los casos se trata de un problema global que, ante la falta de acción institucional, solo tiene soluciones individuales. Para el trabajo, además, se desarrolló una profunda investigación de datos que permite conocer, municipio a municipio, el impacto real de la emergencia climática en México.","Se usaron dos lenguajes de programación para la extracción, procesamiento, análisis y visualización de datos.

• Python: Usado para el cálculo de anomalías, transformación y extracción de datos raster de variables climatológicas a través de la [API de Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides), así como para el procesamiento y cálculo de rachas de sequía en municipios de acuerdo con el Monitor de Sequía de México. Finalmente con Python se crearon mapas y gráficos interactivos para que las y los lectores pudiesen explorar cómo la crisis climática ha afectado a sus estados y municipios.
• R: Se realizó la evaluación de variables representativas usando la técnica estadística de Análisis de Componentes Principales (PCA), así como el análisis de datos de las variables climatológicas para la identificación de los estados que han sido más afectados por la crisis climática.

Se exploraron diferentes fuentes de datos pero destacan dos:
• [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/): Plataforma que facilitó el acceso, cálculo y manipulación de datos raster de variables climatológicas.
• [Monitor de Sequía de México](https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/es/climatologia/monitor-de-sequia/monitor-de-sequia-en-mexico): Cuenta con los registros de tipo de sequía de acuerdo al [Monitor de Sequía de América del Norte (NADM)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/nadm/). El registro cuenta con más de 20 años de datos a nivel municipal.","El desplazamiento causado por la crisis climática no está recibiendo suficiente atención en medios, más en estos tiempos donde las consecuencias son cada vez más severas. Una de las grandes virtudes del trabajo es que otros periodistas podrán tomarlo como referencia para crear sus propias investigaciones, tanto por su perspectiva, como por el uso de los datos. Se espera que pueda servir como ejemplo de un trabajo donde la metodología y los datos estén disponibles y sin algún tipo de limitante para que más personas accedan a ellos. 

La metodología es totalmente transparente al estar en un [repositorio público](https://github.com/nmasfocusdatos/desplazamiento-climatico). En este mismo repositorio se tienen los datos climatológicos para todos los municipios y estados de México listos para su descarga, para que las personas tengan acceso a ellos sin ningún obstáculo. 

No se trata únicamente de que se revisen los datos, sino de que puedan servir de punto de partida para otras investigaciones. Un medio local puede retomar los datos de su propio municipio y construir sus propias historias, así como ubicarse en la media nacional o compararse con otras localidades de su entorno.

The two groups, the Kusasis and Mamprusis, embroiled in what appears to be an intractable ethnic conflict give each other animal labels. This investigation revealed that while Kusasis refer to the Mamprusis as “monkeys”, the Mamprusis also refer to the Kusasis as “pigs” on social media.
These animal labels may seem harmless but history has shown that when humans are tagged as animals, it dehumanizes them. The project pointed out a worrying trend.","1. Key social media pages monitored after publications showed that some sone pages that spread hate stopped posting.
2. The story gave important intelligence to Ghana's security agencies to carefully monitor accounts that incite violence. 
3. The story also flagged dangerous social media accounts to facebook.","To tell this story, I had to keenly follow some very key pages.

We wanted to know how these officers were doing this – what their hours were, how this volume of overtime was physically possible, and whether the department was properly regulating overwork.

Through public records requests, data analysis, and interviews, we found top-earning officers are routinely recording 16-18 hour shifts, back-to-back. In some cases, they’re breaking department policies on overwork and working hours that experts say are dangerous.","The project produced the fullest known accounting of the hours and earnings of D.C. police officers. Criminologists have asked for our dataset, current and former MPD officers and supervisors have reached out to note the story’s accuracy, our overtime reporting has been cited in testimony before the D.C. Council, and the story spread across social media, neighborhood email groups, and local newsletters. 

We think the full potential impact of the reporting has also yet to be realized: we have used the data in two stories so far – but there are likely several more stories in this dataset, which details the daily hours of about 4,000 D.C. police department employees for a five-year period.","D.C.’s police department is notorious for not responding to FOIA requests, and the department is also notorious for retaliating against employees who speak with the press. Despite this, we were able to get data on officer hours and earnings through the city’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer via a combination of direct emailed requests and FOIA requests. The data we eventually received was not standardized, and it was difficult to interpret – which meant we only had parts of the whole story.

To piece the rest together, we had to write code to normalize all of the data. And we were able to speak with more than a dozen current or former MPD employees who could help us understand the full story behind this data: why officers are logging these hours, how it’s even physically possible for them to do so, and which divisions of the department we should examine most closely.","The goal was to identify how much each police officer made in salary and overtime, and the divisions where top earners worked. But the information we received through public record requests was housed in numerous Excel files that have unstandardized information such as name, base pay, hours of overtime, division, bureau, and years with the force. Some files only identified police officers with last names and divisions while others used first and middle names, and different parts of salary and overtime dollars were spread across multiple sheets. To normalize everything, we developed a code book using sourcing and public documentation to match information about each police officer, and then used R and Python to clean naming conventions and sum overtime categories with base pay. We also used the programming languages to identify the highest earners and outliers. We used Google Sheets to hold our datasets and utilized Datawrapper and D3/Javascript to build stacked bar charts and tables for our final story.

We also conducted dozens of interviews over a period of eight months. The reporting resulted in two stories on DCist.com and two features that aired on WAMU 88.5, translating a numbers-heavy project into digestible stories for the radio audience.","We each brought different reporting strengths to the collaboration. Jenny’s sourcing informed Aarushi’s ability to develop the codebook that helped us parse this data. And Aarushi’s analysis of the data informed Jenny as she conducted interviews for the story. Analyzing this government payroll data was impossible without knowing the nuts and bolts of the job of policing and the policies that govern D.C. police hours, scheduling, and overtime. 

Another lesson from this reporting is that it’s essential to meticulously document your methodology. We documented every step of cleaning, standardizing, and analyzing the dataset to fact-check how we normalized previously incongruous data. This allowed us to create enough of the puzzle that reporting could fill in.",English,https://dcist.com/on-the-clock/,,,,,,,"Jenny Gathright, Aarushi Sahejpal, Tyrone Turner, Natalie Delgadillo, Wesley Lowery, Cleo Pool","Jenny Gathright is a criminal justice reporter at WAMU/DCist, Aarushi Sahejpal is Data Editor at the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, Tyrone Turner is Visuals Editor and Photojournalist at WAMU/DCist, Natalie Delgadillo is Managing Editor at WAMU/DCist, Cleo Pool is graphics intern at the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University, and Wesley Lowery is Executive Editor at the Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University."

Desde su creación en 2016, la unidad de periodismo se ha enfocado en investigar casos de corrupción, tanto gubernamentales como empresariales, sin hacer distinción de partidos o intereses políticos. Esta labor de fiscalización desde el periodismo ha derivado en ataques constantes por parte del Gobierno de México y sus colaboradores, con acciones intimidatorias como auditorías financieras, demandas y campañas de desprestigio impulsadas por el propio presidente mexicano, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

They include passport confiscation, paying recruitment fees, excessive working hours and unpaid overtime, poor living conditions and restrictions on freedom of movement. Many workers were desperate to leave their jobs and return home, but could not, as local laws require permission from their companies to resign and exit the country, which their managers denied.",Amazon had pledged to investigate the issues raised and reimburse workers who had been forced to pay recruitment fees to obtain jobs at the company. McDonald's and IHG also disclosed they had initiated investigations of the treatment of their workers in Saudi Arabia and the wider Persian Gulf due to the publication of our work.,"We interviewed about 140 workers for this story. In the first phase, we surveyed about 40 workers employed by different companies in the Persian Gulf to survey their working and living conditions. We then used this information to decide what companies to focus on. We then interviewed 97 workers for the final investigation. We turned qualitative information from these conversations into quantitative data to calculate the frequency of each abuse (e.g. passport confiscation) experienced at each company. 
The political landscape of the Persian Gulf countries is challenging as there is no freedom of the press and human rights issues are rarely covered by local journalists. Both reporters have many years of experience covering the region and were able to identify relevant potential labor abuse victims from their social media activities, then conduct a lengthy interview (which often took place in instalments over several months - we were in constant contact with our interviewees) with them over text messages, video and voice calls, as well as collecting documents (such as payslips, contracts, employment certificates) to verify their accounts. 
Source protection was vital, as the workers were at risk of repercussions in these countries, as they have poor human rights records.","Social media was an essential tool for identifying the labor trafficking victims. This was done by researching information such as listed employers on Facebook and LinkedIn, geotagging on Instagram and activity on TikTok. 
We pulled 1200 names and contact details from the social media platforms of people we believed were likely to be employed by the companies we were investigating in the Persian Gulf. Then, we had to contact them, typically through a direct message, and interview those who responded. We had an 11.5% hit rate of workers who responded, agreed to be interviewed, and whom we could verify as legitimate current or recent former employees of Amazon, Chuck E. Cheese, McDonald's, and IHG Hotels. 
We utilized trauma-informed reporting techniques as some of these workers were very vulnerable. We always disclosed our identities as journalists. We ensured that they understood why we talked to them and our capacities as journalists. We endeavoured not to get their hopes up in any way that we could help rescue them or provide some other assistance. We only pursued interviews with people we were sure understood this and gently ended conversations where we felt this wasn’t the case.","This was one of the largest human trafficking journalism projects of its kind, where almost 100 labor abuse victims were identified and interviewed in detail over several months. We feel this is a valuable approach when interviewing victims of human trafficking as it has benefits for several reasons. 1. interviewing almost 100 people enables the reports to build up a clear picture of abuses taking place (and reporting can't be skewered by one exceptionally good or bad account that could be an anomaly). 2. Human trafficking victims and migrant workers subjected to labor abuses may be disorientated or lack certain documents needed to corroborate their accounts in full. Again, our investigative approach enables the reporters to build up a more accurate and more precise picture of the situation by undertaking dozens of interviews to corroborate allegations. It gives the investigation more weight and credibility to the reader.",English,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/oct/10/mcdonalds-trafficking-links-claims-chuck-e-cheese-saudi-arabia,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/10/amazon-trafficking-links-claims-saudi-arabia-workers-abuses,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWjoP0_lXcM,,,,,"Katie McQue

Em muitas dessas regiões, formaram-se as favelas. Nos últimos anos, com o avanço da pandemia de Covid-19 e da crise econômica, esse tipo de moradia improvisada cresceu na cidade e se espalhou por diversos distritos. Neste projeto baseado em dados, mostramos onde estão os domicílios em favelas da capital e como eles se espalharam pela cidade, quais características fizeram com que determinadas áreas recebessem esse tipo de moradia e como isso impacta na vida da população.","Ao todo, a reportagem chegou perto de 20 mil acessos nas várias plataformas em que foi disponibilizada. Além da página especial, publicamos em vídeo no Youtube e no Instagram, onde obtivemos a maior parte das visualizações. O projeto foi também destacado na Coda (Conferência de Jornalismo de Dados), uma conferência de jornalismo de dados reconhecida no Brasil, onde foi apresentado em uma oficina como exemplo de uso de dados para retratar as periferias.","O projeto enfrentou desafios relacionados à representação das favelas na mídia, um tema muitas vezes excluído da agenda pública, e trabalhou dentro de um contexto de recursos limitados. O acesso a dados precisos e confiáveis sobre as favelas foi um obstáculo, pois a própria palavra 'favela' é um termo em disputa. Para a realização do trabalho, usamos a definição e os dados oficiais disponibilizados pela Prefeitura da Cidade de São Paulo.

O uso de tecnologias inovadoras foi essencial. Além de um scroll map interativo no MapBox, o projeto incorporou gráficos interativos em JavaScript, fornecendo uma visão detalhada e interativa dos dados. Fotos, ilustração e relatos de moradores das periferias enriqueceram o trabalho com perspectivas humanas e pessoais.","Para o desenvolvimento do 'Panorama das Favelas em São Paulo', utilizamos uma combinação de ferramentas e tecnologias para criar uma narrativa interativa e rica em dados. O MapBox foi uma ferramenta chave, permitindo a criação de mapas interativos e detalhados. Com o MapBox, implementamos um scroll map, que proporciona uma experiência imersiva ao usuário ao navegar pela geografia das favelas de São Paulo.

Utilizamos JavaScript para integrar os mapas interativos com outras funcionalidades da reportagem, garantindo uma experiência de usuário fluida e interativa. O HTML foi a base para a estruturação da página da reportagem, assegurando que o conteúdo fosse acessível e bem organizado.

Além disso, empregamos a biblioteca D3.js para criar gráficos interativos. D3.js nos permitiu visualizar dados complexos de uma forma que fosse tanto informativa quanto atraente visualmente. Essa combinação de MapBox, JavaScript, HTML e D3.js nos permitiu contar a história das favelas de São Paulo de uma maneira envolvente e profundamente informativa, aproveitando ao máximo as capacidades de visualização de dados modernas.","O projeto busca colocar ao centro uma narrativa de dados humanizada sobre territórios marginalizados pela mídia e pelo poder público. Este projeto também reforça a necessidade de abordagens profundas em temas sociais. Ao focar nas favelas de São Paulo, ele não apenas apresenta dados, mas os contextualiza dentro de questões maiores de desigualdade e desenvolvimento urbano.

A importância da inovação tecnológica no jornalismo também é destaque. O uso de scroll maps interativos e gráficos em JavaScript exemplifica como a tecnologia pode tornar a narrativa mais envolvente e acessível.

Um aspecto crucial é a combinação de análises de dados com narrativas pessoais. Integrando dados quantitativos com fotos e relatos dos moradores, o projeto fornece uma visão humana e multifacetada do assunto.

Mesmo com recursos limitados e em contextos sensíveis, é possível produzir trabalhos impactantes. Essa combinação de inovação tecnológica, profundidade temática, integração de dados e relatos pessoais são lições valiosas que aprendemos e que servem para qualquer profissional da área.",Português,https://www.agenciamural.org.br/especiais/favelas-de-sao-paulo/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7i2PZcEKnY&amp;ab_channel=Ag%C3%AAnciaMuraldeJornalismodasPeriferias,,,,,,"Por: Ingrid Fernandes, José Florentino, Paulo Talarico

In an effort to map out for the first time the state of violence and femicide across the continent, both before and during the Covid-19 pandemic, 19 European newsrooms collaborated to find new data in at least 22 countries. ""The Undeclared War on Women in Europe: Femicide and the rise of violence against women"" is a cross-border data investigation that revealed the staggering shortage of official, comparable and up to date data on violence against women in the EU, which result in implementing ineffective policies on a European level.","The investigation was published on MIIR's website &amp; simultaneously on the front-page of Greece’s second largest newspaper, ""Efimerida ton Syntakton"" and its online edition (Efsyn gr), which has over 18 million unique users per month. The story was republished on the European Data Journalism Network in at least 7 languages other than English (Greek, German, Italian, Spanish, French, French, Croatian and Polish). The 14 EDJNet media partners who took part in the investigation used the main findings on the state of violence against women in Europe to work on stories with an angle closer to their respective audiences, broadening the outreach to the whole of Europe. The story and our main findings were also re-published on a number of greek and international news websites, such as Euronews, as well as active NGOs and feminist organizations such as the “European Observatory on Femicide” and “Diotima”. In May 2023 the research &amp; methodology were presented at a session of Dataharvest in Mechelen, Belgium. In September 2023 we also participated by invitation at the Global Investigative Journalism Network Conference in Gothenburg, Sweden on a session on femicides. More media partners have shown interest and a follow-up report is currently being worked on.","MIIR and its media partners used a data-approach to discuss the issue of femicides (the deliberate killing of women because they are women), a topic that either goes under-reported or is presented in an extremely sensationalistic way that causes the audience to lose sight of the rate at which femicides occur and the need to look at the reasons behind the phenomenon.
Furthermore, the investigation reveals the significant shortcomings in the accurate collection and publishing of recent data by state actors, which translate into a lack of interest by EU governments to better regulate and provide solutions on an issue that affects the lives of all women living in the European continent. 
Before the ""The Undeclared War on Women in Europe"", there was no official data about femicides at an EU level after 2018, nor an updated map of violence against women. By carefully collecting and analyzing statistical evidence by competent authorities on violence against women in Europe before &amp; during the covid-19 pandemic, we were able to provide a significant report on a cross-European level that fills an existing gap of five years without updated information on the issue, highlighting the major limitations this has on policy making.","In this cross-border project:
-We created a new database which previously did not exist, with updated and comparable statistics about violence against women during the pandemic. We merged different datasets that we collected in this master dataset.
-We used Python scripts to parse pdf tables of the EIGE report and scripts that cleaned all the Eurostat data.
-We fact-checked the dataset structure and analysis.
-We focused on rates, not absolute numbers. Collecting data from different countries means disparities in data collection methodologies and calculations. We calculated percentage changes to make meaningful comparisons.
-We used general statistical data for comparisons purposes. Comparing data on femicide to statistics like population contextualized the incidence of female murders against the overall population.
-We created visualizations to depict the real extent of the phenomenon across EU countries and showing which countries fare better in preventing violent crimes against women. 
-We visualised the missing data and shed light on the under-reporting of gender-based violence in European countries.
-We conducted interviews with affected women and family members, as well as experts on the issue allowed this project to strike a balance between statistics and personal narrative to produce powerful storytelling about the issue of femicide.","This project is an example of how journalists can use data to investigate and bring to light a significantly underreported issue like femicides and gender-based violence. Through persistent data collection efforts, innovative and careful data analysis and fact-checking of the main findings, our team was able to creatively overcome the lack of data with similar, and thus comparable characteristics among European countries, due to different laws and interpretations of crimes related to violence against women. By requesting statistical figures from the competent national authorities for the years 2010-2021, we created a new comprehensive database which contains important findings for the direction of gender-based violence in European countries. By analysing the results we were able to point out which countries are doing the most to prevent femicides and where violence against women is more prevalent. 
In the project we also managed to keep the focus on the human lives affected by violence, simultaneously providing an answer on how journalists can do better when reporting on this critical issue, and use data without reducing the murder of women to crime statistics, producing a narrative that humanizes but does not sensationalize.","English, Greek, French, Italian, Spanish, Polish, Croatian",https://miir.gr/en/the-undeclared-war-on-women-in-europe-part-1/,https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/femicides-in-europe/,https://lab.imedd.org/en/femicides-methodology/,https://github.com/troboukis/FEMICIDES/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb,,,,"-Authors: Janine Louloudi, Nikos Morfonios, Kostas Zafeiropoulos (MIIR)

The cumulative 16-year Sindh Climate Budget expenditure of PKR 20.200 billion is eclipsed by the cost of an Expressway, a controversial mega road project valued at PKR 27.5 billion.","Despite being published in a low-scale media outlet, our project gained widespread recognition among climate activists, academia, and the development sector. It was featured among the [top 10 data-driven](https://gijn.org/stories/data-journalism-top-10-israel-hamas-war-breathing-machine-defects-loneliness-epidemic-and-nobel-prize-winners/) stories for September and October 2023 by the Global Investigative Journalism Network and other major international media outlets. The same network later declared it one of the top [investigative stories in Pakistan](https://gijn.org/stories/2023-best-investigative-stories-pakistan/) for 2023, and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism Newsletter acknowledged the story in November 2023.

Following the project's launch on the website, media development organizations requested our assistance in training journalists on interpreting government budget books. We conducted [two training ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C010JbkMIGl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) sessions and are currently developing a module in response to high demand from the journalistic community. Beyond journalists, political parties, mainly from the opposition, are reaching out to us for training on budget book analysis. The project has ignited a debate in academia, politics, and the development sector on flawed development policies causing harm to vulnerable communities during climate change phenomena.","We faced extreme resource constraints; not only did we lack funding for the project's execution, but we also lacked a team for designing infographics and managing the website's backend. While sifting through numerous government budget books, we simultaneously created charts and tables on Excel and worked on the website's layout and backend. Our resource limitations led us to resort to Google and YouTube to learn how to enhance the website's layout for a more engaging story.

Despite these challenges, our story gained recognition on international platforms. While data access was easy, we often encountered difficulties in interpreting it due to significant discrepancies. It later became apparent that there were typos in the government budget books, consuming considerable time and energy for deciphering.

Staying strictly data-focused without injecting personal sentiments into the story made it exceptionally powerful. The data revealed the 16-year performance of a government that had ruled the province for three consecutive terms, just ahead of elections. This stirred controversy, leading to some opposition, preventing widespread promotion of the story within the country.","Initially, we searched for old budget books in government libraries, focusing on expenditures and allocations of climate change-related departments and identifying districts with prominent climate-related development schemes.

Interestingly, we later gained online access to all budget files. Compiling our data in an Excel sheet, we conducted a thorough analysis of various trends.

We created a climate budget map displaying the number of development schemes proposed by the Sindh government in each district from 2008-09 to 2023-24. The climate budget departments included Environment, Climate Change, Coastal Department, Directorate of Climate Change, Coastal Development, Forest and Wildlife, Alternative Energy, and Rehabilitation.

Surprisingly, the majority of development schemes were concentrated in lower (coastal) Sindh rather than upper Sindh, the region prone to floods. The schemes appeared to be more politically motivated than driven by policy and data.

To examine the planning behind allocation and expenditure, we developed a spider graph. The results indicated that decisions were primarily driven by ad hoc measures or aimed at garnering voter support.","Numbers do not lie; that's the crucial lesson we gleaned from this project. Strictly adhering to data proved more than sufficient to unveil government performance, eliminating the need to pursue government officials for quotes and verifications—everything was accessible in the budget files. Our only outreach was to politicians for their perspectives.

This aspect is precisely what other journalists can take away from our story. As mentioned earlier, we are developing a module on how to interpret budget books, allowing fellow journalists to grasp presenting data in layman's language. We navigated through bureaucratic jargon to present the story in a straightforward manner, intending to reach a broader audience. Our story encompasses various trends observed through data.

By adopting similar techniques, other journalists can delve into the budget documents of different government departments to expose governmental performance. We utilized diverse graph types, such as a spider graph, to assess planning during the budget allocation phase. This knowledge can be shared with other journalists to enhance their investigative toolkit.",English,https://thecitizenry.pk/2023/09/26/big-claims-small-expenditures-battered-by-heatwaves-and-floods-sindh-spent-less-than-half-its-climate-budget-in-16-years/,,,,,,,"Sadya Siddiqui, Oonib Azam","Sadya Siddiqui is a policy researcher brought onboard by The Citizenry.

United States of America,THE CITY,Small,,,Destabilized,15/02/2023,Database,Scraping,"“Destabilized” exposed an ongoing crisis of housing affordability and homelessness in New York: tens of thousands of apartments with rents capped under the state’s rent regulation law sit vacant, held off the market by landlords.

Combining investigative data analysis with in-person reporting, we examined evidence landlords are intentionally keeping apartments empty — with as many as 88,000 vacant at one point in 2021 — after a 2019 state overhaul of tenant laws strictly limited rent increases.","THE CITY created an interactive map that lets readers search by address and see every apartment unit that was registered with the state as rent-stabilized in 2019 but no longer is. THE CITY also published a guide on how a tenant can look up their rent history. 

The interactive map uses a unique dataset created by the nonprofit group JustFix, which extracted information from property tax bills for 2019, 2020, and 2021. This dataset included details on 45,000 buildings with rent-stabilized units. During fact-checking, THE CITY identified and helped fix an error that affected nearly 500 records in the dataset. Further sample checks were conducted to verify the data's credibility. 

After the app was published, renters contacted THE CITY to share their rental histories and inconsistencies in their rent payments. 

An email from housing advocacy group West Bronx Housing and Neighborhood Resource Center Executive Director said, “I just wanted to reach out and share an example of a building where the landlord is flagrantly deregulating the units, which we found using your map of deregulated units tool. We're going to be investigating the other building he owns. See attached, and thank you so much for this wonderful tool.”","Three years after a 2019 overhaul was supposed to stop landlords from removing most apartments from rent stabilization, an investigation from THE CITY uncovered thousands of rent-stabilized units still unaccounted for by the state, despite the 2019 law. 

During a time where the city’s housing affordability is at a record low, enforcing rent-stabilization policies is pivotal in ensuring every New Yorker has a place in this city and a quality place to live. 

However, the nonprofit group JustFix shared with THE CITY records of 44,470 buildings that reported rent-stabilized units on their property tax bills in the last few years. The records highlighted a disparity in the number of programs created to increase rent-stabilized units and the number of units being reported. THE CITY found that nearly 1 in 10 rent stabilized units disappeared from landlords' tax bills in 2020 and didn’t come back in 2021.","We obtained data from a variety of sources, including city and state data reports, open data portals, and data scraping projects, Much of the data for this report came from the state’s housing agency, which originally did not respond to initial requests for comment or information for the story. Without direct access to their data, we faced difficulty reporting on registered apartment vacancies and ultimately had to rely on other sources to construct a clearer picture of the current state of rent stabilized housing stock in NYC. Those other sources included the leaked data memo from that same agency. We also relied on data scraped from landlord property tax bills indicating the number of rent stabilized units reported for each New York City address. We conducted the data analyses using R (specifically the R tidyverse package) and SQL (specifically PostgreSQL). We designed and published data visualizations for the report using DataWrapper.",n/a,English,https://projects.thecity.nyc/rent-stabilized-map/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/12/11/rent-stabilized-apartment-tally-drops-landlords-rent-market/?_gl=1%2Acdbbsy%2A_ga%2AMTE4MzY1NTQyOC4xNjk3NDg3MzUw%2A_ga_G0ZNNV3GTX%2AMTcwNTUxMTg5NS45NC4xLjE3MDU1MTIyODYuMC4wLjA,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/02/15/rent-stabilized-apartments-disappearing/,,,,,"Sam Rabiyah, Suhail Bhat, Scott Klein","Sam Rabiyah is a journalist and multidisciplinary technologist based in NYC.

With that, we feel obliged to provide the information the voters would need in the ballot. This information ranges from the multiple candidates' background, political track record, controversies, oligarchic support, and, ultimately, their views on issues the voters deem important. These issues are divided to topics, namely economics, law, social welfare, environment, national security, and international relations. As politics can be a heavy issue for some, we're presenting this information in a game format where readers can interact directly with our content and even give their own ratings on the candidates' views.","Two months after its release, the page has helped more than k views getting to know more of their presidential candidates. It has also been used as a reference for young voters in Indonesia, which would dominate this election by more than 50%.","Prabowo Subianto, a former general stripped from its position due to human rights violation, is leading the election preliminary polls. Through TikTok, Prabowo attracts voters by dancing in a way they call ""gemoy"", an infantilized word for cute. Over night, he's loved by young voters. However, we also see this as a degradation for political discourse in Indonesia and could be detrimental for the quality of our democracy in the future. In the end, election is a battle of ideas, not gimmicks, and Prabowo is not lacking with ideas either.

For that reason, we aim to present those ideas in an accessible way where voters can engage with those informations directly. Ultimately, we want voters to discuss those ideas and educate themselves on what's important. This is also why we decide to do the game format so readers can compare and rate how the candidates stand on certain issues. The other reason is we feel this is the best format to reach young voters so they can get familiarized with politics in probably their first ever presidential election.","We compile archives of past news of the candidates, their speeches on tape, political poll results, to write their views and standings on certain issues. These findings are then compiled to Google docs to be edited by the editors. We also create data visualisations sourced from electability polls using Datawrapper.

United States of America,THE CITY,Small,,,WATCH: Videos Show NYPD Chiefs Intervened Before Voiding of Ex-Cop’s Gun Arrest,09/03/2023,Investigation,Adobe Creative Suite,"On March 23, THE CITY published a story and forensic video investigation offering a behind-the-scenes look at how two NYPD chiefs intervened in the case of a retired cop who was arrested for allegedly menacing three youths with a gun.

Yoav Gonen obtained video from 36 body-worn, neighborhood and precinct house cameras. Through a painstaking video investigation, THE CITY was able to piece together the clearest account of what happened on a Thanksgiving eve in Brownsville, when an ex-cop allegedly menaced three youths with a gun — and one of the top-ranked officers in the NYPD intervened to have him released.","Following THE CITY’s story, regional station Hot 97 interviewed the three boys about their ordeal, further raising awareness of the incident and Maddrey’s intervention on behalf of the officer who chased the boys. 

Our video investigation single-handedly reignited interest in a 2021 police incident in which a retired cop allegedly menaced youths with a gun and then had his arrest voided after the intervention of Chief Jeffrey Maddrey, one of the highest ranking officers in the NYPD. 

After our video was released, public demonstrations were held in front of City Hall and elected officials began to side with the youths. Then, in a stunning and unprecedented decision against such a high-ranking officer, a civilian review board ruled in April that Maddrey had abused his authority, and in May the police commissioner, who had previously rejected hundreds of review board rulings, levied the maximum penalty against Maddrey, who is fighting the decision.

Shortly afterward, the department’s first woman and third Black commissioner abruptly announced her departure from the NYPD. A source close to Sewell told THE CITY that in making the decision to discipline Maddrey, the commissioner “knew her days were numbered.”","We had a ‘they said - they said’ situation here between a group of young black boys and the NYPD, in which the police department was digging its heels on its insistence that nothing inappropriate was done by a high-ranking police official. We managed to obtain not only body-worn camera footage that documents precisely why the local sergeant believed he had probable cause to arrest the former police officer, but also police precinct footage that showed how little time the ex-cop spent in the jail cell and how chummy the police officials involved were with him. 

The police department refused to provide any footage on the basis that the underlying arrest was sealed. We could have challenged that conclusion in court, which we disagreed with, but instead we FOIL’d the Brooklyn DA’s office for the same footage and, after appeal, were ultimately successful in obtaining more than 30 videos from the DA.","Our main story was based on video footage, which we obtained from a number of sources, many of them stemming from Freedom of Information Law Requests. Some of the video was obtained directly from homeowners/businesses in the area.

We submitted FOILs to the city’s Department of Education (for school camera footage), the NYPD (for all footage relevant to the incident and aftermath) and the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office.",To exhaust all options when pursuing crucial information relevant to your story.,English,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/03/09/nypd-police-jeffrey-maddrey-video/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/04/14/jeffrey-maddrey-nypd-ccrb-abuse-authority-brownsville-brooklyn/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/05/24/jeffrey-maddrey-nypd-police-oversight/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/06/29/keechant-sewell-eric-adam-jeffrey-maddrey-nypd/,,,,Yoav Gonen,"Yoav Gonen is a senior reporter for THE CITY, where he covers NYC government, politics and the police department."

Some districts were almost unrecognizable, while others may have lost an airport, or gained a large housing complex full of voting-age adults.

To help our readers understand their local district, we’ve created a guide to give them key information about their district’s candidates, demographics, and voting patterns.","The project proved useful and popular. In the days leading up to the June primaries, the guide was viewed more times than the number of people who participated in early voting. By the end of early voting, Know Your District garnered 100,000 page views, while the number of early votes was 65,000.","Know Your District was launched against a backdrop of newly redrawn districts in New York, radically changing some districts and who voters’ representatives would be. To help voters understand their new district and the election, THE CITY created this interactive guide on key information about district candidates, demographics, and voting patterns. 

Although there were a few competitive districts, most races had strong incumbents and the primaries in June were the “real” election. The most pressing question for most New Yorkers wasn’t necessarily “who will win” but “what council district am I in now, and who else is in the same district”? So we focused the storytelling efforts on the district.",The project is written in javascript using React.

United States of America,THE CITY,Small,,,The Deed Finders,17/04/2023,Database,Scraping,"When homeowners die without a will, speculators scoop up shares from unsuspecting heirs in a scheme that destroys generational wealth in Black &amp; Latino communities.","Historically, this phenomenon of speculative acquisition of fractional property interests took place in the rural south. THE CITY’s series documented the scheme for the first time in an urban or northern context.

The speculators' candid descriptions of their business model, published in Joseph and Maldonado's first investigative piece in April, generated immediate outrage from lawmakers and community leaders. A second investigation has since catalyzed widespread demands for legal protections for homeowners and reform of agencies overseeing asset distribution. Joseph and Maldonado also detailed the legal loopholes and lack of oversight that makes such schemes possible — and THE CITY published the names of the LLCs the speculators hid behind.

After THE CITY’s investigation, city and state legislators have vowed to introduce bills aimed at curbing fractional deed speculation by informing heirs of the value of their inheritances and providing them with legal resources. Likewise, federal and county law enforcement have told THE CITY they are investigating the two rings of speculators our series profiled.","In spring 2023, reporter George Joseph received a tip from a real estate investor concerned about suspicious deed purchases of brownstones at prices far below market value in rapidly gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhoods. Joseph soon uncovered a troubling pattern: dozens of brownstones were targeted by a team of four speculators, who often obscured their activity through shell companies.

Joseph joined forces with reporter Samantha Maldonado, who had already cultivated one of the speculators as a remarkably candid source while pursuing a separate housing story.

Together Joseph and Maldonado embarked on a seven-month investigation of the transactions. They poured through business registrations, court documents and property records, building a database of hundreds of properties that two different rings of speculators had targeted. They tracked down and gained the trust of far-flung heirs, evicted tenants, dispossessed relatives and notary publics, whose signatures had purportedly validated some of the transactions. 

Joseph and Maldonado spent weeks knocking on doors of tenants and heirs, hearing firsthand accounts of the speculators' tactics and the resulting fears of displacement from long-time residents. They also confronted the speculators at their offices and homes, to hear in the speculators' own words how and why they targeted properties in Black neighborhoods.",They used the sources listed previously to build their own database in order to understand the scope of the speculators’ activities and connect shell companies to individuals.,"The importance of going beyond the numbers in data reporting and equally focusing on firsthand, shoe leather reporting to contextualize findings.",English,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/04/17/speculators-black-brown-homes-deeds/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/07/13/elliot-joseph-ambalo-etai-vardi-heirs-speculators-eviction/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/07/26/speculators-oversight-deeds-policy-solutions/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/10/31/queens-public-administrator-speculator-bros-deed-theft/,,,,"George Joseph

United States of America,The Marshall Project,Big,,,Bail Reform in Cleveland,28/06/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Open data, News application, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Politics, Crime, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python, Javascript and Observable notebooks, Hasura/GraphQL","This project comprehensively investigated bail reform efforts in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, where the use of cash bail has dropped significantly. But instead of implementing more controversial or sweeping reforms — changes to state laws, formal court rules or an expensive overhaul of the county’s pretrial services — county justice officials told us they changed their culture and practices. It involved an in-depth analysis of felony cases, highlighting the impacts of bail system changes on public safety, racial disparities, and jail populations. The package also included a historical timeline of bail reform efforts and an explainer on Ohio's bail bond system.","The criminal justice system — and especially the court system — is resistant to systemic change. At the same time, our story focuses on reform. We think that makes it a unique and necessary type of investigation that’s part of a bigger effort to shine a light on Cleveland’s court system.

Our investigation shows how a major reform came to be and what could challenge it in the future. We’ve heard from judges and policy makers that our work offers an important and clear-eyed perspective on a critical topic. 

At the same time, we wanted to give audiences news they could use about a system that still affects thousands of people every year. Our explainer on the basics of bail in Ohio is about the least flashy piece of content one could imagine, but it’s the top result on Google and the source Google uses to answer search questions about bail in the state. Soon, the explainer will be distributed as a printed flier in justice-affected communities.","The Marshall Project invested significantly in extracting nearly 70,000 records from the court’s docket and in creating a feedback loop to understand what residents might want to know about the larger system. We built and continue to maintain significant computation infrastructure to access these court records because of a systemic lack of transparency around court records in Ohio.

The analysis by Ilica Mahajan is one of the most complex that The Marshall Project has attempted: Bail can be set or changed by multiple actors in the process. Mahajan’s analysis carefully and deliberately untangles the role of various players in setting cash bail based on indirect signals.","Journalists interviewed community members for input, held office hours in partnership with Cleveland Documenters and ultimately challenged ourselves to reimagine how a vast and complicated set of data could be accessible to residents in a city where a substantial number of people are functionally illiterate. We created a simple form whereby residents could submit questions for the journalists to answer in an approachable and explanatory way that could contribute to community understanding of the system and be used for deeper investigation of its flaws.

In terms of technology, we made extensive use of Python and the Scrapy and Pandas libraries for cleaning and processing the data. To accommodate the scale of both scraping and processing the data, we made extensive use of Docker containers running on Elastic Container Service clusters in parallel. The data is loaded into a GraphQL API powered by Hasura, backed by an Amazon Web Services Aurora database.

We used a Javascript environment for visualization and analysis. Our toolchain includes Arquero for data analysis, D3 and Datawrapper for mapping and charting, a custom graphics rig and integration with our in-house content management system, and Observable notebooks for sharing with collaborators.","Our project’s successes in delivering fundamental information and in applying computational techniques are two important lessons for other journalists.

Other journalists can learn from our approach of combining in-depth data analysis with compelling narrative storytelling. We have presented some of our computational techniques at conferences like NICAR and our [methods posts](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/06/28/ohio-bail-bond-basics).These techniques allow small newsrooms with limited resources to handle massive amounts of computation. While this is an esoteric topic, it’s a space where The Marshall Project is innovating and a leader in the field. 

The on-going audience impact of our explainer strategy and our complementary product answering community questions has helped our organization develop a deeper understanding of local audiences and reach them more effectively. This speaks to the importance of persistence: Effectively reaching justice-affected communities requires evergreen resources alongside ongoing stories.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/tag/cleveland-bail-reform,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/09/11/cuyahoga-county-judges-reform-bail-what-happened,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/10/20/how-we-analyzed-changing-bail-trends-in-cuyahoga-county,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2023/06/28/ohio-bail-bond-basics,,,,"Ilica Mahajan, Rachel Dissell, David Eads, Nicole Lewis","Ilica Mahajan, computational journalist

For the feature, I surveyed thousands of Americans about whether they would watch entertainment (film, TV shows, or books) created by AI. I also explored Americans' (and the entertainment industry's) concerns about deepfakes given that the likeness of some popular actors and figures have already been used in nefarious images and videos. I interviewed screenwriters, directors, a Hollywood agent, and CEOs for the story.","When I worked on my story in early 2023 and published it in April of last year, it was before artificial intelligence was being talked about in Hollywood and entertainment industry. I also published the story ahead of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike, which ended up being timely given that AI was such an important talking point when it came to negotiations. While other trade publications like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter started some reporting about AI around this time, I'm confident my piece was one of the first that featured data and insight in-depth on how Americans feel about the future of AI and how it impacts their entertainment.","Entertainment reporting doesn't get taken as seriously as other area, but I strong believe that artificial intelligence/deepfakes and how it has affected Hollywood and entertainment is a major issue. At the end of my data feature, I explore how legal action hadn't been taken against AI in the U.S. (even though countries like Italy have been a little more aggressive about doing so). Even nearly a year after this piece has been published, we're seeing the effects that AI is having on the industry as proved by the double strikes, and the continued use of public figures' likeness (a recent example of this the George Carlin comedy special which was in the news recently) and it's one of the earlier stories that featured this type of data about the technology.","To develop the survey, I worked closely with the survey research team to craft thoughtful questions to ask respondents. For this, we collaborated on Google Doc to come up with the questions, and the survey was launched on Morning Consult's polling platform.

From there, I worked closely with the data scientist team to analyze the data when it came back. Then, I used Excel to go through the data and results carefully to see what would make a compelling story.

To create the charts, which I made myself, I used Everviz and PowerPoint to visualize the data I wanted to use.","Through this project, journalists can learn to tell intriguing stories with data and survey research about topics in entertainment and culture if they can find the angle and ask the write questions.

Mexico,Mexicanos Contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad,Small,,,Nuestro Dinero,01/01/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Politics, Corruption, Money-laundering, Economy","Animation, Scraping, CSV, R, RStudio","_Nuestro Dinero_ es una plataforma que ofrece a los ciudadanos herramientas para entender, analizar y vigilar el uso de recursos públicos en México, en especial en sus dos facetas más importantes: el gasto del presupuesto, así como los contratos y compras del gobierno. El sitio ofrece instrumentos para que los ciudadanos conozcan y dominen las fuentes de información de primera mano. Al mismo tiempo, trimestralmente publicamos análisis con los últimos datos disponibles, en donde identificamos y denunciamos patrones anómalos, corrupción, violaciones a la ley y otras irregularidades, para que autoridades y ciudadanos puedan aprovechar nuestros hallazgos y propuestas.","Además de más de 25 mil visitas únicas en el último año, la plataforma de Nuestro Dinero se ha convertido en un referente para periodistas, académicos y ciudadanos interesados en el combate a la corrupción, pues cada nueva entrega es replicada ampliamente en medios de comunicación y redes sociales, a la vez que provoca reacciones en las autoridades (así sea solo para responder o atacar los hallazgos). Así hemos podido incidir para recuperar información pérdida, que se detengan procesos riesgosos de contratación o se revierta un ajuste presupuestal indeseado.

Con las herramientas de Nuestro Dinero también hemos dado talleres a otras organizaciones nacionales y estatales, permitiendo que más personas puedan vigilar el uso de recursos públicos y se sumen a nuestra batalla por ser un contrapeso ciudadano al poder. Estamos trabajando para ampliar Nuestro Dinero para integrar análisis de los gobiernos locales.

El proyecto también tiene una vertiente comunicativa muy importante, pues generamos infografías, cómics, videos, pódcasts, TikToks y contenido multimedia para acercar la información a públicos cada vez más amplios, con un alcance de más de 1.3 millones de espectadores.

La plataforma fue premiada por el Instituto Nacional de Transparencia (INAI) en su ""Certamen de Innovación en Transparencia 2023"".","México es el único país del mundo que permite que el Poder Ejecutivo modifique el presupuesto anual aprobado por el Poder Legislativo sin tener que votarlo ni discutirlo con nadie, sin ningún límite. En el último año, 21% de todo el presupuesto cambió de destino (68 billion USD) y fue llevado a donde el presidente decidió unilaterlamente. Igualmente, 8 de cada 10 contratos del gobierno se entregan por adjudicación directa, es decir, sin un proceso de licitación pública abierto ni competido. Este es uno de los problemas que explica la persistencia e incremento de la corrupción en México.

Aún cuando el presidente López Obrador presume el combate a la corrupción como una bandera de su gobierno, en los hechos seguimos detectando igual o más irregularidades en el uso del dinero público, al mismo tiempo que las bases de datos públicas están perdiendo calidad y cada vez más información es reservada para impedir que sea revisada por la ciudadanía, lo que dificulta todavía más nuestra labor. Además, nuestra organización es atacada constantemente por el presidente desde sus conferencias matutinas debido a los múltiples escándalos que hemos documentado, con más de 210 menciones para descalificarnos y acusarnos de ""traidores a la patria"".","La herramienta fundamental para Nuestro DInero consiste en el análisis de grandes bases de datos que hemos construido a partir de diferentes técnicas. Por un lado, hemos descargado, resguardado y procesado las bases de datos del presupuesto y las contrataciones públicas de los últimos 10 años, a la vez que hemos generado nuevas bases a partir de procesos de web scraping en sitios del gobierno, así como creación manual de bases de datos con información específica que logramos obtener mediante solicitudes de información.

Toda esta información es analizada por el equipo mediante diferentes paquetes de R y R Studio que han sido creados por nosotros para identificar cambios, irregularidades y violaciones a la ley, junto con una exploración manual a partir de nuestras ""banderas rojas"", lo que nos permite generar información que utilizamos para escribir nuestros análisis recurrentes y que también ponemos a disposición de la ciudadanía. 

De manera paralela, hemos desarrollado una herramienta digital con tableros interactivos para poder analizar toda la información, aunque debido a nuestras restricciones tecnológicas y de capacidad, actualmente solo la podemos compartir con nuestro equipo de periodistas e investigadores, así como algunas organizaciones aliadas.","En muchas ocasiones puede parecer que los temas presupuestales no le interesan a la ciudadanía porque se perciben como extremadamente complejos o imposibles de realizar. Sin embargo, con este proyecto hemos aprendido que es posible comunicar, explicar y generar interés cuando se explica y se entregan herramientas que acercan la información a las personas de una manera sencilla, clara y contundente. Igualmente, dado que las dinámicas de discrecionalidad en el gasto a nivel federal se replican en los gobiernos de los estados y los municipios, es posible replicar nuestros análisis en el orden local, lo que nos permitiría tener una mejor vigilancia del gasto público en todo el gobierno.

Hablar con precisión monetaria de las irregularidades o de los actos de corrupción permite mejorar la discusión pública y generar mayor preocupación entre la ciudadanía, a la vez que eleva los costos de las autoridades de ignorar las revelaciones sobre el mal uso del dinero público.",Español,https://contralacorrupcion.mx/nuestro-dinero/,https://www.tiktok.com/@mxvscorrupcion/video/7258287040109006086?lang=es,,,,,,"Dirección: Leonardo Núñez González

Após decisão judicial determinar que a empresa financiasse um diagnóstico independente, servindo como referência para ações de mitigação de danos, as consultorias Diagonal e Tetra Tech foram contratadas para conduzir o estudo. Mas tanto a população afetada quanto pesquisadores apontam fragilidades metodológicas e condescendência em relação à petroquímica.","A reportagem teve cerca de 7.500 visualizações em nosso site, no entanto o impacto real foi muito maior.

Após a publicação da reportagem, moradores e pesquisadores pediram anulação dos diagnósticos, questionando a transparência e a independência das consultorias, inclusive em audiência pública no Senado Federal. 

O Ministério Público Federal prometeu investigar as ligações (https://www.mpf.mp.br/al/sala-de-imprensa/noticias-al/encontro-virtual-com-mpf-mpal-e-municipio-de-maceio-discute-ajustes-no-diagnostico-tecnico-participativo-apos-escutas-publicas), enquanto a Braskem seguiu negando possuir qualquer relação com as empresas, embora a conexão esteja muito bem documentada.","Maceió, a capital de Alagoas, enfrenta sérios problemas socioambientais devido ao afundamento do solo em vários bairros, resultando em uma parte significativa da cidade se tornando desabitada. Isso levou ao deslocamento de dezenas de milhares de moradores, congestionamento no tráfego central, e o fechamento de muitos pequenos negócios, aumentando o desemprego, o déficit habitacional e os preços de imóveis e aluguéis.

Em maio de 2019, o Serviço Geológico do Brasil (CPRM) confirmou que a extração de sal-gema pela Braskem desde 1976 causou instabilidade no solo, resultando em tremores de terra, além de rachaduras em centenas de casas e edifícios. Tornando uma parte importante de Maceió em território fantasma. As minas de extração estão sendo fechadas, e medidas de mitigação estão sendo exigidas pelo poder público.

Entretanto, os problemas causados pelo fechamento dos bairros e o risco de afundamento persistem, com repercussões globais após o colapso de uma das minas. Documentos revelaram negligência da empresa na segurança das operações, levando à abertura de uma CPI no Senado Federal para investigar o caso.","A principal ferramenta utilizada para a apuração foi o CruzaGrafos, que é uma ferramenta gráfica de visualização de dados que permite a análise e investigação cruzada de diversas informações de interesse público. Ela permite ver relações entre empresas, sócios, administradores e políticos no formato de grafos, tornando a investigação jornalística desses atores mais rápida e eficiente.

Quando uma pesquisadora nos falou das desconfianças em relação à independência das empresas e que acreditava existir ligações anteriores entre elas e a Braskem, eu soube que poderia tentar confirmar a história com a ajuda do CruzaGrafos. 

Na ferramenta foi suficiente colocar o CNPJ (código único) das empresas e pedir para buscar o menor caminho entre elas. A ferramenta traçou as ligações societárias e a partir daí comecei a pesquisar outras fontes documentais e ouvir todos os lados envolvidos, o que confirmou a história.","A plataforma CruzaGrafos foi desenvolvida pelo Brasil.io com a idealização e coordenação da Associação Brasileira de Jornalismo Investigativo (Abraji).

Acredito que é importante que mais jornalistas descubram ferramentas como o CruzaGrafos, que permitem análises de dados avançadas sem exigir uma grande especialização técnica. 

Penso que, embora o conhecimento de linguagens de programação possa abrir um novo leque para investigações jornalísticas importantes, muitas vezes o trabalho pode ser facilitado por ferramentas que auxiliam as apurações e que ainda são pouco conhecidas ou parecem muito distantes para a maioria dos jornalistas.

The investigation (Edited in Arabic) reveals that Morocco has lost approximately one million and 406 thousand hectares of its forests between 2016 and 2022. In contrast, the National Agency for Water and Forests, a government agency, claims that the degradation of forest-cover is estimated at only 17 thousand hectares annually!
The investigation questions the government about the management of fire prevention programs, and doubts the credibility of forest management statements exposing the encroachment of cement towards the burned forests.","1- The Moroccan government has been exposed parliamentary scrutiny regarding the findings of the investigation, especially concerning the loss of approximately one million and 406 thousand hectares of forests between 2016 and 2022. The National Agency for Water and Forests claims that the deterioration of forest cover is only estimated at 17 thousand hectares annually. The alarming level of forest degradation in Morocco prompted a parliamentary inquiry directed at the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development who is expected to respond in the coming days.
2- The National Agency for Water and Forests, has halted the daily update of the dynamic map that has been monitoring the kingdom's forest fires for over 11 years. This map was among the data sources used to support the investigation's hypothesis. However, immediately after submitting a request for clarifications regarding the data analysis results, the updating of fire data, ceased since July 20, 2023.
3- The Royal Academy of Arts in The Hague (KABK) chose the investigative on forest fires and transformed it into a visual narrative (artistic presentation) in collaboration with the (ARIJ) network. The innovative presentation of the investigation was showcased at the ARIJ conference in Amman and also at (COP29).","* The investigation comes following the exceptional fires that occurred in Moroccan forests in the summer of 2022, which were accompanied by allegations of negligence in implementing fire safety measures, and protests by environmental activists that alerted to converting forests into investment projects.
* What fueled these fears was that 95% of forest fires were of unknown origin, which prevented the number of fires from being reduced and those responsible punished, and instead encouraged the burning of forests and subsequent land grabbing.
* The context is also related to the fact that all of these factors have led to a decline in vegetation cover and a record rise in carbon emissions, which poses a threat to the lives of the population.
* Unfortunately, the Forest Department does not disclose details of forest fires in Morocco, which hinders the analysis of relevant data, and requests for this information have been submitted without response.
 * To prove the hypothesis of the investigation, it was first necessary to obtain data for analysis, and this was done through two databases, one of which was manually compiled for three months from a dynamic map of the Forest Department, and the second database was obtained from the Statistics Department.","- Manual data compilation from a dynamic map of forest management.
- Data extraction using the Tabula program, accessed through the portal of the government statistical agency.
- Data cleaning in an Excel file.
- Identification of problem, impact, cause, and solution questions.
- Data analysis using a set of tools, especially pivot tables in Microsoft Excel.
- Visual representation of data using the Flourish program.
- Additionally, utilization of satellite imagery to address certain questions, aiming to substantiate the encroachment of cement towards the burned forests.","* There are many and indeed numerous ideas for stories that can be explored using data, including open-source data. 
* Many of these stories have the potential to become data-driven investigative projects.
* Journalistic stories can be found within datasets, and data analysis allows for proving or disproving a hypothesis uncovering something new that can be presented in a compelling news story for readers.

But what isn’t always apparent is what help is available to the city’s nearly 900,000 public school students — and how outcomes can vary depending on the resources schools provide.


We tracked dozens of data points on mental health support in NYC public schools. Do they call 911 on students in crisis? Are there enough social workers and guidance counselors? Readers can enter their school name below to find out.","THE CITY teamed up with the nonprofit education news project Chalkbeat to create an interactive news application that allows parents to compare schools’ arrest statistics. Our lookup tool, which continues to be updated, collected data on over 1,500 public schools, from the number of guidance counselors and social workers to demographic data and educational outcomes. We also published a guide with Chalkbeat that walked parents through how they can advocate for more resources.

The release of the app was followed by a panel discussion at the Brooklyn Public Library, featuring parents, parent advocates and students who discussed their experiences accessing mental health resources for children and the challenges they face.","In the course of reporting a prior article about inadequate mental health services for public school students who are mandated to receive them under federal law, Abigail heard anecdotes about children’s untreated mental illness leading to 911 calls and police showing up to remove children to hospital emergency rooms via ambulance. She also learned that this was happening despite the legal settlement that was supposed to end the practice in all but the highest-risk cases.

She sought data to show the prevalence of in-school arrests of children in emotional crisis. Relying on statistics the NYPD is required to release under a little-noticed city law, Abigail obtained reports showing that each year hundreds of children, as young as 5 years old, are put into handcuffs after a teacher or school administrator calls 911, often in response to incidents that did not pose risk of serious injury.","To help families better understand schools’ mental health staffing and support when choosing a school, as well as the frequency with which each school’s staff called 911 in response to children in crisis, we created an interactive guide: “How Well Does Your Child's School Support Student Mental Health?” The data also formed a foundation of reporting for the article, including a chart showing the disproportionate number of arrests involving Black children.","Covering child mental health can be challenging given tight privacy restrictions under federal medical and educational laws, and this project highlights a way to use data about 911 calls in response to mental health crisis to provide a window into the prevalence of incidents and extent to which school rely on police and EMTs to remove children from school premises.",English,https://projects.thecity.nyc/school-mental-health/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/05/04/mental-health-help-nyc-public-schools/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/05/23/mental-health-nyc-public-schools/,https://www.thecity.nyc/2023/05/23/success-academy-911-mental-health/,,,,"Sam Rabiyah, Suhail Bhat, Scott Klein, Amy Zimmer","* Sam is a journalist and multidisciplinary technologist based in NYC.

Satellite Imagery","Despite international sanctions imposed against Russia since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, in mid-2023 President Putin launched the first part of a massive new Liquefied Natural Gas project in the far north of Siberia – built using expertise, technology and finance from Europe, Asia and the US. 

This data-driven investigation revealed how two European companies, Technip S.A. of France and Linde PLC, founded in Germany but headquartered in Ireland, played an integral role in Arctic LNG 2 from the start – and delivered materials right until, or even after, EU sanctions came into force.","After publication, Technip’s share price plummeted 22%, wiping hundreds of millions of Euros from the company’s value. In the following weeks, the US State Department announced new sanctions targeting Arctic LNG 2. These were followed with US sanctions against Russian companies linked to Linde. The international investors in Arctic LNG 2 then reportedly suspended their involvement, and Samsung stopped building ships for the project, putting the future of the entire facility in doubt. Construction is not yet complete on two thirds of Arctic LNG 2. The investigation may therefore have mitigated environmental damage in the region and prevented hundreds of millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions. 

Ukrainian civil society organizations and the Ukrainian government’s anti-corruption agency welcomed the investigation, publicly called for new EU sanctions to target Russia’s lucrative energy sector and the companies involved in its expansion, and raised the investigation in their conversations with diplomats. 

The UK government created a new agency to crack down on companies skirting Russian sanctions. This appears partly linked to previous investigations by the team into UK-based companies supplying key components to Arctic LNG 2.","The investigation represents the culmination of months of work to establish editorial interest in Arctic LNG 2, engage a range of experts as sources, and build connections with the campaigning organizations that have kept the issue on the agenda.","The investigation took advantage of commercially available customs data to identify shipments of critical components to the construction site for the project. 
These were validated using satellite imagery and others OS-INT techniques, including analysis of social media posts, to build a complete story of shipments of critical pieces of hardware to Arctic LNG 2, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine.

The data analysis was provided to teams of investigative journalists in Germany and France who did extraordinary work to create in-depth investigations into all apsects of the companies' involvement in Arctic LNG 2.","Customs records provide an important basis for investigations into fossil fuels, supply chains, and potential sanctions evasion, but forensic analysis is needed using a range of data sources – including satellite imagery, social media posts, company records and expert source interviews – to verify and contextualize that information. 

While the legal standards for corporate malfeasance are high, the impact of this investigative project reveals a clear public interest in exposing actions that may fall short of criminal behavior or intent. A data-driven investigation into corporate behavior can have enormous impact by revealing attitudes to risk that investors, regulators and officials may find troubling. 

Dialogue with policy experts, campaigners and researchers is invaluable for honing the focus of an investigation and preparing the ground for impact. Networks involving civil society organizations and journalists can play a huge role in ensuring an investigation ‘lands’.

Impact is cumulative. High-impact blockbuster investigations are often not the first piece to emerge from research. Articles about other companies involved in Arctic LNG 2 published earlier in 2023 helped build editorial interest and put the project on the radar of public and private sector stakeholders.","French, German, English",https://archive.md/VDYX9,https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/arctic-lng-2-wie-westliche-konzerne-ein-russisches-prestigeprojekt-ermoeglichten-a-75f86074-b87e-4ae4-be64-0e443591c2a4?giftToken=92576903-ea32-4a72-a004-da2af5e66028,https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/20/russia-lng-gas-sanctions-west-europe-united-states/,https://blog.datadesk.eco/p/arctic-lng-2-investigations,,,,"Sam Leon, Louis Goddard, Sophia Baumann, Claus Hecking, Hans Koberstein, Nathan Niedermeier, Jérémie Baruch, Adrien Sénécat, Arthur Carpentier, Solène Reveney","The project was initiated by Data Desk, an investigative consultancy specialized in tracking the commodities at the heart of the climate crisis.

It reveals offshore deals and avoiding sanctions. Ternavskiy thrived in oil dealings, especially thanks to the trade with the state-owned Belarusian Oil Company, making over $2 billion with Medesoil Trading Limited. His Belarusian companies built a school for Lukashenko's mistress and catered to officials. Swiss citizen Stephan Brunner played a role, managing Ternavskiy's assets. The findings expose Ternavskiy's financial strategies and raise concerns about enforcing sanctions. The use of offshore structures prompts a call for better regulations to prevent abuse and evasion.","The impact of ""Silent Money"" investigation has reverberated across multiple platforms, sparking significant reactions and responses. Notably, the human rights organization Respect-Protect-Fulfill seized upon our findings, prompting them to petition both the US State Department and the US Treasury Department to include Ternavskiy on the sanctions list. This marks a critical step toward holding accountable those implicated in the investigation.
The platforms of Belarusian Investigative Center played a pivotal role in amplifying the story. Across platforms, the audience engagement has been profound: 335 thousand.
Our story was republished in reputable media outlets. Notable publications on OCCRP, Belsat, Radio Svaboda/Radio Free/Radio Liberty, The Insider, Ukrainian Vedomosti, Nasha Niva, Current Time and others have collectively reached thousands of additional viewers and readers.
We counted at least 30 republications. The investigative report has become a focal point of discussions on Twitter, Telegram, and other social media channels.
The diverse range of republications, including articles, podcasts, and videos, demonstrates the multi-faceted impact of our investigation. This widespread coverage shows the investigation's resonance and its crucial role in highlighting financial malpractices within political circles in Belarus, where the government is continuing the repressions and support of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.","Our investigation faced challenges due to limited resources and restrictions in Belarus. We couldn't conduct the interviews there, focusing instead on offshore dealings. The businessman cleverly hid assets in various places using proxies and family members, so we put a lot of efforts prooving that he is befind the assets.

Sources in Belarus were afraid to cooperate because our organization is labeled extremist by belarusian government. This fear hampers our ability to gather information and expose the truth.

The political situation in Belarus is tough, with a dictatorship and repression against civil society. This posed risks to the safety of our authors and editors. The project had to navigate these complexities to shed light on the hidden financial dealings, showcasing the importance of investigative journalism in the face of adversity. The struggle for resources, safety concerns, and the need for innovative approaches to protect sources all add layers to the story behind the investigation.","The investigation harnessed a combination of tools, techniques, and technologies to uncover and analyze information effectively. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) databases played a pivotal role in accessing global data sets related to offshore dealings and financial transactions, providing a comprehensive foundation for the investigation.

Data analysis tools were employed to scrutinize the acquired financial documents, allowing the team to identify patterns. We used Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. We analysed connections between companies and people and created infographics using Maltego. Financial document analysis, a key component, involved exploring contracts, transactions, and offshore structures to reveal the hidden truth of the subject's financial activities.

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques were crucial in gathering information beyond traditional sources. The team conducted extensive social media searches to track the subject's online presence, connections, and public activities, enriching the investigative process with additional context.

Facial recognition technology was likely employed to verify identities and connections, ensuring accuracy in linking individuals to financial dealings and activities.","Fellow journalists can take important lessons from this project. For example, how crucial rigorous document analysis is.
We are very creative in gathering information when the access to it in Belarus is limited. What would we do without advanced OSINT techniques.
Protecting sources is crucial. Because their organization was labeled extremist, sources were scared. Building trust and ensuring source safety are vital for successful investigative work.

On the morning of publication, Amol Rajan, the BBC Radio 4 presenter, singled out the article for praise on the Today Programme. The leader article was re-posted on X / Twitter 2m times (see: https://x.com/TheEconomist/status/1646406769910898692?s=20); posted and re-posted by plenty of other journalists (ie, Robert Peston: https://x.com/Peston/status/1634309447202795520); along with numerous health experts, too.","A strong body of literature had highlighted the slowdown in life expectancy in the 2010s before the covid-19 pandemic. Huge attention had been paid to the grim death toll wrought during it, and the excess deaths which continued after it. We were the first to bring all these things together, and with the latest available statistics, using provisional data to calculate life expectancy for 2022. Extrapolating from long-run trends, we worked out that if progress had continued at the rate it did between 1980 and 2011, the resulting increase in life expectancy would have amounted to 700,000 fewer deaths. Even accounting for an international slowdown in life expectancy, and deaths caused by the pandemic, that still left a quarter of a million deaths unexplained.

The data was beautifully illustrated by our special projects team; who designed a scrolly-telling line chart to make accessible to lay readers what is often an impentrably technical subject.","Quant tools; R; R Studio; Open access to life expectancy and health data from ONS and devolved nations health agencies; OECD data; and other academic databases (for comparisons to international life-expectancy).

This was story was a good exemplar of those two aphorisms. Through timely measurement -- there is a long lag in life-expectancy data published by the ONS and other health agencies -- alongside some fantastic visuals from our interactives team and tenacious reporting from Georgia, we told a story to a new audience in a very different way.

We utilized data from around 15,000 headlines in Russian and Hungarian media extracted from the GDELT Global Graph database since January 1, 2021. We selected a number of state-affiliated media in Hungary and Russia and searched for specific keywords in Hungarian and Russian language datasets. 

Quantitative research methods included Topic Clusterization, Analysis of KeyWord Mentions, and Word Clouds. Topic Clusterization utilized the BERTopic library, leveraging transformers and c-TF-IDF to define topics surrounding narratives in propaganda media outlets. Analysis of Key Words involved processing the dataset using Tableau Public, presenting weekly bar chart visualization with parameter filtering for content search. Qualitative analysis involved studying the context of publications to identify the narratives used by propaganda to shape positive and negative images of politicians and political processes.

To validate the results obtained through quantitative methods, we conducted a comparative analysis, juxtaposing the findings from the keyword mention analysis with clustering data. This approach allowed for a more robust understanding of patterns within the dataset. The methodology employed underwent scrutiny from experts as part of the evaluation process within the previous Editwars.org project.","This cross-border and cross-newsroom collaboration highlighted that even if there is seemingly a little overlap in audiences' interest, especially in the realm of media analysis, thinking outside the box and looking for points of contact can result in impactful reporting.

United States of America,The Philadelphia Inquirer,Big,,,Philadelphia's Primary Voting Clusters,21/02/2023,"Explainer, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","We knew Philadelphia’s crowded 2023 mayoral primary would be defined by fissures among the city's Democrats, so we decided to quantify and map them.

To define these ""voting blocs,"" we clustered all the city's 1703 precincts into one of six groups, according to past voting history in Democratic primaries.

We found that like much else in Philadelphia, preferences even among Democrats are strikingly divided by class and ethnicity. We also discovered an electoral divide within similar-seeming Black neighborhoods.

Three stories resulted:
- An explainer
- A description of each cluster's voting power
- A post-mortem showing how the clusters mapped to electoral results","A key part of good political journalism is explaining how elections work and how the electorate moves in predictable or unpredictable ways. This series set the stage for analysis on key themes that we continue to explore, namely which constituencies wield political power and how politicians pitch themselves to different audiences in America's sixth-largest city.

In explanatory terms, the primary results vindicated the soundness of the clusters. Of the six clusters we identified, three were majority-white, two majority-Black, and one plurality-Hispanic. We found we could neatly describe the winning candidate's coalition by showing how she united the three majority-minority clusters. Meanwhile, each of the majority-white clusters voted for different candidates, splitting along sometimes-subtle but still quantifiable socioeconomic lines.

It was clear the story resonated. It ranked among the top 5% of the Inquirer's stories in local readership for 2023, and among the top 1% for driving new subscriptions.

A class of Philadelphia politicos was particularly appreciative. More than one campaign operative told us that our schema was insightful, quantified some hunches they had long had about the geographic dimensions of voter behavior, and served as an appropriate template for understanding the factionalism within Democratic politics in the city.","Performing this analysis was complex, both analytically and in terms of methodology. We began by collating eight years of citywide primary election data, which had to be statistically harmonized across shifting precinct boundaries over that time. Then, we consulted with multiple political scientists and operatives to refine our methodology. (A major debate was whether to weight the observations by turnout, or otherwise incorporate turnout as a factor. We decided that in measuring expressed preferences, turnout was not worth taking into account). Finally, we incorporated and analyzed Census data to infer the demographic makeups of the clusters.

We also went beyond the data to learn the political history of certain neighborhoods. We talked to community leaders and political activists within some of the voting blocs to ensure we gave proper context for why certain clusters have more voting power than others, and the historical trajectory of each coalition's relative power.","Broadly, this analysis comprised the following:
- Collating past election results, deciding which elections to base our analysis on, and calculating the shares won by each candidate in each election, normalizing results in multi-candidate elections
- Geographic harmonization of results to account for shifting administrative boundaries
- Iteratively building the clusters using a k-means algorithm, visualizing the results as we went along
- Overlaying demographic data from the US Census on the clusters for descriptive purposes.

We performed everything in Python, with the exception of the cluster visualization, which we completed in QGIS.

Other than the reporting we undertook to refine our methodology, the meat of the work involved handling non-congruent geographic boundaries. First, precinct boundaries changed from election to election. In addition, most demographic data was available only at the Census Tract level, and had to be extrapolated to the (much more granular) precinct.

To ""crosswalk"" both old precinct boundaries and tracts to present boundaries, we used a technique known as population weighting: we broke down precincts to their constituent census blocks, determined the overlap of blocks across precinct or tract boundaries, and weighted the precinct-level election results or demographics based on the share of population contributed by old precinct boundaries or tracts.","Broadly, we're hopeful that journalists, and particularly political journalists, can depend more on social scientific techniques like the ones we drew on to help explain the electorate and its preferences. Particularly below the national level, American political journalism still relies on heuristics and broad assumptions to characterize voters.

Our analysis probably represents the kind of ""low-hanging fruit"" available to data-driven journalists who apply techniques broadly used in national-level political analysis at the local level. We look forward to learning more about other communities' political demography through the use of similar techniques.

After all, local elections, primaries, non-partisan contests, and many other races are often not best understood as contests for partisan power, and we think journalists' understanding of voters and their communities improves when they're not viewed through a partisan lens.",English,https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/inq2/philadelphia-democrats-race-class-voting-data-20230221.html,https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/philadelphia-democratic-primary-2023-voting-groups-polls-20230403.html,https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/inq2/black-latino-poor-voters-supported-cherelle-parker-democratic-primary-20230522.html,,,,,"Aseem Shukla (data reporter)

United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,,,Generative AI exists because of the transformer: this is how it works,12/09/2023,"Explainer, Long-form, Infographics","Animation, D3.js, Canvas, Python","Generative AI exists because of the transformer. But how does it actually work? 

In a stepped-through visual explainer we answered this question, using visual metaphors, interactive graphics and interviews with experts to unpick a topic that could transform our lives in ways not seen since the mass adoption of the internet. 

Creating a story that was informative for the layperson and scientifically sound was a major challenge, and the project involved discussions with numerous researchers — including the team behind _Attention Is All You Need_, the paper that kick-started the generative AI era.","The impact has been widespread and ongoing. It was one of the best read stories on the entirety of FT.com in 2023 and subscribers loved it, with the comments from readers almost unanimously positive. One of the most liked comments said “Amazing job guys. I do this for a living and love how you’ve conveyed LLMs so concisely and effectively”.

Beyond the FT, almost 20 per cent of our page views came from social media. This is almost seven times higher than the social visits to a typical FT story. This reflects the way the story has been shared organically — and struck a chord with those attempting to understand one of the most significant technological breakthroughs of our time.

The CEO of Shopify, Tobi Lutke, shared a link to his 300,000+ followers saying “This is incredible work by the @FT. Visual storytelling is what the open web is unbeatable at”.

Jakob Uszkoreit, one of the authors of the original transformers paper, described the project as “by far the best explanation for non-practitioners I've seen”.","The concepts underpinning generative AI have been visualised in research and media organisations, but we wanted to combine the two in a way we hadn’t seen before. 

This involved reading countless papers and interviewing dozens of practitioners to boil the topic down to the core concepts readers really needed to understand.

A lot of the academic research on this subject features visualisations from the original paper or other papers that have been produced since. Typically these are static, dry and difficult to follow. We wanted to use visuals to bring the subject to life and explain these concepts in a clear and succinct manner.

We also took the time to generate our own word embeddings that we could use as examples throughout the piece. We did this for two reasons: firstly, getting our hands dirty and playing with the model ourselves gave us a far better understanding of how LLMs work. Secondly, we wanted to make the examples as accurate as possible, so the story would work for both the expert and the layperson.","Before building or designing the page, we storyboarded a lot of ideas using Figma, a collaborative design tool. This allowed us to share thoughts across the team and to present our ideas to AI experts in a visual way.

The page was built using React, a popular front end framework. We utilised the JavaScript library D3 as well as CSS transitions to get the look and feel we wanted from the page, and to take readers through the concepts step-by-step.

To generate the word embeddings, we used the GloVe 6B 50D pre-trained model and converted these to Word2Vec format. To generate the 2D representation of word embeddings we used the BERT large language model and reduced dimensionality using UMAP. The self-attention values and the probability scores in the beam search section are conceptual.

Finally, we used the free version of ChatGPT-3.5 to generate some of the example sentences used in the visual part of the word embedding and self attention section.","The power of visuals, particularly for breaking down complex or abstract topics that transcend the daily newscycle.

Each unmarked grave represents a person who lost their life en route to Europe, and a fate that will remain forever unknown to their loved ones. This nine-months-long investigation shows, in immense detail, how Europe’s migration policies have failed more than a thousand people who have died in transit and the families who survive them.","The findings of the Border Graves Investigation team were published in text, video, radio, and podcast form in Spain, Italy, Greece, Poland, Lithuania, Germany, and Croatia in many languages (English, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Lithuanian, German, Croatian/Bosnian/Serbian). 

In Lithuania, it sparked conversation among the Lithuanian parliament, referred to as “that unfortunate article about the border.” 

The publication in the Guardian reached 500,000 views in the first week, and was cited in a later op-ed by the Guardian about the need to uphold migrant rights as the UK debates its domestic policies regarding an increase of migrants arriving via the English channel. 

Our team has subsequently been invited to share our findings on radio interviews in Canada, Italy, and Croatia. 

Our data finding of 1000 unmarked graves was re-reported by Reuters, after which many regional news also continued to report on the finding, including countries we hadn’t originally published in such as Bulgaria, and pushed the conversation into new countries and contexts in the region. 

Starting from a complete absence of regional data on unmarked graves of migrants in the EU, we have established an iron-clad figure showing the indisputable violation of the rights of migrants and their families.","In 2021, the European Parliament passed a resolution recognising the need for a “coordinated European approach” for “prompt and effective identification processes” for bodies found on EU borders. Yet in 2022, the Council of Europe called this area a “legislative void.”

Despite this resolution, there is no government, on the EU or national level, that systematically collects data on the deaths of migrants who lose their lives en route to Europe. Lithuanian Parliament member Tomas Tomilinas tells us point blank that it is not in governments’ interests to maintain such data, especially when governments like Lithuania and Poland have recently legalized pushbacks. While organizations such as the IOM and UNHCR collect data on deaths, they don’t have data on how many were buried, with or without identification, on European soil. 

In short: nobody is counting how many unmarked graves of migrants have popped up all along Europe’s borders: in olive groves, on hilltops, in dense forests, and along remote highways.

We operated from a complete void of information. Yet we have collected and aggregated EU-wide data on this issue for the first time, with a strict methodology and rigorous fact checking, to reach the minimum number of 1,015 unmarked graves.","Collecting and fact checking data in this fragmented landscape was a gargantuan challenge.

Our team of eight local journalists traveled on-the-ground to cemeteries in eight countries, at times counting rows of unmarked graves ourselves.

Because it is impossible to visit all the sites, as they are remote and scattered, each country created its own strategy for collecting data given varying administrative systems and contexts.

For example, in Croatia we emailed and telephoned every funeral home company contracted by municipalities to conduct burials. These figures were fact checked with academic researchers at ERIM.

In Spain, we sent hundreds of emails to every municipality on the border where deaths have been registered in NGO databases, and interviewed city councilors in the Canary Islands where deaths are now surging.

In Poland, local NGOs shared with us many geo-tagged photo evidence of graves, and we fact checked these locations.

In Greece, the coroner in Sidiro, one of the largest migrant graveyards in Europe, personally sat down with us to go through his burial records over the last ten years. 

Once we had compiled our final dataset, we shared and comapred these numbers in hours of video conferences with the ICRC Forensics Team.","Our project exemplifies the value of cross-border collaborative investigations, as this project would have been impossible without a local journalist in each country – someone who understands who in a system will or won’t be willing to share data. Many unmarked grave sites we visited have never been reported on, and even more have never been reported in English.

And of course it was important to be on the ground, because we personally visited over half of the graves in our dataset to count them, and sat down with coroners and gravekeepers to go through their records – sometimes a handwritten book in a back cabinet of a cemetery office, data that has never even been digitized.

It can be powerful to work together on a European scale, because the problem is a European problem, created by European policies. If governments can collaborate to coordinate a “Fortress Europe” toward migrants, journalists must coordinate on the same regional level. We show that these scattered graves are part of a larger pattern of vast and thorough institutional indifference, and we hold European institutions accountable to their own voted resolutions.","English, Spanish, Italian, Greek, Croatian, German, Lithuanian",https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2023/dec/08/revealed-more-than-1000-unmarked-graves-discovered-along-eu-migration-routes,https://unbiasthenews.org/border-graves-investigation/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuozAj9Gvu0&amp;t=13s&amp;ab_channel=UnbiasTheNews,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlDtBRg02aU&amp;ab_channel=UnbiasTheNews,,,,"The project was initiated by eight journalists, the majority of whom are independent freelancers: Tina Xu (coordinator, Germany), Danai Maragoudaki (Solomon, Greece), Daphne Tolis (Greece), Gabriele Cruciata (Italy), Leah Pattem (Spain), Eoghan Gilmartin (Spain), Barbara Matejčić (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia), and Gabriela Ramirez (Unbias the News, Poland, Lithuania). We came together for the project through funding by IJ4EU and JournalismFund.

In the final four months of the project, we teamed up with the investigation team at Süddeutsche Zeitung, working with Kristiana Ludwig and Ben Heubl, and The Guardian, working with deputy investigations editor Rachel Oldroyd, and journalists Felicity Lawrence, Ashifa Kassam, Lorenzo Tondo, Manisha Ganguly, and Pamela Duncan.","The idea to examine the EU migration crisis via the tragedy of unmarked graves began in 2017, when coordinator Tina Xu watched a young man cry before a mound of dirt in the makeshift graveyard of Lesvos, surrounded by nothing but the wind through olive trees and cicadas humming.

They are now more likely than other demographic groups in Virginia and nationwide to die by suicide. Our story was the first to reveal this trend. The article put a human face to the issue, focusing on a Black teenager who had tried to kill himself with a gun. Experts say adolescent males turn to self-harm because society often discourages them from expressing their emotions.","We don't know of any additional reporting that came from our work, but some of our sources did see impact from this story: 

* The family at the center of the story [received additional donations](https://www.gofundme.com/f/z7hux5-the-road-to-recovery) to support their child's recovery from an attempted suicide.

* A community organizer was able to add additional community mental health events in response to increased interest.","Whenever journalists pursue a story about suicide, they must strike a delicate balance between telling a story that humanizes the issue while maintaining respect for the people involved and not inspiring copycat self-harm. That requires sensitive, empathetic reporting and careful and thoughtful writing. In practice, that means:
* Framing a story about suicide to look forward rather than recounting the actual event.

* Focusing on suicide prevention by seeking out voices to contextualize the issue.

Reporting this story presented some data challenges. Our mission was to localize the findings of a [report on youth suicide](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db471.htm) by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That report was based on millions of records from the CDC’s [WONDER database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) (Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) and a strict definition of suicide (specific codes from the International Classification of Diseases). To replicate the numbers for Virginia, we had to be careful to follow the study’s exact methodology. To ensure accuracy, we shared our findings before publication with the Virginia medical examiner. She confirmed that our numbers were valid.","We ran more than 100 queries of the [WONDER database](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) using various years, geographies and other variables. After replicating the nationwide numbers cited in the study by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics, we then pulled the corresponding data for Virginia – with a focus on residents age 10-24 (broken out by gender and race). We pasted the query results into a [Google Sheet](https://bit.ly/virginia-suicide-trends) and calculated the change in suicide rates over time for different demographic groups. This comparison showed that Black youths had the biggest increase in suicide rates in Virginia. We then created data visualizations in Datawrapper. 

Finding a human source was, again, old-fashioned journalism in the form of combing past reporting in our state and reaching out to advocacy and recovery organizations. Ultimately, we found a source through an [online fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/f/z7hux5-the-road-to-recovery) and used that platform to establish contact with our source.","Our report underscored the importance of monitoring academic journals and scientific reports with an eye toward findings that can be customized for your publication’s audience. In this case, the report was a data brief titled [“Suicide and Homicide Death Rates Among Youth and Young Adults Aged 10-24: United States, 2001-2021”](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db471.htm). Look especially for studies based on open datasets. If possible, explore such data in advance. The WONDER database can be complex and confusing. For example, the CDC suppresses statistics when a query’s results are based on fewer than 10 deaths. 

Outside of data, this story was a good reminder and exercise in using sensitive stories to anchor data and solutions journalism. It also forced our newsroom to practice simple but effective presentation decisions, like including a content warning before the digital and audio version of the story.",English,https://whro.org/news/local-news/42400-suicide-rates-for-young-black-boys-and-men-in-virginia-is-the-highest-it-s-been-in-at-least-a-decade,https://www.datawrapper.de/_/Oc7pn/,https://bit.ly/virginia-suicide-trends,https://bit.ly/suicide-rates-by-state,,,,"Mechelle Hankerson, Jeff South","**Mechelle Hankerson** is the news director at WHRO Public Media, an NPR member station in Hampton Roads, Virginia.

United Kingdom,Carbon Brief,Small,,,Revealed: How colonial rule radically shifts historical responsibility for climate change,26/11/2023,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Environment","Animation, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Svelte","This groundbreaking analysis revealed, for the first time, how colonial rule shifts historical responsibility for climate change.

It sheds new light on the complex but vital question of who is responsible for global warming, which lies at the heart of climate justice.

For example, taking colonial rule into account, the UK’s share of historical emissions nearly doubles and that of the Netherlands nearly triples.

The analysis is based on two large datasets, combined in a novel way, and brought to life through unique dataviz and compelling storytelling.

It received global media coverage and is already being used for academic research.","Our analysis was covered internationally in several national exclusives – on the print frontpage of [NRC](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2023/11/26/co2-uitstoot-in-voormalige-kolonien-maakt-van-nederland-een-van-de-grootste-mondiale-klimaatvervuilers-a4182337) in the Netherlands and in print editions of the [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/26/british-empire-past-emissions-double-uk-climate-responsibility-data-shows) in the UK and the [Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/accounting-for-colonial-rule-reduces-india-s-climate-role-by-15-101701059104857.html) in India.

Nature’s [Anthropocene newsletter](https://www.nature.com/briefing/anthropocene) featured our analysis as its infographic of the week.

Our analysis triggered strong pushback from climate-sceptic columnists at right-leaning UK publications including Richard Littlejohn in the [Daily Mail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12797373/RICHARD-LITTLEJOHN-Working-home-Money-gas-bills-FREE.html), Ross Clark in the [Spectator](https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/climate-reparations-are-an-awful-idea/) and Michael Deacon in the [Daily Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/11/28/queen-camilla-wokery-gender-veganism-omid-scobie-endgame/).

Author Simon Evans was interviewed about the analysis on [BBC World Service](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct4sd9), [Himal Southasian](https://www.himalmag.com/cop28-dubai-climate-change-net-zero-simon-evans/) and Canadian Indigenous current affairs podcast [Media Indigena](https://pod.link/1092220986).

The analysis was selected among the “best environmental journalism of 2023” by [Greenpeace’s Unearthed](https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2023/12/26/best-of-climate-journalism-2023/), which said it “ma[de] the idea of climate justice and the question of who bears responsibility for the current crisis more tangible”. [Covering Climate Now]https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/675136109/what-cop28-means-for-climate-coverage) listed it among “our favourite work on climate change” in 2023.

It has also been shared widely on social media, including by Greta Thunberg.","This project has been two years in the making, building on analysis of historical responsibility for climate change published by [Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/) in 2021.

This previous work showed some large former colonies – notably India and Indonesia – had very significant historical emissions, implying greater responsibility for climate change than their former colonial rulers the UK and the Netherlands. Was this fair, given these former colonies lacked ultimate decision-making power for significant periods of time? Perhaps not – but the means to investigate was lacking.

Starting in late 2021, Carbon Brief began the process of finding suitably robust, comprehensive and independent data, before checking, cleaning, extending and combining it with existing figures on historical emissions within present-day borders.

Only with this novel combination of two large datasets did it become possible to investigate the impact of colonial rule on historical responsibility for warming. Carbon Brief’s team then set about bringing these numbers to life by combining eye-catching, unique and scientifically-credible dataviz with storytelling informed by extensive interviews and hours of research.

Crucially, in line with Carbon Brief’s editorial values, the project attempted to explore the thought-provoking implications of the analysis, without imposing any preconceived judgements on how it should be interpreted or used.","The analysis is built on two datasets from the academic literature: one on annual historical emissions within present-day borders; the other on the emergence of independent nation states around the world, listing the status and colonial ruler of each country in each year.

These datasets were cleaned, extended and combined using a Python script written in a Jupyter notebook. In the spirit of transparency, this script is publicly available on GitHub, along with the full results of the analysis.

The results are presented at international level, with key stories emerging from the findings then illustrated and explained step by step. The animated “bar chart race” in the article was coded from scratch using D3 and Svelte, showing cumulative national emissions in each year alongside the depleting global “carbon budget” for 1.5C.

The other graphics in the piece were created in Datawrapper and then dressed using a bespoke webtool. Finally, the article includes an interactive, searchable table of results, to enable readers to explore the data on their own.","We hope this project holds a few lessons for other journalists.

First, while important and apparently simple questions can sometimes only be answered using complex data analysis, this need not be a barrier for journalists, as long as the right team is in place. The Carbon Brief staff behind this project included journalists, editors, data scientists, dataviz specialists and our digital content team.

Moreover, the stories emerging from complex analysis need not – and indeed should not – be complicated to explain. Clear, engaging storytelling that brings new understanding and information to light is key.

Second, time is a crucial ingredient in executing such a complex project, necessitating the full support – and patience – of senior editorial staff.

Third, eye-catching dataviz and attention-grabbing toplines can create an opportunity to delve into difficult questions with nuanced, thought-provoking and perhaps even unresolved answers. The true responsibility for historical emissions under colonial rule is ethically complicated, but clear data analysis brings opportunities to start engaging with such questions.

Finally, deeply researched data journalism can be a fascinating – and fun! –learning experience for those involved in its production, both in terms of the stories uncovered and the new techniques learned.",English,https://www.carbonbrief.org/revealed-how-colonial-rule-radically-shifts-historical-responsibility-for-climate-change/,https://www.carbonbrief.org/revealed-colonial-rule-nearly-doubles-uks-historical-contribution-to-climate-change/,https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1729084697031123184,https://github.com/carbonbrief/colonial-emissions-data,,,,"Simon Evans (writing and analysi), Leo Hickman (editing), Verner Viisainen (data analysis), Tom Pearson (dataviz) and Tom Prater (dataviz).","Simon – deputy editor and senior policy editor.

The data guided the reporting for “The Human Limit”, a Washington Post series exploring who is most at risk as a new wave of climate-fueled disease threatens humanity. It was central to “[Where dangerous heat is surging](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/extreme-heat-wet-bulb-globe-temperature/),” an article that showcases the analysis’ biggest findings and explains how rising temperatures will transform the way we work and live in the coming decades.

CarbonPlan [published](https://github.com/carbonplan/extreme-heat) the underlying data and the model code on their website, enabling the wider scientific community and policymakers to build on the findings. 

Following the publication of the stories, CarbonPlan met with the World Bank’s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery, who are planning to use the data to support their work on climate resilient urban development.","The model covered 15,000 cities around the world and used the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) metric, which integrates temperature, humidity, wind speed and sun radiation, and is considered the gold standard for measuring heat stress on the human body. 

What makes our model distinctive is incorporating urban heat island effects – which can increase local temperatures by several degrees – and calculating separate estimates of risk in the sun and in the shade. We built a search tool that allows readers to see the results in places they care about.

The model went through numerous revisions informed by several of the world’s top heat researchers. We gathered scientific feedback and suggestions for improvement from eleven heat experts around the globe as we continually shared new versions of the data set and an accompanying methodology paper.

The on-the-ground reporting that followed the data analysis proved challenging. In Pakistan, both of our reporters suffered from heat exhaustion. In Yemen, one of the world’s most difficult places to report, the extreme heat became debilitating for our journalists after just a few minutes while they also had to work around government minders who did not want us to show uncensored human suffering.","The team processed more than 3 terabytes of historic climate data and future projections using a cloud-based pipeline to create the model. Then we created a suite of nodeJS scripts that merged the resulting city and regional heat data with population estimates so we could calculate the total number of people affected in any country and in the world as a whole.

To refine the estimates, we first projected extreme heat days in 15,000 cities. Then, we calculated the exposure for people living in rural areas around the globe using a shapefile of “climate impact regions” which exclude uninhabited parts of the world.

To present the findings, the Post used a combination of mapping and charting tools: The Pakistan article featured an interactive globe while the world data piece contained an interactive lookup component built in React and an animated world map created in D3.js and Observable.","The collaboration between The Post and CarbonPlan showed the value of combining rigorous scientific methods with insights from the ground and quickly adapting the analysis to new questions that came up as the journalists on the project spoke to independent experts, government officials and local people affected by the heat.

A reportagem catalogou todas as obras literárias exigidas desde os anos 1980 em cinco dos mais importantes vestibulares do país, produzindo recortes de gênero e raça dos autores e a média de idade das leituras exigidas em cada ano.","A Universidade de São Paulo, maior universidade pública do Brasil e reconhecida como a melhor do país em diversos rankings, foi identificada pela reportagem como tendo o menor percentual de mulheres escritoras em suas listas de obras literárias. Na semana seguinte à publicação da matéria, a organização do vestibular da universidade divulgou as listas de leituras para os três anos seguintes, sendo todas as obras escritas por mulheres.","Não existia uma base de dados com as listas de leituras obrigatórias dos vestibulares. Foi necessário pesquisar fontes distintas para encontrar essas informações, um trabalho de semanas que mesmo algumas universidades não tinham disponível.

Beyond its trigger, three critical variables fuel a mega fire: forest continuity, shrub density and weather conditions. These catalysts mean the difference between a fire burning out and one capable of generating enough momentum to surge across the line of control and into unknown territory. **_Fuelling a Mega Fire_** is intended to help build a new understanding of mega fires and the structural causes accommodating them.","Fuelling a Mega Fire was published in both Spanish and English and has so far received 1532 views on the Sonda Internacional website. 

The feedback we have received from readers as well as scientists and firefighters across the Iberian Peninsula is that the project stands out as a contribution to public service journalism fulfilling a necessary function to reeducate readers on the new realities of the fire prone landscapes of Spain and Portugal.

Beyond the current metrics we believe the story will continue to act as a resource into the future as the challenge of extreme wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula continues to worsen without significant and widespread changes in land management. The story will remain freely accessible online through the Sonda Internacional website.","What may not be evident from the work is the tiny team behind Sonda Internacional who put it together with very limited resources as well as the months put into securing access agreements with firefighting teams across Spain, building close relationships with experts and scientists invested the story’s success and establishing trust in the small rural communities traumatized by fires and the dangerous results of changing land-use practises.","Quality photography and videos were primarily used to illustrate the key chapters of the report but additionally we utilized illustrative graphics, drone vision, comparative satellite images to show long-term changes in the land, a 360 camera to immerse the reader in the density of vegetation, an infrared camera to show the effects of humidity in burning speeds, interactive maps and we visualized datasets into gifs to make information as accessible as possible.","This report represents a ten-month investment in research, filming, and production - a commitment uncommon in the fast-paced world of modern journalism and traditional newsrooms. Despite the resourcing challenges we faced as a small media organization reliant on donations and grants we considered this time investment vital in order to tell the story accurately and with the support of leading scientists. We believe the journalism world can benefit from more well researched in-depth reports of this kind. 

Beyond the importance of time investment, other journalists could also learn the significant advantage of building trust and establishing visibility within small communities. Earning the trust of the rural communities relevant to our story required us to be present, engage with everyone and prove we were working far deeper than many of the conventional news reports they were used to seeing, would go. Most importantly we promised to not oversimplify the complexities of rural life. Gradually, as we worked, people opened up to us, took us into their homes or onto their land, and also felt the benefit of sharing their stories with us.","English, Spanish",https://sondainternacional.com/en/proyectos/mega-fires-beyond-extinction/fuelling-a-mega-fire/,"https://sondainternacional.com/en/proyectos/mega-fires-beyond-extinction/the-open-wounds-of-pedrogao-grande/#:~:text=Sixty%2Dfour%20people%20died%20and,drought%20and%20enduring%20heat%20waves.",https://sondainternacional.com/en/proyectos/mega-fires-beyond-extinction/spanish-lapland/,,,,,"Authors: Lily Mayers, Mikel Konate, Paulo Nunes dos Santos.

United States of America,CNN,Big,,,"‘Not seen since Vietnam’: Israel dropped hundreds of 2,000-pound bombs on Gaza, analysis shows",22/12/2023,"Investigation, OSINT, Chart, Map, Satellite images","AI/Machine learning, RAIC","CNN found that Israel dropped hundreds of 2,000-pound bombs on Gaza in the first month of the offensive alone. These bombs are inherently indiscriminate because of their very large lethal fragmentation zone – also known as a kill zone or blast radius – that is roughly the size of 58 soccer fields. The US only used this bomb once in its years-long war against ISIS.","Our findings, aided by AI-analysis of satellite imagery, helped to explain a major contributing factor the scale of damage and staggering death toll in Gaza over the course of this war. Our report was picked up as the top story on the pre-eminent DC-based defense digest Just Security and the lawyers representing South Africa at the ICJ this month drew on our findings in their case against the Israeli offensive.","We worked on this project as the debate about whether Israel was doing enough to protect civilians in Gaza had hit fever pitch. Our methodology was a conservative one. It sought to identify the scale at which these bombs were used in a short period of time (1 month). By working with AI, we were able to quantify the minimum number of 2,000-pound bombs that had been used, by looking at the size of the craters in satellite imagery. As a result, we were able to produce concrete information about what had previously been speculative, which is that the intensity and density of the bombing campaign in Gaza was preceded only by the war in Vietnam.
 
Working with AI lent our work both rigor and speed. A team of four reporters was able to produce information that was eventually used by a team of lawyers representing South Africa at the ICJ. It broadened the sample of our inquiry by which we sought to determine whether or not Israel was actually using measures to protect civilians. It also enabled us to take the information to experts, putting the data in a frame of reference that underscored the magnitude of the situation.","Satellite imagery from the first month of the war reveals over 500 impact craters over 12 meters (40 feet) in diameter - pattern consistent with the aftermath of 2,000-pound bombs. 
In this investigative effort, the team partnered with artificial intelligence company, Synthetaic. Leveraging examples of craters from Gaza, Synthetaic trained their algorithm, which analysed PlanetLabs satellite imagery on four dates: October 15, October 22, November 3, and November 6, revealing a total of nearly 2,000 craters.
Synthetaic uses RAIC, a detection platform for image, video, and geospatial data. Developed by Synthetaic, RAIC uses an unsupervised AI to instantly search unlabeled data without models. 
The algorithm sifted through the images, discerning and excluding the smaller craters, ultimately retaining only those with a diameter of approximately 40 feet. To ensure data accuracy, a Synthetaic team member, along with two CNN open-source intelligence journalists, manually scrutinized each identified crater.
Please note the analysis may be conservative due to constraints in available satellite imagery; the datasets from November 3 and November 6 do not cover the entirety of Gaza. Additionally, the nature of 2,000-pound bombs may not consistently result in visible craters, as this outcome depends on factors such as soil type and other variables.","As news organisations grapple with the risks and concerns associated with the AI’s impact on journalism, this investigation underscores how AI can be utilised for reporting and news gathering purposes. 
Synthetaic used RAIC on PlanetLabs satellites imagery to search for bomb craters in the north of Gaza for the first month of the war. Then, the OSINT team at CNN manually reviewed each crater to remove false positives. 
It is an excellent example as to how AI can help journalists sift through vast amounts of data for investigative reporting, so that they can focus on uncovering hidden patterns and analyse data swiftly.",English,https://edition.cnn.com/gaza-israel-big-bombs/index.html,,,,,,,"Tamara Qiblawi, Allegra Goodwin, Gianluca Mezzofiore, Nima Elbagir, Renée Rigdon, Alex Newman, Ian Berry, Barbara Arvanitidis, Mark Baron and Alex Platt","We are a multi-platform team composed of investigative reporters, OSINT specialists, visual editors and cartographers from CNN who collaborated with the American artificial intelligence company Synthetaic.

Mas apesar de os indicadores económicos mostrarem isso, havia um desafio: como retratar essas histórias? Fomos às raízes do jornalismo de dados e da publicação do “Precision Journalism: A Reporter's Introduction to Social Science Methods” e decidimos que nada melhor do que criar essa base de dados de testemunhos que tomavam o pulso à economia. Uma amostra que nunca teve a intenção de ser estatisticamente representativa mas que, na nossa opinião, foi o rosto das múltiplas dificuldades que os portugueses enfrentaram em 2023.","O impacto deste projecto foi enorme, sendo provavelmente dos projectos mais bem sucedidos em termos de impacto que o jornal já produziu. Conseguimos que mais de 400 pessoas (verificadas) conseguissem partilhar o que mudou na sua vida com a subida dos preços, mas também em que bens, etc. Criamos uma espécie de mural que combinava estatísticas e testemunhos para dar rosto a esta crise. E conseguimos, desses 400 testemunhos, extrair 6 grandes reportagens com casos que caracterizavam alguns desses problemas. 
O que mais nos surpreendeu foi também a capacidade que o jornalismo tem para mudar algumas dessas coisas. Um dos casos reportados, um pai que começou a fazer entregas na Uber Eats depois do trabalho para poder pagar as aulas de piano do filho, recebeu de outro leitor um piano para que este pudesse praticar. Outro, um estudante universitário que viu a sua renda subir de forma bastante expressiva, recebeu um contacto de um senhorio para lhe arrendar um quarto.","Para além do que já falamos, o trabalho foi um grande desafio de forma a garantir que os testemunhos que nos chegavam eram verdadeiros. Por um lado, queríamos que os leitores não sentissem que estavam a revelar muito de si - muita da informação poderia ser considerada sensível - por outro lado, tínhamos de garantir que os dados fornecidos eram de pessoas reais. Isso foi um enorme desafio.
Para além disso, o design do trabalho foi outro enorme desafio. O site teve provavelmente 4 ou 5 versões antes de chegar a esta versão, uma vez que queríamos que fosse um trabalho de fácil navegação e que permitisse ao leitor explorar os dados e os testemunhos.","Para este trabalho recorremos, numa primeira fase, a uma ferramenta externa para criar o formulário de recolha dos dados. Queríamos que o leitor sentisse que não estava a ceder os seus dados a uma qualquer plataforma mas sim ao jornalista dos Público. Por isso, optamos por uma ferramenta que permitiu emular o design do Público, integrando-o numa página simples do jornal. A sua divulgação foi feita essencialmente através das redes sociais e destaque na homepage do jornal.
A análise de dados foi feita com recurso a R, onde foram criados os vários scripts de recolha e análise dos indicadores disponíveis no site. Os dados que foram submetidos através do formulário eram, depois de verificados pelos jornalistas, inseridos num Google Sheets.
A página foi desenvolvida com SvelteKit. Foi também desenvolvido um template para publicar as reportagens/longforms resultantes desta recolha de dados.","Chico Buarque escreveu um dia, numa das suas músicas, que “a dor da gente não sai no jornal”. Terei que discordar. Mas acredito que sai cada vez menos. Principalmente porque “a dor da gente” foi substituída pelas fontes profissionalizadas e pelos “especialistas”. Mas também porque o jornalismo às vezes esquece-se de abrir um canal de comunicação com a sua audiência. O que este trabalho mostrou - com um cepticismo inicial da minha parte, confesso - é que as pessoas estão dispostas a partilhar as suas histórias desde que esse canal de comunicação exista.
Para além de mostrar uma verdade que é cada vez mais uma certeza no jornalismo de dados - de que criar a nossa própria base de dados pode ser muito mais interessante do que apenas reutilizar uma criada por alguém - este trabalho também prova que muitas vezes os números não bastam para reportar uma crise económica.",Português,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/inflacao-precos-poupanca,https://www.publico.pt/interactivo/aumento-custo-vida,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/miguel-estafeta-emprego-uber-inflacao-poupanca/,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/ana-estudante-universidade-propinas-renda-lisboa-inflacao-poupanca,,,,"Rui Barros,

United Kingdom,The Financial Times,Big,,,Quantum computing could break the internet. This is how.,03/05/2023,"Explainer, Long-form, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Audio","3D modeling, D3.js, Three.js, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, Python, SVG, React","They call it Q-day. That is the day when a robust quantum computer will be able to crack the most common encryption method used to secure our digital data. Q-day will have massive implications for internet companies, banks and governments — as well as our own personal privacy.

But how do quantum computers actually work? The FT’s visual storytelling team and innovation editor John Thornhill interviewed dozens of experts in order to explain how they upend the function and assumptions of classical computers. We step through sets of visuals to simplify and explain technical concepts, while written-through sections provide broader context.","The project was widely shared and one of the best-read visual stories produced all year. This is a famously complex topic and we needed to make it accessible to a general audience. Our aim was to simplify things and abstract concepts with visual metaphors so that a non-technical reader could grasp the significance and implications, if not all the exact technical details.

Based on the comments and feedback, the project achieved this aim of making the function and potential impacts (positive and concerning) understandable.

One comment in particular stood out: “This may well be the best use of data visualisation to explain a complex concept I have ever seen. Not only do I feel I am closer to understanding what quantum computing actually is, but I learned a lot about traditional computing that I didn't realise I didn't know.”","There’s a reason there haven’t been many visual explainers like this on the topic of quantum computing: it is extremely difficult to wrap one’s head around and to simplify things for a general audience in a way that doesn’t lose the core of the concepts (particularly without an advanced degree in physics). Writing and constructing this piece involved an extraordinary volume of research, as well as dozens of conversations with physicists. We think where we ultimately landed was successful, but summarising traditional computing concepts, quantum physics, and RSA encryption without losing a reader was an enormous challenge.","There are a few different tool/technology stacks involved here. The first involved a 3D model of a quantum computer that we loaded into blender, formatted and then used to output a rendered image sequence. Different sets of those render images were used in the topper and in a middle section to create the illusion of a 3D view at a much lower page weight than loading the model itself.

For the main visual sections, we settled on a “blank canvas”/”whiteboard” approach, slowly building up visual elements in a React context and using a combination of CSS transitions, SVG and D3 methods to step through our maze. The visual outline, as well as the mazes themselves, were constructed in Figma. The interactive part of the “bits/maze” visual required effectively creating an 8-bit computer in the browser (an early version included interactive logic gates).

This all required heavy consultation with experts and very careful thinking on transitions. We knew that we needed to layer up from an understanding of bits/bytes/classical computing before starting to explain qubits and we had to be very careful to transition things in ways that would maintain a clear connection between elements.","At a process level, there were two interesting things about our approach here: 1) the level of consultation and back-and-forth with experts to make sure that the way we were simplifying concepts still properly captured the more complicated underlying concept and 2) that this project was born out of a collaboration with our audio team, which produced a series on quantum computing for the FT tech tonic podcast contemporaneously. We worked together with them to produce two separate projects on the same topic, at the same time, but across different formats. Both were successful, playing to the strengths of their mediums, and proved to us that collaborating across different disciplines within an organisation can lead to great stories.

At a technical level, I think our approach on the rendered image sequence worked really well (and we’ve used it across other projects as well). There were a number of transitions between visual elements that I think effectively showed a connection between two frames that could have easily appeared discrete/disconnected that took a lot of careful thinking (in particular, in the section with the explanation of RSA encryption/”paint buckets”).",English,https://ig.ft.com/quantum-computing/,,,,,,,"Sam Learner, Sam Joiner, Irene de la Torre Arenas, John Thornhill","Three of us are a part of the FT's visual storytelling team, an interdisciplinary group of journalists combining data, design, coding and reporting skills.

Los afectados por un incendio y los bomberos encargados de apagarlo cuentan cómo vivieron el día que el parque nacional de alrededor de su población quedó calcinada. El acceso a los datos que recopila el cuerpo de bomberos de Cataluña, referente en Europa, permite reconstruir exactamente qué se quemó, cómo tomaron las decisiones para extinguirlo y qué harán ahora para analizarlo y evitar otros fuegos similares.","El proyecto ha tenido un notable impacto en cifra de visualizaciones (10.000), en el principal periódico de habla hispana del Mundo. En la localidad quemada, supuso un cambio inicial en el que las administraciones públicas renovaron su compromiso de aportar dinero para la recuperación del monte quemado.","Los datos geográficos que fundamentan el artículo no habían sido publicados hasta entonces, al menos en España. Las referencias geográficas de extensión del incendio por horas son recopiladas por el cuerpo de bomberos que se encargó de controlar el incendio, pero no es una práctica que todos los equipos de extinción lleven a cabo, por lo que lo novedoso es conseguir que los bomberos compartiesen esos datos y poder mostrarlos sobre un mapa.","Para la elaboración del proyecto se utilizaron las siguientes herramientas:
- JavaScript, HTML y CSS para la creación de la animación al inicio del artículo
- R como lenguaje de programación para el procesamiento de los datos.
- QGIS como software GIS para el procesamiento y tratamiento de datos espaciales.
- Adobe Illustrator y el plugin ai2html (desarrollado por el New York Times) para la publicación de los gráficos estáticos.
- Svelte como framework reactivo de JavaScript que permite desarrollar un ScrollyTelling fluido, dinámico que funciona perfectamente independientemente del dispositivo desde el que se lea.
- Blender para la creación de los _dioramas_ sobre los que se cuenta el avance del incendio.","Cada historia tiene siempre diferentes afectados y puntos de vista. Es importante no elaborar solo las informaciones teniendo como fuente de los datos y los vídeos a las administraciones públicas, en este caso los bomberos, porque contar cómo vivieron ese día sería quedarse con una parte del suceso. Preguntar a los vecinos afectados y conseguir que compartar sus archivos de vídeo permite mostrar otro componente humano de las consecuencias de un fenómeno, los incendios, que por desgracia parece más común dadas las circunstancias climáticas y de gestión del territorio actuales.

United States of America,CNN,Big,,,A lonely struggle: Nine mothers share the mental health challenges they faced during ‘the happiest time of their lives’,05/05/2023,"Illustration, Audio, Women, Health",Adobe Creative Suite,"It’s estimated that as many as 1 in 5 women experience some form of mental health issues during pregnancy or in the first year after childbirth, known as the perinatal period. These vary greatly from non-psychotic conditions, such as depressive illness and anxiety, to less common conditions, such as postpartum psychosis. But a widespread lack of knowledge, deeply entrenched stigma and systemic gender and economic inequality mean that millions of people are estimated to go undiagnosed or untreated each year.",This stunning audio-visual interactive aimed to address this stigma and engage people by sharing the stories of women across countries and socio-economic groups worldwide and highlight how they can truly affect anyone.,"Data on maternal mental health conditions is limited, particularly in low and middle income countries. To ensure we made use of whatever data and research is known, CNN worked closely with a network of health providers and civil society organizations supporting perinatal mental health in different countries around the world. We had regular contact with these experts and conducted a panel discussion to help us design questions to ask the women we interviewed. This ensured we did not use stigmatizing or insensitive language, and enabled us to provide context and transparency, to avoid putting women in a vulnerable position. 


Among the organizations that were interested in participating, a few were selected and asked to help facilitate access to women in their networks. The aim was to find people with different health, social, economic and geographical backgrounds, providing a heterogeneous sample of cases to identify local factors around maternal health, as well as highlight global gaps and similarities. We also established criteria for participation. For example, the protagonists had to be out of the vulnerable and acute phases of their conditions, and they had to be part of a health network that would follow up and support them throughout the project.","The project was designed in Figma, and the illustrations drawn by hand by a commissioned illustrator before being processed in photoshop and animated using code. Adobe Illustrator and After Effects were used to process the animated elements, and we used Premier Pro to process the audio files and subtitles. We also used tweening functions synchronized with the scrolling of the page using pure custom JavaScript (for performance). For the audio, we used Pro Tools for all audio editing and mixing and, iZotope RX8 Suite for all audio repair.","The aim of the story was to show how perinatal mental health conditions affect women globally by hearing the voices and perspectives of women affected by some of these issues. For this reason, we decided to combine the use of traditional journalism and less orthodox news gathering methods to allow women to speak openly about their own experiences. 


Following advice from multiple mental health experts, we asked women to document the hormonal, physical, emotional and psychological changes experienced during pregnancy and after birth, and how these changes impacted their mental health. The participants were asked to respond freely, wither by writing, sharing diary entries or sending voice notes. A facilitator ensured women were not put in compromising situations. 


For the digital article, we then compiled people's experiences in the form of audio diary entries for audiences to hear from these women directly. For the visual storytelling, we chose an immersive format that enabled us to introduce these women as relatable characters through their illustrations, while setting a tone and enabling readers to feel the emotions associated with their experiences through the look and feel of the piece. The audio allowed you to hear from them in a very intimate way.",English,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/05/health/maternal-mental-health-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html,,,,,,,"Writer and Producer: Carlotta Dotto

While membership in these groups is not always publicly available, The Post identified affiliations based on public lists where available and reported where not available.

Most Republicans belong to at least one group, but many claim membership to more than one due to personal interests and political leanings. About a dozen Republicans choose not to be a part of any of the five groups, according to The Post's reporting.","The data collection was time consuming as we had to reach the House member offices to confirm their membership.

Face a esta realidade, e tendo em conta os registos históricos verificados durante o verão no Atlântico Norte, decidimos criar uma ferramenta que permitisse saber a temperatura da água do mar em cada praia da costa portuguesa, ao mesmo tempo que monitorizávamos a temperatura média da água de toda a costa portuguesa.","Esta_ news application_ teve um impacto imediato, com a sua actualização diária a atrair diariamente vários utilizadores recorrentes que passaram a consultar as previsões da temperatura da água do mar nas suas praias. A actualização diária dos registos permitiu ainda vigiar a evolução da temperatura, tendo sido possível extrair dados relevantes para outros trabalhos jornalísticos.","Para além do sucesso da _news application_, com um formato evergreen que será relevante para lá deste ano da publicação - os dados são actualizados diariamente, entre Maio e Setembro, recorrendo à API do Serviço de Monitorização do Meio Marinho do Copérnico -, foi possível extrair uma história sobre como a costa portuguesa escapava à vaga de calor que se registava na altura no Atlântico Norte. 
O trabalho exigiu o investimento de mais horas do que o habitual, face à dimensão da base de dados recolhida - dados horários de uma área geográfica como a da costa portuguesa, mais o historial dos últimos 30 anos para cada uma das praias, resultam em milhões de linhas de informação para processar. O cruzamento da localização geográfica das praias com as respectivas temperaturas obrigou a equipa a aprender e aplicar conceitos e ferramentas não utilizados até esta empreitada. A dimensão da base de dados obrigou também a que a recolha fosse limitada a apenas metade do ano, entre Março e Setembro, de forma a optimizar o funcionamento da aplicação.","Recorreu-se a duas bases de dados: a lista de praias, e suas respectivas coordenadas geográficas, fornecida pela Agência Portuguesa do Ambiente (APA) e os dados de satélite da temperatura da superfície do oceano extraídos de sistemas de previsão e análise da costa portuguesa (continente e ilhas) do Copérnico. 
As coordenadas geográficas das praias na base de dados da APA serviram para identificar os pontos correspondentes nos registos de temperatura da superfície do oceano do Copérnico, com recurso a um modelo oceânico de dados locais e de satélite para realizar previsões e análise de temperatura (Portugal continental e arquipélago da Madeira) e a outro de análise e previsões oceânicas globais (arquipélago dos Açores). 
Uma github action recolhe diariamente a previsão da temperatura do mar para cada praia, entre as 8h e as 20h. Estes registos são contextualizados com uma comparação histórica que considera a média da temperatura da água do mar em todas as praias entre 1993 e 2021.
Os cálculos, assim como o cruzamento das duas bases de dados, foram feitos com a linguagem de programação R. O desenvolvimento web foi feito com recurso a Svelte e à biblioteca de componentes desenvolvida dentro da equipa, o Tangram.","Este trabalho permite aliar três potencialidades importantíssimas das _news applications_. É um conteúdo interactivo personalizável, que permite individualizar os dados existentes numa base de dados de dimensão nacional ao possibilitar a escolha da praia que se quer consultar, mostrando assim uma realidade diferente a cada utilizador. 
É também um conteúdo evergreen, o que significa que todas as horas despendidas podem ter uma retorno de longo prazo bastante elevado, tendo em conta que a aplicação será relevante em todas as épocas balneares. 
Finalmente, é um conteúdo assente numa base de dados permanentemente actualizada que permite à redacção monitorizar um indicador muito relevante para a actualidade como é a temperatura dos oceanos (em especial o Azul, a secção do jornal dedicada à crise climática, ao ambiente e à sustentabilidade), daí podendo resultar histórias ou complementar reportagens sobre o tema.",Português,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/temperatura-agua-praia/,https://www.publico.pt/2023/08/18/azul/noticia/costa-portuguesa-quente-escapa-vaga-calor-atlantico-norte-2060522,,,,,,"Rui Barros, José Volta e Pinto","José Volta e Pinto: licenciado em Ciências da Comunicação, depois de uma breve passagem por engenharia, entrou em 2020 para a secção de Online do jornal Público.

It was published on two different days because it was a long form story. 
In the process, the story uncovered the forms of the inhumane act of stereotyping these individuals, the institutions where it happens, including government-led institutions as well as security organs in Uganda such as the Uganda Police Force.","The story established the root or depth of the problem and then higlighted the plausible remedies to address the challenge. The story further uncovered the role, strengths and impact of undermining the laws or regulations. It as well highlighted the need to understand that, cultural differences exist between different groups and people. Due to this, the story also uncovered the plight that dreadlocked communities face on a daily, interms of accessing employment opportunities in reputable companies or organizations. Through this story, it was established that, the role of embracing various aspects of culture that unite and disregard all aspects of discrimination is essential in uniting different people.","During the initial stages of gathering information for analysis, it was difficult to directly chat or discuss with police officers as most of the information they shared lacked proof and, in some instances, they falsely denied arresting individuals with dreadlocked hair. Although I was able to interview high profile individuals for this project, most of them requested the use of pseudo names for fear of losing their jobs since they lead reputable organizations in the country. The project as well had access to information from documents like published articles, videos, reports, studies and individual interviews were carried out to back up the project’s findings.","The findings in this project were established by physically meeting with the marginalised individuals and high profile people for interviews. It was necessary for the Journalist to collaboratively identify different software applications to visualize the information in an understandable way. Some of these include; infographics, images and drop quotes from the story. This was done as way of explaining the information in an interactive format. To understand the magnitude of this challenge, documents and published articles were analysed and the findings established a pattern of discrimination, violation of human rights and stereotyping individuals with dreadlocked hair.","Journalists can learn the basics of scrutinizing information from different formats about certain topics in an analytical way. For instance, this project required the joirnalist to search out for information from audios, videos, texts, reports and studies. It enabled the journalist to gather comprehensive information for this project. Journalists therefore need to also understand and acknowledge that stories that have or create an impact in a community are the undermined ones which need more attention. It is also important to note that journalists should not be afraid of producing long form content due to the misconception that audiences are not interested in this nature of content.

A sua actualização semanal ao longo de nove meses permitiu aos leitores consultar a variação dos preços de 41 produtos do cabaz IVA zero, comparando ainda a variação do valor total do cabaz com a variação dos produtos não englobados. 

A actualização regular permitiu também obter várias histórias de acompanhamento ao longo dos meses.","A decisão do Governo de isentar de IVA uma série de bens alimentares essenciais foi recebida com contestação por partidos da oposição e com cepticismo por parte dos consumidores, existindo dúvidas sobre a eficácia da medida na contenção dos preços. 
Os dados utilizados foram disponibilizados pela associação de consumidores portugueses (Deco Proteste), que leva a cabo a monitorização de um conjunto de alimentos essenciais.

Video","An immersive visit into the homes of three families living in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine, six days after a Russian missile strike on their apartment block.","The project sheds light on the impact of the war in Ukraine on ordinary civilians and their daily lives. By combining intimate photographic portraits, photogrammetry of the residents' apartments, and text based on interviews with the residents, the article immerses the reader in the experiences of families affected by Putin's incessant bombing.","In Ukraine, attacks on civilian targets have become an integral part of Russian warfare. Since the beginning of the war on February 24, at least 8,451 Ukrainian civilians have died as a result of military violence. Daily air raid alarms and the indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas contribute to psychological distress and disrupt normal life. When Dominic Nahr, a photojournalist, and Jonas Roth, an international journalist, visited Ukraine in spring 2023, their goal was to shed light on the suffering of the Ukrainian population during these attacks. Going beyond a traditional news article, we recognised the importance of making the impact on civilians as tangible as possible for our readers.","Dominic Nahr, photojournalist, and Jonas Roth, journalist, reached Zaporizhzhia, a city in southern Ukraine located 40 kilometres from the front, six days after the attack on apartment block 2b. While they had been travelling to the city, Adina Renner, a visual journalist based in Switzerland, had created a prototype of the story in Adobe After Effects using available visual material from social media. On-site, Nahr and Roth were able to view the prototype on their mobile phones and therefore collect voices, images and photogrammetry scans in a manner consistent to the concept. Back in Switzerland, Renner refined the visual storytelling concept using the prototyping tool Protopie, Roth and Nahr wrote the text and edited the images and Manz – a 3D specialist – produced videos from the photogrammetry in Blender.

United Kingdom,The Financial Times,Big,,,"Inside North Korea’s oil smuggling: triads, ghost ships and underground banks",29/03/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, OSINT, Infographics, Map, Corruption, Crime","Animation, 3D modeling, Three.js, QGIS","llegal shipments to Pyongyang, which is developing a new generation of ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads, have been well documented.

Less well known, however, are the individuals behind the shadowy networks that enable the regime of Kim Jong Un to finance its nuclear ambitions.

A year-long investigation by the Financial Times and the Royal United Services Institute revealed for the first time how business figures in Asia have helped facilitate illicit deliveries of hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil to North Korea. 

Using groundbreaking visuals, it’s a story of gangsters, ghost ships and spies.","In the wake of this investigation we have already seen a change in the activity of the ships and individuals referenced in the story. The project also documents, for the first time, the ways in which businesses help to prop up Kim Jong Un's nuclear regime. For this reason alone the investigation is an important piece of analysis — and helps frame how researchers, NGOs and nations should approach the subject of North Korean oil smuggling. Importantly for the FT, the piece was also hit with subscribers, with an article dwell time well above the FT average. The most-liked comment summed up the thoughts of many: “Fabulous reporting, and hats off to the graphics team. This is what journalism should look like — thank you.”","Reporting on North Korea and the shadowy networks that empower it is incredibly difficult. This investigation is a complex tale traced through shell companies, triad networks, underground financing channels and sprawling family connections. It involved reporters knocking on doors and putting themselves at considerable risk by targeting organised crime groups in East Asia.

But it sheds new light on how the shattered economy overseen by North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has been propped up by murky intelligence and financing operations in the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

It also helps explain how Kim’s regime can continue to build increasingly sophisticated nuclear weapons in defiance of tough international sanctions. Last week, Kim attended a missile test that simulated a nuclear attack on the US and South Korea.

“This is the most detailed evidence ever put into the public domain to show how North Korea uses people with high-level connections to criminal networks like the triads to evade sanctions and finance their weapons programmes,” says James Byrne, director of the open-source intelligence and analysis research group at Rusi.","Our visual investigation opens in cinematic fashion, with a CGI video showing a reconstruction of a genuine ship-to-ship transfer. The video was created using a combination of Blender, an open source 3D application, and After Effects, Adobe’s motion graphics software. 

Using a combination of satellite imagery and the automatic tracking systems used by naval vessels we worked with the Royal United Services Institute to conduct near constant reconnaissance of ship-to-ship transfers of oil in both the Taiwan Strait and off the coast of North Korea, as well as deliveries into the port of Nampo and by truck to Mirim Training Ground in Pyongyang. 

This combination of imagery and data, captured over almost a year, allowed us to visualise every step in the smugglers’ supply chain — a body of evidence that ultimately led to a change in the activity of both the ships and individuals at the heart of the network.","The FT visual storytelling team worked collaboratively on this project, combining expertise from investigative journalism, geopolitical affairs, open-source intelligence, data analysis and visualisation. This kind of work can be painstaking, but combining graphics skills with traditional reporting and subject matter expertise leads to a quality of journalism that is hard to match.",English,https://ig.ft.com/north-korea-oil-smuggling/,,,,,,,"Authors: Christian Davies, Primrose Riordan, Chan Ho-him, Steven Bernard, Dan Clark, Sam Joiner, and Caroline Nevitt.

Nigeria,Dataphyte,Small,,,Mitigating Misinformation and Disinformation from Pollsters towards the 2023 General Elections in Nigeria (copy),25/02/2023,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics",Google Sheets,"The project was conceived during a time of political division and high expectations fueled by speculative polls regarding the Presidential elections scheduled for February 25, 2023.

The project aimed to predict the election outcome objectively by providing factual and unbiased explanations of the factors that influenced past voting patterns in Nigeria, offering reliable statistical estimations of critical variables that would determine the election outcome, reducing potential misinformation from election pollsters and the impact of false narratives such as group grievances and riots that might arise after the elections. The project’s predictions matched the eventual election outcome with a 98% correlation.","The first story in the project, published in Dataphyte's Data Dives Newsletter, had the highest number of reads in the year 2023 as well as when published on the website.

Also, Premium Times, a well-known investigative journalism organization in Nigeria, reviewed traditional and new opinion polls that were inaccurate and singled out the Dataphyte story as the only one that provided precise and correct predictions without any equivocation. 

The project’s stories emphasized the importance of data and objectivity in moderating public discourse, particularly where leading opinions are influenced by bias and emotions, and in reducing the risk of misleading the public into group grievances by these divided opinions. 

The story was the first and only one to clearly state the pattern of the election victory: that regardless of the scenario, the eventual winner, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, was the only candidate to secure the required 25% of votes in two-thirds of the 36 states and the federal capital. 

The project’s success was lauded by many, as it provided a reliable and objective tool for understanding the complex dynamics of Nigerian politics. This helped to reduce shock and surprise and ensured a less riotous aftermath of the presidential elections.","Before Nigeria's 2023 general elections, the political atmosphere was tense, and traditional and social media were filled with fabricated data-driven reports and experiments that fueled biased socio-political stories. Due to this, every story and commentary was suspected of ethnic or religious bias towards a presidential candidate. 

To ensure that this project was based on facts and figures and not influenced by the current political mood or reporter bias, the Dataphyte data journalist relied heavily on evidence from past academic research. They used computer screenshots and quoted verbatim (instead of paraphrasing findings) from those research to validate the variables used in designing the predictive model.

Thus, the first story (President Tinubu: Predilections and Predictions) went to great lengths to establish that the choice of variables was statistically reliable and used long before the tumultuous election period.

The follow-up story (President Atiku: Muslim Grade. Middle Ground) presented the reporter's predictive model and results. It further showed that the statistical method used in the research, each state’s demographics, and their respective voter predilections had been measured objectively before this time.

The third in the series (President-Elect Tinubu: Glimpses, Glitches, and Glints) showed how the eventual outcome of the elections matched the writer’s predictions.","Tools: Microsoft Excel Software - its Analysis and Visualisation Tools

Techniques: Quantitative Techniques, Statistical Weightings, Statistical Modelling and Inference.

Technologies: Computer Screenshots/Photography of previous research evidence to prove that every word, every paragraph, and every chart/map was taken from previous research work by other authors and not the reporter (instead of just paraphrasing the research findings in the reporter’s own words).","This project offers valuable lessons that other journalists can learn from. Firstly, it’s important for journalists to maintain objectivity, especially during times of political polarization. 

Secondly, investigative and interpretive reports should be transparent, detailing the methods and means of research.

Thirdly, journalists must have the courage to declare their findings from investigations, regardless of their personal preferences or political affiliations.
 
Fourthly, data journalism can effectively moderate public debate and alleviate public anxiety and confusion during uncertain times by using descriptive and predictive statistics. Additionally, data journalism can also be leveraged to combat misinformation and disinformation. 

Lastly, journalistic rigour is essential in presenting fact-based reports and preventing misinformation from spreading.

The audience ends at a map where they can input their address and see the proximity of their location to mass shootings that have occurred since 2014 — a startling personalization to highlight a reality that so many Americans face regularly.","While high-profile mass shootings dominate headlines and spark debate, most go relatively unnoticed by national outlets and disproportionately affect marginalized communities. Coverage that digs into the everyday reality of millions is crucial as rates of mass shootings in the US continue to rise and affect more people, especially some of the country’s most vulnerable.","From a data analysis perspective, we used python (geopandas) and QGIS for the spatial analysis. To determine the country-wide number of people living in relatively close proximity to a mass shooting, we conducted a spatial analysis process of 1) plotting US census block groups with population totals 2) plotting the mass shooting locations 3) calculating 1-mile areas around each shooting location 4) dissolving the individual areas into a total area 5) calculating the percentage overlap of the total area to each Census block group to estimate the population living within 1-mile of a mass shooting.

To present the story, we used Adobe Illustrator and Datawrapper to create graphics and illustrations. Development-wise, we used front-end languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) and Mapbox to create a scrolly-telling experience and showcase the piece.","This project is a strong example of how data journalists can use creative data analysis and combination to find fresh angles for widely used data sets to tell new stories. In this case, the topic was US mass shootings, a horrific reality that’s been widely reported on. Many outlets have used data from the Gun Violence Archive (GVA) to create stories around annual statistics and trends. This project was unique because it combined the GVA data with US Census Bureau population data to ask a new question: approximately how many Americans lived near a mass shooting in the last decade? 

We used spatial analysis to not only look at direct gun violence, but the potential community ramifications, purposefully showcasing abstract data in a human context. The project exemplifies this by starting with people’s stories and again, at the end of the piece, where it allows individual readers to find out how close they may have lived to a mass shooting. Overall, this piece uses creative data analysis, visuals and reporting to localize a national trend and reach readers in a unique and engaging way.",English,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/08/us/americans-living-near-mass-shootings-statistics-dg/,,,,,,,"oReporter, Design and Data Editor: Amy O'Kruk

Brazil,Gênero e Número,Small,,,"Branco e masculino, STF pode mudar em 2023",11/04/2023,"Chart, Politics","Google Sheets, CSV, Adobe Illustrator, Flourish","A reportagem visual mostra uma “cascata de homens brancos”, onde as linhas que os representam ocupam a altura quase total do gráfico, o que aponta de maneira inédita a sobrerrepresentação de homens brancos no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) ao longo da história. Entre 170 ministros que haviam atuado no órgão até aquele momento, somente três eram negros – todos homens - e somente três eram mulheres - todas brancas.","Ao mostrar que, desde sua criação, o STF teve suas cadeiras ocupadas 95% do tempo por homens brancos, o trabalho serviu de insumo e foi amplamente citado por organizações da sociedade civil na defesa de maior representatividade no STF, como o Movimento Mulheres Negras Decidem, que liderou a campanha #MinistraNegraJá

Os dados foram citados por veículos de circulação nacional e regionais, nativos digitais e da mídia tradicional, como o Portal Catarinas, Brasil de Fato (PE), Redes da Maré, Valor Econômico, Núcleo Jornalismo e Portal Ig.

O trabalho ganhou o Prêmio Cláudio Weber Abramo de Jornalismo de Dados 2023, na categoria “Visualização”.","Desde a sua criação, em 1891, o STF é uma corte majoritariamente branca e masculina, mas isso nunca havia sido demonstrado de maneira gráfica a partir de dados. Publicada no dia da aposentadoria do ministro Ricardo Lewandowski, a reportagem mobilizou o debate público sobre diversidade de gênero e raça na máxima instância do Judiciário, no ano em que dois ministros - entre eles uma mulher - se aposentaram e o presidente Lula teve a oportunidade de indicar dois novos integrantes para a Corte.

A parte textual traz as principais contribuições ao debate jurídico feitas pelos integrantes da Corte que não eram homens brancos, uma vez que parte dos argumentos de quem resiste a políticas de representatividade no STF se baseia em afirmar que a escolha dos ministros não deve ser feita somente a partir de cor/raça ou gênero.

A reportagem visual deixou em evidência que o debate constitucional no Brasil foi feito majoritariamente por homens brancos, sem a participação do maior grupo demográfico do país, as mulheres negras.","Os dados históricos de ministros que passaram pela Corte não estavam compilados por gênero e raça, então o primeiro procedimento foi a busca manual de informações de cada ministro entre 1891 e 2023.

No trabalho de análise dos dados, nos inspiramos no conceito de anos-pessoa, usado na demografia para o cálculo da expectativa de vida ao nascer. Somamos os anos de cada ministro no cargo e chegamos ao tempo de exercício total de todos os magistrados ao longo da história do STF. A partir disso, calculamos quanto desse tempo foi exercido pelos diferentes grupos demográficos presentes no Brasil. 

Para uma primeira análise, utilizamos o Flourish com o objetivo de entender e identificar se existem padrões nos dados. A visualização de dados foi feita com o programa Adobe Illustrator e sua adaptação para a web através do script open-source ai2html do New York Times, que converte arquivos do illustrator para formatos HTML e CSS. A visualização foi adaptada para o formato desktop e mobile, para que o usuário possa ter a melhor experiência em diferentes telas.","A reportagem visual é um exemplo de coleta manual e inovação metodológica para análise de dados. Ainda que não houvesse uma base estruturada disponível, reunimos e disponibilizamos para o público informações relevantes para o debate racial e de gênero na máxima instância do Judiciário. 

A aplicação do conceito de anos-pessoa na análise demográfica da Corte também é uma contribuição para o campo do jornalismo de dados que cobre a conformação dos poderes que constituem o Estado brasileiro.",Português,https://www.generonumero.media/reportagens/homens-brancos-stf/,https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cq82SYnJUjy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D,,,,,,"Aline Gatto Boueri, Victória Sacagami, Marcella Semente","A Gênero e Número é uma associação que produz e distribui jornalismo e informação orientados por dados e análises sobre questões urgentes de gênero e raça, visando qualificar debates rumo à equidade.

Unfortunately, it has been under threat due to human activities. The consequences of this have been felt by the nearby communities, who are now experiencing the effects of climate change. As a result of deforestation and other human activities, the region has become extremely prone to drought, and during the rainy season, the area is plagued by floods. It's a sad situation, and it highlights the importance of taking care of our environment and the impact that our actions can have on the world.",Ive been invited to train journalists on the use of data in storytelling. The story has also been widely shared by the journalists as a new way of multimedia storytelling.,"The Ngong forest encroachment is being carried out by land grabbers with the backing of state officials. It is an unfortunate situation that they have compromised the state organs in charge of conservation and even resorted to silencing media houses from exposing their deeds.

Brazil,Lupa,Small,,,LupaMundi - Mapa das legislações sobre desinformação,06/11/2023,"Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database",Personalisation,"Projeto único no mundo, o “LupaMundi - Mapa das legislações sobre desinformação” apresenta, em um mapa interativo, as leis sobre desinformação do mundo todo. Elaborado pela Lupa, o mapa está disponível em português e inglês, o que o torna uma ferramenta que pode ser consultada por pessoas de diversas nacionalidades.

Com a busca, o usuário pode usar filtros e comparar as leis dos países, o que possibilita uma análise aprofundada sobre o tema, fazendo com que seja uma referência especialmente para jornalistas, pesquisadores e estudiosos do fenômeno da desinformação.","O LupaMundi foi lançado em novembro de 2023 e despertou grande interesse de jornalistas e pesquisadores de desinformação no Brasil e no exterior. As informações do LupaMundi estão à disposição de qualquer pessoa para que sejam usadas em reportagens, pesquisas acadêmicas e outros.

Como resultado da relevância do projeto, a Lupa foi convidada a participar de uma série de eventos para apresentar o LupaMundi, como o Fórum Pamela Howard para Cobertura de Crises Globais, do International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), e uma reunião com checadores do mundo todo da International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). O mapa também foi apresentado para acadêmicos brasileiros que estudam o fenômeno da desinformação em uma live organizada pela Lupa.

A possibilidade de comparar a legislação sobre desinformação no mundo todo de forma simples e fácil chamou a atenção de diversos veículos especializados. O LupaMundi foi destaque nos seguintes veículos: Latam Journalism Review, do Knight Center de Jornalismo das Américas, International Center for Journalists (ICFJ), International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), Portal dos Jornalistas, Farol Jornalismo, O Desinformante, Ajor e Agência Tatu.


As matérias no site da Lupa tiveram mais de 10 mil visualizações. Os posts publicados nas redes sociais da Lupa tiveram alto engajamento com 60 mil interações.","Além do ineditismo da iniciativa de compilar a informação sobre legislação em desinformação do mundo todo, é importante destacar que as informações estão disponíveis para toda e qualquer pessoa acessar. Isso é importante porque muitos projetos de lei sobre desinformação estão em debate mundo afora para conter o impacto da desinformação. Desta forma, o LupaMundi possibilita que o cidadão compare a legislação dos diferentes países e entenda as diferentes formas de fazer frente ao problema.

A Lupa foi além e mapeou também os 14 principais projetos de lei que estão em debate no mundo. Os países foram selecionados de acordo com sua relevância geopolítica – alguns exercem influência nos debates do mundo todo, outros têm papel de destaque em seus continentes. É o caso do Brasil, já que o projeto de lei (PL) 2.630/2020 pode influenciar outros debates na América Latina.

Devido à atualidade do tema e o interesse global no assunto, o LupaMundi está disponível em inglês e português.

O mapa teve a colaboração da Red LatamChequea e dos signatários da International Fact-checking Network (IFCN) na etapa de apuração e coleta de dados.","O LupaMundi é um mapa interativo. Esse formato é essencial para os usuários analisarem de forma clara e objetiva as informações que constam na base de dados apurada pela equipe da Lupa. 

Foi utilizada como base de dados uma planilha do Google, para o trabalho compartilhado e a coordenação entre a equipe de apuração, edição e desenvolvimento de software. A interface do mapa foi desenvolvida a partir de um modelo disponibilizado pela ONU em formato SVG, com o uso da linguagem JavaScript. O design, paleta de cores e as funcionalidades foram definidos pela equipe do projeto na Lupa.

Uma das premissas do projeto era que a interface fosse simples de ser atualizada pela equipe de jornalistas da Lupa. Isso é fundamental para manter o LupaMundi atualizado, já que o tema das legislações sobre desinformações está na pauta diária de diversos países e, por isso, as informações mudam com frequência.","Jornalistas do mundo todo que falem inglês podem usar o LupaMundi para produzir reportagens com as informações disponíveis no mapa. A intenção é que eles possam criar histórias que sejam relevantes para os seus contextos locais a partir da comparação da legislação com outros países.

O LupaMundi permite a análise, a partir do cruzamento de informações, das diferentes legislações e formas de atuação jurídica dos países, nas temáticas relacionadas à desinformação ao redor do mundo.

O LupaMundi também permite pesquisa por temas específicos, como denúncias de uso para censura e cerceamento da liberdade de imprensa em determinados países, crimes cibernéticos, regulamentação da imprensa, da internet e das plataformas, entre outros.

Quem ganhou mais com os contratos públicos? Qual o atraso destas obras face ao inicialmente previsto? Quantos milhões vão ficar por executar? Qual o custo-benefício das obras em curso? Estas são as perguntas de partida para um trabalho que quis analisar o investimento público realizado no sector da ferrovia no último quadro comunitário de apoio 2014-2020 (cuja execução podia ir até 2023).","O projecto foi muito bem recebido porque tornou transparente informação que estava dispersa ou que nem sequer tinha sido divulgada de forma transparente. Como foi criado um conjunto de scripts que permite uma actualização diária do projecto, o portal tornou-se a plataforma onde qualquer cidadão pode consultar o estado da obra que, de alguma forma, mais impacto tem na sua vida. A plataforma também veio colocar a descoberto a falta de transparência no processo, uma vez que, por exemplo, tornou-se impossível dizer quanto é que o orçamento de alguns dos troços já derrapou - que era, inicialmente, um dos grandes objetivos do projecto.","O acesso a dados foi a maior dificuldade deste projecto. Muita da informação estava simplesmente dispersa, sem que houvesse qualquer forma de uniformizar essa recolha de forma automática. Para além disso, houve uma constante recusa por parte das instituições públicas envolvidas no processo em divulgar dados - uma recusa que só foi resolvida, e parcialmente, através do equivalente em Portugal ao FOIA. Ainda assim, a equipa que esteve envolvida ficou sempre dividida entre esperar pela informação ou publicar informando que, apesar de termos questionado a instituição, os dados requisitados não chegaram. O trabalho ainda está a ser actualizado, e muita desta informação ainda não chegou. Outra dificuldade esteve associada às fotografias para cada troço. Tínhamos como objectivo que o leitor pudesse não só olhar para os números de determinada obra mas também ver o estado da obra naquele momento. Felizmente a equipa de dados do jornal trabalhou com a equipa do “Sobre Carris”, um podcast do jornal dedicado em exclusivo à temática da ferrovia. Isso permitiu recorrer a muitos “trainspotters” e ouvintes do podcast, que foram enviando imagens da sua autoria para cada um dos troços. Essa participação activa da audiência foi fundamental para tornar o trabalho mais rico.","O trabalho recorre a uma combinação de um conjunto de scripts em R e a github actions que, todos os dias, correm para proceder à actualização da informação disponível no portal. Este conjunto de scripts tentou automatizar ao máximo a actualização dos dados, mas depressa percebemos que uma grande parte do trabalho teria que ser feito de forma manual e da forma mais tradicional possível: fazendo chamadas ou, em alternativa, enviando e-mails. 
Por isso, o trabalho está em grande parte assente num google sheets partilhado, que os jornalistas envolvidos podem actualizar sempre que há uma novidade em cada um dos troços.
Neste trabalho fizemos também as nossas primeiras experiências com modelação 3D para desenhar um comboio que se pareça com o modelo usado pela empresa pública, a CP. Ainda que o objectivo inicial fosse usar three.js para animar este comboio, depressa percebemos que essa tecnologia seria demasiado complexa para implementar neste projecto.
O frontend recorreu ao SvelteKit e à ferramenta de componentes do PÚBLICO, o Tangram.","Acreditamos que já se tornou uma verdade de La Palice no jornalismo de dados: as melhores bases de dados são aquelas que os próprios jornalistas criam. A criação deste portal nasceu, primeiro, de uma necessidade dos próprios jornalistas que não conseguiam encontrar informação sistematizada sobre todos os troços.

United States of America,Flatwater Free Press,Small,,,"""Who's Buying Nebraska?""",05/10/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Business, Agriculture, Economy","Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, OpenRefine and Posit Cloud","Multinational corporations, out-of-state investors and billionaires are buying up gigantic chunks of Nebraska farmland, found a 2023 Flatwater Free Press data-driven series.
FFP requested sales records, exhaustively cleaned, compiled and checked them with Nebraska's 93 counties, then chopped through a thicket of LLCs, revealing the buyers' hidden identities.
Among the findings:
Seven of Top 10 are headquartered outside Nebraska and spent a combined five-year total of $246 million.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Ted Turner each own entire counties of ranchland.
Bill Gates, Meta and Google are buying up pricey farmland -- and pricing out farmers.","Stories in the 8-story series, ""Who's Buying Nebraska?"" were read by more Nebraskans than any other in FFP's history. The second story in the series, on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Nebraska land purchases, was read by more than 260,000 people, or nearly 15% of the state's population. The stories were also republished by dozens of other Nebraska media outlets, from the biggest TV station to tiny weekly newspapers, ensuring that hundreds of thousands of other Nebrsakans saw them. 
The series has sparked renewed conversation about regulation of farmland buys, the usage of water underneath farmland and other issues related to rising land value. And it has challenged Nebraska's traditional perception that farmers own the land on which they grow crops and raise cattle. It's instead focused attention on a rural and little discussed part of income inequality, which is that more Bill Gates' own Nebraska land, while fewer and fewer middle-class farm families do.","Either consciously or not, the state of Nebraska has made it nearly impossible to find, access and analyze land sales. It's pretty hard to overstate the difficulty of data collection here. Consider: These records are kept by 93 different officials in 93 counties, many of whom still keep paper records and then send error-riddled reports to the state. Reporters Yanqi Xu and Destiny Herbers spent weeks fact-checking the data, ultimately getting it into a format that was both accurate and user friendly. They then took up another Herculean reporting task: Finding out who is behind generic-named LLCs that often list as their address a PO Box in a random state. After weeks more of work, they were remarkably successful at tracing these LLCs back to corporate farms, hedge funds and billionaire buyers.
These data collection efforts, which came before the traditional reporting process, are the only reason the project exists. And these efforts are the sole reason that Nebraskans have access to this information for the first time in state history.","The data we used was requested from Nebraska's Department of Revenue, but records were intitally entered by individual county assessors, creating inconsistencies that we used multiple tools to resolve. We used Posit Cloud to collaborate on processing the intitial data with R and Tidyverse, then cleaned buyer names with OpenRefine's facet and cluster functions. We requested additional address information for buyers and joined it to the original csv to help identify individual buyers who appeared under multiple names attached to the same address, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Once the data was cleaned and the sale records were combined under buyer names, we exported to Google Sheets to manually enter additional information for the front-facing top buyer lists and used pivot tables to analyze the top buyers. We created dynamic data visualizations for individual stories with Flourish, and also used Flourish to display searchable tables of the top buyer lists within the series.","A couple lessons: 1. Journalism like this pulls back the curtain on income inequality, using data to show in this case the accumulation of land in fewer and fewer hands makes it harder for even middle-class farm families to acquire it, farm it and pass it on to their children. It was a ""show don't tell moment"" for our newsroom.
2. There are incredible untold stories in the most rural places on any continent. You can't throw a reporter's notebook without hitting a journalist in Washington DC. The vast stretches of empy land in Nebraska held an incredible story that no one had previously tried to tell.
3. With time and effort, thorny problems -- reasons to not do a project -- can be solved. We also didn't let the perfect be the enemy of good on anaylsis of the land sales. (For example, eliminating one smaller category of sales because the data was simply too error-ridden, and then explaining that decision where applicable.)
4. Every city and statewide publication should be doing a similar story for who is buying up property in their locale, and why.",English,https://flatwaterfreepress.org/whos-buying-nebraska-corporations-investors-grabbing-giant-chunks-of-nebraska-farmland/,https://flatwaterfreepress.org/whos-buying-nebraska-top-farmland-buyers-by-money-and-land/,https://flatwaterfreepress.org/whos-buying-nebraska-after-shopping-spree-mormon-church-is-top-land-purchaser/,https://flatwaterfreepress.org/spilling-bills-beans-tech-billionaire-spent-113-million-on-nebraska-farmland/,,,,"Yanqi Xu, Destiny Herbers, Evelyn Mejia","Yanqi Xu, senior reporter, Flatwater Free Press.

Brazil,Gênero e Número,Small,,,5 gráficos para entender o racismo estrutural no Brasil,20/11/2023,"Chart, Human rights","Google Sheets, CSV, R, Adobe Illustrator, Scrollama","A reportagem visual traz cinco gráficos para entender o racismo estrutural no Brasil a partir da representação das desigualdades nas áreas de educação, trabalho, violência, saúde e política. 

O projeto conta com uma linha do tempo, que mostra que ⅔ da história brasileira transcorreram sob regime escravocrata, e marcos temporais - como leis e políticas públicas de reparação e inclusão - para mostrar a persistência do racismo 135 anos após o fim da escravidão e o tempo transcorrido entre a instauração do regime e as primeiras ações do Estado para reparar as desigualdades que ele criou.","A reportagem visual foi publicada no dia 20 de novembro, data na qual o Brasil comemora o Dia da Consciência Negra, e serviu de referência para o debate público sobre desigualdades raciais ao graficar o racismo no Brasil.

O trabalho foi citado como referência na newsletter Nos Eixos, do Jornal Nexo, uma das principais publicações mensais sobre visualização de dados no Brasil.","Há 135 anos, a escravidão foi abolida no Brasil, mas o racismo não. Até hoje, ele persiste e define os lugares que pessoas negras podem e não podem acessar na sociedade com base na sua raça. 

A partir do conceito de racismo estrutural, definido pelo atual ministro de Direitos Humanos e Cidadania, Silvio de Almeida, como “a desigualdade racial como característica da sociedade e não apenas ação isolada de pessoas e instituições racistas”, comparamos dados públicos mais recentes de educação, trabalho, violência, saúde e política.

As cinco áreas foram escolhidas porque são representativas do acesso a garantias constitucionais, que indicam o exercício pleno da cidadania. Em um país onde negros representam 56% da população, os dados indicam que essa população está sobrerrepresentada entre vítimas de violência policial e na populaçao carcerária, mas subrrepresentada entre pessoas com acesso ao ensino superior e entre eleitos para o Congresso Nacional e para os cargos executivos estaduais.","As análises das bases de dados da Pesquisa Nacional de Amostra Domiciliar (PNAD) Contínua de 2022 foram realizadas no software R com os pacotes “PNADcIBGE” e “survey”, que possibilitam uma investigação direcionada da pesquisa mantendo as suas características amostrais.

Os dados de saúde foram retirados da base do Sinan e compilados utilizando a linguagem de programação R. Os dados de violência foram coletados do Anuário Brasileiro de Segurança Pública de 2023 e os das eleições de 2022 foram coletados no site do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE).

A visualização de dados foi feita com o programa Adobe Illustrator e sua adaptação para a web através do script open-source ai2html do New York Times, que converte arquivos do illustrator para formatos HTML e CSS.

Russian Federation,Mediazona,Small,,,Endless SHIZO. Have a look at the conditions of Alexei Navalny’s solitary confinement,02/06/2023,"Illustration, Infographics, Human rights","VR, 3D modeling, AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Three.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been imprisoned for three years now. And he spent nearly 300 days of this term in SHIZO, the punishment isolation cell, which is the most severe form of legal punishment for inmates in Russian prisons. A concrete sack devoid of sunlight and fresh air, it cloaks prisoners in a regime of stringent prohibitions. To shed light on this form of torment, we have compiled a guide covering all of Navalny’s SHIZO terms. We’ve also created a simulator that offers readers a vivid insight into Navalny’s SHIZO cell environment—available on the web and via VR.","Multiple stints in solitary confinement are internationally recognized as torture. In Russia, more and more political prisoners find themselves subjected to this treatment. We created an immersive experience which allows users to become witnesses of this torture—on the example of the most famous and influential political prisoner in modern Russia. The project reached hundreds of thousands of our followers and earned praise from colleagues in the media. Released in the summer of 2023, it’s constantly updated, as Alexei Navalny is punished with SHIZO over and over again.","Mediazona has been writing about Alexei Navalny and other political prisoners for a long time now. Our publication was founded in 2014 and since the start has been devoted to coverage of human rights issues in the penitentiary system. Before the “Endless SHIZO” project, we only described isolation cells with words, never showed them or tried to recreate the experience of a person who is placed there.
We strongly believe our immersive work helped to show what a SHIZO looks and feels like, by literally placing our audience in these horrific conditions.","We used Blender v3 to create the 3D-model of the cell. We also used textures generated in Stable Diffusion 2.0 and commercial PBR materials from textures.com, as well as assets from 3DBabylon.com and sounds from free audio libraries. After that, we exported the project into a gltf format to embed it on the website with the Three.js library. We are very proud of our optimization model, which takes up just 15 Mb and works on all types of devices.
In order for the project to work in VR, we used the capabilities of Three.js and created our own controls.",The SHIZO project taught us that immersive experiences are a very powerful way to interact with our audience.

United States of America,CNN,Big,,,Britain's Shadowy Border,31/07/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Immigration","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Python, Deck GL, Figma","As security has tightened around rail and road crossings to the United Kingdom, the Channel between the UK and France has become a more common route for migrants desperate for a better life. It is a perilous journey. CNN analyzed how one deadly incident on December 14, 2022 unfolded, drawing on flight and ship-tracking data, official records from authorities, a distress call and interviews at the scene. The UK government owns AI technology said to be capable of swiftly detecting these boats and even deploying life rafts. But it was a passing fishing crew that saved nearly everyone on board.","The UK government has invested in high-tech surveillance for the English Channel. But as the number of small boats arriving on UK shores continues to rise, it’s not clear whether this expensive AI technology is effective either in detecting the boats or in helping save the lives of those on board when they sink. When a small boat packed with migrants capsized last December, leaving four dead, it was a fishing crew that came to the rescue.

This piece explores one facet of a global trend in using AI technology to digitize border security. The mapping starts out with a snapshot of the frequency and type of UK channel boat crossings. That same map transitions to show the depth of UK surveillance. And then delves into one investigation of a perilous Channel journey that resulted in loss of life. Additionally, this piece shines a light on a topic that has high public interest.","Asylum seekers crossing the English Channel in small boats have been the focus of intense anti-migrant rhetoric. The UK government vowed to crack down on these journeys and invested in AI technology to detect boats. CNN used various data sources to investigate the UK’s surveillance of the waterway, including MarineTraffic, OpenSky and Flight Radar. All are free platforms showing sea and air traffic. The piece also explored the increased use of AI in border security. We examined AI drones and AI cameras stationed along the British coastline and established their surveillance ranges and tracking routes. This demonstrated the UK government’s capability to spot boats, and therefore notice when they were in distress. However, CNN’s investigation found that they did not always deploy this technology to save migrants. The UK government and the AI companies did not share details on how the technology is used due to the confidential nature of government contracts. Neither disclosed whether the technology operated in the English Channel during a fatal incident involving a migrant boat in December 2022. Therefore, public data was crucial in determining that the UK government had the technology to detect and potentially save the boat in distress, but did not.","For this custom-built interactive feature, we used Svelte as the javascript framework for the entire piece. We used Python for data analysis of the Marine traffic fishing data,
which we visualized via mapping, using a combination of QGIS, Adobe Illustrator, MapBox and DeckGL. The overall responsive user experience was designed using Figma, where we employed a bold visual design language to convey the hard reporting style of the investigation, giving it strong visual impact on the page. At the top we created a dramatic entry point, using a powerful video of a boat full of migrants trying to make the dangerous crossing, paired with text appearing sentence by sentence to focus the reader’s attention. In terms of storytelling techniques, we harnessed scrolly-telling to deliver digestible bite-sized chunks of information to our readers, paired with the beautiful data visualizations, mapping, and motion elements, all of which allowed them to immerse themselves, whilst having full control over their reading experience.","The intersection of different public data sources can sometimes lead to original findings. While there was little transparency on the part of governmental agencies in terms of how this technology operated, flight and marine traffic sites revealed when and where rescue operations had been undertaken. The data also revealed that an AI drone had on previous patrols flown over the exact area where the boat had sunk, but was not deployed at the time of the incident. The absolute power of data journalism and visualization. This story wouldn’t have been possible without the ability to analyze multiple, complex data sets, and visualize them to identify these key findings and patterns which served as lynch pins for this story.",English,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/07/uk/migrant-crossings-ai-small-boats/,,,,,,,"oReporters: Katie Polglase, Livvy Doherty

Проект рассказывает о личных данных похороненных, а также регионах, где они жили перед вербовкой на войну, а также описывает практику захоронения погибших бойцов властями Новосибирской области и руководством ЧВК ""Вагнер"".","Проект был опубликован в период, когда власти Новосибирска [столкнулись](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/6312703https://) с нехваткой мест на городских общественных кладбищах. 

Материал показал, что на одном из крупнейших кладбищ города, Гусинобродском, сектор на примерно 370 захоронений был отдан под тела погибших бойцов ЧВК ""Вагнер"", что, очевидно, повлияло на общий дефицит мест на территории муниципалитета. 

Также этот проект показал, что в более чем десятке случаев родственники захороненных бойцов не знали об их месте погребения — один из интерактивных элементов материала позволяет найти имя своего родственника в случае его пропажи.","Этот проект стал возможен благодаря банку данных муниципальной системы общественных кладбищ Новосибирска ""Ритуал"". 

Однако эта система не адаптирована под автоматический скрейпинг, поэтому для исследования данные приходились собирать вручную, проверяя упоминание каждого захоронения по другим, ранее доступным базам данных (судебная система, социальные сети и другие).","Ручной сбор данных с [интерактивной карты](https://map.novo-sibirsk.ru/) кладбищ Новосибирска, анализ и проверка данных в Google Sheets, финальная визуаилация данных в онлайн-сервисах Flourish и Datawrapper.","Журналисты могут обратить внимание, что в некоторых случаях стоит внимательно обращать внимание на данные, которые хранят локальные органы власти, чтобы рассказывать об историях федерального масштаба",Русский язык,https://www.sibreal.org/a/gde-horonyat-vagnerovtsev-kotoryh-ne-zabrali-rodnye/32658821.html,https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/15182476/,,,,,,"Егор Федоров, Алексей Смирнов (псевдоним)","Над проектом работала команда журналистов из Сибири, которые несколько лет занимаются освещением общественно-политических событий в регионах востока России."

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,,,Bienvenue au rayon des formats réduits,30/05/2023,"Explainer, Database, Crowdsourcing, Economy","Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","As the cost of what’s in our grocery store cart grows, the products themselves are shrinking. This is what we know now as shrinkflation. We have identified dozens of products whose format has declined over the years. Our main project is the first and only database of shrinkflation in Canada. This crowdsourcing project is part of a vast file on shrinkflation, broken down into almost a dozen additional articles to allow readers to better understand the phenomenon and grasp its extent across the country.","Our crowdsourcing project was a success: we received more than 350 emails from readers, submitting us examples, sharing observations on the phenomenon or even sending us suggestions for themes to push our file further away. More than 600 examples of products were also submitted via an online form. The file was so far-reaching that some of it was even translated into English by CBC. Other media also picked it up. It also benefited from great visibility on radio and television for a digital piece. Our file also made it possible, with its complementary articles, to expose other issues associated with shrinkflation: foods which become taxable in a smaller size and overpackaging, or misleading packaging, sometimes also associated with shrinkflation. It also revealed a new aspect of the phenomenon: skimpflation, when companies reduce the quality of their products, rather than the size, but also to save costs. A few months after the deployment of all of our articles, the Canadian government even announced that it would strengthen the capacity for action of the Office of Consumer Affairs, with a Working Group on grocery stores responsible in particular for ''highlighting practices harmful to consumers'', such as ''shrinkflation'' and ''skimpflation''.","Before our publication, there was no database on shrinkflation in Canada. The extent of the phenomenon was therefore impossible to measure. There are no reliable surveys on which to base ourselves and the examples found here and there on the Internet or social networks are anecdotal and cannot, except in a few rare cases, be considered as reliable evidence. The idea of measuring the extent of the practice, and the absence of data to do so, pushed us to begin our own data collection. But we quickly face the scale of the task, with the tens of thousands of food products sitting on store shelves. There is not even a database establishing the total number of food products for sale in Canada (which also differ from one province to another), nor is there a record of sizing changes these products may have undergone over time. Shrinkflation is not monitored, nor is there any oversight from any authority, despite its impact on our wallet or even health. Experts say there's a need for a review, to hold manufacturers, which show no transparency in this matter, accountable, but above all to protect consumers.","Without data, and realizing what it would take to collect them ourselves, we opted for a crowdsourcing project, asking readers to send us products which, according to them, met the definition of shrinkflation. They could do it through a Google form, simple to fill out, but they also had the option to write to us, or send us photos, by email. By leading us on the trail of specific products, and adding some specific information (new and old sizes, for examples), we then just had to carry out the necessary checks before adding them to the database. We went through old flyers and web archives and cross-checked everything using textual archives or data harvesting. All companies were contacted to validate the information and allow them to explain their decision. Everything was then presented in the form of an interactive database, with cards presenting the information (image, year, name, brand and reduction) for each of the products. The database could look like an online grocery shopping site, also allowing reading to filter products by category. Otherwise they are presented according to the most recent products added.","Shrinkflation resonates strongly with the public: everyone shops for groceries and notices price increases. Many articles have looked at this commercial practice over the years, but without addressing the heart of the problem: the real scale of the phenomenon and the lack of monitoring. This is not surprising given that reliable data on the subject was not available and that companies that engage in it often lack transparency. However, sometimes, the absence of data is a subject in itself. Alternatively, it may be sufficient to see how it would be possible to access or obtain data, with crowdsourcing, for example, in order to create one's own database to quantify, if not at least document, a phenomenon that is increasing in Canada. It is precisely to fill this void that the Canadian government announced new measures after the publication of our database and some of the additional articles of our file.",French and English,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/reduflation/base-donnees-produits-aliments-epicerie-formats-taxes/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/reduflation/en-produits-epicerie-aliments-encadrement-surveillance-donnees-impact-facture-portefeuille/,https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/news/2023/10/minister-champagne-reports-on-the-initial-commitments-from-the-five-largest-grocers-to-stabilize-food-prices.html,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/reduflation/dequaliflation-qualite-produits-aliments-ingredients-recette/,,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier journaliste, Melanie Julien cheffe de pupitre, Anis Belabbas et Francis Lamontagne designers, Josselin Pfeuffer illustrateur, André Guimaraes et Mathieu St-Laurent développeurs, Martine Roy coordonnatrice et Danielle Jazzar réviseure linguistique","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Based on innovative pop culture data analysis techniques by Hickey and containing over 100 charts and data visualizations from illustrator Heather Jones, the book argues that pop culture can change viewer's physiology and psychology, can produce all sorts of societal and individual changes in viewers, and can have ramifications across the world.","The book, released in October 2023, was a top-selling item in television, film, and pop culture books upon release, and gained positive reviews from Publisher's Weekly and Vox and excerpts in Polygon and Business Insider. The book also gained starred reviews from Library Journal and Book Page. Beyond the positive reception for the book, it's inspired conversation about the intersection of pop culture coverage and data journalism, and much of the data collected and created for the book is being published for use in academic and journalistic settings.","The book was the result of years of research and reporting, speaking to scores of researchers from around the world from a vast variety of fields, from astrobiology to paleontology, from medical vision research to polling. It approaches a vastly under-analyzed segment in the world of data journalism — pop culture and entertainment — and makes the argument that it is vital for more effort to be made in coverage given how meaningful it actually is to readers. 

Additionally, it involved a significant amount of data collection from unconventional sources necessitated by its subject matter. Pop culture journalists lack the established databases, government research, and financial data streams utilized by peers on other desks, and this book pursued exciting and innovative data sources to fuel its work.

The book is furthermore the result of an utter dedication to data visualization, and is one of the most data visualization-heavy nonfiction books ever produced. 

A number of innovative reporting and data collection techniques were pursued in the development of the book, including measurements of galvanic skin response, eye-tracking technology, and more. These techniques and the success of their implementation will hopefully serve as an inspiration for future work in our field.","This book relied on a vast variety of innovative and cutting-edge data collection and analysis techniques. 

Unique data collection techniques were employed by the author, including galvanic skin response (GSR), eye-tracking. Data was collected and interpreted from a wide variety of unconventional resources, including theme park wait time databases, simulations of Pokemon battles, online Fandom Wikias, British Honours records, airport arrivals, corporate financial statements, polling, wrestling databases, and the Congressional record. Scientific and academic research that collected data through mass spectrometer analysis of air chemistry, blood work, fanfiction databases, internal Pentagon documents obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests, crime data and more was adapted into graphics. 

The data was interpreted through many standard techniques — Excel, Python and R, predominantly — and was adapted into graphics through tech like colored pens and paper, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Creative Suite including InDesign, Illustrator, and After Effects.

This book strove to break new ground in data sourcing, given the unique difficulties in working with pop culture-related data.","This book aims to inspire cultural journalists to pursue more data-driven and visual-driven methods to their work, and to develop new and compelling ways to use the tools of data journalism to explore entertainment and movie projects. 

Beyond that, the book integrates cutting-edge scientific techniques including novel eye-tracking technology and galvanic skin response measurements that other journalists may take inspiration from for additional work in this and other fields. The data used to produce the book will be published online.

More broadly, it is a call to action for journalists and data journalists in particular to see pop culture and entertainment journalism not as a diversion but a necessary, highly sought-after and fertile subject area, where overcoming the impediment of data access can lead to fascinating and compelling work that readers truly care about. Moreover, given the amount of time that readers spend caring about and consuming pop culture, it's furthermore a worthwhile and necessary goal to cover it to the level it ought to be.","Forthcoming translations into Traditional Chinese, Russian, more to come.",https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cikrg2qz8c7fnwtkwv5z6/You-Are-What-You-Watch.Pdf?rlkey=135gkvz98v5myqd5ambqfxs9v&amp;dl=0,https://www.flipsnack.com/artisanbooks2/you-are-what-you-watch-galley.html,,,,,,"Walt Hickey, author

By demonstrating data on the performance of unpaid work in Brazil, the research provides an overview of the time dedicated to carrying out care activities, household chores, voluntary work and production for one's own consumption.
The data highlighted in the post point out some of the main differences in dedication to these jobs by gender, color or race, age group and region of the country.","The issue of ""invisible work"", which is unpaid and is often not even seen by those who do not perform it, is increasingly part of the public agenda, especially regarding domestic chores and personal care, which tend to fall more on the shoulders of women than of men.
This post gives visibility to data from the main IBGE survey on work and income (PNAD Contínua), which elucidates the issue of unpaid work, based on the time dedicated to carrying out these activities by people aged 14 or over in the country.
Among the social networks on which IBGE published the post, the greatest reach was on Instagram (14,500 accounts reached and 1,760 interactions on the first day - 08/23/23).
With the ENEM (National Secondary Education Examination), in November, the subject of unpaid work gained even more relevance in the public debate, as it was the topic requested in the essay of the test, including the citation of a previous edition of PNAD Contínua in the reference materials for preparing the writing.
From this new highlight, our post on Instagram started to resonate again, having currently (01/17/24) a reach of 24,600 accounts and 4,125 interactions.","It may seem like a simple job, but for most of IBGE's surveys we don't have the chance to prepare posts that explore the data obtained, while presenting them with a visual appeal purposely aimed at drawing attention to the topics covered.

Netherlands,Pointer (investigative platform) of KRO-NCRV (Dutch public broadcaster),Big,,,"Ongehoord Nieuws: vooringenomen, onjuist en doorspekt met complottheorieën",24/04/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Fact-checking, Video, Audio, Immigration, Covid 19","R, RStudio","The TV program ""Ongehoord Nieuws"" (by Omroep ON!) has been airing on public television since the beginning of 2022. Even before the first broadcast, there was a lot of discussion about how this new broadcasting organization would shape its journalistic programming. And after about 80 episodes, it became clear that all the concerns beforehand were justified: ""Ongehoord Nieuws"" systematically spreads false and biased information, and in some cases, unfounded and harmful conspiracy theories. We have investigated this through data analysis of all subtitle files, facial analysis, and interviews with former employees.","Metrics: the investigation was well read: nearly 23k readers, and over 44k visitors who stayed on the page for 3 minutes on average which is quite long compared to our other publications. The story was news in many other nationwide media such as newspapers, both in the Netherlands and in Flanders.
It was well received in particular by fellow journalists who praised the publication for its level of detail. Readers felt that they finally had an overview of Ongehoord Nieuws that surpassed the anecdotal criticism that was written about the organization up till then.","During the period in which we conducted our research, the broadcaster Ongehoord Nederland (ON!) that produces the program was under heavy scrutiny of both the public and the Ombudsman of the Dutch public broadcasting companies. Just before the start of our work Ongehoord Nieuws aired an episode of their show about so called 'white racism' in which they showed videos of violence perpetrated by people of color against white people, stating that this violence was driven by racism directed at white people. Outrage among the public ensued. Factually the reporting was incorrect, as Pointer showed by factchecking these videos and their origin in a seperate publication.
But of even more importance was the sudden participation of a biased, untruthful, and misinformation ridden 'news outlet' in the, up till 2022, quite pristine Dutch media landscape. Having a news show like Ongehoord Nieuws on Dutch public television was seen as a typical example of how the post truth era also contaminates the media and had been considered impossible for a long time. 
As employees of a fellow broadcaster, researching the intentions and work of our 'colleagues' was hard, and we were 'bashed' on some of ON!'s online publications and tv shows.","We used facial recognition techniques in order to identify which politicians were invited most and to be able to see if there was a preference for a certain political color of the guests of the show. We concluded that 90% of 'politician screentime' was taken by far right politicians.
We also used text mining on the subtitles of the 80 episodes of the program. Firstly to understand which themes were important for the makers of Ongehoord Nieuws and later in our investigation to find which subjects, misinformation and conspiracy theories, connected to these themes, were mentioned. Effectively, we just counted all these instances, analysed the data using RStudio. Through this we were able to say in how many of the episodes certain themes were adressed, how many times they referred to the World Economic Forum for instance. Analysis of the subtitles also gave us the opportunity to see exactly which video fragments we could use in our publication.","Through our 'verantwoording' (a step by step explanation of our project, see project link 2) journalists are made aware of the possibilities of analysing spoken media by using subtitles. Our way of investigating minimizes the risk of cherry picking when criticizing another media outlet. We were not just slinging mud over two or three bad cases of reporting, we analyzed the full picture, giving our subject hardly any opportunity to acuse us of predilection. 
Also, the way we visualized our story is a rare form of reporting. Though supported by an all-encompassing data-analysis, all episodes of the first year of this program were taken into account, the final product is an anthology. We enriched our publication with fragments from their broadcasts to make the data tangible to our readers.",Dutch,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/ongehoord-nieuws-vooringenomen-onjuist-en-doorspekt-met-complottheorieen#/,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/zo-hebben-we-misinformatie-en-complotten-ontdekt-in-de-ondertitels-van-ongehoord-nieuws,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/geert-dales-kaapte-uitzending-van-ongehoord-nieuws-om-complottheorie-over-omvolking-kritisch-te,https://drive.google.com/file/d/18Q61HPoFb57rAsFy5AZBT20mpU7Z3Iz4/view?usp=sharing,,,,"Jerry Vermanen, Thomas Mulder, Peter Keizer, Eva Meesterberends (journalists), Wendy van der Waal (designer), Heleen Emanuel, Marije Rooze, Els Engel (developers), Sietze van Loosdregt (editor)","Jerry Vermanen initiated the project.

Não optando por uma linguagem alarmista sobre as alterações climáticas, é, também, na nossa opinião, um exemplo de como o scrollytelling e a personalização de narrativas por via dos dados pode ter uma força muito grande para comunicar temas complexos como este.","O trabalho foi especialmente desafiador dadas as circunstâncias em que aconteceu. Em 2023 a equipa de dados do jornal PÚBLICO passou a ser composta por dois jornalistas de dados: Rui Barros, com sete anos de experiência em jornalismo de dados; e José Volta e Pinto, que, tendo bastante experiência com análise de dados com recurso ao Excel, não tinha muita experiência em desenvolvimento web. O trabalho foi planeado pelos dois jornalistas mas, poucos dias depois, Rui Barros teve um problema de saúde, tendo ficado duas semanas de baixa. Este foi, por isso, o primeiro trabalho que o membro da equipa mais júnior teve de fazer todo sozinho. Foi um desafio gigante, não só pela sua inexperiência, mas também porque estava a recorrer a uma base de código que tinha sido desenvolvida pelo outro membro da equipa - e que nos ensinou a importância de ter documentação escrita, mesmo em equipas de dados pequenas.","Depois de seleccionar os temas que a equipa considerou essenciais, a recolha e limpeza de dados foi feita através de recurso à linguagem de programação R. Já o desenvolvimento web foi feito com recurso a Svelte e a uma biblioteca de componentes desenvolvida dentro da equipa, o Tangram.","Há duas grandes lições que, acreditamos, outras equipas de dados podem aprender com este projecto: a primeira é que os dados continuam a ter esta incrível e fascinante capacidade de tornar uma história genérica numa história que o leitor sente que foi feita para ele. Isso transforma por completo uma história, principalmente se o jornalista tiver a capacidade de dar também o contexto geral (mesmo que estas narrativas sejam bastante complexas devido à necessidade de considerar todos os edge cases).
A segunda lição tem a ver com as circunstâncias descritas acima: é fácil planear o futuro sem prever a existência de imprevistos. Mas quando tendemos a ter conhecimento, know how ou simplesmente “como as coisas funcionam” apenas na cabeça de uma pessoa, há um grande risco de um trabalho ter que ir para o lixo apenas porque essa cabeça não está disponível naquele momento.",português,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/como-clima-planeta-nasceu/,,,,,,,"José Volta e Pinto, Rui Barros e José Alves (ilustração)","José Volta e Pinto: licenciado em Ciências da Comunicação, depois de uma breve passagem por engenharia, entrou em 2020 para a secção de Online do jornal Público.

Germany,"Dekoder-gGmbH (Germany), Novaya Gazeta Europe (Latvia)",Big,,,In Propaganda’s Web,19/12/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Infographics, Politics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Natural language processing","Why do Russians support the war against Ukraine and what role does Russian propaganda play in this? This was the central question of the data-driven project that analysed over 3 million articles by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. The research focused on contextual paragraphs, known as “boilerplates”, that the Russian state media uses to frame world events in a specific light, namely by creating an image of Ukraine as the enemy. By using data-based storytelling, we show how propaganda has been preparing Russians for the war since 2014 — and the methods it used to adapt to the changing reality.","The project was successful for both media outlets involved. In terms of clicks, together we reached over 30,000 people in the first three weeks (in equal measure for the German and Russian versions, we only recently published the English version). We have received a lot of positive feedback from the journalistic and scientific community, both for the text and its content as well as for its structure.

Our rather risky use of Graph, a form of visualisation that is rarely used in journalism, paid off too. “Graphics display an appreciation for the scale of the propaganda machine,” as one of our readers put it. 

The reviews are already in from our readers: “Impressive research, finely prepared”, “absolutely superbly done”, “incredibly good design“, “an excellent example of data journalism”. 

What is more, we even got feedback from RIA Novosti itself: the head of RT, a RIA-affiliated propaganda outlet, Margarita Simonyan, shared our research on her social media, adding “We're on the right track, team!”. Well, we seem to have hit a nerve. We will shortly be investigating whether our publication also had an influence on the work of RIA Novosti.","Although the initial goal of the project was to publish our results, it has turned into something more. As we worked on the project, we — at times by trial and error — 
- developed a methodology for decoding propaganda media 
- collected and pre-analysed a lot of data that can be used in further projects that we have planned for this year.
We have also consulted with research institutes specialising in disinformation in the sphere of political communication (especially in Germany). Our lively communication and exchange of data resulted in the creation of an informal working group that goes beyond journalism, combining it with academic expertise. So: stay tuned.","First, we scraped over 3 million articles published 2002-2023 from the RIA Novosti website by building a custom Java application.
To preprocess data for further analysis, we used NLP methods to tokenise, normalise and extract sentences with NLTK, MyStem and Natasha Python modules.
As we discovered a pattern of using specific sentences, we began to develop a methodology to combine variants of the same sentences into nests. Here we employed two approaches: we used the Levenshtein edit distance for basic copy-paste detection, along with the DBSCAN algorithm for more advanced clustering. This allowed us to reduce the DB, which remained significant in size. Having set a frequency threshold, we prepared a set of a thousand nests containing thousands of sentences, interconnecting tens of thousands of texts.
To carry out qualitative analysis, we used thematic modelling methods, complemented by manual labelling of sentences. We then analysed the sentences by date, quality and degree of connection, metadata and auxiliary clustering results. We also used Gephy to study the network and created several tools to visualise data for network analysis with D3.js.
We chose scrollytelling to present our results, mainly using the JavaScript force-graph library and D3.js.","We have singled out three main conclusions that we came to after completing our project.
1. Be patient and delve deeper into the data. For RIA, the cases of fake news are obvious, but it took us a long time to recognise a pattern. We spent the first few months working on a hypothesis — propaganda militarises Russian society — which we wanted to test using computer linguistic methods. A lot of time and effort came to nothing, as this hypothesis was not confirmed. But as we carried on, we discovered context paragraphs and revealed a pattern that explains how propaganda works. 
2. Visualisation is an important tool that helps bring complex analysis and methodology to light in a fun and engaging way. It’s important to invest resources in writing a cohesive story to accompany the data.
3. Most importantly, our research has shown that the main instrument of propaganda is a drastic reduction in the complexity of information. It not only leads to a reduction in social discourse, but also to the degradation of a society. What we have learnt is that journalists should by no means reduce complexity, but instead look for a language to talk about complex things.","English, German, Russian",https://specials.dekoder.org/en/propaganda/in-propagandas-web/,https://specials.dekoder.org/ru/propaganda/v-seti-propagandy/,https://specials.dekoder.org/de/propaganda/im-netz-der-propaganda/,https://specials.dekoder.org/de/propaganda/frequenzen/,,,,"Text: Leonid Klimov (dekoder), Katya Lakova (Novaya Gazeta Europe)

United States of America,"LAist, APM Research Lab, The California Newsroom",Big,,,California Nursing Homes Are Becoming 'De Facto Mental Health Centers',20/09/2023,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration",Coding in R studio and the mapping platform,"In September 2023, LAist, APM Research Lab, and The California Newsroom co-published the article California Nursing Homes Are Becoming ‘De Facto Mental Health Centers’ after a months-long investigation. The article found the state may be in violation of federal law, revealing the number of residents with serious mental illness (SMI) in California nursing homes and demonstrating the dangers to residents with SMI and the broader impact on health care quality and access.","Within a week of publication, our investigation in California drew more than 30,000 pageviews, and an associated Instagram post reached more than 400,000 people (about half the population of Delaware). Both are well above the interest levels typically generated by stories or posts by either LAist, APM Research Lab, or The California Newsroom. 

Additional impact includes: 

The office of Assembly Member Jim Wood, Chair of the 2nd Assembly’s Health Committee in California, reported that they have read the story with interest and are asking questions of the oversight committee. Toby Ewing, executive director of the state’s Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission, told us about our data findings: ""You've done more work on this probably than the state of California has done,” and that the state should be tracking this information. 

Disability rights advocates said the story shed important light on how the mental health care system has failed Californians and informed us that the story was spreading in their network. 

The San Diego public radio station KPBS is interested in building on our work; we met with them to explain more about what we found and have shared our data with them.","Researchers we spoke with were surprised that we were given this data via public records request. For them to access, it generally requires payment and a signed data use agreement, neither of which we were subjected to. It was also a new (to us) challenge to figure out how to parse, load in, and otherwise work with the data given its 35GB size once unzipped, as well as to understand the data fully enough to analyze it. 

Another challenge came when files from CMS that we received had not been cleaned. It took over a month and several communications back-and-forth to explain the duplicated data that we found and how we found it before we received a clean dataset again. (We could not clean it ourselves while ensuring accuracy.) 

As far as we know, we came up with a new method for creating a ‘census’ of patients on a given day using just the MDS data. The main researcher we consulted with on our methods said that typically researchers use the MDS data in concert with another dataset.","We used the Minimum Data Set (MDS) from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) as our source, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. The data we received covered the years 2013 through 2022. The MDS is based on information CMS receives from nursing homes eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. We used the MDS data to analyze the approximately 1,140 California skilled nursing facilities (nursing homes) appearing in records and that are not certified by the state as ""special treatment programs"" (STPs) for residents with psychiatric care needs. We also joined this data with data from the state regarding citations and fines handed to facilities. 

We used R/RStudio to open, clean, analyze, and map the data. We used Flourish to create the other graphics and the interactive lookup tool. The map and lookup tool in particular allow Californians to know whether a nursing facility that they or their loved ones are considering, or are already a resident of, is caring for a high percentage of people with serious mental illness.","Other journalists could request the MDS via FOIA and use the code we published to replicate this analysis in other states or use our method and code as a starting point for looking at other variables and asking different questions. There are over 800 variables in the MDS for each patient’s assessment; we only used a few dozen in our reporting, so there is an endless amount of data analysis and reporting that could be generated from further use of the MDS.",English,https://laist.com/news/specials/mental-illness-nursing-homes-california-what-we-found,https://laist.com/news/specials/mental-illness-nursing-homes-investigation-how-we-reported,https://laist.com/news/specials/california-nursing-homes-are-warehousing-people-with-serious-mental-illness-experts-say,,,,,"**LAist**

How much Russia earns from the Ukrainian land,22/11/2023,"Investigation, OSINT, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Agriculture","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Python, ai2html, Satellite imagery","During the two years of the full-scale invasion, Russia has managed to harvest more than 10 million tons of wheat from the occupied territories. This is roughly equal to the annual output of an entire country, such a as Romania. TEXTY tells how the aggressor country steals grain and to whom Russia sells it. 
We used data from agriculture business and combined it with the information from open sources. It formed the basis for AI models training. Satelite images helped us to determine the areas of fields of different crops and find out how many crops were stolen by Russia.","The project got sensational effect in Ukraine, due to two factors: (1) the investigation was done by Ukrainian media with its own methodologybased on satelite imagery, (2) figures on stolen grain are supported by visualisation that clearly shows which fields were occupied and how the frontline makes tillage impossible. Several Ukrainian mainstream media made news on the project (at least 16), as well international community was interested in project (at least 13 in English and Spanish detected).

Significant impact done on **agriculture community** in Ukraine: many assosiations and business journals made publications.

Key project results [were published](https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/local-economist-ukraine-country-office-monthly-economic-bulletin-research-assessment-and-monitoring-november-2023) in the **UN World Food Program** Monthly Economic Bulletin.

The project got significant audience engagement in **social media** - about 140,000 mainly in Facebook and Twitter.

Also **professional community** noted the publication: GIJNetwork named among best projects of Nov,23; Ukrainian StratcomCener made publication in Twitter, other journalists marked and reposted the project.","NASA experts, [according to Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-21/ukraine-crops-in-russia-occupied-territory-are-hard-to-forecast), mostly confirmed our estimates of grain stolen by Russians in Ukraine for 2023: NASA - 6.4 million tons of grain and 1.5 million tons of sunflower, TEXTY - 4.6 mln and 2 mln respectively. For 2022: 5.86 mln and 1.68 mln, TEXTY - 6.46 mln and 2.34 mln respectively.","Agriculture companies use satellite imagery and machine learning to remotely identify the boundaries of fields and the crops grown on them. One of them provided the data on wheat, sunflower, and maize acreage in the occupied territories of Ukraine to us. These three crops are the most widely grown in Ukraine at all. 

The data was combined with the information from open sources. Taking together, it formed the basis for AI models training. The algorithm requires pre-processing of satellite data to work correctly: increasing the spatial resolution of raw images, detecting clouds, and accurately determining the growing seasons for each specific region around the world.

As a result TEXTY developed maps which show in colour the planted areas for 2021, 2022, and 2023 in the government-controlled and occupied territories of Ukraine for maize, sunflower, and wheat. Based on the maps after consultations with specialists and finding data from market and exchange TEXTY calculated estimated income. 
The second partof the investigation was to detect how occupational authorities moved grain out of Ukrainian territorries to sell. We noted that satellite imagery regularly shows huge accumulations of grain trucks near grain terminals in Sevastopol and Kerch in occupied Crimea.","Satelite imagery provides huge amount of data, wich could be used by investigative journalism. This is not something new in journalism. But cooperation with business, in our case - with agriculture assosiations, could give significantly more information for investigators.

A reportagem visitou pontos de grande fluxo de pessoas na Avenida Paulista - a principal da cidade - e nas imediações para medir a temperatura ambiente e a umidade relativa do ar.","A reportagem teve um impacto significativo na conscientização pública sobre os impactos do calor extremo no nosso dia a dia. Os dados coletados pela reportagem mostraram de forma clara e objetiva como o calor pode afetar a vida das pessoas, especialmente em áreas urbanas e densamente populosas.

Os dados coletados pela própria equipe mostraram que o calor extremo está se tornando mais frequente em São Paulo, uma tendência que está sendo observada em todo o mundo. 

Um outro aspecto de destaque é o fato dos dados principais da matéria terem sido produzidos pelos próprios jornalistas, permitindo mostrar o impacto direto do calor em diversos locais, visto que os dados oficiais não conseguem demonstrar com esta minúcia.","Segundo o observatório europeu Copernicus, 2023 foi o ano mais quente dos últimos 100 anos. Além disso, a cidade de São Paulo bateu recordes de calor extremo no ano passado, evidenciando a importância de ampliar o debate sobre as mudanças climáticas e como tais efeitos afetam diretamente a vida das pessoas. 

São Paulo é uma cidade brasileira que costuma ter temperaturas mais amenas. Com isso, a população não está habituada a enfrentar as altas temperaturas como as vivenciadas no final de setembro de 2023.","A reportagem utilizou um termo-higrômetro para medir a temperatura ambiente e a umidade relativa do ar. O equipamento foi calibrado antes da coleta de dados e as medições foram realizadas com cuidado para minimizar as imprecisões.

Na produção também foram utilizados dados históricos de temperatura do Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia do Brasil (Inmet) processados por meio de códigos Python. Esses dados foram usados para comparar a temperatura registrada no dia mais quente do ano com a média histórica, além de outras análises relevantes.

Para as visualizações presentes na reportagem, utilizamos gráficos dinâmicos produzidos por meio da ferramenta Flourish.","Este projeto destaca a importância de utilizar instrumentos específicos para proporcionar uma visão mais próxima da realidade em reportagens sobre condições climáticas. Mostra também que os jornalistas não precisam necessariamente ficar à espera somente de dados oficiais, e que há possibilidades de gerar os próprios dados para a produção de reportagens.

A ênfase na comparação com dados oficiais demonstra a relevância da verificação e validação das medições.

Desenvolvida por meio das tecnologias da ferramenta Mapbox, a reportagem permite que os leitores tracem rotas com menor incidência de roubos e furtos de veículos na capital paulista. 

A análise abrange o perfil do crime ao longo de 2022, considerando fatores como local do crime, perfil do roubo e região. Ao organizar dados fragmentados, a reportagem oferece uma visão detalhada da criminalidade, proporcionando uma compreensão direta do impacto no cotidiano dos leitores.","Por proporcionar uma visualização acessível e simples das ocorrências de roubo e furto de veículos em São Paulo, a reportagem desenha o caminho do roubo de veículos em São Paulo. Além de fornecer métricas e insights sobre o crime, a reportagem influenciou diretamente a conscientização pública sobre a segurança no trânsito da cidade. 

O público agora pode tomar decisões informadas ao planejar seus deslocamentos, contribuindo para a melhor compreensão da dinâmica dos crimes. A originalidade da abordagem, utilizando um mapa interativo, ampliou o alcance da reportagem, tornando-a mais envolvente para os leitores e gerando um alto volume de acessos. 

O projeto também inspirou a comunidade que trabalha com dados a considerar soluções inovadoras para questões de segurança, destacando o papel do jornalismo na aplicação prática de dados para o benefício coletivo.

A reportagem ganhou menção honrosa na categoria Visualização do Prêmio Cláudio Weber Abramo de Jornalismo de Dados - a maior premiação da área no Brasil.","Maior cidade brasileira, São Paulo percebeu um aumento nas ocorrências de roubo e furtos de veículos após a pandemia. Os crimes, que estavam em queda após aplicação de lei que proibia a revenda de componentes automotivos sem homologação do governo Estadual, voltaram a subir na cidade, principalmente em áreas distantes do Centro. Em paralelo, a redução de operações de fiscalização nos chamados desmanches, pontos de venda de peças usadas. 

Apesar do produto utilizar dados de 2022, exclusivamente, o noticiário da época já apontava para um aumento significativo das ocorrências no ano de 2023. Acontece que a apuração ocorreu durante a chegada de uma nova gestão estadual, que revisitou os dados de 2022 de segurança pública e alegou inconsistências: na revisão de dados, o furto de veículo cairia ao invés de crescer em SP. 

O entrave adiou em alguns dias a confirmação das informações do mapa, além de ter ligado um alerta sobre a importância de materiais como esse para monitorar até as estatísticas oficiais do governo. 

Diante desse cenário, a necessidade de uma ferramenta que evidencie de maneira impactante a distribuição geográfica desses incidentes assume uma importância crucial, o que, acentua a urgência de uma solução como o **Rota +Segura**.","O projeto fez uso da ferramenta Mapbox para criar um mapa interativo, permitindo aos usuários traçar rotas com menor incidência de roubos. A coleta de dados foi realizada através do Sistema de Registro Digital de Ocorrências (RDO), o canal oficial da Secretaria de Segurança do Estado de São Paulo de divulgação das informações. 

Utilizamos bibliotecas Python como Requests e Pandas para extrair, processar e limpar os dados. A análise focou nos registros de crimes com informações de geolocalização (latitude e longitude), que representava 94,5% do total de casos de roubos e furtos em 2022. 

Com isso, desenvolvemos a ferramenta que testa automaticamente dez possíveis rotas considerando tempo de deslocamento, distância e quantidade de assaltos ao longo do percurso, oferecendo ao usuário opções baseadas em métricas relevantes. No fim, a plataforma exibe duas rotas viáveis, entre os pontos A e B informados pelo usuário: uma com o maior número de ocorrências; e a outra com menos crimes registrados.","Os profissionais de jornalismo podem aprender com este projeto a importância de utilizar tecnologias interativas para tornar dados complexos acessíveis ao público. A combinação de dados de segurança pública com ferramentas de visualização, como o Mapbox, permite uma compreensão mais profunda dos padrões criminais, sobretudo em regiões densamente populosas, como a cidade de São Paulo.

O projeto destaca a necessidade de superar desafios de acesso a dados ao utilizar fontes oficiais e focar em informações geolocalizadas para uma análise mais precisa.

This decree not only summoned hundreds of thousands of men to war, but also led to amendments in the Criminal Code. Anticipating a large number of refusals, the State Duma immediately tightened most of the articles of the Criminal Code concerning crimes related to military service. 
We gathered and studied thousands of court cases, in order to learn how servicemen and mobilized soldiers fled the front lines and how they were punished for this.","The project shed light on the drastic state of the Russian army in the second year of the war with Ukraine. It also allowed us to see some of the strategies Russian authorities and military command use in order to punish soldiers and threaten them into fighting the war. This, in turn, helped us formulate the most efficient tactics to avoid military service or receive the minimal punishment possible if a person has already been drafted.
The project reached hundreds of thousands of our followers and was widely quoted by our colleagues, both in international and Russian independent media.
This is an ongoing project, we monitor the court cases constantly and release updates on the statistics.","In theory, Russian court statistics is open to the public—but only in theory. There is no unified system that would allow to monitor court cases. In addition, government websites resist attempts to gather data from IPs abroad. To collect the data, we wrote a script and rented out several hundred proxy-servers that allowed it to work constantly and without interruption.
This was our third big investigation devoted to criminal prosecution of draft evaders (see more links below). All three features were meticulously researched and contain both data analysis and case studies and personal stories of prosecuted soldiers.","We used Python to scrape data (plus proxy-servers for a constant connection to courts’ websites) and D3.js for visualization. With thousands of cases in court records and hundreds of court decision texts available, it was important for us to dig deeper into the cases with the help of Mediazona’s reporting team, study the specifics of sentencing, and find individual cases that would illustrate the data.","In the course of working on the project, we perfected our skills of gathering Russian court statistics and working with it. That is something that could be useful to many of our colleagues who write about Russia. Information is scarce, and one has to constantly find new ways of getting data—even when, in theory, it’s supposed to be open to the public. In this particular case, it was very important for us not only to gather and analyze data, but make it practical and useful to our readers: explain the tactics of authorities and ways to resist these tactics.

Netherlands,Mediahuis NRC,Big,,,How the Netherlands compensated slave owners,01/07/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Map, Audio, Economy, Human rights","Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","Together with freelancer Okke ten Hove, investigative journalist Carola Houtekamer and data journalist Winny de Jong digitized data on the compensation of slave owners in 1863 when the Dutch ended slavery.

Based on this data, we wrote an article on the (cynical) fact that the compensation was a careful, quick, and easy administrative procedure for the slave owners, by reconstructing the journey of a young enslaved boy. 

It was for the first time in history that the precise calculation of the amount of compensation the Dutch government paid to slave owners was possible.","The article on how slave owners profited from the abolition of slavery, seen through the eyes of a young boy enslaved by one of the committee members, was very well read. The article was shared and discussed among historians and scientists working on the topic, by Dutch-Surinam organizations and people working on the topic of reparations by the government.

Together with the article, we also published a database with the exact amounts of money paid out per slave owner, in which readers could look up their own family name, drew even more attention. The database turned out to be the tool by which readers could engage with the topic, to see “if their family was involved too”. The project drew the attention of two museums, who are considering ways to incorporate the project into their collections. 

Over 52k readers spent, on average about 5 minutes reading the main story. The story had over 115k pageviews. At the newspaper 'reading minutes' are considered the most valueable metric, since they'll give insight into perceived value beyond clickbait. The cumulitive number of reading minutes is well above 230k.","Officially the Netherlands abolished slavery in 1863. However, due to a rigged system that was set up to protect the plantation economy, former enslaved people were obliged to work on plantations for low salaries for another 10 years. Which explains why some consider 1873, not 1863, the end of slavery 

In december 2022, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte made formal apologies for the Dutch' historical role in the slave trade - a historical moment. Both the apologies and the Dutch history of slave trade became the subject of a polarized public debate. NRC looked for ways to add value and perspective to this national discussion. By telling the story of the Dutch who profited of the abolishment of slavery by following one of its victims for a week of the victims of slavery, we tried to force readers to ask themselves the hard questions about our shared history.

The idea of changing perspective was inspired by the work of Jimmy Breslin (1928 - 2017) ‘go where no other journalist goes’, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (1933 - 2020) who advocated womens right by helping an all-male American Supreme Court understand that men are equal to women, and thus women are equal to men.","Historian Okke ten Hove, our main source, worked years on digitizing parts of the archives concerning the emancipation of the enslaved. Using his digital notes, NRC programmed to parse this information into spreadsheets. This made it possible for the newspaper to then find unique names among plantation owners, making it possible, for the first time in history, to sum profits. Since Okke ten Hove first digitized the archival pieces by hand, the Dutch National Archive has scanned the original files. This made it possible to verify the results of our programming. 

With the bordereaux as our guide, we could reconstruct the where abouts of one of the verification commissions. Consulting a multitude of sources like historical documents, books, combing through public and private archive, we were able to write the voyage story of the enslaved teenager Jan Pietje who joined Doctor Seiler on a weeklong trip verifying the bordereaux for a facile pay-out for slave owners.

Building on the talents of all makers involved, we combined programming and automated data processing with investigative journalism, archive research, and extensive interviews with experts and historians.",Using historical sources and digitizing them in the process can result in new stories on what is considered a well known history. To make the story the makers combined their talents: a different perspective which made all of us look differently at our shared history; digital and data skills; good writing; extensive research and many interviews with historians among others.,Dutch (published July 1st 2023); English (published November 2023).,https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2023/11/10/how-the-netherlands-compensated-slave-owners-a4179456,https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2023/11/08/okke-ten-hove-copied-by-hand-the-slavery-archives-i-do-not-know-exactly-how-long-it-took-me-years-a4178783,https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2023/06/30/zoveel-geld-leverde-de-afschaffing-van-de-slavernij-de-slavenhouders-op-a4168561,,,,,"Carola Houtekamer, Okke ten Hove, Daniel Niessen, Koen Smeets, Anna Vossers, Peter Zantingh, Wubby Luyendijk, Monique Hamers-Regimbal, André Dryansky and Winny de Jong.","Carola Houtekamer is a Dutch investigative journalist.

Brazil,Agência Tatu de Jornalismo de Dados,Small,,,A dor d’Elas,21/11/2023,"Database, Chart, Women","Google Sheets, Flourish, Datawrapper.","Este projeto consiste em uma série de reportagens que evidenciam, através de dados públicos, problemas de gênero vivenciados por mulheres brasileiras que são violentadas de diversas formas. Ao todo, quatro reportagens, publicadas em momentos diferentes, falam sobre vieses de violência de gênero, seja na forma de violência física, no cerceamento de direitos, no não cumprimento da lei ou no aumento de violência doméstica. Com visualizações simples e didáticas, as reportagens buscam apresentar os dados analisados de forma que a população em geral consiga entender a importância e o impacto de cada número, principalmente nas vidas e rotinas das mulheres brasileiras.","O impacto das reportagens produzidas pela Agência Tatu são sempre destaque a nível regional, isto porque a organização possui como foco de trabalho analisar e apresentar dados que evidenciem a região Nordeste do Brasil, pois esta região muitas vezes fica à margem do foco das mídias nacionais e que possui a menor cobertura de jornalismo local do país. Desta forma, cada reportagem publicada nesta série teve um impacto diferente. No caso da matéria sobre projetos de lei sobre aborto, foi possível notar um bom compartilhamentos por redes feministas locais e nacionais, por se tratar de um tema considerado tabu por muitas pessoas, o mesmo foi notado em relação à reportagem sobre meninas que são vítimas de estupro de vulnerável, já que também faz relação com o tema do aborto. Em outra reportagem da série, sobre dados de violência contra a mulher nos primeiros meses do ano, obtidos via Lei de Acesso à Informação, foi percebido um maior compartilhamento em mídias independentes da região Nordeste e por jornalistas nas redes sociais. Além disso, as reportagens serviram como embasamento para algumas redes feministas que tratavam sobre violência contra a mulher, utilizando os dados da Agência como fonte confiável para fundamentar os discursos.","Por ser considerado um país extremamente conservador em diversos aspectos culturais, é difícil para jornalistas abordarem temas que retratam a violência de gênero e conseguirem “furar a bolha” para que o assunto seja de fato consumido pela população. Cada vez mais os jornalistas precisam anexar um ponto que gere um maior interesse e polêmica, para assim poder abordar os tópicos e dados que são, na verdade, o foco da matéria. Para essas reportagens da série, também foram enfrentados desafios na obtenção de dados, como foi o caso das matérias sobre aumento da violência contra a mulher e sobre medidas protetivas, já que os jornalistas responsáveis não conseguiram obter os dados de todos os estados da região Nordeste, mesmo tendo acionado a LAI. Também foi notada muita resistência de órgãos estaduais quando solicitados dados sobre acesso ao aborto e, diante deste obstáculo, foi buscada uma nova alternativa e abordagem para a reportagem, que culminou na publicada sobre projetos de lei sobre aborto. Desta forma, é preciso reforçar que o trabalho de reportagem sobre temas como esses são uma forma de resistência do jornalismo independente, que tem buscado todas as formas possíveis para apresentar dados que verdadeiramente importam para a sociedade.","Para produzir esta série de reportagens foi necessário utilizar ferramentas de análise de dados, como o sheets do Google, e de visualização de dados, como o Datawrapper e o Flourish. Em uma reportagem específica, intitulada “8 a cada 10 projetos contrários ao aborto são pautados por deputados homens” foi criada uma metodologia para a análise dos dados coletados. Foi dedicada ao menos duas semanas para concluir a análise manual dos 252 projetos de lei que foram categorizados um por um, de acordo com o método criado pela Agência Tatu e explicado no link da própria reportagem. A cada reportagem uma nova técnica ou ferramenta é explorada, pois cada notícia necessita de um trabalho dedicado para que seja apresentada da melhor forma. É importante mencionar que todos os dados coletados e analisados para todas as publicações da Agência Tatu são disponibilizados na íntegra, no espaço “Dados abertos”, disposto sempre ao final das reportagens, dessa forma, qualquer leitor, jornalista ou pessoa interessada pode acessá-los e conferir a base utilizada para a construção da reportagem.","Um dos maiores aprendizados que se pode ter com esse projeto é sobre como abordar temas de gênero que são sensíveis, como os de violência contra à mulher. Para produzir as reportagens, também foi necessário muito estudo e aprendizado, inclusive lendo manuais de “Boas práticas de cobertura feminista sobre aborto no Brasil”, por exemplo. Para tratar sobre temas de violência de gênero, é preciso ter a consciência de que o assunto muitas vezes pode ser gatilho para algumas pessoas, portanto é fundamental contextualizar os dados apresentados com as diversas realidades, sobretudo da região Nordeste do Brasil, que é o principal foco da Agência Tatu.",Português-BR,https://www.agenciatatu.com.br/noticia/filhos-estupro-de-vulneravel/,https://www.agenciatatu.com.br/noticia/projetos-de-lei-sobre-aborto/,https://www.agenciatatu.com.br/noticia/violencia-contra-a-mulher/,https://www.agenciatatu.com.br/noticia/medidas-protetivas-no-nordeste/,,,,"Karina Dantas, Thiago Aquino, Graziela França","Karina Dantas é jornalista pela Universidade Federal de Alagoas (Ufal) e pós-graduanda em Assessoria de Comunicação.

For the first time, universities and colleges were compelled to publish and publisise the costs pegged on their programmes enabling students and parents make informed decicions on courses they select and plan accordingly. Prior to this, the institutions would introduce hidden costs which was burdensome parents and guardians. Sieving through the massive data sets provided insights on the role of cost on the preferance of certain courses in the various universities.","**1.Agenda setting;** upon publishing of the article attention on the most costly programmes and the institutions offering them took center stage. This framing and emphasizing of the topic shaped public discourse and focused attention on matters Kenyans consider important.

**2.Empowered Individuals:** the article provided readers with information they need to make informed decisions in various university programme costs, marketability of the courses and options available.

**3. Influenced Policy and Legislation:** the data-packed article provided policymakers and legislators with evidence and insights contributing to the development of new policies, amendments to existing laws, or changes in regulatory frameworks.

**4. Fostered Accountability**: by publishing the article, institutions of higher learning were held accountable for their actions. This has largely contributed to maintaining a system of checks and balances in the education sector.

**5. Informed the Public**: The primary role of journalism is to inform the public. This well-researched and well-written article provided valuable information to readers, increasing their awareness and understanding of important issues in the education space. This helped the citizens make informed decisions and participate more effectively in civic life.","Over the recent years, Universities in Kenya have been chocking under heavy debt due to cash flow challenges partly brought by dwindling government capitation that has failed to keep pace with the rising student populations.

To remedy this, the government under the leasership of newly -elcted President William Ruto reviewed funding regime in efforts to address inequitable capitation witnessed under the differentiated unit cost ( DUC) model that had plugged universities into financial distress owing to ballooning pending bills.

State funding for students under the new funding model is choice of the programme, household income band, affirmative performance and government priority areas.

2. Data Cleaning was done with view of removing duplicates, handle missing values, and correct errors. It came in handy to standardize and format data for consistency.

3. Visualization; This technique enabed the team to create informative and engaging visualizations to communicate the indings in termes of emergent trends. We applied the use of charts and graphs to present complex data in an accessible manner.

4. Storytelling -i applied this technique to develop a narrative around the data to tell a compelling and understandable story.
Use data visualizations to support key points in the narrative.

5.Collaboration among team members within the newsroom and with external experts. This made it seamless to share data and findings transparently.","1. Collaboration through teamwork is key as it enhances data journalism. Involving data scientists, graphic designers, and other experts can lead to more comprehensive and impactful storytelling. Collaborative efforts can result in a richer, more nuanced presentation of data.

2. Contextualization enriches the final product; visuals such as graphs and charts provide context and help contextualize data within a broader narrative, allowing readers to grasp the significance of the information presented. 

3. Storytelling is an essential technique for the kind of impact the article will have on the audience.As such, a compelling narrative alongside visual representations of data can create a powerful storytelling experience. This helps readers connect emotionally with the information.

O trabalho envolveu meses de apuração, entre viagens a cinco estados do Nordeste do país, diversos pedidos de dados feitos via Lei de Acesso à Informação e um profundo trabalho de análise de dados.
O cruzamento entre um estudo sobre os locais mais necessitados e os dados sobre as doações de equipamentos hídricos jogou luz sobre o contraste entre regiões prioritárias abandonadas e aquelas beneficiadas por padrinhos políticos.","A publicação teve impacto imediato: o governo brasileiro criou uma comissão especificamente para apurar problemas apontados pelas reportagens, como o armazenamento impróprio de caixas d'água e a venda irregular de equipamentos.
A série, cuja matéria de abertura foi manchete do jornal, também gerou amplo debate nos setores envolvidos a respeito das distorções causadas pelas emendas parlamentares na elaboração de políticas públicas contra a seca.","A série foi publicada em meio a um cenário político de crescente ampliação do poder orçamentário do Congresso, por meio das emendas, paralelamente à desidatração das políticas de Estado no semiárido, em especial o programa Cisternas. Essa combinação favorece o uso eleitoral de ações de curta duração ou ineficientes, como a distribuição de caixas d'água e caminhões-pipa, mantendo populações vulneráveis dependentes de padrinhos políticos. A originalidade do trabalho se deve principalmente ao inédito cruzamento entre um estudo da Embrapa Territorial e as planilhas com dados de doações e instalações de equipamentos pelas estatais Codevasf (Companhia de Desenvolvimento do Vale do São Francisco e Parnaíba) e Dnocs (Departamento Nacional de Obras contra as Secas). A reportagem teve acesso a uma base de dados inédita do estudo, com as informações completas sobre o grau de vulnerabilidade das cidades na região. Essa base foi comparada aos dados obtidos via Lei de Acesso à Informação (equipamentos doados e instalados), com especificação de quantidades e autores das emendas parlamentares. O material traz mapas interativos nos quais o leitor pode visualizar as disparidades e pesquisar os detalhes de cada município.","Os dados disponibilizados em formato PDF foram extraídos e transformados em dataframes com a ajuda de um código de programação na linguagem Python, baseado mais especificamente nas bibliotecas tabula-py e pandas.

Para cruzamento dos dados, a reportagem vinculou os municípios citados aos seus respectivos nomes e códigos oficiais. Essa etapa envolveu um grande esforço de revisão, limpeza e apuração manual, considerando as variações e erros de grafia entre as diferentes fontes, entre outros problemas.

Os mapas animados e interativos foram desenvolvidos no framework Astro Build em linguagem React e nas biblioteca Leaflet.js e Swiper.js, além do software Figma para prototipagem.

Além disso, o principal recurso utilizado para obtenção dos dados foi a Lei de Acesso à Informação.

Mexico,Inter Press Service,Small,,,Pemex explots fossil fuels with money from international banks,26/09/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Environment, Economy","Microsoft Excel, CSV","The research looked at how Petroleos Mexicanos, Mexico's national oil company, financed its exploration and production activities from national and international sources. Pemex has received billions of dollars from private and Mexican development banks, without climate risks evaluation. This financing feeds the climate crisis, as most of the banks and Pemex lack credible climate goals. Moreover, Mexico's development banks have violated their own safeguards by missing a proper evaluation for their financing of oil projects, following the Mexican policy of pushing fossil fuels and abandoning the energy transition.","The investigation moved intensely in Spanish and English. In the former, it was one of the most read stories in the IPS website. The reportage has served to show the importance of climate financing and why it has to be redirected to sustainable activities, and away from fossil fuels. It has fortified the transparency and accountability of Mexico's energy and climate policies, as the support for Pemex is problematic, due to its huge debt and unabated pollution. It explores the climate costs of putting resources into oil companies. In addition to it, the project is an inspiring example of data journalism FOIA requests and the evaluation of climate and energy policies when the climate crisis has been exacerbated by the burning of fossil fuels. It makes governments and banks accountable for their policies.","The Mexican governments has strenghtened its support of the national energy and oil companies with enormous public budget and public policies, as it has an open profossil fuels stance. This has created a dense political atmosphere, in which any criticism is disqualified or vilified, as the government argues that it's saving national assets and investment for the public benefit, without taking into account the social, environmental and economic damages. Private and Mexican development banks aren't transparent about their lending policies and practices, which make difficult the tracking of the money. Another point is that it's not clear how Pemex uses the money, as it goes directly into its general operations.
Finally, the amount of data was huge, so the analysis, filtering, comparison, were time demanding.","I wrote an hypothesis, which was validated by the sources and data; the cause and effects of the problem and the investigative questions to develop the research. I did FOIA requests to know the sources of the financing and the destiny of the money and looked at reports on financial flows. I used Excel to analyze the data, to compare it, to filter it, to group it. It helped me to identify which banks gave most of the money to Pemex and for what activities. With all this bunch, I compared it with the banks' net zero and climate goals to see if they match or not, as well as Pemex's policies and climate goals.","The design of the research is important, as it guides it through the whole process. It allowed me to organize the material and to define the information needed. With it, I made the FOIA requests and looked for the necessary data. International platforms on emissiones, net zero policies and climate goals are very useful to track the commitments and the banks' lending policies. The investigation shows how to evaluate public policies, to track financing and make accountable for.

That means human rights violations by law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, incidents like this occur frequently in Bangladesh's second capital, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the Child Act in the country. Minors are being wrongly classified as adults during case filing due to ineffective age verification protocols. This violates the Minors Act of 2013. They are being incarcerated with adult offenders, causing trauma and social stigma.","This news sparked widespread outrage, and public reaction, and the police administration promptly took action against those responsible for the irregularity. Despite the existence of legal provisions for juvenile offenders to be sent to rehabilitation institutes, their treatment under the law is determined by their age at the time of the case filing. This age manipulation leads to delayed justice, missed opportunities for correction, and the possibility of repeated criminal activity. Experts emphasize the importance of properly determining the age of juvenile offenders by the law to guarantee fair treatment and appropriate rehabilitation. 

According to GIJN, this piece is one of the in-depth investigative reports on Bangladesh that was discussed in June. On the 20th of December Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) announced this report, has been included in the list of 8 'Best Investigative Stories from Bangladesh in 2023'. 

Here is its link:

Through case record analysis and interviews with victims, their families, lawyers, and police officials, it highlights the trauma and social stigma these juveniles face. Even after being granted bail, they continue to struggle with the aftermath of their experiences. 

The report adheres to the principles of investigative journalism, including systematic research, thorough analysis, and the disclosure of confidential information in the public interest. It aims to promote accountability and social justice by providing transparent, honest, and reliable information.","I have used an editing tool to blur the pictures of the victim's children to protect their identity. I obtained secret documents using the RTI method. To create my database from open data, I used Google Sheets. Based on the statements of the detained children, it was discovered that the date, time, and place of detention matched in all three cases. To demonstrate the difference between the actual and false locations recorded by the police, I used Google Earth maps to show images of the crime scene. I also used the Photoshop tool to combine the data of the cases I found through my search. Finally, I analyzed the comparative data of the previous year's cases using graph charts.","This involves crafting a story that is logical and consistent, making assumptions, and validating them to ensure they are reasonable. I utilized four methods to test this hypothesis: imagination, precision, experience, and objectivity. Conduct thorough research beforehand. Stay focused and proceed step-by-step with the evidence. I conduct in-depth research on child law and establish a relationship with children and families. I create a master file for data verification and follow ethical standards. Proper completion of this work can lead to positive change in long-standing injustices.

My inspiration to work on this issue came when I was watching a Tamil movie. During my field investigation, I discovered that law enforcers may violate human rights when investigating violations. This is not an isolated incident, as on average a lawyer handles five similar cases each year. If 300 lawyers handle this number of cases, it's a very concerning situation. My work is fueled by a sense of public interest.

Although Uruguay has good international indicators of open government data, it is hard for citizens to access relevant and updated databases. In addition, if the data exists and is accessible (as it was in the case of our investigation), the necessary technical capacities to process it are not usually available. If we add to these difficulties, the approach to complex issues such as climate change, the mission becomes even harder. 

We assembled an interdisciplinary and multicultural team (with professionals from Uruguay, Argentina, Mexico and Chile), unusual by the standards of not only local but also Latin American media. Our media organization is staffed with journalists, geologists and data scientists that use cutting edge methods to collect and analyze evidence to show how climate variability and climate change affect and will impact different communities in Uruguay.","We analyzed the three groups of workers in three pilot areas where climate change will affect working conditions and occupational safety. We found that climate change and climate variability are already impacting the lives of workers in Uruguay and are expected to leave impoverished populations in a more vulnerable situation. But through our project, we also established that data can help us tackle these challenges: by leveraging open data, as a society, we have the ability to make decisions and take crucial action before people in Uruguay are adversely affected by flood projections and other natural disasters.

- We used 21 open datasets from the Uruguayan Government and four datasets created by us for the research.
- Our investigation is also based on 13 interviews conducted by us, and 19 national and regional documentary sources.
- We used satellite images from Google Earth and Planet Labs.
- We created our own maps.

The Defence Ministry hasn't reported casualties since September 2022: the last officially reported number was 6,000. And now the Kremlin has “recommended” to governors not to publish obituaries of the Russian soldiers so as «not to alarm people».
At June 2023, Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) published preliminary mortality data for the year 2022. There isn't a single word about war deaths. However, Important Stories managed to estimate the scale of military casualties, using statistical methods and taking into account the excess mortality rate.","The losses of Russian personnel in the war in Ukraine are very important information that the Russian authorities are trying to hide in order to create a false image of this war among Russians. 
Our attempt to assess the real losses led to the fact that people had the opportunity to learn that the Russian command would throw them like meat just to achieve their goals. In addition, other Russian journalists began to publish their calculations. 
In conditions of censorship, when the state hides the number of deaths in the war in Ukraine and even ""recommends"" that governors not publish individual obituaries of the Russian military, any assessment based on an adequate and verifiable method is important. This is the only way to understand the real price of human lives that Russians pay for the war against Ukraine.","This investigation was probably done in the most unlikely circumstances. Firstly, the data we were working with was intentionally designed in a certain way so that journalists could not easily find out about the number of military deaths. Secondly, the very publication of our investigation is punishable under the new laws of Russia. The authors of the investigation are potentially at risk of up to 15 years in prison in Russia. Thirdly, even working in the independent publication ""Important Stories"" under their own names is also criminally punishable by imprisonment of up to 5 years. After the publication of the investigation by one of the authors, Alesya Marokhovskaya, threats of physical violence were received, the attackers followed the journalist and collected data on her movements.","""Important Stories"" obtained this figure by estimating excess mortality. It is based on the idea that there is an expected mortality and there is one that we see in reality. The difference between them is excess mortality. ""Important Stories"" used two different methods to assess excess deaths. Both gave the same result — 18 thousand dead.

The first way is to calculate the excess mortality of men from external causes. This category includes deaths caused not by diseases, but by external influences (for example, road accidents, murders, suicides, etc.). They should also include deaths in war.

In 2022, female mortality from external causes fell, while male mortality increased, although in peacetime the mortality trends of men and women do not differ. Based on this, ""Important Stories"" built a forecast of the expected male mortality in 2022: if not for the war, it would have amounted to 98 thousand.

However, in reality, as follows from Rosstat data, 116 thousand men died from external causes in 2022. Thus, excess mortality in 2022 amounted to about 18 thousand men.

And for visual presentation, we used scrollitelling to make it easier for the reader to perceive data and graphs.","Other journalists can use our calculation method for their own needs: calculating excess mortality can be useful in assessing not only those who died in the war, but also, for example, for victims of covid. Or any other statistical anomaly. 

In addition, our visualization method may inspire other journalists to try scrollitelling for their story.","Русский, English",https://istories.media/en/stories/2023/07/06/rosstat-war-deaths/,https://istories.media/stories/2023/07/10/zhurnalisti-i-uchenie-otsenivayut-rossiiskie-poteri-na-voine-ot-18-do-25-tisyach-chelovek-v-2022-godu-kakaya-otsenka-tochnee/,https://istories.media/stories/2023/09/21/ot-povestki-do-pokhoronki/,,,,,"Rina Nikolaeva, Alesya Marohovskaya","Rina Nikolaeva (31 y.o.) graduated from the journalism faculty of Moscow State University, worked in PR and as a radio correspondent.

The analysis revealed familiar patterns: the same companies almost always emerged as competitors, the procurement expert was often common, and the success rate was something unusually high in most cases. Suspicious cases of corruption are reported to the Public Procurement Authority and the Integrity Authority at the same time as this article is published.","Following the publication of this article, the Public Procurement Authority, the Integrity Authority and the GVH have launched investigations, which are still ongoing. The article has been picked up by several media outlets and has been the subject of a radio interview. Since the publication of the article, we have received several enquiries from Hajdúböszörmény regarding further tenders won by Tömb 2002 Kft. One of the tenderers concerned, the University of Debrecen, has not issued a tender for the procedure under Article 115 of the Civil Code since then (we do not know if it is because of the article/investigations, but it cannot be excluded). The article was the subject of two podcasts, one of which was with representatives of two professional organisations (K-Monitor, Transparency International).","Perhaps it could have been better shown how everyone is unwittingly involved in maintaining a corrupt system, whether it is subcontractors who do not speak up, institutions/authorities who do not do market research, who look for the easy way out and accept the easy solution, and the apparent inertia of the authorities. Systemic corruption is now part of everyday life, but pointing out only some of its elements does not seem to connect the dots. This article has tried to give a broader picture, while at the same time pointing out how tenders can be manipulated behind the appearance of legality. That is the problem with this system (the NER): everything seems to be legal, and therefore the EU cannot do anything about it.","The analysis was carried out by an accredited public procurement consultant thanks to a database created under EU pressure. Key data from tenders were collected in excel sheets and the duplicates highlighted. The data spoke for itself, unrealistic without the political background. In addition, the company database (Opten.hu) and the Aleph program were used to map the company network, and additional visualisations were created using Flourish.studio.","It is worth seeking expert help if you do not have the right competence for a particular test. They can easily spot suspicious elements. Furthermore, it is advisable to invest more time (in this case several months) if you want to be thorough (e.g. to be able to process enquiries). It is also worth looking at the data in context rather than in isolation. In isolation, it may appear that all was well with the tenders examined, but the overall picture is quite different. Lastly, if you want the subject of this article to be examined by the authorities, do not be afraid to make a public interest report.","Hungarian, English",https://atlatszo.hu/kozpenz/2023/10/24/korrupciogyanu-tobb-szaz-kozbeszerzest-vizsgaltunk-meg-bejelentest-teszunk-a-hatosagoknal/,https://english.atlatszo.hu/2023/10/31/this-is-what-systemic-corruption-looks-like-a-company-wins-almost-every-tender-it-enters/,,,,,,"Eszter Katus, Krisztián Szabó",Eszter Katus and Krisztián Szabó are both journalists at Hungarian inversitative journalism nonprofit atlatszo.hu

It consisted of two parallel efforts. First, we built SecretCanada.com, an unprecedented national database of 300,000 completed FOI requests for more than 600 public institutions across the country. It includes detailed guides on how to file requests and custom-made FOI letter generators. Second was a traditional shoe-leather investigation, in which we proved that Canadian public institutions now regularly and purposefully ignore FOI laws by withholding information they are legally required to disclose.","Since the launch of SecretCanada.com, people have used it to generate an FOI letter more than 18,000 times, and total page views for the website top 375,000. It is being used in newsrooms across Canada, and as a teaching tool in journalism programs. “This has really helped me grasp how exactly to file these important requests to better my reporting,” one student said. “It’s such a great tool in the classroom!” Lawyers are directing clients to the website: “I send the link on filing an access request for immigration notes to at least 2 consults a week,” one wrote. An editor at a local weekly told The Globe: “It has helped our newsroom secure more than 120 different information files ranging from wildlife fencing repair, information that went into releasing most recent national park management plans and higher profile incidents in the national parks.”

Following our investigation, opposition members of Parliament called on the federal government to overhaul access law and policies, an investigation has been launched by the province of Alberta's information commissioner, and Canada’s 14 commissioners banded together to sign a joint resolution, calling on their governments to modernize access laws and strengthen the public’s right to information.","Canada has had freedom of information laws for more than 40 years, but the access system has gradually been eroded as public institutions slowly retreat from their responsibilities under the law. Today, journalists in Canada frequently see access requests as pointless: records may take six months or longer to arrive, and when they do, they may be so heavily redacted as to be useless.

Secret Canada is a project that aims to simultaneously expose this dysfunction – through a massive, 18-month investigation – and offer a solution, by building the SecretCanada.com website, which serves as a powerful indictment of how Canadian governments have failed on access, while also empowering the public to learn about FOI and wield it for themselves. During the course of the project, reporters interviewed more than 200 sources, published dozens of stories and, crucially, used FOI to investigate FOI, filing more than 1,000 access requests, the majority of which were for data from internal FOI tracking systems.","SecretCanada.com’s main technical challenge was assembling a large and idiosyncratic dataset and presenting it in a unified interface.

We cleaned and processed hundreds of thousands of records from jurisdictions across Canada, each with their own unique data formats, metadata and categorization. Once this data was normalized into Google Sheets, a custom Python script harmonized these records, normalized text and categories, and assigned unique IDs to each FOl request.
With the data assembled, the next challenge became building a frontend. We used Next.js, a React-based framework which let us have static builds of the site and server-side functions for interacting with the database. This allowed us to build a fast and responsive site that could be indexed by search engines.

We used Amazon Web Services' Amplify for hosting, and changes to the codebase automatically triggered a rebuild of the site. We used Contentful.com, a headless CMS, as an interface for non-technical staff to edit blog and guide posts and changes from this system automatically triggered a rebuild of the site. Each version of the site was pushed to AWS’s Content Distribution Network, giving users a lightning-fast browsing experience – most page loads happened in a few tenths of a second or less.","From the beginning, we knew we wanted the Secret Canada project to include a public-service component. Given how ingrained Canada’s culture of secrecy had become, we expected governments would not want to change, even when confronted with damning evidence – so we resolved to create our own impact.

We did this by filing hundreds of FOIs for data from public institutions' FOI tracking systems and compiling the data. Building our own database from information locked away in the various FOI tracking systems used by public bodies like ministries, municipalities, police services and hospitals meant that the public was suddenly privy to exactly what kind of information their public institutions were releasing. We also built a series of fill-in-the-blank FOI letter generators that anyone could use to quickly draft their own request letters and open-sourced the spreadsheet we used to keep track of the requests we’d filed for the project.",English,https://www.secretcanada.com/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canada-freedom-of-information-laws/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-immigration-applications-access-requests/,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-access-to-information-laws-historians/,,,,"Tom Cardoso, Robyn Doolittle, Andrew Louis, Carys Mills, Mahima Singh, Ming Wong, Danielle Webb, Greg McArthur, Renata D'Aliesio.","Tom Cardoso (investigative reporter)

United States of America,Bloomberg News,Big,,,How Musk’s X Is Failing To Stem the Surge of Misinformation About Israel and Gaza,20/11/2023,"Investigation, Breaking news",Scraping,"When reporting on disinformation and misinformation in the Israel-Hamas war, Bloomberg noticed a prevalence of blue-check accounts (paid accounts) on X that were using their status and algorithmic advantage to spread falsehoods. Using the open database of ""community notes"", we sought to quantify this and identify serial offenders, who under Twitter's prior regime would have been banned or had their distribution reduced. The data-driven story seek to explain the state of fact-checking and the lack of effectiveness of the community notes system at Musk's X, at a time when global tensions are especially high and misinformation leads to real-world consequences.","Since Elon Musk took over Twitter (now called X), he cut most of the workforce handling content moderation and loosened the rules. Musk has been pushing community notes as a program that he argues does a better job compared to traditional content moderation. In a bid to promote the program, X made the community notes system accessible to the public. This is one of the few ways to get insight into the platform’s innerworkings, after X started charging more than academics and journalists can afford for access to its API. Our story became a model for demonstrating how researchers can use this database to investigate the platform’s role in misinformation, even without access to Twitter’s API and helped pave the way for more reporting and research on the topic. The story was widely cited and shared by researchers and journalists. Months after we published this story, Propublica published their own story on the same topic and made very similar points, using our methodology. (https://www.propublica.org/article/x-verified-accounts-misinformation-israel-hamas-conflict).","In 2023, large tech companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft and Twitter (now called X) eliminated many roles in response to souring economic conditions, and included large numbers of content moderation jobs in their cuts. At the same time over the past year, they’ve also steadily undercut the ability of independent researchers, academics and journalists to monitor their platforms. Twitter has been particularly egregious in this trend. Back in April, the company started charging people thousands of dollars to use its API to examine the virality and reach of posts on the platform, which made the work of tracking the rise of mis- and disinformation, hate speech and other misleading posts prohibitive, especially for researchers, civil rights groups and 
others who aren’t affiliated with well-funded institutions.
The company was in the midst of trying to prove that it was working hard on misinformation related to the Israel-Hamas war, especially after Musk came under fire for his anti-Semitic commentary. When our story came out, they tried to spin it as positive. https://twitter.com/lindayax/status/1727444724485705812?s=46&amp;t=2lCNjmnwz3woxKfdI1T7Eg","We used keywords to identify community notes that are placed on tweets about the Israel-Hamas war and calculated the lag between each community note’s creation and public display. And then cross check that dataset with two external datasets to identify the accounts that were previously suspended and the accounts that recently started to pay for the premium service. 

For the graphics, we used Puppeteer, a node.js library, to programmatically screenshot and save the pages of original tweets on which Community Notes were displayed and used imagemagick and Photoshop to blur, crop and make sprites of the screenshots for display on the web. Python is used to parse the HTML of the tweet pages to analyze engagement and calculate the lag between the tweet posting and when the Community Note appeared. The page is rendered with Svelte and D3.js to animate graphics.","-It is possible to use a combination of scraping, data that a company publishes, and research data to report on misinformation

Three primary networks, coordination between them and Kremlin disinformation amplifiers were all examined and visualized using a dataset consisting of 3,871 Telegram channels and 57,646 messages. Three aspects of this investigation are brought to light: the interconnectivity of these networks; the strategies they employ to disseminate false information to foreign audiences; and amplifiers of false narratives in each country. Furthermore, we discovered a link between the main network and Kremlin-affiliated voluntary training program in Russia.","After our research was published, local Polish and Italian media as well as Politico and the Reuters Institute referenced our work in their pieces about Kremlin disinformation. We conducted a workshop for journalists and NGO workers about the findings, techniques, and tools we used during this investigation in October at the annual disinformation conference of EU Disinfo Lab. We presented our results and methodology to policymakers, and other stakeholders at NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence organized event Riga StratCom Dialogue in June. Also, we conducted training sessions regarding the tools and research methodology for two participants of two different cohorts in our capacity-building initiative, Digital Sherlocks Program, where we teach journalists, students, and global civil society members on how to counter and report disinformation.","To truly understand the full picture of our project, it's important for the jury to know some things that may not be obvious from the work itself. One key point is that the tools we use for this kind of work can be unpredictable and change often. This makes it challenging to report on disinformation. As journalists, we can't always rely on external companies or tools, so we have to be creative in finding ways to gather public interest data that is either free or reasonably priced.

Our project serves as an example of how we tackled reporting on large-scale networks on Telegram. We combined open-source and free tools with traditional methods and some manual work to achieve our goals. It's a testament to our resourcefulness and determination in the face of obstacles.

By sharing our experience, we hope to highlight the importance of adaptability and ingenuity in investigative journalism. Our project goes beyond the ordinary and showcases how combining modern tools with tried-and-true approaches can lead to groundbreaking insights.","We employed a variety of tools and methods, including both traditional and open-source tools. We began by using Telegram Tracker, an open-source command-line interface (CLI) tool created by one of our colleagues, Esteban Ponce de León, to scrape messages from 56 channels using the Telegram API. Next, to find other amplifiers of channels from the main clusters, we used the Telegram analytics tool TGStat. Following data collection, we cleaned the dataset which included 57,646 messages and 3,875 channels. First, we performed a modularity analysis using Gephi, a free software for network visualization and analysis. Second, to examine additional connections, we examined the dates of channel creation and historical data. The results were then presented as visual or screenshot composites. Third, we examined nine clusters. According to Gephi's modularity analysis, certain country-based clusters had stronger connections. To identify the individuals behind the networks, we used additional methods like reverse image searches and advanced search on searche engines. We found that largest and oldest network is linked to a voluntary military training program in Russia. We assessed the language that channels use and our international research team's consultations also revealed that machine translation or non-native speakers were involved in these information operations.","In general, for someone not familiar with OSINT, our work can potentially serve as a guide. We explain how we obtained, analyzed, and presented the data. For journalists already reporting on such operations, our findings on country-based clusters may facilitate more in-depth analyses of specific channels by them, helping to inform the public with accurate information in those countries. Also, journalists can gain insights into patterns and understand how coordinated efforts operate on Telegram, empowering them to identify and address more effectively. Following publication, we briefed a few German journalists on our findings as well. The approach we adopted is based on open-source information, allowing others to replicate and discover more influence operations originating from Kremlin on various platforms. Overall, journalists can benefit from data on 56 channels in the main cluster and other related channels over 3 thousand to conduct further investigations, produce additional case studies, utilize same tools for similar research, and apply the same methodology to uncover other information operations.",English,https://dfrlab.org/2023/03/01/networks-of-pro-kremlin-telegram-channels-spread-disinformation-at-a-global-scale/,,,,,,,"Nika Aleksejeva, Sayyara Mammadova","Nika Aleksejeva is a research fellow for the Baltics at the DFRLab.

We worked with researchers to build a more complete picture of guns in schools than official records provide, and spoke to students, teachers and parents to document the impact of these incidents. The end result is a digital piece that features text, video and charts, as well as a print piece in _The Economist_, and a series of films that explored the issue further.","The project shone light on an often poorly covered aspect of gun crime in America: the lack of comprehensive data collection and the poor policy choices that can lead to. It also shared the sometimes traumatic personal stories of people caught up in school gun-crime. And as a result of our work with David Riedman of the K-12 school shootings database, he is now tracking “swatting” incidents (hoax threats that prompt a police response) in schools. Within The Economist it showed the value of new ways of storytelling, combining video reporting with data journalism and more traditional reporting. The success of the project has led to more such collaboration, as well as a renewed appetite to find new digital formats and methods of presentation that can offer readers a richer experience than a print article might.","There is no federal record of every time a gun is fired on school property in America, nor an agreed definition of a school shooting. This made collecting and verifying data tricky. We worked with David Riedman, a researcher who maintains a database of incidents, but also verified each of his reports ourselves, by contacting dozens of schools and law-enforcement agencies. We used this data to identify a typical month of gun crime in schools, and profiled a series of incidents that illustrated the difficulties of preventing such crime. Many schools and authorities were reluctant to talk about the incidents, either due to ongoing legal proceedings or because of reputational risk. The reporting required both statistical rigour and sensitivity, especially when convincing people to speak about their experiences on camera. Finally, though not the first time The Economist has combined video, data and text journalism, this is the most ambitious and complex project in which we have done so. We maintained The Economist’s thorough analysis while telling more personal stories, and explored new ways of presenting our journalism (eg in an explorable calendar at the end of the online article, allowing readers to dig deeper into our data).",See previous reply.,"The importance of collaboration between teams in the newsroom to find new ways to present data and tell stories.

United States of America,Bloomberg News,Big,,,Power Plays,23/03/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Database",Scraping,"In Britain, Italy, Pakistan and the U.S. state of Texas, Bloomberg uncovered energy firms deploying an array of predatory tactics that squeezed extra revenue from the public amid skyhigh inflation and during other recent crises. This international investigation combined shoeleather sourcework with dizzyingly complex data analyses to document billions of pounds, dollars and euros lining companies’ pockets. Reporters also revealed how poor policy and underinvestment in infrastructure left the public exposed to higher costs. Outraged politicians and lawmakers responded by demanding reforms, and policymakers have either made or promised to make crucial changes to protect consumers.","Within hours of the first UK story’s publication, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesman said that energy firms’ tactics were “clearly completely unacceptable” and that the energy regulator was “urgently looking into it further.” Reporters followed up with an exclusive on new rules banning ""excessive"" profits from the practice identified in the piece. After the second UK story members of Parliament grilled an energy executive during a committee hearing about the piece, with one Conservative saying her firm’s conduct “feels wrong.”

In Italy an opposition legislator repeatedly referred to Bloomberg’s findings in a formal demand that ministers review hundreds of millions of euros in bonuses paid to the nation’s grid operator. In Pakistan a Senate panel held hearings and will make recommendations about how to ensure the government does not lose out again to gaming by overseas firms. 

After the first Texas story, the state’s independent market monitor estimated that the ""artificial withholding"" it described inflated prices by $8 billion, a number that later rose to $12 billion. Key policymakers promised to review the grid operator’s procedures by the end of April 2024. The Dallas Morning News ran an editorial based on our the Texas piece headlined “Regulate Texas gas pipelines.”","For most of these stories, data was publicly available — but massive in scale. In the UK, for example, it tracked the output of every power plant for every half-hour period every day of the year. In total, more than 100 million market records were examined. Reporters wrote more than a half-dozen scripts just to download it all. They also set up a cloud server and computing platform to store and summarize the data as they looked for questionable behavior.

Each effort required reporters to master locale quirks and special circumstances. Texas posed a particularly robust challenge. Tipsters alleged that prices had surged this past summer thanks to a little-known policy tweak that had created an artificial shortage of energy. But the Texas grid operates an opaque system for tracking trading activity and uses a proprietary algorithm for setting prices. On the surface it looked impossible to figure out what exactly happened. But after extensive conversations with market insiders and former grid officials, Bloomberg reporters came up with a Python program that could calculate what the price of energy would have been if not for the new policy.","The complexity of energy markets posed a vexing storytelling challenge. Bloomberg deployed a series of interactive data visualizations that integrated seamlessly into the written copy and added dynamism and explanatory heft. These graphics helped readers grasp how companies’ questionable tactics worked, and showed how quirks of geography and market power provided firms with an incentive to game the system. 

The stories held to account more than a dozen multinational companies. These firms trade and produce power around the clock from multiple sources in multiple jurisdictions, each with its own set of labyrinthine market regulations. To get inside the industry, reporters developed sources inside one of the most opaque markets in finance. Many had little incentive to discuss behavior that might land them or their companies in trouble, or put their industry under a harsh light. One Texas company had a fearsome reputation inside the industry and was well-known for retaliating against those who spoke out. To find any one source willing to talk, reporters had to contact dozens of people. But those who did speak provided details about how particular maneuvers worked and how firms evaded regulatory scrutiny.","When journalists try to penetrate a secretive world, sometimes it feels genuinely impossible to find someone who can talk on the record. Often, we can write amazing stories with anonymous sources and documents and rigorous data analysis. But for our Italy story, a Bloomberg reporter showed the value of persistence. After many months vainly spent trying to find an insider who would step out of the shadows, the reporter refused to give up or to treat this as a lower priority. Finally, the reporter managed to cultivate an energy trader who gave an on-the-record glimpse at his firm’s strategies. His company deployed a maneuver that exploited moments when energy demand was low — which led to a bonanza during the awful early days of Covid. He even admitted a secret that had only been hinted at in public records: He had been the accused ringleader of a cartel that Italian authorities had fined for collusion a decade earlier in connection with this manipulative trading tactic.",English; Italy story was translated into Italian,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/storythreads/2023-09-14/energy-bills-how-gas-and-electricity-prices-are-punishing-consumers,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-uk-power-electricity-market-manipulating/?srnd=storythread-S0Z7XBDWX2PS01,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-uk-power-stations-avoided-paying-back-consumers/,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2023-texas-grid-electricity-prices/?srnd=storythread-S0Z7XBDWX2PS01,,,,"Gavin Finch, Jason Grotto, Todd Gillespie, Eric Fan, Vernon Silver, Rachel Adams-Heard, Sam Dodge, Demetrios Pogkas, Jeremy C.F.

Of Uganda’s more than 30 global athletics medals, the Sabiny from Sebei Sub-region account for more than 70 percent, setting it aside as the country’s powerhouse. 
Interestingly, the most decorated athletes share a bloodline. And we take a look at this. The trophy cabinet owes most of its glitter to the Kapsumbata clan, particularly the Simba family, which has produced global superstars Jacob Kiplimo, Victor Kiplangat, and Oscar Chelimo, and the Kaberwa family which gave us superstar Joshua Cheptegei.","1. The project stirred a national debate on the possibilities of cross breeding in athletics, with the government promising to allocate funding and make the trials.
2. The story raised a pertinent debate on litigation and copyright for the sperms of athletes. Earlier, there had been allegations of some athletes conniving with foreigners and selling sperms. 
3. Local radio stations held talkshows that sensitized the communities about conservation of cultural roots and practices, forexample, the eating habits that are key in preserving talent.
4. The story inspired the Kapsumbata clan people and the Sebei community to take athletics as a golden opportunity in the global stage. Schools and camps started holding athletics compitions. 
5. The project was an eye-opener to the government. The state minister of sports is stiring government on cultural preservation for athletics in rural areas, so that we can produce more champions from the lineage of families. 
6. More athletics camps have been set up in Sebei Sub-region to enrol more children and youth to the sport.
7. Being a lead story for our national newspaper, the content inspired community journalism, with local radio stations appreciating the work and doing day-two stories (rooting for more talent).","Legal threats: I shelved most of the facts related to athletes trading sperms because of possible litigation. However, I am still looking for a fertile ground or evidence to do the story. 
Access to Data: This was a rigorous exercise because the locals and family members of athletes kept protecting their origin and family ties. The mothers of athletes, forexample, refused to have their pictures taken, which created animosity and an information gap. The communities still believe in witchcraft, this required a lot of time and resources to accomplish.","1. I used whatsApp to do collaborative journalism. I created a WhatsApp group for educated siblings of Jacob Kiplimo and Joshua Cheptegei and convinced them about my project. 
2. I also offered my camera to a family member who made recordings from hostile mothers of athletes. Some had declined to cooperate with me.
3. I did phone call recordings for all talks held with different people. 
4. I used community elders to do fact checking on the historical information gathered. Friends and neighbors of celebrated athletes where instrumental.
5. I spoke in mother tongue to most of the experts and elders in athletics. This created a bold and easy access to information.
6. I establish the family tree of the athletes. This eased my writeup.
7. A graphic representation of the family tree made the story telling easy for the reader to understood.
8. I did mobile journalism in the rural areas, recording the cultural and health lifestyle that the community expect athletes to uphold.","1. Telling stories in rural areas requires humility and being down to earth. The sources will trust you and release the facts of the stories.
2. Collaboration with sources and fellow journalists is key in telling great stories.
3. Data journalism is unique and sells content. Every story that is compelling embeddes the use of data. Figures require fact checking, which enriches the credibility of the story.
4. Stories are better told from the field and not the newsroom. One story leads to a multiple of others.
5. Every story requires time and determination. it took me three weeks to capture all facts about the family bloodline. we should never kill stories by giving up. Lets create more time.
6. Great stories as are of human interest. Once the story affects the people positively, go for it. 
7. Great stories can be told without utilizing a lot of finances. This story required good collaboration and less travel expenses.

It sheds light on the pervasive issue of incest and gender-based violence in Kasese District, Uganda. Through compelling narratives of survivors like Jane Musoki and Rosette, the project addresses the alarming rates of aggravated defilement, early pregnancies, and early marriages in the","The impact of the project is multifaceted, bringing attention to the deeply entrenched issues of incest and gender-based violence in Kasese District. Firstly, it provides a platform for survivors like Jane Musoki and Rosette to share their harrowing experiences, breaking the silence surrounding such taboo topics. By sharing these personal stories, the project contributes to raising awareness about the prevalence of incest and its devastating effects on victims.

Furthermore, the project highlights the alarming statistics of sexual and gender-based violence in the region, drawing attention to the urgent need for intervention and prevention measures. The detailed breakdown of cases, such as teenage pregnancies and early marriages, serves as a wake-up call for local authorities and stakeholders to address these issues promptly.

Moreover, by emphasizing the challenges faced in effectively addressing these problems, such as underreporting and insufficient resources, the project advocates for sustainable funding and improved planning to combat gender-based violence. The recommendations presented in the report provide a roadmap for stakeholders to enhance understanding, improve case management, and prioritize preventive measures.","The project faced several contextual challenges that may not be immediately evident from the work itself. Kasese District, like many regions in Uganda, operates within a specific political landscape that can impact the reporting of sensitive issues such as incest and gender-based violence. Uganda has had instances where media outlets faced government scrutiny or censorship, potentially posing a challenge for journalists to freely report on such topics. This political context may have influenced the degree of transparency and ease of access to information during the project.

Resource constraints are another significant factor. The project acknowledges struggles due to inadequate funds and inefficient data management. In a region where journalism often operates with limited financial resources, this could have impacted the depth and scope of the investigation. The lack of resources might hinder the ability to conduct extensive fieldwork, interviews, or invest in innovative technologies for data collection and analysis.

Legal threats are also a potential concern when covering sensitive topics like incest. In some regions

Access to accurate and comprehensive data on gender-based violence can be challenging. Underreporting of such cases, as mentioned in the project, suggests a broader issue of data accuracy and reliability.","Interviews and Fieldwork: I likely conducted in-person interviews with survivors, community members, and officials to gather firsthand accounts and insights. Fieldwork would have involved visiting locations mentioned in the report.

Data Collection and Analysis: Given the statistical nature of the project, data collection tools may have been employed to gather information on cases of gender-based violence. Analytical tools, such as spreadsheets or statistical software, might have been used to interpret the collected data.

Digital Recording and Transcription: For accuracy and reference, digital recording devices may have been used during interviews. Transcription tools or services might have been employed to convert spoken words into text.

Online Research: Investigative journalists often leverage online resources, databases, and archives to gather background information, legal documents, and relevant statistics.

Communication Tools: To connect with sources and colleagues, communication tools such as email, messaging apps, and video conferencing may have been utilized.

Writing and Editing Software: Standard word processing software for writing, editing, and formatting the final report.","Importance of Giving a Voice to the Voiceless: The project exemplifies the power of journalism in giving a voice to survivors of sensitive and taboo topics. Journalists can learn the importance of using their platform to amplify the stories of those who may otherwise remain unheard.

Addressing Underreported Issues: The project sheds light on the underreported issue of incest and gender-based violence. Journalists can learn the significance of addressing topics that are often overlooked or kept in silence, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of societal challenges.

Data-Driven Reporting: The inclusion of statistics and data enhances the project's credibility and impact. Journalists can learn the effectiveness of incorporating data-driven elements to support narratives, providing a more nuanced and evidence-based perspective.

Navigating Challenging Contexts: The project operates within a complex context, acknowledging political, legal, and resource-related challenges. Journalists can learn the importance of navigating such contexts carefully, employing resilience and strategic approaches to overcome obstacles.

Advocacy for Change: The project goes beyond reporting by presenting recommendations for stakeholders.

How the GRU created a phantom ""PMC"" to recruit thousands of Russians for the war against Ukraine",01/12/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Breaking news, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Video, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights","Animation, AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","Russia’s main military intelligence directorate (GRU) is operating an elaborate network under the guise of a “PMC” Redut to recruit for its war against Ukraine – journalists exposed this secretive system. Complex investigation includes analysis of hundreds of documents found at the waszone, intense open-source research, video and satellite analysis, mapping of the connections between the various armed groups. Journalists proved how Russians are enlisted into this fictitious “PMC” by signing contracts with fake companies and receiving benefits in an opaque cash system. Reporters traveled to the frontlines also revealed on how GRU handlers involved in the torture of Ukrainian civilians.","The key impact of the investigation - exposure to the public and beyond the secretive and duplicitous manner in which the Russian government is enlisting personnel for its all-out war against Ukraine. 
The resonance of the investigation resulted in citations by dozens not only Ukrainian and Russian news outlets, and the findings were cited by prominent chroniclers of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including the Institute for the Study of War and the British Defense Ministry’s daily intelligence briefing on the war. The video portion of this investigation, released prior to the publishing of our interactive text project, has received almost 2 million views on YouTube.
As our investigation revealed, Russian fighters who signed up were deceived by their own government, believing they were enlisting with an actual PMC. This was highlighted by the shroud of silence the families of Redut fighters encountered when they attempted to figure out precisely which entity their relatives had signed up with.
Going forward, our exposure of the Redut network’s clear links to Russian military intelligence could serve as a significant deterrent for potential Russian fighters to sign up to fight in this illegal war.
Also, the European Union imposed sanctions on Redut.","This investigation was initiated by Schemes, the investigative unit of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty, when we found documents of the so-called Redut PMC right in the combat zone during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. Eventually, we found so much information that we decided to invite journalists from Systema, Radio Liberty's Russian investigative unit and central newsroom to cooperate.
The journalists worked in cooperation - the Ukrainian part from Kyiv, under periodic Russian shelling, and the Russian part from third countries. 
In the end, we found ways to work together for a single purpose - to study and analyse all the findings and to find new evidence, which Ukrainian journalists collected when returned to the active combat zone again and again or visited the prisons all other Ukraine where Russian military personnel were being held.
The latest technologies and skills in working with data tools helped to bring all this together.","- Primary collection of physical documents of the Russian military in the war zone;
- AI/machine learning. All kinds of optical character recognition (OCR) services for documents;
- Systematisation of the findings in tables according to different identifiers;
- Identification of hundreds of Russian military by various identifiers - compilation of work with various services and databases;
- OSINT analysis;
- Photo/video face recognition services, face comparison services;
- Analysis of Russian military personnel phone billings;
- Reverse geocoding (i.e. obtaining an address from a geographical point), compiling a general table and then transferring to a map the movements of Russian military units in Ukraine;
- Working with satellite imagery to confirm hypotheses and create a timeline;
- Scraping - collecting information from social networks through recruiters advertising, from Telegram and other databases;
- Under-covered communications with recruiters of Russian military units and interviews with relatives;
- Collection and verification of documents from sources (comparison of seals, signatures, caps, incoming/outgoing numbers, etc.)
- Hours of interviews with Russian military personnel;
- Analysis and geolocation of photo/video footage from obtained Russian military mobile phones, followed by field visits for final comparison of images;
- Analysis of financial records of legal entities;
- Locating and interviewing victims of Russian military action in Ukraine;
- Data cleaning for the whole data-driven investigation","- This is one of the most unique cases of storytelling and investigative reporting, where literally all types of information sources were used: footage and testimonies in field, interviews, identification, billings, photo/video matching, processing of large data sets, data from sources (and from both countries), osint, and even undercover work etc. And this is an example of how you can fit all of these into a complex story;
- We managed to draw a line from the very-most private to the very-most general - from four mercenary-prisoners, we were able to draw a connection all the way to the top of the GRU;
- Our findings show that information from the Internet and even from US sanctions lists that can be considered as common knowledge - can be at least incomplete (at most - untrue);
- Sometimes it is not too late, even at the end of the investigation, just change the angle from which you look at the story, and your hypothesis.

Criada em 2019, essa frente é diretamente ligada a grandes empresas de tecnologia – plataformas digitais, apps de entrega, serviços de hospedagem – e faz pouco esforço para esconder essa ligação.","A reportagem facilita a visualização de dados públicos que eram pouco visibilizados, permitindo navegar pelas informações e compreender as relações de poder envolvidas na Frente Digital de forma mais clara. A transparência de interesses e de representação é crucial nesse momento de debate sobre regulação de redes sociais e plataformas digitais no Brasil.","O Instituto Cidadania Digital declara ter auxiliado a Frente Digital na produção de quatro leis, todas ""de interesse direto da sociedade civil e dos brasileiros da ponta"": o Marco de Startups; a Lei do Governo Digital; a Lei da Telemedicina; a Política Nacional de Educação Digital.

Em 16.mai.2023, o deputado federal Lafayette de Andrada (Republicanos-MG), apresentou o projeto de lei 2582/2023 para servir como uma tão aguardada regulação de plataformas digitais.O texto foi proposto como alternativa ao chamado PL das Fake News (2630/2020), que teve sua urgência aprovada em abr.2023, mas enfrentava forte resistência na Câmara dos Deputados, especialmente por partidos de oposição.

O texto do PL 2630 é particularmente detestado pelas grandes plataformas porque impõe uma série de obrigações e deveres para essas companhias – alguns dos quais seriam inviáveis ou muito difíceis de realizar. Já a proposta de Andrada vai na direção contrária e deixa de fora muitos dos pontos importantes de transparência e moderação que especialistas esperam de uma regulação.

Até o momento, nenhuma regulamentação específica sobre plataformas digitais foi aprovada no Brasil.","Esse especial é baseado inteiramente em informações e documentos públicos presentes nos sites da Frente Digital, da Câmara dos Deputados e do Instituto Cidadania.

보도가 나간 이후, ▲보건복지부는 ‘당신이 치매에 걸린다면’ 치매 환자 간접 체험 인터랙티브 등 본보 기획이 치매 인식 개선에 크게 기여했다며, 이에 발맞춰 그간 부정적 편견을 키워온 치매라는 용어를 내년부터 변경하겠다고 밝혔습니다. ▲배회감지기 보급 확대, 배회인식표 디자인 전면 재검토 등 치매 실종 예방 정책 관련 구체적 개선 방안도 약속했습니다. 또 치매 실종 노인들의 안전한 귀가를 바라는 마음에서 시작한 치매 환자 인식 개선 캠페인 ▲기억해챌린지에는 한덕수 국무총리를 비롯해 박형준 부산시장, 가수 김조한, 배우 허준호 등 각계각층의 인사들이 동참했습니다. 또 한국취약노인지원재단과 독거노인종합센터는 기억해챌린지를 연중 캠페인으로 진행, 치매 어르신들 영양 도시락 사업 등으로 확대해나가겠다는 방침도 밝혔습니다. ▲경찰청과 대한치매학회 등 치매 학계는 행복 GPS 동선 데이터의 정책 활용 가능성을 확인한 만큼, 향후 치매 환자 배회 패턴에 관한 연구를 본격적으로 시도할 것으로 보입니다.","대한민국에서 치매에 걸리면 환자는 물론 가족들도 숨기기 급급합니다. 치매를 둘러싼 부정적 편견이 강한 탓에 치매 환자는 더욱 고립되고 세상과 멀어지기 마련입니다. 하지만 치매 돌봄 선진국은 달랐습니다. 치매 환자 당사자의 목소리가 정책에 반영되고, 치매 환자를 이해하려는 노력도 다양합니다. ‘당신이 치매에 걸린다면’ 인터랙티브 콘텐츠는 치매 환자에 대한 사회적 인식 개선을 끌어올리기 위한 목표로 만들어졌습니다. 선진국에선 치매 환자들의 시선으로 바라본 세상을 담은 영상이 치매 인식 개선 교육 자료로 활용되고 있다는 점에 착안했습니다. 치매는 누구나 걸릴 수 있는 병으로, 치매 환자에 대한 이해도를 높인다면 치매 환자를 바라보는 시선도 좀 더 따뜻해질 수 있습니다. 사용자가 직접 치매 환자가 돼보는 체험을 통해 치매 환자에 대한 이해도를 높이고, 사회적 인식 변화를 이끄는 계기가 됐습니다.
치매 환자의 배회 패턴을 파악하기 위해 시도한 GPS 분석은 국내는 물론이고, 국외에서도 선행연구가 없을 만큼 최초로 시도되는 작업이었습니다. 우선 SK하이닉스의 ‘행복 GPS’ 데이터가 외부로 공개되는 것 자체가 처음입니다. ‘행복 GPS’는 매년 4,000-5,000여명의 치매 환자, 발달장애인을 대상으로 배회감지기를 무상 보급하며, 보건복지부가 위탁사업으로 지정할만큼 단일 규모로는 배회감지기 최대 이용자를 보유한 사업입니다. 사회적으로 활용도가 높은 데이터인 만큼, 경찰청도 배회 패턴 연구 용역을 위해 문을 두드렸지만, 개인정보보호법에 가로막혀 시도하지 못했습니다. 개별 기업의 데이터를 확보, 객관적 분석을 통해 치매 환자의 실종 상황 시 수색 가이드라인으로 활용될 수 있는 정책 가능성의 계기를 마련했다는 점에서 의미가 있습니다.","사용자에게 ‘당신이 치매에 걸렸다면 이렇게 세상이 보일 것이다’라는 컨셉에서 시작했으며, 일반인이 바라보는 치매 환자의 모습이 아닌 최대한 치매 환자의 입장을 시각적으로 전달하는 것에 중심을 두고 제작하였습니다. 치매 환자들이 주로 배회하는 패턴과 길을 잃는 원인 등에 대한 축적된 데이터를 확인하여 일반 사용자가 간접 경험할 수 있도록 영상으로 시각화하였습니다. 화면상 스크롤을 내릴 때마다 치매환자가 평범하게 동네 길을 걷다가 갑자기 배회하기 시작하는 위치를 지도에 표기하여 배치하였으며, 해당 위치에 스크롤이 도착하였을 때 Javascript를 이용하여 치매 환자가 바라보는 세상이 영상으로 재생되도록 구현하였습니다. 
영상과 함께 치매 환자가 느낄 법한 곤혹스러움을 표현한 속마음과 전문가의 소견을 함께 넣어 치매에 대해 좀 더 깊이 직관적이고 이성적으로 이해할 수 있도록 표현했습니다. 또한 단순히 경험으로 끝나는 것이 아닌 치매 환자의 GPS 배회 데이터를 분석하여 어떠한 상황에서 배회 확률이 높은 지 볼 수 있는 차트를 Javascript와 Css를 이용하여 구현하였습니다.
실종 전단지 인터랙티브에서는 실종 당시 사진과 ai기술로 변환된 현재 예상 사진을 구분하여 볼 수 있게 하여, 전단지를 보고 실종자를 알아볼 수 있게 제작하였습니다. 가운데 컨트롤 바를 배치하고 Javascript를 이용하여 좌우로 움직일 수 있도록 구현하였으며, 좌로 이동하면 현재 예상 사진이 우측으로 이동하면 실종 당시 사진이 보이도록 구현하였습니다.","한국일보 엑셀런스랩은 기획탐사 취재팀입니다. 신문기사를 기반으로 하는 레거시한 취재팀이지만, 이번 기획에는 디지털 파트, 영상 파트가 함께 협업하여 플랫폼에 적합한 다양한 콘텐츠를 생산했습니다. 신문용 지면 기사, 온라인 인터랙티브 콘텐츠, 유튜브와 인스타그램을 기반으로 한 롱폼 영상과 숏폼 영상 등 다양한 형태의 콘텐츠를 제작했습니다. 치매 환자를 가족으로 둔 사연과 정책의 문제점, 다른 나라의 사례들은 신문 기사로 발행하고, 영상에서는 치매 아내를 둔 남편의 가족을 하루를 제작했으며, 인터랙티브는 치매 환자의 시선에서 바라 본 세상을 콘텐츠로 제작하여 많은 공감을 얻었습니다. 치매 환자 GPS 동선도 최초로 분석했습니다. SK하이닉스의 사회공헌사업인 ‘행복 GPS’ 배회감지기 이용자들의 6개월치 GPS 동선 데이터를 확보해, 한양대학교 배회연구팀과 함께 배회 특성과 패턴을 분석, 실종 상황 시 수색 가이드라인으로 활용 가능한 기초 자료를 만들었습니다. 치매 환자 GPS 데이터 공개부터 분석까지 모두 국내외 최초 시도입니다. 마지막으로 치매 당사자 커밍아웃 인터뷰, 가상 치매 환자 용산역 배회 사회 실험 등을 시도했고, 실종된 치매 어르신들의 안전한 귀가를 바라는 마음에서 시작한 캠페인 #기억해챌린지도 시작했습니다. 한덕수 국무총리를 비롯해 각계 각층의 인사들이 참여해 치매 환자에 대한 사회적 인식 개선을 촉구하며 부정적 편견을 해소하는 데 기여했습니다. 치매 라는 주제를 두고 다양한 시각과 입장을 보도함과 동시에 여러 형태의 콘텐츠로 제작함으로써 신문에 한정된 독자가 아닌 플랫폼별로 흩어져 있던 다양한 사용자들에게 바이럴되면서 더 많은 공감과 반향을 이끌어 냈습니다.",Korean,https://interactive.hankookilbo.com/v/dementia/chapter2.html,https://interactive.hankookilbo.com/v/dementia/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OFBhMLLJrs&amp;list=PL6dChQlPmND4A4E_dHItuliNdnGDB44f8&amp;index=12,https://www.hankookilbo.com/Collect/8701?Page=3,,,,"엑설런스랩 - 강윤주, 이성원, 박지영

Elle révèle les revenus accumulés par les réseaux illicites dans lesquels sont impliqués de hauts fonctionnaires des pays concernés. Poursuivis pour sa chair et ses écailles auxquelles l'on attribue des vertus médicinales, cette espèce protégée pourrait disparaître.","Dès sa publication le 13 novembre 2023, l'enquête a été en moins d'une heure, l'article le plus lu sur le site Datacameroon, qui reçoit en moyenne 9000 visiteurs par mois. Les liens ont été partagés par de nombreux confrères du Cameroun et d'ailleurs. 

Plusieurs parlent d'une enquête « bien documentée ». Selon un chercheur cité dans le travail, ''C'est un article éducatif pour les agents de l'Etat qui acceptent les pots de vin''.
D'après U.S Agency for Global Media, le sujet '' met en lumière des crimes contre la nature qui sont endémiques dans d'autres régions du monde. « Le travail a suscité un intérêt pour de futures collaborations avec ADISI Cameroun, à l'initiative du projet. 

 Le 21 novembre, l'article est mentionné dans la News Letter de [The Naturebeat] (hhttps://thenaturebeat.substack.com/p/nature-beat-ttps://)destinée aux journalistes et chercheurs environnementaux. Le 14 décembre, deux journalistes de l'équipe sont invités pour édifier le public sur les ondes de Dash radio, une radio urbaine de Douala dans un programme quotidien de 2 heures.
 
L'enquête sera aussi répertoriée dans le top 10 des travaux recommandés par Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) en Afrique fin novembre 2023.","Précisons d'entrée de jeu que cette enquête a été produite dans le cadre du projet ODACA (Open Data For accountability in Central Africa), initié par l'association ADISI Cameroun. Dans le cadre de cette initiative, les journalistes sont sensibilisés sur les questions relatives à la grande corruption, l'un des facteurs majeurs d'appauvrissement des pays en développement. 

Quand elle s'intéresse au trafic des espèces animales protégées, l'équipe du projet constate que les médias dans la Sous-région Afrique Centrale, ont presque toujours mis en avant l'éléphant dans leurs enquêtes, en laissant de côté ce petit animal, présenté comme le plus braconné au monde et dont le trafic génère des milliards. 

Le travail d'investigation est réalisé dans un contexte marqué par la grande consommation de la viande de pangolin par des populations qui ignorent tout du statut de protection de cet animal. Mais surtout, le trafic illicite qui anime un réseau bien ficelé des forêts africaines jusqu'en Asie, avec la complicité de hauts fontionnaires.","Dès le début du projet, une interface de travail a été créé sur **Google Drive** où sont conservés l'ensemble des travaux. 

Dans un premier temps, l'équipe s'est appuyée sur l'exploitation des **ressources documentaires disponibles en ligne** afin de peaufiner les grandes lignes du travail. Des articles de presse, vidéos, rapports d'études et instruments juridiques ont été passés en revue, lus et synthétisés. 

Nous avons parallèlement exploré une **base de données** fournie par Center for Advanced Defense Studies-C4ADS - des fichiers Google Sheets répertoriant des données de saisies d'espèces réalisées entre 2013 et 2023 et relatifs aux pays de l'Afrique Centrale, dont le Cameroun, la RDC, le Congo, le Gabon, et la Guinée Equatoriale. Le scraping nous a permis d'extraire des données pertinentes par rapport aux questions de notre enquête. Nous avons ensuite effectué des analyses, avant de produire grâce à l’application **Flourish,** des graphiques qui représentent par exemple la quantité d’écailles de pangolins saisie en provenance du Cameroun (2013-2022) et de la RDC (2016-2020). 

Les résultats obtenus en ligne ont été croisés avec des données recueillies sur le terrain auprès de diverses sources. Notamment des responsables d'Organisations spécialisées dans la conservation, un écogarde, des fonctionnaires, des agents de la Douane.","Par ce projet, les journalistes pourront apprendre comment remonter la piste d'un trafic intertnational en matière d'espèces animales protégées en se servant d'une base de donnes, d'outils etcnologiques et d'élements de terrain.",Français et anglais,https://datacameroon.com/afrique-centrale-le-trafic-de-pangolin-genere-pres-de-419-milliards-de-f-cfa-par-an/,https://datacameroon.com/especes-protegees-nous-navons-pas-de-moyens-pour-assurer-la-surveillance/,https://biocamer.net/jennifer-biffot-le-pangolin-a-un-role-ecologique-qui-permet-aux-humains-de-bien-vivre/?fbclid=IwAR34k2cr2HEU1Ns3d3OB9wvgh_g1aEdMUvc871H22XaNuVom0zooLjFiuvs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRAFXwlhK9I,,,,"Mathias Mouende Ngamo, Philomène Djussi Fotso , Séverin Thejoce Garba","Mathias Mouende Ngamo est journaliste camerounais.

This interactive, gamified scrollytelling experience simulates the real chances of winning (and mostly losing) in such games, which are highly popular across the country, particularly among the poorest communities. Health organizations warn about growing addictions. This demonstration aims to show all players that no game is profitable for them; it is predetermined to benefit the national lottery.","This project was published very late this year (as French people traditionally enjoy buying scratch-off tickets for Christmas and New Year's Eve), so it's a bit early to assess its full impact.
Shortly after publication, a representative from the public entity Etalab contacted Le Monde. Etalab maintains the platform data.gouv.fr, used for the dissemination of public data and promoting open data from all producers. This representative asked if the data we aggregated for this simulator could be published on the platform, [a request to which we agreed](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/francaise-des-jeux-donnees-des-tableaux-des-gains-jeux-de-grattage/#/resources).

In early January, the board of the National Gambling Authority (ANJ) has urged operators to significantly moderate their promotional strategy in 2024, in order to avoid exerting excessive advertising pressure.

The project has also received very positive feedback from our readers, both via social media and letters to the editor. Additionally, we've received kind and amused messages from people who actually won the jackpot using our ""play a thousand times"" simulator. We had prepared a special message for them in the code, asking them to email us a screenshot of their winnings chart. Three of them have reported ""winning"" one million euros in a game called ""Millionnaire""... Statistically speaking, it had to happen!","The Française des jeux has the legal obligation to publish all monetary prizes associated with each lottery game, but none of this information is compiled and made easily accessible as a CSV for instance. To compile all the data, we had to scrape their website and manually verify all entries to ensure that our simulator was providing users with accurate output.","* We used python to scrape the data and Google sheets to clean it and analyze it
* We used Javascript, node.js, Svelte and d3.js to create the simulator and code the scrollytelling article. We coded within Cursor, an integrated development environment, which allows us to send chatGPT requests about our code if necessary.
* We used Figma and adobe illustrator to design our article and the fake tickets

The story was heavily data-led, including looking at what has changed in India since the Nirbhaya gangrape which shook the country in 2012. 

Most stories reported before my story looked at the topic from the legal lens and not the public healthcare lens.","The video was watched widely by people. There were more stories on healthcare access to sexual assault survivors, which were reported later.","Context in terms of reportage and data: As I have mentioned before, most stories on rape and sexual assault almost always looked at the topic from the legal point of view.

"Tanzania, United Republic of",Nukta Tanzania,Small,,,How coconut husk technology will save miners from the dangers of mercury,05/08/2023,Solutions journalism,Personalisation,"The project involves the production of activated carbon from coconut husks. This activated carbon serves a dual purpose: it can be utilized for gold extraction in mining processes and, critically, it serves as a substitute for mercury. By leveraging coconut husk technology, the project not only contributes to more environmentally friendly gold extraction but also addresses the health and environmental risks associated with mercury, offering a sustainable solution for both miners and the ecosystem.","The project has demonstrated a significant positive impact on both the audience and the community. 

Through its innovative approach of using coconut husk technology for gold extraction and mercury substitution, the project has not only improved the safety and well-being of miners but has also contributed to environmental sustainability. 

The community has witnessed a reduction in the harmful effects associated with traditional mining practices, such as mercury contamination.

Moreover, the project's success story has inspired other journalists and stakeholders in the field. 

The recognition as the best story in the Data Awards provided by the National Bureau of Statistics in Tanzania further solidifies its impact and importance. 

This acknowledgment highlights the project's exceptional contribution to journalism, data-driven storytelling, and its role in raising awareness about sustainable alternatives in the mining industry. 

The recognition is not only a testament to the project's success but also serves as an inspiration for others to explore innovative solutions that can make a positive difference in society.","This story could be projected in Innovative Technology context because the story explains how activated carbon technology serves as a safer and more sustainable alternative to the traditional method of using mercury in gold extraction during mining activities.

The crucial aspect of this innovation is its role as a substitute for mercury in gold extraction. Traditionally, miners have used mercury to form an amalgam with gold particles, a process associated with severe health and environmental risks. The coconut husk technology eliminates the need for mercury, offering a safer and more sustainable alternative.

Environmental Impact:

The use of coconut husk-derived activated carbon minimizes the release of mercury into the environment, reducing the ecological impact associated with traditional mining practices. 

This innovation aligns with environmental sustainability goals by mitigating the harmful effects of mercury contamination.","I interviewed people engeged in Active Carbon Production, Observation skills, reading several reports for reference like environmental reports on the effecys of mecury from WHO, Small Mining report from Tanzania government and active carbon export and import data.","The project showcases the power of seeking and implementing innovative solutions to address long-standing issues. Journalists can learn to explore and highlight stories that feature creative and sustainable approaches to existing problems.

It also demonstrates the intersection of technology with social and environmental impact. Journalists can learn to identify and report on stories that not only introduce new technologies but also assess their broader implications for communities and ecosystems.

Journalists can learn the importance of health and environmental journalism, particularly when covering industries with potential hazards. This project emphasizes the significance of reporting on initiatives that prioritize both human well-being and environmental sustainability.

The project's success is tied to community engagement and empowerment.

Un crime qui consiste à tuer une femme pour la cause qu’elle défend mais aussi parce qu’elle est une femme. Reportages, enquêtes, data, portraits : un travail inédit mené dans plusieurs pays, notamment la Colombie, le Kenya, l’Afghanistan ou encore la Grande-Bretagne. Femmes à abattre, c’est aussi la première base de données répertoriant les femmes victimes de féminicides politiques à travers le monde.","Ce projet a été le premier à mettre en évidence ces assassinats politiques genrés. La presse a relayé notre projet et nous avons reçu de nombreuses demandes d'accès à notre base de données de la part de chercheurs et chercheuses. Nous avons fait naître le concept dans l'espace public (des hommes politiques reprennent l'expression). Nous avons aussi pu organiser deux événements qui ont permis à des femmes victimes du continuum de violences politiques genrées de s'exprimer sur ce sujet. 
Nous avons créé une newsletter avec près de 1000 abonnements à ce jour. Grâce à elle, nous continuons de communiquer sur le concept de féminicide politique.
Le projet a dépassé les frontières de la France puisqu'il traite du féminicide politique dans le monde. Nous avons pu toucher un public très large grâce à nos publications en France mais aussi en Belgique, avec une enquête en flamand dédiée au contexte belge.","Ce sujet a été particulièrement difficile à mener d'un point de vue financier, mais aussi humain. Nous avons dû créer notre propre méthode de travail, collecter l'ensemble des noms de notre base de donnée à la main. Nous n'étions que deux data journalistes. Pour le financement, il a été difficile de faire reconnaître l'importance d'une telle enquête. On a pu nous reprocher une forme de ""militantisme"". Or, cette enquête repose sur des années de travail, mais aussi des dizaines d'interviews d'expertes et des sources minutieusement vérifiées et analysées. 
Pour certaines zones géographiques, l'accès aux données a été plus complexe du fait de l'absence de données sur le terrain ou par ignorance de certaines langues. 
Certains terrains ont été menés dans des zones dangereuses, comme en Colombie.
Il a été très éprouvant de travailler sur les assassinats de femmes. Le recensement de centaines de cas a marqué nos journalistes profondément, notamment nos deux data journalistes qui ont évoqué dans une interview l'impact psychologique d'un tel sujet.","Nous avons essentiellement utilisé Google Sheets. Nous avons extrait nos données de nombreuses base de données existantes (comme HRD Memorial et AWID). 
Nous avons sélectionné une période de 2010 à 2020 pour les assassinats. Nous avons créé un tableau avec plus d'une dizaine de colonnes. Nous avons ensuite sourcé nos informations afin de ""valider"" ou non un cas. Chaque cas a été vérifié ainsi au moins trois fois par nos deux data journalistes. 
Âge, pays, date, éléments biographiques, mode opératoire de l’assassinat, statut judiciaire, précédentes menaces, impact de l’assassinat… Toutes ces informations ont été collectées grâce aux sources ouvertes (articles de presse, réseaux sociaux, documentations judiciaires en ligne, rapports, articles scientifiques, etc.).
Plus nous ajoutions des cas dans notre base de données, plus les tendances commençaient à apparaître. Au total, sur les 431 cas recensés, nous avons pu établir un faisceau d'indices suffisant pour entrer 287 cas dans une première base de données. 144 cas ont été écartés pour plusieurs raisons : elles ont été assassinées avant 2010 ; ce sont des féminicides intimes pour lesquels il n’a pas été possible de prouver l’assassinat politique ; elles n’étaient pas visées (attentat visant des groupes mixtes, accidents, mort naturelle, etc.).","Les journalistes ont maintenant une méthode éprouvée pour identifier de potentiels féminicides politiques. Notre base de donnée permet d'isoler les indices pour conclure au plus proche à un assassinat politique genré.
Ce projet a fait naître ce concept et participe à une meilleure compréhension du continuum de violences subies par les femmes (cis et trans) engagées en politique.

Since Russians cannot get the truth about the Ukrainian war from their own media, we created a map and a secret room inside the popular game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. In a secret room within the map gamers can find information about Russian military operations in Ukraine. The map has been loaded tens of thousands of times ans was widely reported in media around the world.

There are three language versions of the story: Finnish, English, and Russian. Links to all of these are included in this application form.","The government actively blocks foreign news sources in Russia. To get around the blockage we turned to Counter-Strike, which is estimated to have four million users in Russia. Helsingin Sanomat hired two known map builders to create a game map to resemble a Slavic city. In the map ""de_voyna"", when a player dies, they get to see a secret room within the map. The room contains information about the war: maps about missile strikes against civilians, photos of the Butcha massacre, story a man from Odesa who lost his entire family in Russian bombing, and so on.

It's impossible to know how many Russians have seen the room, but the map has been popular and loaded almost 25 000 times. The project was widely covered in international news, and for example AFP and Reuters wrote stories about it.

Also multiple gaming youtubers covered the map and played the game, so the impact is much wider than the map itself.","The story was a part of campaign on the World press freedom day. The story was also published in English and Russian. It is part of the effort by Helsingin Sanomat to offer independent journalism on the war to Russians.

HS is among the media blocked by the Russian government, but for the users using VPN connections, HS has published articles in Russian beginning in the spring of 2022.

The map drew wide international interest. The map was released in early May 2023, and a month later the gaming company Valve blocked Russian users from loading the map.",Technically the the process was much about game design using the tools to create new maps within Counter-Strike.

Open Watch won the Open Data Award at the 2024 Korea Data Journalism Awards.","Open Watch enables continuous tracking of elected officials' power, not only focusing on prominent figures with concentrated power such as members of the National Assembly but also encompassing over 3,800 local council members across 243 regions nationwide.
With various access methods such as browsing, dataset downloads, and APIs, Open Watch facilitates easy participation in monitoring activities not only for professionals and journalists but also for the general public interested in this field. 
Since its launch in September 2023, citizens have utilized Open Watch's data to analyze South Korea's political power and structure. Various initiatives aimed at enhancing democracy have emerged, including proposals for legislative lobbying programs or apps. As an example, citizens have analyzed the disciplinary records of local councilors provided by Open Watch, combining this information with details on each party's district committee chairman and nomination records. This analysis exposes corrupt nomination systems where parties nominate problematic personnel without holding them accountable, allowing them to run for candidacy again. Another effort involves analyzing the political sponsorships of assembly members who exercise formidable power by treating their electoral districts as personal strongholds. Through such analyses, citizens aim to expose political cartels surrounding the nomination.","Firstly, existing open data projects related to political power are mostly created through large media organizations or foundations. Open Watch, whereas, is an exceptional case formed by individual activists gathering around the Center for Freedom of Information(CFOI), a small but deeply rooted nonprofit organization founded in 2008, which has been involved in various data journalism projects though it is a NPO. We envisioned a model where (project)designers, developers and citizens participate as a side project, minimizing operating costs to create an environment where information is accessible to everyone.
Secondly, to collect the data, we have sought contributions from various entities. While utilizing some of the existing open APIs from the National Assembly, we also submitted FOIA requests to various government agencies, including the National Election Commission and local governments. Data collection for local council members posed challenges as their information is dispersed across different formats and websites, with limited open data compared to the central government. Since readily accessible forms like APIs or crawlers were not available, over 50 citizens participated in a datathon to manually gather the data. Additionally, we collaborated with major domestic media outlets(Seoul Broadcasting System) and other nonprofit organizations, sharing data collected through articles or projects.","We retrieved basic parliamentary information through the API provided by the South Korean government's public data platform. To supplement missing data, we wrote web scraping code to extract information from the National Assembly's website. Using this collected data as a foundation, we integrated it with data collected through FOIA requests into a Google Sheet. After confirming data integrity, we synchronized the Google Sheet with a database using the Google API for data synchronization.

To make it easier for future developer participation, we utilized widely used libraries and platforms in the current developer market, such as React and Vercel. Additionally, for scalability and preparation for accumulating a variety of data types and an increasing number of users, we chose the platform named ‘PlanetScale’ as the DB service. For website data analysis, we are using a combination of New Relic and Google Analytics.","Firstly, this site serves as an open data project and can be valuable for many journalists seeking long-term information about public officials. We provide Google Sheets and APIs for all data, enabling individuals with various technical backgrounds to access information efficiently.

Additionally, the collaborative approach of collecting data through the cooperation of citizens, the press, and non-profit organizations is worth considering, especially for smaller media outlets with limited resources.

Lastly, we wish to emphasize that quality information gathered by journalists should not fade away after being used for one-off projects or articles. Instead, by accumulating and making the data accessible to a wide range of individuals, it can evolve into a much more useful shared resource for society.","Korean (preferred), English",https://openwatch.kr,https://docs.openwatch.kr,http://datajournalismawards.kr/2023-winner4/,,,,,"Seunghun Jang(hoony), Joeun Kim, Yujin Lee","Seunghun Jang(hoony): developer and producer.

https://en.zona.media/",Big,,,Bring out your dead. A joint investigation by Meduza and Mediazona,10/07/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","A joint investigation by Meduza and Mediazona reveals the true number of Russian military losses in the invasion of Ukraine as of May 27, 2023. Analyzing existing reports about published obituaries, mortality data from the Federal State Statistics Service, and extensive records from the National Probate Registry, the investigation estimated Russian losses in Ukraine between 40,000 and 55,000 Russian men under the age of 50. When factoring in the number of men wounded so seriously that they did not return to military service, Russia’s total casualty count rises to at least 125,000 soldiers, based on our calculations.","The special presidential order classifies information about military casualties, and it is forbidden to reveal or discuss this topic on social media under the threat of criminal prosecution. While the Defense Ministry undoubtedly has precise data about its own losses, officials haven’t addressed the subject since September 21, 2022, when they claimed that only 5,937 Russian soldiers had been killed by that point in the “special military operation.” 
These figures seem unrealistic to say the least, which is why we started to research the topic. We strongly believe that publicly relevant information should not be hidden and that truth can influence people's opinions (and in that particular case their willingness to sign a contract with the Ministry of Defense and go to the warzone). We believe that people in Russia should know that in 15 months of the war (from February 24, 2022, to late May 2023), three times more Russian soldiers died in Ukraine than Soviet troops over 10 years of war in Afghanistan. Nine times more soldiers were killed in Ukraine than in the first Russian-Chechen War between 1994 and 1996.","Meduza Explanatory Dept plays a key role in the newsroom from the very beginning. Meduza invented such a format, so-called cards, when complex topics are explained in a simple language, and later many other media copied it. At a time when reporting from the ground is extremely difficult, the role of the Explanatory Department has become even more important. They are the ones in charge of all military analysis, defense topics, battle maps, and database investigations in Meduza.
For example, it was our Explanatory Dept who verified that it was the Russian troops responsible for the massacre in Bucha. Meduza’s source provided us with a video that was filmed during the “entrance” of the Russian troops to Bucha. We gave the video to two independent experts (an astronomer and a mathematician) in order to verify when the videos were shot, using chronolocation techniques. Their findings allowed us to confirm that the times in the metadata matches the actual times when the footage was recorded, and that the first video of the bodies couldn’t have been filmed after March 26, 2022, which proved that the horrific civilian killings in Bucha took place before Russian troops retreated from the town.","We have developed our own original methodology for working with different types of data. The main two sources of information were 1) lists of the deceased maintained by Russian journalists on the basis of public obituaries and burial lists, and 2) data from the public Russian Register of Inheritance Cases (RND), which publishes information about some of the deceased citizens in order to inform their potential heirs. We also used a few official documents. None of these sources alone can provide complete information about the military losses, but only their combination, the method of which we had to develop independently allowed us to do so. In addition, our work heavily relied on demographic studies of excess mortality, which have become an essential source of information on the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another methodological technique was the use of the case-control approach, common in medical statistics. On the technical side, we used automatic sampling and parsing of data from public databases, time series analysis, regression and other types of statistical analysis.","In our investigation, we published a detailed description of the method we used to obtain the data. In response to our article, we received many inquiries from colleagues and interested readers, which generated further dialogs around this topic. To everyone who requested, we sent our raw data and advised on the calculations. Some of our readers have expressed a desire to conduct their own research based on our method and to use our method in their calculations.","Russian, English",https://meduza.io/feature/2023/07/10/47-tysyach-pogibshih-rossiyskih-soldat,https://meduza.io/en/feature/2023/07/10/bring-out-your-dead,https://zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats,https://en.zona.media/article/2023/07/10/stats,,,,"Due to security reasons, we cannot disclose the names of the authors until you confirm that this information will not be public.

Japan,Studio LAX,Small,,,Impact of celebrity scandals on gender,31/12/2023,"Investigation, Open data, Women, Crime","Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Tableau, Natural Language Processing, sentiment analysis","We collected typical celebrity scandals in the Japanese entertainment industry from 1996 to 2023. Utilizing publicly available information on celebrities from Wikipedia. 
W analyzed the impact of these scandals on their careers, comparing the degree of impact across various dimensions such as gender and type of scandal.","Through this work, we aim to encourage the public to adopt a broader perspective in rethinking the societal punishment for gender discrimination (inequality). When there is moral deviance, women often face harsher and more prolonged punishment compared to men. If this work can lead the audience of mass media and decision-makers to contemplate the differences that have persisted until now, it will have fulfilled our purpose.","In Japan, the punishment for moral lapses manifests in many ways. Celebrities who deviate morally or commit crimes face penalties from both the market and the public. A direct consequence of such deviations is a reduction in business opportunities; they might be replaced by other actors, or their ongoing projects and series might be abruptly halted. In Japanese, this is referred to as ""Kouban"" (降板). The extent of punishment for such moral lapses varies depending on factors like gender, the timing of the scandal, and the profession of the individual involved. Our project primarily focuses on gender.","(1) During the data gathering stage of our project, we used APIs to collect two datasets: one on scandal news from NDL (National Diet Library) and another on celebrity biographies from Wikipedia. 
(2) In the data cleaning process, we used MySQL to match celebrity scandals (such as excluding political scandals) and performed morphological analysis using KHcoder. We utilized Google Cloud Platform's natural language processing capabilities to determine the extremity of the scandals and to categorize them accordingly.","- During the one and-a half-years of working on this project, we observed new changes in the attitude of Japanese society and mass media towards scandals. This period serves as a record, potentially benefiting future research on scandals and gender studies.
- As our research focuses on scandals, starting from data collected years ago, our aim with this project is merely to present the differences in impact caused by gender and to encourage a broader perspective on this issue. We do not wish to reignite stigma effects due to this project. Also, considering the right to be forgotten, we have decided to omit all specific information about individuals, ensuring that no one person can be identified.","English, Japanese",https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/studio.lax/viz/ImpactofCelebrityScandalsbyGender_17040264108770/Dashboard1,,,,,,,"Yitong Xie, Shanshan Liao","Yitong Xie has been a developer in the wireless communication industry for four years and possesses a constant interest in social sciences.

Netherlands,RTL Nieuws (The Netherlands),Big,,,"Corruption, criminal interference and transgressive behavior in Dutch town halls",27/11/2023,"Investigation, Database, Infographics, Video, Map, Politics, Corruption, Crime","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Corruption, criminal interference and transgressive behavior in Dutch town halls. The RTL Nieuws Research desk investigated misbehavior of public servants. The first time ever this was investigated nation-wide. 

A huge job. We requested integrity reports from all 342 municipalities in the Netherlands, via the Woo (similar to FOIA). and created our own database. 

This data, combined with extensive research, resulted in several news stories. We counted 900 public servants who crossed the line and were punished. Plus a critical note: 'Municipalities fail to register abuses'. Also, we revealed how criminals have easy access to town halls due to poor screening.","Multiple ministers (Internal Affairs and Justice) stated that the results of this investigation are unacceptable and they call local governments to action, to upgrade their screenings and registration concerning misbehaving public servants.

At community-level many local politicians asked questions to local governments, e.g. in Groningen. To make sure the method used to deal with misbehavior will be discussed and improved. 

All our findings are easily accessible to our audience, since we have mapped all our findings in an online 'tool', where every inhabitant can find the results for his or her municipality. This tool was used more than 300.000 times.

We selected 3 articles from this investigationfile, that are translated for the Sigma Awards, see the link below, number 4.","“The newsroom looked more like a mailroom than a news floor,” said one colleague. More than three thousand reports were analyzed. 
 
Keeping track of so many Woo/FOIA requests was difficult. Not every municipality wanted to cooperate, even though they have to by law. Breach of privacy was a common ground for refusal, or municipalities refused to provide data since they were afraid to openly share integrity-breaches. Ultimately, after many phone calls and e-mails, most municipalities finally delivered.

We created our own dataset. We received, e-mails, excel sheets and hard-copy information. Since there is no general method for local governments to register integrity-breaches, we labeled all data ourselves. Is it corruption? Sexual harassment etc. This data-set served as a basis for several news stories. E.g. an overview of punished public servants and a critical note: local governments fail to deal with integrity-breaches.

We also focused on 'criminal undermining' (a spearhead of the Research desk, to show the impact of criminal subversion on citizens). We did extensive research by talking to sources, sifting through local media, court decisions, inspecting criminal files and inquiring with experts and the municipalities involved. All cases and extra information were added to our database.","We used Flourish to visualize the research results and case studies.
We used Pinpoint to specifically search for cases in documents and we also used Tabula and similar tools to convert information from PDFs into data files.","To do an investigation this big takes a lot of patience and determination. 342 integrity request do demand a lot of time and effort from researchers. Especially in the Netherlands, where governments do not tend to follow the law concerning these WOO-requests, it's very common for them to delay or to not respond at all. The lesson learnt is that determination pays off. It also shows that it is possible to create accessible news stories from piles of unorganized and incomplete data. Unique content is in our hands now, from local governments throughout the country. Furthermore: administrative integrity sounds soporific. But it didn't stop us from starting this investigation. It was a challenge to come up with the right words, graphics and headlines to present an attractive news-story. Politicians on as well national and local levels are calling for action now.

The grocery basket calculator not only computes current costs but also compares them to the previous year. In the backdrop of Pakistan's economic challenges, where inflation significantly impacts daily expenses, this tool empowers users to make informed grocery spending decisions. Inflation data enables users to gauge price fluctuations, aiding in proactive budget adjustments. The calculator facilitates smart choices amidst rising prices, offering a valuable tool for households in Pakistan.","The grocery basket calculator designed for Pakistan goes beyond metrics, directly impacting individuals and the community. In a nation grappling with economic challenges and inflationary pressures, this innovative tool becomes more than just a calculator—it becomes a catalyst for informed decision-making and financial empowerment.

By providing a platform that calculates the current cost of a typical grocery basket and compares it to prices from the previous year, the tool enables users to navigate the complexities of inflation. It equips individuals with insights into the dynamic nature of prices, facilitating proactive adjustments to their budgets.

The impact transcends personal finance; it contributes to enhanced financial literacy within the community. As users engage with the calculator, they not only manage their grocery budgets effectively but also gain a deeper understanding of economic dynamics, fostering a more financially literate population.

Furthermore, the initiative could potentially inspire other journalists and innovators to innovate data visualisations for addressing financial news. It serves as a tangible example of using data visualisations apart from charts and hard data to understand numbers in a way they affect our everyday lives. This project stands as a testament to the transformative power of data visualisation.","The data was eaily accessible from the official webiste. 

Due to our small team consisting of only two members, we face constraints in creating entirely new projects with limited resources. However, when Flourish introduced a new feature, the calculator, I saw an opportunity for experimentation. At the time, Pakistan was grappling with high inflation rates, and leveraging this calculator to inform our audience about the escalating cost of living seemed both straightforward and innovative. Implementing this idea required coding to enable the calculator to compute the percentage increase in prices.","I utilized the Flourish calculator template, which required the incorporation of HTML and conditional statements to establish the underlying logic for the calculations. To ensure accuracy, a spreadsheet was employed to compile the data and cross-verify the results generated through coding.","Numerous methods exist for conveying numerical information, particularly in economic news. For individuals who may find it challenging to grasp inflation trends depicted in charts, the concept becomes more accessible when illustrated through the metaphor of a basket. This approach effectively demonstrates how inflation impacts the everyday items people use, providing a tangible connection to the real-world effects on their lives.

United Kingdom,"BBC News, BBC World Service",Big,,,Counting Russia’s dead in Ukraine - and what it says about the changing face of war,16/06/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border","Animation, Microsoft Excel, R, RStudio","Russia has a history of concealing its military losses. So when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the BBC’s Russian service and partners at Mediazona began the arduous exercise of collecting and verifying the names and details of Russian fighters killed in Ukraine, cross-referencing with local reporting, court files, cemeteries and calls to families. After 16 months we had confirmed 25,000 individuals, dwarfing Russia’s official count of 6,000. Analysis revealed Russian troops dying in early 2022 had primarily been young, professional soldiers. A year, later most of those dying appeared to be older, less experienced and likely recruited from prisons.","The online story ran in English, Russian, Ukrainian and 16 other languages. Together they garnered more than 3 million page views. The story also aired on the BBC News channel and 6 o’clock and 10 o’clock news bulletins, which collected a further 9 million viewers. A radio package aired on the BBC’s Today programme, Newsday and BBC World radio bulletins. And US-based PBS radio network cited the BBC investigation in its bulletins and broadcast an interview with the authors. 

The project findings were cited by leading media outlets including New York Times, Economist, Politico, The Times and The Guardian. The data has also been acknowledged by Institute for the Study of War as well as by UN officials in open and closed hearings and has been cited in scientific papers, such as “Ethnic and regional inequalities in Russian military fatalities in Ukraine” by Alexey Bessudnov.

Most significantly, at least 15 families learned about the fates of their loved ones and managed to find their final resting places because of our reporting.","Collecting data in a conflict zone is tricky at the best of times. In our case, the very premise of the story is that Russia is deliberately concealing or underplaying its military casualties in Ukraine, meaning we’d face additional obstacles trying to find credible information.

We were also working as an international team. Many of the journalists involved were advised not to enter Russia or Ukraine. Our solution to this problem was to be innovative and flexible - using shared resources, working in areas where we did have access, and protecting our human sources in more dangerous areas.","The BBC and its partners used traditional techniques in order to compile an authoritative list of confirmed Russian deaths in Ukraine. Names and details of fighters who died were gathered and verified by consulting popular Russian social media platforms, local news reports, court records, cemeteries, and by speaking with the deceased’s friends and family members. All information was logged in a cloud-hosted database, enabling cross-border collaboration. 

BBC journalists then used R to clean, translate and analyse the verified data. 

The cleaning process was not insignificant - given the many hands and various sources involved, inconsistencies were numerous and not all data categories were complete due to a shortage of confirmed information. We checked that our numbers were sensible at different points of time based on estimates of losses during high-profile military manoeuvres , such as the high-casualty Bakhmut offensive.

By isolating the ‘first’ and ‘latest’ 3-month periods of the conflict and extracting a typical fighter’s characteristics for each grouping, we could show how Russia’s fighting force had changed over the course of a year. Further analysis allowed us to highlight some of the unprecedented detail our original dataset was able to provide.","This story would not have been possible without the expertise of the data-collection team, who had the foresight at the start of the conflict to know that Russia’s government would be unlikely to report accurate military losses. Their commitment to a methodical data-gathering process gave us as authoritative a picture of Russia’s military casualties as possible.

We believe this project shows how a lack of data does not mean a lack of a story. And although long and hard work might be required to reach that story, it can pay off. We had a great and dedicated team, who were willing to do the grunt work to make it happen.

Germany,CORRECTIV,Small,,,Wie ernst die Lage in den Frauenhäusern ist,06/03/2023,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Women","Scraping, R, Python","In 2022, most women's shelters in Germany were pushed to their limits. As a result, women seeking protection from violence were often unable to find a shelter with a vacancy in their area. Nationally, there is a shortage of around 3,500 places in shelters. At the same time, many shelters lack secure funding. By working with data and local journalists, this CORRECTIV.Lokal project sheds light on how difficult it is for women affected by violence to find protection.","For the first time, our research has provided an overview of how overwhelmed women's shelters in Germany actually are. Neither politicians nor the two major women's shelter associations in Germany had previously had a clear overview. The data we collected was used by local journalists for almost 60 local media publications. In several federal states, members of state parliaments asked “Kleine Anfragen”, or inquiries for parliamentary oversight, based on our research.",Women who experience domestic violence and their children are among the most vulnerable groups in Germany. They do not have a strong lobby that stands up for them. Women's shelters are chronically underfunded and often have to turn away dozens of women a day. This is sometimes a matter of life and death for affected women and their children. Our research highlights just how dramatic the situation is in German women's shelters. And how politics and society leave those affected to fend for themselves.,"From January 1 to December 31, 2022, we scraped occupancy data for all women's shelters and safe houses listed on the „Frauenhaus-Suche“ (women’s shelter search) map three times a day (8 a.m., 12 p.m. and 6 p.m.). Shelters can also note whether they have room for women with children.

In total, there are around 400 women's shelters and safe houses in Germany. Of those, 336 were listed on the website. Our analysis focused exclusively on the shelters. Furthermore, we limited our analysis to only shelters that shared occupancy data on at least 288 days of the entire year (80% of the time).

In the end, 200 women's shelters met these requirements. They form the basis for our analysis. In Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen, none of the women's shelters met our analysis criteria. After analysing the data, we shared an overview with journalists in our local network, who then reported on the situation in their region. To this day, the scraper is still running, allowing us to provide yearly updated statistics for local journalists to continue reporting on the issue.","This project is a testament to the fact that meaningful data journalism does not have to be technically complex. Scraping and analysing the data was relatively straightforward. And while the results of the analysis itself are shocking – on average, the analysed shelters reported that on 303 days of the year they were completely full – it was ultimately the testimonies from the many managers and staff that we spoke to that show why the situation is so urgent. The data simply helped us prove that chronic underfunding and burnout are not outliers.

Collaboration also played a central role in the project. In partnership with CORRECTIV.Lokal, dozens of local journalists have published stories about the situation in their region. Since women’s shelters are managed by each of Germany’s 16 federal states, partners were able to provide additional context and reach more readers than just us alone. We believe that this type of national-local collaborative journalism is key to informing people about nationally relevant topics on the local level, and a creative way to reach many different audiences.",German,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/2023/03/06/haeusliche-gewalt-frauenhaus-platz-finden/,https://lokalmap.correctiv.org/?investigation=frauenhaeuser,,,,,,"Jonathan Sachse, team lead CORRECTIV.Lokal

Una vez que definimos el enfoque y el hilo narrativo, trabajamos en paralelo con las compañeras de diseño y desarrollo para sacar el máximo partido a los datos y al texto. La propia estructura, dividida en décadas, está marcada por el análisis de los datos: para cada década, se calcularon los valores medios de las propiedades de cada canción que facilitan los datos de Spotify. De esa forma, pudimos extraer cuál es la canción ""media"" o más representantiva de cada época.

Además, tuvimos que lidiar con cuestiones legales relacionadas con los derechos de autor de las canciones y los fragmentos que se pueden escuchar en el reportaje.","**Recolección y análisis de datos**
Creamos una base de datos con todos los números uno a partir de fuentes oficiales. Con el código de Spotify que cada tema tiene asociado, hicimos llamadas a la API con Python. El posterior análisis de los datos lo hicimos con el mismo lenguaje. Para obtener el tema más representativo de cada década, buscamos la canción con los valores más cercanos a la mediana.

**Diseño**
Del paquete Adobe, empleamos Photoshop para el tratamiento de las imágenes localizadas al inicio de cada capítulo y las que se incluyeron en los interiores de algunas canciones e Illustrator para los gráficos, tanto radiales como los que después se desarrollaron con código y los iconos vectoriales.
Para cortar las canciones emplemos Audacity. Utilizamos Figma para el UI y la interfaz de la landing, tanto en escritorio, como en móvil, así como Procreate, para los dibujos.

**Desarrollo**
En la parte Front-End de desarrollo hemos utilizado de forma generalizada en todo el proyecto HTML5, SASS como preprocesador de CSS y JavaScript.
Utilizamos la librería D3.js para visualizar los datos del mapa de calor de los números uno semanales.
Para la visualización de canciones de forma interactiva hemos utilizado la librería P5.js","Creemos que en nuestro entorno no es muy habitual elaborar reportajes con datos relacionados con el mundo de la cultura, ya que la mayor parte de los temas suelen ser sobre asuntos políticos o económicos. Por eso, uno de los aprendizajes puede ser abrir las posibilidades del periodismo de datos a ámbitos y enfoques menos comunes.

Por otra parte, consideramos que el punto fuerte de este proyecto es la innovación en el diseño y el desarrollo, principalmente a la hora de visualizar el sonido y destacar las características principales de los temas de cada década. De igual forma, también hemos dado mucho peso a la ilustración, algo cada vez más extendido en referentes internacionales, como el South China Morning Post.

With open defecation often the only option, citizens face shocking conditions, risking robbery, sexual assault and even wildlife attacks as they are forced to seek the privacy of the bush. Many citizens – especially children – are at risk of deadly fecal-oral diseases, as a result of human feces seeping into the ground, contaminating crops alongside key water sources used for drinking and cooking.","The work generated substantial impact inside and outside of the country. Within 24 hours, the Namibian government responded to our three-part investigation, accepting that the report had “laid bare” the “glaring challenges” in the sanitation sector, before outlining a series of new promises and goals for improving sanitation standards in 2023. UNICEF and a sanitation-focused NGO also praised the investigation and the results as providing material with which to hold the government accountable.

A second follow-up, six months later, found that the Namibian government had – for the first time ever – begun constructing quality dry toilets in rural areas and providing necessary training and outreach. Our follow-up included interviews with individuals who had received dry toilets and the necessary training to maintain them. They detailed how their lives had changed thanks to the introduction of improved sanitation facilities. 

Stakeholders in the private sector outlined that they had, after multiple attempts, finally secured meetings with members of relevant ministries who also visited a pilot project for the toilet in Windhoek. 

The work generated results outside of Namibia, too, earning recognition in North America, and Europe, sparking additional coverage opportunities for the team and partnerships with outlets inspired by the work.","To fund this project, the team required additional financial support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. Given the ambition of the project – which required traveling across the entire country, to both rural and urban areas, to collect stories from all Namibians – we required the funding to cover travel costs and ensure the team cast an expansive net on the issue of sanitation. Rather than make broad generalizations, we wanted to understand how the issue manifested in more remote areas vs. informal settlements vs. city centers.

In our analysis of the Government's Accountability Report, we encountered a major challenge in data accessibility regarding the sanitation budget. Allocations for sanitation were dispersed across various ministries, each managing distinct water and sanitation projects. This decentralization meant no consolidated figure for total sanitation expenditure existed. We collected individual budget items from these ministries into our dataset. Due to the complexities and to ensure accuracy, we refrained from aggregating these figures into a single total.","1. **GDELT**: Essential in the initial research phase for gathering news articles on Namibia's sanitation, providing context and background.

Nuestra investigación combina técnicas de análisis de datos y reporterismo tradicional sobre el terreno para poner números a la expansión del eucalipto en Galicia, subrayar la necesidad de monitorizar mejor ese crecimiento y las consecuencias de ambas dinámicas.

Se trata de una historia regional que sin embargo manda un aviso a todo el continente.","La publicación recibió 6.000 visitas, con un elevado tiempo de permanencia, y motivó un acalorado debate en redes como Twitter. El reportaje también despertó el interés de las emisoras de radio Onda Cero y Radio Nacional, en las cuales intervinimos en directo —concretamente, en los programas de Julia en la Onda y A Media Mañana— para explicar nuestra investigación y exponer las conclusiones.","El debate acerca de los peligros del eucalipto en Galicia está muy politizado, con un gobierno regional prácticamente monopolizado por el Partido Popular que ha defendido históricamente al sector maderero en detrimento de la gestión forestal y el riesgo de incendios. La principal consecuencia de ese desequilibrio es la ausencia de datos e informes que permitan analizar el tema con rigurosidad y sobre todo perspectiva histórica, un vacío que muchos aprovechan para tergiversar cifras y justificar argumentos viciados.

Asimismo, el mayor peligro de la especie es a futuro, ya que mientras las plantaciones estén explotadas el riesgo de fuego es menor. Esa amenaza aún imperceptible conduce a muchos a subestimarla y restarle importancia, pero en una región que arde tanto, con la despoblación y el envejecimiento poblacional disparados y la tierra tan compartimentada, es un factor que debería tenerse muy en cuenta.

Ante la ausencia de datos y la politización del debate, nuestra investación adoptó un enfoque más científico: ayudándonos de entrevistas con expertos y estudiosos de la materia, así como de la experiencia de los propios bomberos forestales de la región, pudimos desgranar los peligros de la descontrolada expansión del eucalipto en Galicia.","Además del reporterismo sobre el terreno, utilizamos el análisis cartográfico para mapear la expansión del eucalipto en Galicia y el análisis de datos de estadísticas públicas para ponerle números.

También acudimos las solicitudes de información pública para tratar de aportar más contexto al reportaje, pero la opacidad de los organismos públicos regionales frustó nuestros intentos.","Los incendios en Europa han entrado en una nueva fase, y en muchos lugares es necesario anteponerse al fuego para poder luchar contra él, gestionando de forma activa el campo. Ese nuevo enfoque requiere también de historias como esta, ejemplos regionales que en un futuro pueden ser muy útiles en otros rincones del continente.

También pone el foco en una dinámica cada vez más importante y a menudo pasada por alto: el abandono rural y el crecimiento del bosque, sobre todo sin planificar ni controlar, equivale a más combustible para las llamas. Hay que cuidar de nuestros espacios naturales y velar por la sostenibilidad de su desarrollo, algo para lo que es imprescindible proteger e incentivar la actividad rural.

The plant was damaged by an earthquake and tsunami in 2011, and the wastewater has accumulated since then. This visual story examined to explain the controversial plan to discharge water by using 3D models. China opposes the water release and restricts imports of Japanese food. Decommissioning the plant would take 30 to 40 years, Japan has only begun the first step.","We published the content simultaneously in Japanese and English, and got a cumulative total of more than 130,000 viewers.

Our content focuses on the decommissioning process of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant, which suffered a nuclear accident in 2011. In August 2023, 12 years after the accident, the Japanese government decided to discharge treated wastewater into the sea for the first time.

Our team created a 3D model from the numerous photos to give readers a hands-on understanding of the water discharge plan. The content was widely quoted on social networking media and in other media, and was highly recognized for its ease of understanding and technological advancement.

The Chinese government has opposed the discharge of treated wastewater into the sea and has imposed an embargo on seafood. There is also opposing posts on social networking sites, which conveyed the propaganda using false images. We ccovered these opposing posts on social media after publication of the visual story.","Since the accident in March 2011, the nuclear plant premises have continued to change. The number of tanks storing treated water has exceeded 1,000. However, the Japanese law imposes various restrictions on photographing inside the plant, even by the media, due to security concern. Geographically, the plant is located along the coast and is not visible from outside the site.

Our team chartered a helicopter and attempted to take photos from a distance of three kilometers from the plant, which is outside the scope of the government regulations. Then we created the 3D models from more than 4,000 photographs to explain the mechanism and route of the wastewater discharge.

For this content, we used """"photogrammetry"""" technology, which creates 3D models from multiple photographs. The content also expressed a sense of realism by combining satellite photos and photos taken at the nuclear power plant.","The 3D model we created in this project has a very large data size. Therefore, we come up with a better way to ensure smooth display on the web.

We used the 3D software Metashape and Blender to reduce the data size. We then imported the 3D model into Blender and used Blender's camera tool to visualize the process. After that, we used Aftereffects to process the colors and other design elements of the wastewater discharge process. Finally, the images were exported as a series of sequentially numbered pictures.

Japan,"Nikkei, Nikkei Asia",Big,,,Western machine tools evade sanctions to fuel China's nuclear program,07/11/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Economy",3D modeling,"This project is a year-long investigation that sheds light on significant loopholes in supply chains that enabled China's main nuclear lab to obtain sensitive Western technologies. 
Nikkei analyzed more than 900 bidding and contract documents disclosed by the military lab since 2022 with experts, and found that it has circumvented international export restrictions to procure Western machine tools. Machine tools are subject to export controls in various countries because they are the heart of modern manufacturing and could be used for developing nuclear weapons.

Nikkei's investigation suggested that sensitive Western technologies have fueled China's nuclear forces buildup unintentionally.","The article in Japanese has reached approximately 290,000 readers and got around 50 new paid subscribers.

One senior official belonging to the U.S. Department of Commerce posted on social media that this work did a good job of explaining China's Military Civil Fusion strategy. Another senior official of the U.S. Congress contacted Nikkei because he was impressed with our keen investigation and found machine tools were a blind spot on export controls. One prominent U.S. political scientist introduced this story in his opinion essay in the New York Times essay.

Some overseas media such as Yonhap News Agency in South Korea and Liberty Times in Taiwan quoted our report.

In response to our reporting, the Japan's chief cabinet secretary addressed that the government needed to tighten export controls to prevent dual use products from being diverted into military use. 

In December 2023, the Japanese government has changed the policy and added the China's nuclear lab to the End User List, which details foreign importers involving in the development of weapons of mass destruction. After that, the practitioners between Japan and Germany have begun to discuss the matter because these two countries have the top market share in machine tools industry.","There had been suspicion that Western technology was leaking to China, but there has been little clear evidence so far. We obtained official bidding documents and turned up the names of the companies and products mentioned in them as hard evidence.

The project was done as it became increasingly difficult to acquire data in China. China amended the anti-espionage law in 2023 to strengthen its information control. Although the bidding data is public information, we were very careful about proceeding with interviews, as there was a risk of endangering interviewees in China.

Moreover, we thought that the project needed to focus on an individual to make the article more narrative. We collected videos and photos published by China's state media that showed a Chinese engineer operating a high-performance advanced machine tool of a Japanese manufacturer. We identified the Chinese technician and -- after clearing up legal issues -- showed his face and name.

Eventually, we were able to reveal the aims of the authoritarian state, which is targeting Western technology, through the OSINT method.","Our team analyzed a variety of open sources to reveal what has been procured by the China's nuclear lab. One of the sources is official bidding documents. We took notice of the fact that the research institute has announced on its own platform the technologies or products it wants to procure.

One difficulty is that the documents were written in Chinese. We've read and interpreted every sentence carefully, and verified the names of companies and product models.

Analysis of such publicly available information was combined with interviews with employees who worked in the factories. The reporters also contacted dozens of manufacturers that were listed on the bidding documents and tried to clarify if they knew about the alleged leaks.

Also, our team worked hard on visualization. We created a 3D model of a machine tool based on a catalog. Our goal was to help readers understand its capability by reconstructing the complex movements in 3D form.

To distribute our visual story more widely, we created a video documentary, NIKKEI Film, based on the story. It helped our readers to understand the context.","Reporting on authoritarian states is becoming increasingly important and necessary.

China is increasing surveillance, blocking access to data from outside the country and even moving to keep official statistics from public view.

Russia is also clamping down on freedom of speech and restricting journalistic activities. North Korea is another country where it is extremely difficult to get reliable information.

However, we don't need to give up. Based on public information that few may be aware of, there are still opportunities to uncover the hidden facts of these states, companies and individuals.

It was also a key point that Western nations are beginning to recognize the importance of the supply chains in terms of economic security. As the world griows more internationalized, supply chains are getting more intricately intertwined. Unexpected risks may be exposed by carefully tracking supply chains.","Japanese, English",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/china-nuclear-supply-chain/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/china-nuclear-supply-chain/,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Nikkei-Film-China-s-nuclear-program-siphons-sanctioned-machine-tools,https://www.nikkei.com/telling/DGXZTS00006180T00C23A8000000/,,,,"**Reporter and Editors**

Vue 3, Tailwind
JavaScript/HTML/CSS
Python","This story dives deep into the issue of divorce in the Philippines, examining why it’s the only country today (save for the Vatican) without access to this basic right.

The story aims to shed light on how the inordinate influence of the Catholic Church and the conservative laws in place continue to put Filipino women and children at a disadvantage. Rather than taking a traditional approach to presenting facts, the reader follows a canonically Filipino female character and accompanies her around distinctly Filipino contexts throughout the piece.","This story was shared internally and used as reference material within Facebook groups advocating for divorce in the Philippines. There are very few reliable sources of truth regarding this topic: even on official government websites, information about the various legal processes involved in severing marital ties are either hidden or scattered across several pages. Articles from law firms or explainers from news websites are well-intentioned but often inconsistent in the information they share, probably due to the fact that divorce is still considered a taboo topic, leaving people hesitant to share their opinions or personal experiences.

The story received 1,423 views, with an average engagement time of 48 seconds. It also got 514 likes and 108 shares on Instagram.","Navigating the legal system in the Philippines as a woman seeking divorce is fraught with emotional and financial hurdles. Check any website advertising legal services for annulment or separation, and there is a high likelihood they contradict each other, mix up terms or list wildly different amounts for services. Add to this the fact that many persons seeking separation or annulment are women who have been out of employment for many years and do not have financial solvency on their own, and this creates a culture of staying in abusive marriages for the sake of financial security. While there has been some progress in getting a divorce bill passed through the lower house of the Philippine legislative body, there remains several other levels to overcome before a proper divorce bill is passed into the constitution.","Our research was composed of a primary source interview supplemented by secondary sources in the form of websites and listings for legal services related to annulment/legal separation. We also processed data from the Philippine Statistics Authority on religious distributions and rates of filings for annulment/legal separation over time.

For our primary source, we spoke with a public servant with experience in all three branches of government and intimate knowledge of the legal process to obtain annulment from the perspective of both an applicant and as someone in the judiciary. Their insights were corroborated against existing legislation and records from the Philippine House of Representatives.

For data visualisations, we used Observable and Flourish to generate the base charts. These were exported as SVGs and edited further in Adobe Illustrator. 

The comic was first scripted based on our research of common timelines and prices for each part of the process, then storyboarded and drawn. It was the subject of several revisions, initially starting as a timeline before becoming a comic.

We intentionally referenced religious and domestic elements of Philippine culture throughout the story. This was meant to bring readers into the world of a normal Filipina woman seeking to leave her husband.","Working on this story taught the team to be enterprising in seeking out data. We interviewed an anonymous source who shared her unique experience as someone who underwent the process of annulment and works in the Philippine government. We also consulted representatives from women’s organisations and legal firms to ensure we were building the story on solid factual ground.

But just because we suddenly had a surplus of data to work with didn’t mean we were to inundate our readers with too much information. We learned the importance of breaking down concepts into smaller, digestible chunks, making it easier for the reader to grasp and ultimately empathise with. We also balanced out these facts with emotional resonance: underscoring the universality of Susan’s emotions without losing the cultural nuances of the issue.

This way, our team appeals to international audiences who may not be as aware of the issue, and Filipino readers who might be unsure of their stance on this fundamental right. When writing about a topic as contentious and controversial as divorce, we found it’s important to cast our nets wide in the hopes of bringing more attention to this underreported issue.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/divorce-and-women-rights-in-the-philippines,,,,,,,"Writer / Angel Martinez

Japan,"Nikkei, Nikkei Asia",Big,,,100th anniversary of the Great Kanto Earthquake: How fires spread across Tokyo for 46 hours,25/08/2023,"Explainer, Open data, Map","D3.js, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite","Tokyo marked the 100th anniversary of the Great Kanto Earthquake on Sept. 1 2023. The earthquake registered magnitude 7.9, and fires triggered by the quake turned into inferno. Of the some 105,000 dead or missing, more than 900,000 people were killed in the fires. Nikkei reconstructed of how the fires lasted for 46 hours to burn down 40% of the Japanese capital, based on records.","Japan is prone to earthquakes and has been hit by major earthquakes frequently since the Great Kanto Earthquake. In addition to damages by tsunamis and collapsed buildings, there is a big risk of fires in Japan. The most recent example is a large fire in Wajima city, Ishikawa prefecture, caused by the Noto Peninsula earthquake on Jan. 1, 2024. The wooden homes in Wajima are built along narrow roads that prevent easy access by firetrucks and complicate evacuation efforts. Even after 100 years since the Great Kanto Earthquake, areas with dense wooden housing still remain in Tokyo and other cities. By reproducing how the fires lasted and spread, we once again raised public awareness of disaster prevention and mitigation, and adovocated the importance of preparation based on lessons learned from the past. In Japan, this work was received the Jury Prize (Judges' Choise) in the Japan Typography Yearbook 2024, which publishes outstanding works of communication design using letters. It was also picked in Data Journalism Top 10 by Global Investigative Journalism Network on Sept. 10 2023.","In Japan, Sept. 1 is designated as ""Disaster Prevention Day,"" and its origin can be traced to the Great Kanto Earthquake that occurred in 1923. However, in a survey conducted by the Japanese Red Cross Society in 2023, almost half of the respondents answered that they did not know the origin of the day, indicating awareness of past disasters has waned despite Japan being an earthquake-prone country. In order to minimize the damage from earthquakes in Japan, it is important to be prepared on a daily basis and to have an awareness of disaster prevention among individuals, and thus we wanted to launch content that would lead to disaster prevention and mitigation on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Great Kanto Earthquake. Since the event occurred 100 years ago, we had to do the diligent work of creating data from old survey records that showed the spread of fire with arrows and other symbols on a map.","While the entire map is composed of scrollytelling, we used a slider forthe part showing fire spread to enhance operability. Since there was no digital geospatial data available to show how the fire spread and what Tokyo was like 100 years ago, we created our own GeoJason data format based on the digital archive images of the Disaster Management Library in Tokyo. First, we created a prototype by extracting the elements of each fire spread area at each time from the digital archive images, and then created vector data of the fire spread area manually tracing each area at each time using Adobe Illustrator. We also traced the base map of the time in the same way. We georeferenced, or added geographic information to the extracted images using QGIS, a Open Source Geographic Information System licensed under the GNU General Public License. The data was then formatted into GeoJason format using GDAL. Georeferencing was performed on the data for the extent of the fire spread at all times. We used deck.gl to display the maps on the web.","As time goes by, the public's interest in disasters and accidents that cause extensive damage wanes, and the lessons learned and the importance of preparedness are gradually forgotten. In order to prevent such fading, various methods have been used in the past, such as reporting the testimonies of disaster victims, to convey what happened at the time of the disaster. In addition to these conventional methods, we feel that using maps and data to visualize and report what happened at that time will deepen readers' understanding and help raise their awareness of disaster prevention. In addition, even if data that can be used as is does not exist for past events, many documents and maps have been digitized and preserved, and we have realized the usefulness of utilizing such materials.","Japanese, English",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/kanto-earthquake-46hours/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/kanto-earthquake-46hour/,,,,,,"**Reporters**

Among those who rely on the river are 30 federally recognized Native American tribes, who have called the upper and lower river basins home since time immemorial. These tribes currently hold the rights to about one-quarter of the Colorado River’s water, a share that could increase as outstanding claims are settled. 
 
Indigenous leaders are demanding a seat at the table to help chart out a path forward. Our interactive project brings this important story to our international audience.","Upon publication, Crisis on the Colorado immediately generated discussions on social media about the impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities. It was praised by Indigenous leaders along the river basin, and by academics and environmental groups, who said it would be a key tool in raising awareness of the vital need for Native American communities to have a seat at the table as water negotiations ramp up in the years ahead.
 
This was the first time this story has been told in such rich detail to an international audience, and it has put a new global spotlight on this issue, which will help to hold US politicians accountable as they navigate the Colorado River crisis.","This project, which explores the effects of climate change through a crucial intersectional lens, centers the voices of Indigenous leaders along the Colorado River, from Southern Ute, to Gila River, to Fort Mojave. In working to understand their concerns and priorities, Jillian and Megan drove more than 1,000 miles along the river system, stopping at key communities along the way. They boarded a boat to tour Antelope Canyon, and flew in a small plane over Lake Powell, where marks on the rock walls show how high the water once was.
 
In addition to their on-ground reporting, Jillian and Megan spent months researching this story and speaking with historians, environmental advocates, legal experts and others.","To visualize the scale of the drought, we used before-and-after satellite imagery and immersive maps that took readers on a journey along the river. The final interactive combined a rich narrative with photos, videos and graphics, giving readers a comprehensive understanding of what’s at stake.","Indigenous communities can no longer be ignored; despite the past century of exclusion, they are a critical part of this waterway’s present and future.

Left behind were the ruins of 530 villages and towns. One of those villages was Bayt Nabala, located just outside of Lydda Airport.

75 years later, Al Jazeera spoke to some survivors and their descendants about what that community was like.

Based on their descriptive memories and combined with historical records and maps, we recreated Bayt Nabala using the latest generative AI tools.

The result was an interactive longform which combined 15 carefully constructed AI images with dozens of photographs, maps and infographics.","The story was very well received not only by the general public but perhaps more importantly by those eyewitnesses and their descendants who managed to ‘see’ this village for the first time.

One such comment on social media captured this sentiment:
My mom &amp; her siblings were the first generation in her family to be born outside of Bayt Nabala, the village they’re from in Northern Palestine that was destroyed by Israel after 1948. They’ve never seen it. @AJEnglish recreated it using AI.

Overall this project demonstrated that the storytelling landscape is an ever evolving one. Rather than adopting new technologies for their novelty, we believe that journalists should constantly be asking themselves if these tools and techniques enhance our journalism.",.,"To generate the AI scenes, Al Jazeera produced more than 2,000 iterations using Midjourney V5.1. Special attention was paid to ensure that every detail, from the clothing worn, the colour of the bricks, the shape of the valley and the spacing between the streets was as accurate as possible.

All these 15 scenes were produced in under three weeks, something that would have likely taken months using traditional illustration techniques. This is mainly because of generative AI’s ability to very quickly iterate and adapt based on the verbal eyewitness testimony that we received.

The use of AI in this story demonstrated the power and agility that generative AI programmes can have for historical storytelling based on a combination of eyewitness testimonies. It’s not the memory of one person that was recreated but the synthesis of many.

Newsrooms have long used reenactments and docu-dramas to tell stories like these and this case study highlights the practical visual digital alternatives made possible using AI.","New tools should ideally make your work clearer, more informative and more interesting to your readers.

GSAP
Ai2HTML","This story is a collaboration between Kontinentalist and data consultancy studio Thibi. Over seven months, we worked closely and leveraged our strengths on data analysis and visual storytelling to tell a unique story about Myanmar culture, beyond current headlines about conflict.

The story explores the phenomenon of “copy thachin” or copy songs, which are Myanmar renditions of songs originally created in the West. This movement has shaped popular music in Myanmar for more than 50 years, especially when the country was closed off to the outside world. The piece incorporates audio, video, interactive data visualisations and even Genius-style lyrics analysis.","This story represents the first time anyone has ever covered the copy thachin phenomenon using data. We depended on two sources: a 55,000-strong Facebook group on copy thachin, and MyanmarMP3.net for the entire repertoire of Myanmar pop music. From there, we cleaned and analysed the data to create a never-before-seen picture of copy thachin, creating an interactive historical timeline of the genre, and a network diagram that visualised the relationships between artists. 

This was also a chance to educate global audiences on a lesser known aspect of Asian music and celebrate the creativity of Myanmar musicians who worked under strict censorship. Our story allows people to not only discover the main features of this genre and its history, but also do a deep dive of the rich discography of artists and artist relationships—not to mention discover precious easter eggs like who covered Metallica and Celine Dion.

This story also helps to fill the knowledge gap in the study of Myanmar pop history and present it to the audience in an immersive way, both aurally and visually.

The story received 795 views, with an average engagement time of 49 seconds. It also got 242 likes and 79 shares on Instagram.","Not a lot is written about copy thachin outside of academia, and international press coverage focuses mainly on the issue of plagiarism. This doesn't do justice to a genre that is still significant for millions of music fans in Myanmar and the diaspora. 

News from Myanmar these days is inundated with reports of conflict; we wanted to shine a light on the creativity and ingenuity of its people despite the challenges they endure. Hence, in our story we highlight the unique features of the phenomenon, and challenge and unpack the idea of “copying”. Copy songs require ingenuity in lyric writing, song composition, production, and distribution, as musicians avoided government censors, developed their skills, and cultivated local fans in their journey as artists.

Perhaps like the genre, this story incorporates inspirations both from Myanmar and abroad. For the timeline, we took inspiration from Vox's Jamaican dub music story to create a histogram-cum-timeline whose shape resembles an equaliser’s sound waves. For the design, we wanted to give readers context about Myanmar’s history and move them through time. We gained inspiration from art and architecture from ‘70s and ‘80s Myanmar, gleaned through old pop culture magazines and photography.","We trawled through the “notes” feature of the Facebook group, parsing the group's text files and extracting over 7,000 lines of text. With some help from ChatGPT and regular expressions, we pulled all the information together into a spreadsheet, creating a database of copy thachin for the first time. This process yielded a dataset of over 3,000 copy thachin and their originals. 

We then used Webscraper.io to scrape Myanmar song data from MyanmarMP3.net, a free streaming site for Myanmar music with listings of tracks, artists, and albums, complete with extra information such as an album’s release date, the backing band for the album, and the recording studio used. We used Python and Google Sheets for data wrangling and analysis. 

For the visualisation, we used D3.js for both the interactive timeline and network diagram. We used Adobe Illustrator and ai2html for illustrations with positioned elements. We used Soundcite to annotate lyrics with audio clips. 

For design, we used Figma for storyboarding and UI/UX design. And for the development, we used ArchieML for syncing writing workflows with development, Vue for our front-end framework, and Kontinentalist's own content management system (CMS), Caraspace.","This story proves that data journalism companies can work closely together and learn from each other in a collaborative, open and non-competitive way. 

Like any good collaboration, it is greater than the sum of its parts. Thibi pitched a story idea specific to its context, wrote the story, managed all the data aspects and visualisation, and coded up the story. Kontinentalist shared access to its content management and design systems, shared its internal process of putting a story together, and advised Thibi on the editorial, data visualisation and accessibility aspects of the story customised to our audience and platform.

For Kontinentalist, this was a chance to learn from Thibi’s strong data skills, and collaborate on a piece we would not be able to do by ourselves. For Thibi, this was a chance to have a portfolio piece that showcased our skills by crafting a story on a topic we cared deeply about.

The report highlighted the insufficient development of the Philippine economy, what it means for the average Filipino worker, and how attitudes towards work differ among social income classes.","The report used a combination of publicly available data from government agencies and research organizations, soundbites from real workers, and data from a survey we conducted to illustrate a holistic picture of the realities faced by young workers in the Philippines.","Across the globe, Gen Z have gained a reputation for challenging long-standing norms and beliefs surrounding work, money, and the future. This story specifically looked at the plight of Gen Z workers in the Philippines, and emphasized that socioeconomic realities – such as high inflation rates and minimal increases in the real value of wages – greatly impact shifts in work culture brought about by younger generations.

The story also emphasized that generational concepts are largely imported from Western societies, which are not completely appropriate in the Philippine context. While younger workers today are struggling to make ends meet, the persistent problems with the Philippine economy have affected Filipino workers of all generations and their ability to live decently.","First, the team surveyed a total of 537 Gen Z Filipinos, aged 15 to 26, about their attitudes towards work and their spending and saving habits. The survey was disseminated online in two ways – it was publicly posted on the Rappler website, and it was directly distributed to Rappler’s partner schools.

Survey responses were then processed and segmented by income class, using Google Sheets, R, and RStudio.

We also downloaded publicly available government data on inflation and wages in the Philippines, using CSV files and Google Sheets.

Lastly, we also interviewed two Gen Z Filipino workers on their personal experiences, as well as an expert who provided insights on the socioeconomic situation for Filipino workers over the years, and across income classes.","This project aims to show journalists one way of marrying numbers with human soundbites to create more compelling, multi-dimensional stories.

Flourish","Exploiting the legal system is a collaborative story between Kontinentalist and Anton L. Delgado of SEA Globe. It sheds light on the illegal trade of long-tailed macaques. Despite long-tailed macaques not gaining as much international attention as more charismatic wildlife, it is imperative to manage their population numbers, which is declining rapidly in some countries due to their role in biomedical research.","The story received 1,137 views, with an average engagement time of 46 seconds. It also got 51 likes and 14 shares on Instagram.

It was also reposted on SEA Globe, which garnered attention among their audiences.","For this story, we mainly used data from the CITES database. While this database is extensive and publicly available, we quickly noticed that there were a lot of gaps and discrepancies in the data. This is because the global wildlife trade is extremely difficult to track, and numbers reported are often not the exact amount of wildlife and wildlife parts traded, which can mean illegal activities are taking place.

The focus was on long-tailed macaques. While they are commonly seen around in Southeast Asia (where we and a large portion of our audiences are based), there is not a lot of positive attention on them compared to more charismatic wildlife. However, they play a very important role in biomedical research and medicinal testing—in fact, the COVID vaccine testings were done on long-tailed macaques. Therefore, they play an undeniably important role in human health, and yet are still unsustainably traded for that exact reason, putting their population numbers at risk.","Using data from the CITES database, combined with on-the-ground investigations, we highlighted suspicions of corruption within the Cambodian government, and how an unsustainably large number of macaques are exported out of Cambodia every year.

Through various interactive data visualisations that we created on Flourish, we further emphasised relevant parts of the narrative, encouraging the reader to observe the data and form conclusions of their own.

We also used illustrations created on Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, and illustrated one infographic to make a relevant concept easier to understand visually.","The infographic in the story was brought up to our illustrator quite early, so they would have time to brainstorm and create it. This means we involved other members of the team pretty early in the story ideation process, so that they would have a very clear understanding of the topic before they would create the visual piece.

Additionally, working with Anton and his editor from SEA Globe was very helpful. They had prior knowledge and expertise in the topic, and wanted to work with us for our data analysis and visualisation capabilities. They kindly shared valuable information from their investigations, which was helpful as the Kontinentalist team focuses more on data and writing work, and does not often perform on-the-ground investigations.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/illegal-wildlife-trade-of-endangered-cambodian-crab-eating-macaque-macaca-fascicularis,,,,,,,"Writer / Anton L.

The report pointed out that the actors in this community are getting away with it by claiming academic expertise and legitimacy.","Following the publication of the article, we noticed that two of the propaganda actors we identified (Facebook groups) changed their privacy settings from public to private.

The piece was also hailed by the Global Investigative Journalism Network among the Best Investigative Stories from Southeast Asia in 2023.","This study was conducted with data consultancy, TheNerve, with support from Internews.","The team scraped Facebook for posts containing keywords related to geopolitical issues involving both China and the Philippines (i.e. maritime disputes in the West Philippine Sea and EDCA bases). These posts were analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) to surface the propaganda and disinformation narratives that benefit China, and to see how they formed the bigger discussion landscape.

We then looked at the actors who were posting these harmful narratives and used a network community detection algorithm to determine the different networks of accounts that posted about the topic. This allowed us to identify which communities propagated pro-China propaganda and disinformation over the years – from 2016 to 2023 – and how these communities behaved as the Philippines changed presidents with different foreign policy priorities.","Other journalists can pick up leads from the findings of the report. Through data analysis, the piece showed how pro-China propaganda was seeded in the Philippines. However, we also found that the malign actors we found in our datasets have been gradually shifting their efforts offline – through press events and other forums – which may be worthwhile to investigate further.",English,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/ways-how-china-propaganda-seeded-online-philippines/,,,,,,,"Author: Pauline Macaraeg

Flourish","Clearing the air: Questioning Singapore’s carbon credits decisions is a story that is part of a project initiated by Internews’ Earth Journalism Network (EJN).

The mandatory and voluntary carbon credits markets, which manage the overall carbon emissions of industries and business, is largely unfamiliar to the general public, due to too much scattered information online, too many jargons involved, and too many stakeholders. The goal was to address this knowledge gap. Because the carbon credits markets are so complicated, there’s also a lot of ambiguity which some stakeholders have taken advantage of. We wanted to highlight these issues as well.","Our promotional material for the story on social media received comments that the story was a very clear breakdown of the carbon market, and that they’ve shared it to others. Some team members involved in the story received similar feedback from their peers.

The story received 956 views, with an average engagement time of 1 minute 9 seconds. It also got 309 likes and 80 shares on Instagram.","The Earth Journalism Network established the project, with the goal to shed light on global carbon offsetting projects and controversies.

Kontinentalist focused on Singapore. Our government has been quite relentless in making big steps towards turning the country into a global carbon hub. Lately, they’ve also been pushing for industries and businesses to join the voluntary carbon market.

These decisions are often framed as a sustainability decision, but most of the general public can only take their word for it, as not many are very familiar with the complicated carbon market.

In reality, the voluntary carbon market has a lot of loopholes and failings, and the fact that our government is pushing stakeholders into the voluntary carbon market needs to be analysed. There could be a lot of action with no true environmental impact, and in worse case scenarios these actions may even result in human rights violations in certain, poorer parts of the world.

The general public, who vote on our leaders based on the decisions these legislators make, need to be able to ask them the right questions. That starts with having a firm understanding of the carbon offsetting system.","The story uses data from the World Bank Carbon Pricing Dashboard, the Straits Times, and the Ecosystem Market State of Voluntary Carbon Markets 2022 report.

We spoke to the journalists at SourceMaterial and had an off-the-record conversation with Melissa Low, a Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. We also obtained a statement from Climate Impact X for the story.

The journalists at SEA Globe, one of the partners we worked closely with, managed to interview residents of Chi Phat, a mountainous village located in Southern Cardamom, Cambodia, where a huge REDD+ project is located. There have been several investigations into this project, due to its alleged human rights violations. They kindly offered to send us their interview answers, which we used in our story.

As we wanted the story to be an “explainer” piece, we also added infographics to visually explain important concepts and jargons. These infographics were created on Figma.

Our developer used ai2html to ensure that the links on our static infographics could work. We decided this was important, as the sources for this story were particularly crucial for the reader to explore if they wanted to.","The infographics in the story were all first brainstormed among the team members, where every person sketched out how they thought was the best way to explain a particular concept. We then put these sketches on Figma, and voted on the ones we thought were best suited for the story. The designer/illustrator then went with the highest voted ideas.

This brainstorming session was good practice, as it got all members of the team (writer, data visualisation consultant, designer, and developer) involved in the conceptualisation phase.

Additionally, working with external partners with prior knowledge and expertise in the topic was very helpful. They kindly shared valuable information from their investigations, which was helpful as the Kontinentalist team focuses more on data analysis work and doesn’t often perform on-the-ground investigations.

In order to gauge how our audience would receive the story, we got several team members who were not involved in the story and who had no prior knowledge of the topic to read the piece. This step was particularly important as the story served to be an explainer piece, and the reader should not be left confused after reading the story.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/singapore-pushing-for-voluntary-carbon-offsets-and-market-to-become-carbon-trading-hub,,,,,,,"Writer / Gwyneth Cheng

Many people trust and rely on the information they hear on Radio Ergo in many ways - to learn about farming techniques, or treatment for their livestock; to know how to recognise the symptoms of acute watery diarrhoea or cholera and what to do about it; or to receive early warnings about floods or other weather crises.","Radio Ergo's main objectives are to strengthen access to critical information to enable Somalis to make better informed decisions on issues affecting lives and livelihoods; to provide a channel of communication between Somalis and the humanitarian community; and to support the strengthening of Somali media. 

Radio Ergo runs an independent call-in platform known as Freedom Fone. By calling the shortcode number 2012 from a basic mobile phone connected to any of the main telecom providers, listeners are invited to leave a voice message free of charge.

Listeners call to explain or comment on challenges or crises in their local area, such as disease outbreaks or a broken water well, and to ask questions to radio programme experts on health, livestock, or farming.","Running a radio service that broadcasts in one of the most violent countries in the world is no easy task. The war-stricken country has been without a central government for three decades and continues to struggle with internal conflicts between local clans and armed groups.

While many other radio services focus on politics and news, Radio Ergo only broadcasts humanitarian issues and topics related to the everyday lives of Somalis. This makes it less a target for extremist groups and enables the radio to collect content from all parts of the country.","Listeners across the country can hear Radio Ergo broadcast on shortwave frequency 17845kHz every day at 3-4pm East Africa Time (12-1pm GMT). Shortwave transmission is a key element of our strategy, as large audiences in the rural and remote areas of Somalia are not served by local FM radio and therefore access vital news and information through shortwave radio.

The daily Radio Ergo programmes are also rebroadcast by a network of local partner FM stations in Somalia, who use the programmes to complement their own content.","We train journalists to help them enhance their skills in humanitarian and social issues In parallel, Radio Ergo works to support a number of other content initiatives notably the Kalfadhi parliamentary and governance youth platform using web and social media.

The story investigates how feminist and queer organisations across South and Southeast Asian cities have pioneered innovative ways to create spaces for leisure, joy and resistance. The story covered 10 cities and 5 countries, collaborating with 10 grassroots groups. We wanted to show that despite the different contexts of the groups we engaged, that their solutions all converge towards a collective dream of more inclusive, accessible cities.","The story won the runner-up prize at the the WAN-Ifra Digital Media Awards Asia 2023, and Silver at the 2023 Information is Beautiful Awards in the People, Language and Identity category. 

It received 1,757 likes and 488 reshares on Instagram. The story was also retweeted over 66 times and received 78 likes on Linkedin. The story received 4,643 views, with an average engagement time of 31 seconds.


For the Kontinentalist team, the most important and rewarding outcome was how this story prompted discussion and reflection in our personal networks on how women access leisure in their cities. Within the data visualisation and journalism communities, this story has been featured by the Global Investigative Journalism Network, Datawrapper, and Buried Signals.","Data on this topic is scarce within journalism and academia. Moreover, the topic is often framed from the perspective of statistics that illustrate how unsafe cities or public transport are for women, and the myriad of challenges that women who cycle for leisure face. Rather than focus on tired narratives of how women are victimised by the design of the built environment and societal values, the team wanted to reframe the question how women mediate public spaces. We achieved this by focusing on the creativity of diverse communities across South and Southeast Asia in pioneering their own spaces to practise and advocate leisure as a form of resistance. 

Despite the different backgrounds of the communities and individuals we interviewed for this story, we found that the solutions each employed to create opportunities to access leisure had more in common with each other. As such, our goal became to show these different solutions all together, so that our readers and interviewees could learn from one another.","This data story contained many new techniques, such as the use of ArchieML to update the text algorithmically. The visualisation of individual quotes sorted by country was made using D3, while motion tweening was achieved with GSAP and JavaScript. Static visualisations were first built in Flourish then exported and overlaid with illustrations in Illustrator/Figma. These were made interactive using ai2html. The final map showing our data collection partners was built with Mapbox.","Firstly, this experience taught us how to better manage community relationships, and how to work with different partners and groups to produce a cohesive data story. Although it was challenging to balance the different interests of each group, the story would not have been as rich and revealing without their various perspectives and contributions. 

Secondly, the processing and presentation of qualitative data can take on different forms. In this story, we approached qualitative data as we typically would quantitative data. One of the results of this is an explorable data visualisation that showed the extent of the issue as well as the solutions. To tie all these qualitative interviews together, we analysed 10 interviews, survey and focus group discussion responses to find common threads and ideas through qualitative coding.","English, Hindi",https://kontinentalist.com/stories/women-create-spaces-joy-leisure-resistance-in-south-and-southeast-asia,,,,,,,"This story was a collaboration between Kontinentalist, Mariyam Haider and Khabar Lahariya.

Figma","The wisdom of traditional architecture in Asia uncovers the wealth of local knowledge and vernacular methods that shape traditional houses in Asia. Focusing on the Malay “kampung” house, this longform piece is heavy with intricate illustrations that highlight its different features and the holistic meanings behind them. The story shows how the forgotten wisdom and ancient methods behind vernacular buildings were strongly attuned to the local culture and climate. This is supported by existing research and data that reveal how much more sustainable vernacular buildings are than more modern, generic, and Western-centric buildings.","Our readers and followers on social media responded very positively to this story, with 2,379 likes and 889 shares on Instagram. This suggests a demand for more cultural stories that share old, or forgotten knowledge, and shed new light on underreported, or even dry topics. 

The story received 2,518 views, with an average engagement time of 30 seconds. 

The team was also invited to share our behind-the-scenes process on Buried Signals.","In Singapore, where the team is from, most Malay kampong houses were cleared to make way for high-rise flats and other modern infrastructure. The younger generations thus know very little, or nothing at all, of how our communities once lived and the traditions of building that were more connected to the environment. Our story is a way to challenge the perception that modernity is always better and show that turning inwards towards our own history and traditions can offer solutions to current challenges.

This story was also an opportunity for the team to push the boundaries of how we tell stories at Kontinentalist, and be more experimental with how we visualise information. Originally, the story was supposed to be done using our standard “Chronicle” format, which can be built without code using our content management system, Caraspace. Our initial sketches included a long, static five-step stacked infographic of text and visuals, which took the reader away from the overall story. We thus decided to invest more time into turning it into a bespoke story, using a more dynamic format that breaks away from our usual practice and customises each visualisation to be more concise, yet impactful.","We utilised Figma for wireframe creation, while Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator were used for crafting data visualisations and illustrated graphics. To refine the modern building materials energy viz, we used Flourish which provided a reference size for data points, and further visual enhancements were made using Photoshop. For optimal accessibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports, most of the static visuals were exported using ai2html.","There is an abundance of localised data in Asia to be explored and brought to light. Before digging deep into research on traditional Malay houses, we were unaware that many studies have been done on the sustainability and holistic nature of Malay vernacular architecture. There is also a wealth of documentation and research by local historians, architects, and cultural researchers that only needed to be made more accessible and digestible for the average reader. Much of this research is available online and offline through physical books. 

This story is also an example of how to effectively transform qualitative data into impressive and unique visuals, and how to combine qualitative and quantitative data to tell a powerful story.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/wisdom-of-vernacular-architecture-asia,,,,,,,"Writer / Zafirah Mohamed Zein

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,,,Jakarta’s roadside food sellers: Finding a path in a future of convenience,13/07/2023,"Explainer, Long-form, Illustration, Lifestyle, Business, Culture, Covid 19, Economy, Employment","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Flourish
Rawgraphs","Jakarta’s roadside food sellers: Finding a path in a future of convenience is a story combining comics, audio, data visualisations and narrative to tell a story about food sellers in Indonesia. The story is based on interviews with and data collected from “kaki lima” or roadside food sellers, based in Kramat Jati in East Jakarta. 

The story uses comics to tell a fictional story of Ahmad as he grows up and witnesses the changes around him, seeing kaki lima sellers slowly replaced by more convenient food options, and the neighbourhood undergoing urbanisation.","The project received much attention online, especially for the comics and visual storytelling which made for an easy read. The article was also shared and appreciated by researchers doing work on Indonesia, international data journalists and Indonesian-based designers. 

Two Kontinentalist team members were also invited for a live radio interview by Singapore radio station CNA93.8 for its travel segment, Destination Anywhere.

The story received 2,007 views, with an average engagement time of 1 minute. It also had 309 likes and 80 shares on Instagram.","Finding the data to support this story was challenging. Firstly, data about this informal sector is patchy. Part of the difficulty is that many workers consider registering with the government to be a tool of surveillance. 

With the landscape changing quickly, this impacts the availability and quality of data. For example, it was impossible to map the number of cloud kitchens in Jakarta accurately, despite their growing ubiquity. Similarly, there was no definitive data that could sufficiently show the relationship between the number of sellers versus the rise of e-commerce platforms.

Our workaround was to find indirect but related datasets, e.g. using data on mobile phone subscriptions to paint a picture about the e-commerce scene.

A lot of the change can be “felt” or observed. This was why we decided to go with a fictional tale of an Indonesian boy who is experiencing these changes first-hand. These were based on our illustrator Griselda’s personal experiences growing up in Jakarta, as well as interviews writer Arran did with kaki lima sellers in Kramat Jati. 

The story’s design and colour palette are inspired by vintage Indonesian label aesthetics.","For this story, we prioritised using comics to weave a human-centred narrative and convey the strong community aspects surrounding kaki lima sellers. For example, the idea of food diversity is shown in an illustration of the favourite dishes of Ahmad and his mom.

On the backend, the comic illustrations were arranged and coded in ai2html format. 

We also incorporated sounds into the story, which are peppered throughout to create an aural landscape supporting the narrative—e.g. kaki lima seller calls being present in earlier comics, then the sounds of buskers and Grab delivery riders in later comics.","It’s possible to tell a complex story of something that’s in the midst of transformation. This story is not just about food or commerce, but also urbanisation, consumer culture, and technology, amongst others. We had to find a way to tell a coherent story that can champion the trade of roadside food sellers, while also talking about everything else. When it comes to a story about an old trade, it’s also possible to not romanticise the trade, or capitalise on nostalgia, to tell a nuanced story that acknowledges the realities on the ground.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/jakarta-roadside-food-sellers-challenges-in-future-technology,,,,,,,"Writer / Arrang Ridley

Figma","No Place to Work: The Risks and Realities of Migrant Labour in Singapore is a story that explores and presents the challenges to migrant worker safety in Singapore, and what impedes their chance to live and work in Singapore with dignity. 

The story visualises a dataset of migrant worker deaths in Singapore that happened from 1 Jan 2000 to 3 Aug 2022. It is based on data collected by a group of volunteers who call themselves the Migrant Death Map team, cleaned and analysed by the Kontinentalist team.","The story builds on a map of migrant deaths that Kontinentalist had helped to build, which can be found on www.migrantdeathmap.sg. For this map, Kontinentalist helped with data cleaning and processing, and created data visualisations that analysed the data. We built on these insights and expanded on them in our story, focusing on safe work conditions for migrant workers. 

For our part in the project, we were invited to speak about the map and our story at the event “The Human Cost of Progress in Singapore” organised by Migrant Death Map. This was held on October 29 2023. 

This story is well-read, perhaps due to the fact that there’s a lack of one-stop, comprehensive info on migrant worker safety and labour conditions in Singapore. Moreover, the topic of transporting migrant workers in lorries, which we touched briefly on, is something that continues to be debated on and brought up in Parliament in Singapore till today. 

The story received 5,864 views, with an average engagement time of 58 seconds. It also got 879 likes and 366 shares on Instagram.","Though migrant worker safety is a ubiquitous issue in Singapore with an endless trickle of reports about their deaths and injuries, a comprehensive look at the underlying patterns behind their deaths felt glaringly absent. There is no publicly available structured data with sufficient granularity. Our story and collaboration with Migrant Death Map was a chance to change that.

We backed up the insights gleaned from the data with desk research, especially reports and firsthand accounts sourced from local NGOs like HOME and TWC2. However, policies in Singapore during this time were changing, especially due to the requirements of COVID, and hence we had to keep checking and updating our story prior to publication date. 

There was also a discrepancy between what is recommended by the state, and what actually happens on the ground. Sometimes enforcement of errant employers is inconsistent. This inconsistency meant that we had to be careful about the data we were putting out, and recognise the realities of lived experiences, balancing the current protections and regulations available to workers while acknowledging the flaws in the system.","Honestly, this story depends on basic, but painstaking, data collection, cleaning and processing techniques for 22 years worth of data. 

The Migrant Death Map team had approached Kontinentalist with a stack of newspapers and a Google Sheet filled with data extracted from newspapers. Our writer Mick refined the datasheet and imposed structure and consistency before continuing the data collection for the rest of the 22 years. 

We looked at what would give us the most insights. For example, looking at gender together with cause of death was informative, as it showed the different modalities of violence experienced by men and women migrant workers.

Then there are the sensitivities behind deciding things like the different categories of workplace incidents—is falling materially different from being crushed? What about fires versus chemical explosions? 

With the data and insights themselves being powerful, we went with a simple “Chronicle” format using the storybuilder of our content management system, Caraspace. This allowed us to stack content blocks easily, without needing to use complex code. We utilised Flourish embeds for our data visualisations.","Firstly, not all stories need complex elements or bespoke code to be valuable. This story was fairly straightforward in terms of the design and development, capitalising more on the strength of the narrative and clarity of the insights. 

Secondly, this was a unique chance to build on an existing project, and write a separate story that would be useful for our audience. Our work with Migrant Death Map was a partnership done on pro-bono terms, and for that, we worked mainly on the map, illustrations and some simple data vizzes. But as we saw the potential of the data and map, we decided that we could write a story about it that could flesh out other aspects to contextualise the story for our readers. 

Oftentimes, journalists work on one project and quickly move on. This was a chance to build on work already done to extract even more value from it, and to hopefully extend the reach and cause we were writing about in the story to a larger audience.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/migrant-labour-face-safety-risks-in-singapore,,,,,,,"Writer / Mick Yang

It was part of a collaborative project, Beneath The Sands, organised by global network Environmental Reporting Collective. Kontinentalist was one of 12 reporting partners highlighting issues related to global sand mining. 

The story took on a three-part structure to help the reader make connections between the sand trade and land reclamation in Singapore. Incorporating quotes, poetry, a scroll-triggered portion featuring a unique “binoculars-style” framing and a choose-your-own-adventure component, the story carries a dystopian, almost fantastical feel, complimented by the visual style.","We received positive feedback for the story, especially on the visual design, the user interactions, and the writing. Most people found it refreshing as it offered a different way of approaching a topic that can be dry or esoteric. By giving it a more humane tenor, coupled with meaningful design and interactive elements, the story felt engaging and emotional, bringing the topic of sand to life. We received positive comments from fellow journalists, as well as the international data visualisation community. 

Internally, this story was highly ambitious and involved a lot of new components. We were fortunate to have 7 months to work on the story, which gave us time to experiment and achieve the best possible outcome. 

It was also gratifying to be part of a multi-newsroom effort, the Beneath the Sands project spearheaded by the Environmental Reporting Collective. Our story was published concurrently with stories from 12 other countries. Our story was part of the Reclamation focus, and one of our maps was also used for an overarching story on reclamation written by the organiser. 

The story received 3,012 views, with an average engagement time of 39 seconds. It had 1,034 likes and 265 shares on Instagram.","In Singapore there is a lot of sensitivity around the topic of sand imports, especially whether they are sourced ethically. We have heard of reporters in newsrooms being asked to kill such stories. In response to other media reports, the government has issued terse statements that insist on confidentiality due to national security, or say that it depends on external contractors to act ethically. 

Moreover, while Singapore is considered one of the largest importers, there is a lack of credible data on the sand trade globally. For the few sources that exist, there are limitations—for example, inaccuracies may occur due to reporting differences, double counting, or illegality.

Also, when creating a map of land reclamation projects in Singapore, we found a lack of comprehensive or consistent data. We had to depend on a mix of government agency websites, newspaper articles, and state plans. There were also no maps that show changes to Singapore's borders for the time period we wanted to capture, so painstaking manual tracing and georeferencing was involved. 

Faced with all these limitations, we had to find a way to tell a compelling, accurate story that could be backed up with data.","The story incorporates multiple elements in all ways—in terms of assets used, the story’s structure, interactivity type, user experience and design. This all had to be hard-coded and experimented numerous times to achieve the desired result. 

There are two key visualisations in the piece: one is a comprehensive map of reclamation projects in Singapore which also reflected changes to Singapore’s borders over the years. Creating this involved the manual labour of georeferencing, tracing and research. This map was created using ArcGIS and Mapbox and coded into the story as a clickable visualisation with two levels of interactivity. 

The other is a large, scroll-driven animated interactive which allows the reader to experience the section as if viewed through binoculars, with each scroll gradually revealing the text and illustration.

This involved planning a storyboard with image and text elements to fly in and out of the screen. The animation is scroll-driven and implemented using GSAP.

We weaved multimedia assets such as photos, videos, lottie animations (for vector graphics), gifs, and interactive maps. There is a mix of static and interactive illustrations, including animated components (.MP4 video), and custom-coded and ai2htmlL illustrations.","Firstly, this story is a lesson in finding new and innovative ways to tell an “old” story. 

Land reclamation in Singapore is a story that has been told many times. And within the global sand trade, Singapore is often seen as the villain. 

We wanted to examine the situation in a new, creative way, going down a route that is perhaps more poetic and empathetic than one might expect. We looked at how we could recast Singapore’s role—could we become stewards of sand, rather than guzzlers? While still taking a realistic view, we considered how a Singapore policymaker might take to our story, and offered an alternative vision for Singapore in this story of sand. 

Secondly, we’d like to highlight our accessibility features in the story. On a general level, we created mobile-compatible versions of all components of the story, which required a lot of testing. 

For the scroll-triggered “binoculars” component in particular, we created a whole other version that reads more like a children’s storybook, while being accessible and screen reader-friendly. 

While accessibility features can sometimes feel like an afterthought, we are proud to create an experience that creatively responds to various access needs and comfort levels.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/is-land-reclamation-in-singapore-worsening-the-global-sand-mining-crisis,https://www.beneaththesands.earth/reclamation,,,,,,"Author / Nabilah Said

We analyze past positions, assess implementation history, and identify similar proposals. Expert analysis adds depth. In the midst of election information chaos, our goal is to pragmatically scrutinize candidates' policy proposals.","The implementation of this policy platform has had a positive impact on society. Through collaboration with the media, fact-checking has increased the transparency and reliability of candidates' policy proposals, inspiring other journalists to emulate this approach to enhance news accuracy. The platform has sparked a trend of more media involvement in political fact-checking, strengthening public trust in candidates' commitments. Simultaneously, expert analyses provide voters with deeper insights, encouraging more informed choices. This practice not only influences elections but also inspires other journalists to incorporate fact-checking into their daily news reporting, elevating overall media quality.","We aim to conduct thorough fact-checking before the elections, so we meticulously record every presidential candidate's policy presentation. Leveraging AI technology, we automatically transcribe each event verbatim. Subsequently, human reviewers diligently cross-reference, identify omissions, and summarize policy proposals. This data collection process requires considerable effort. Moreover, to strengthen our initiative, we have invited collaboration with ten domestic media outlets for fact-checking. Together, we establish shared fact-checking standards to ensure the credibility of each policy proposal verification.","We established a policy platform that not only presents candidates' policy proposals and fact-check results but also encourages public collaboration. People can contribute by adding candidates' policy proposals, highlighting controversial events related to those proposals, and tracking their implementation progress. This open collaboration allows the platform to continuously grow with the collective efforts of the public, becoming a force for oversight and accountability.","Other journalists can learn various experiences and best practices from this project. Firstly, they can learn how to leverage AI technology for automatic transcription of events, saving time and improving efficiency. Secondly, through the process of manual cross-referencing and identifying omissions, they will understand how to carefully review and ensure accuracy.

The report analyzes psychiatric assessments from court judgments, revealing patients' struggles with rigid healthcare systems, familial trauma, and economic hardship, hindering their reintegration into society. It highlights their efforts to seek treatment amid systemic failures. The report also shares stories from affected individuals and discusses current system inadequacies, anticipated changes post-amendment, and support models from civil groups and experts, offering insights for future policy development in mental health care.","The report on Taiwan's Mental Health Act amendment and the challenges faced by mental health patients significantly impacts society and provides inspiration for other journalists. By shedding light on the struggles of individuals with mental health issues, the report raises public awareness and empathy, highlighting the need for more compassionate and effective mental health policies. It challenges the stigma associated with mental illness through the portrayal of personal stories and the analysis of psychiatric assessments from court judgments. This innovative investigative approach demonstrates the potential of legal documents in revealing broader social issues. The report's comprehensive nature, blending personal narratives with policy analysis, serves as a model for in-depth journalism on complex social issues. Additionally, it underscores the importance of collaboration between different sectors, including civil groups and experts, in supporting mental health patients. This aspect suggests new areas for journalists to explore, emphasizing the role of collaborative efforts in addressing societal challenges. Overall, the report not only contributes to a deeper understanding of mental health issues but also serves as an exemplary case of sensitive and impactful journalism.","The data on mental health patients is often too sensitive and private to be publicly available for a comprehensive examination of their plight. Past reports have mostly focused on individual stories. Therefore, this report, for the first time, utilizes the judicial verdict system, thoroughly examining the contents of verdicts to gain a comprehensive understanding of their challenges in seeking medical treatment, familial issues, and economic hardships. This approach enables society to gain a deeper understanding of mental health patients, thereby helping to remove the stigmatized labels attached to them.","We used web scraping technology to collect all verdicts mentioning mental illness and further manually categorized the challenges faced by mental health patients into medical, familial, and economic aspects. In presenting the report, we started by excerpting the inner thoughts of patients from the verdicts, hoping readers could see their internal monologues. Additionally, the report utilized a self-developed component, ""random text select,"" allowing readers to access all the organized verdict content.","Other journalists can learn from this report the value of using unconventional data sources, like judicial verdicts, to explore complex social issues like mental health. The report demonstrates how sensitive and private data, typically challenging to access, can be used to paint a comprehensive picture of the struggles faced by mental health patients. This approach offers a new perspective compared to traditional reporting, which often focuses on individual stories. By examining legal documents, journalists can uncover systemic issues in healthcare, family dynamics, and economic factors affecting mental health patients. This report serves as a model for deep investigative journalism, encouraging others to seek out alternative data sources for more insightful and impactful reporting.

A review by READr of ten domestic issues, such as the Zhongli incident and the tainted oil scandal, reveals a trend of political polarization on Facebook. Negative events are manipulated to criticize political parties, with slogans like 'vote them out.' Duplicated posts across groups and pages attempt to shape opinions, raising concerns about the disappearance of genuine problem-solving methods amidst the politicization of public opinion.","This report reveals the trend of political polarization in public discourse during election years, especially on Facebook, emphasizing its impact on society. It highlights how unrelated events are politicized, fueling specific political slogans that may influence election outcomes and public ideologies. Additionally, the report notes the prevalence of duplicated content, potentially orchestrated to shape specific opinions intentionally. Such findings could inspire other journalists to pay closer attention to the politicization of social events and examine how information on social media affects public opinion. The report underscores the media's role in fostering fair and objective discussions and contributes to a broader awareness of information manipulation in social events and elections.","We selected 10 social issues to capture public opinions on Facebook, but determining the content of discussions required considerable effort. It involved breaking down post keywords and manually judging the main topic of each post based on these keywords. Subsequently, we further categorized these topics into several discussion themes, including event discussions, system reviews, unrelated events, and more.","We initially focused on annual significant social events using media data, and subsequently utilized CrowdTangle to collect public opinion data on Facebook.

It highlights the difficulties in seeking justice and the systemic issues within the legal and social framework that often leave survivors without proper recourse. The report emphasizes the emotional and psychological toll on victims, the stigma associated with speaking out, and the complexities of navigating a legal system that often does not adequately support or believe survivors. The article is a profound exploration of the ongoing MeToo movement in Taiwan and the hurdles that survivors face in their journey towards healing and justice.","The report on the MeToo movement in Taiwan, as described in READr, has a significant impact on both the audience and the broader community. By shedding light on the struggles of sexual harassment and assault survivors, it raises public awareness and fosters a deeper understanding of these issues. This, in turn, encourages empathy and support for survivors.
Moreover, the report's in-depth exploration of the systemic challenges within the legal and social framework may inspire other journalists to investigate similar issues, leading to more comprehensive coverage and potentially catalyzing changes in policies and societal attitudes. The report contributes to the ongoing discourse on gender equality and justice, making it a valuable resource for both the community and fellow journalists seeking to address these critical issues.","Regarding the READr report on the MeToo movement in Taiwan, there are several background aspects that may not be immediately apparent from the article itself but are crucial for understanding its context and significance:
1. Political Environment: Taiwan has a complex political landscape that influences public discourse on social issues, including gender equality and sexual harassment. Understanding the political nuances can provide insights into the challenges faced in raising awareness and implementing changes.
2. Legal Framework: The legal system in Taiwan regarding sexual harassment and assault cases has its limitations and complexities. The report may not fully detail these legal intricacies, but they are essential in understanding the hurdles faced by survivors seeking justice.
3. Resource Limitations: Investigative journalism, particularly on sensitive topics like sexual harassment, often requires significant resources, which might be constrained. This includes funding, access to legal expertise, and support for in-depth research.
Understanding these background elements can help judges appreciate the complexity, challenges, and achievements of the reporting project, highlighting its impact and significance within the broader societal and political context of Taiwan.","In the report on Taiwan's MeToo movement, the team utilized the following tools, techniques, and technologies to complete the project:
1. R Studio for Data Analysis: R Studio was employed to collect judgment data from the Judicial Yuan's database. This involved data related to cases concerning the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act and Article 228 of the Criminal Code (coercion into sexual intercourse or obscene acts) between July 1, 2022, and July 7, 2023. R Studio's advanced data processing and analysis capabilities were effectively used to organize and analyze this information.
2. Case Study Methodology: An examination of seven different crime scenes in the verdicts, as well as statements from perpetrators and victims. This required meticulous text analysis and a deep understanding of legal procedures to reveal the logic behind the judgments and the reasons for the judges' decisions.
3. Artificial Intelligence Visualization (Midjourney): The artificial intelligence program Midjourney was used to visualize key content mentioned in the interviews.","From the above-described report on Taiwan's MeToo movement and the supplementary information provided, other journalists can learn several valuable lessons:
1. Innovative Data Analysis: The use of R Studio to analyze legal documents showcases how journalists can employ advanced data analysis tools to extract and interpret complex information. This approach is particularly useful in investigative journalism where data plays a crucial role.
2. Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Research: The project exemplifies how to effectively combine quantitative data (court cases analysis) with qualitative insights (victim interviews and AI visualizations). This holistic approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.
3. Ethical Storytelling: The sensitive handling of victim interviews and the use of AI to visualize key content without exposing the victims' identities demonstrate ethical considerations in journalism. This is crucial when dealing with sensitive topics like sexual harassment.
4. Use of Technology in Journalism: The application of AI visualization tools like Midjourney illustrates how technology can be used creatively in journalism, both to protect privacy and enhance storytelling.
These lessons can inspire and guide other journalists in their investigative projects, especially those tackling complex social issues with a combination of data analysis, ethical reporting, and innovative storytelling techniques.",Mandarin,https://www.readr.tw/post/2953,,,,,,,"Chen Pei Yu, Syu Siang-Yun, Lee Yu Ju, Tseng Lee-Yu, Wu Man-Ru, Chien Hsin-chan","READr is not just a data newsroom, it is also a digital innovation team.

Wrong policies that put the scalpel in the doctor’s hand and fail to remove it,26/09/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Corruption, Culture, Women, Health, Crime, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Personalisation, Scraping, Canvas, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, ","**A data-driven investigation uncovers the factors behind the alarming prevalence of medicalized circumcision in Egypt, despite its criminalization. This practice accounts 83% of all circumcisions.**

**Drawing on data, health surveys, official decisions, and legal documents, the investigation traces the transfer of the circumcision scalpel from midwives to doctors.**

**To assess the enforcement of stricter legal provisions, the investigation meticulously combed through news archives. The findings were shocking: only one prosecution for medicalized circumcision occurred in two and a half years.**

**Furthermore, the investigation unearthed disturbing evidence of clandestine mass circumcisions conducted by doctors.**","**I presented an investigative report based on data, statistics, official decisions, and surveys, in which I revealed the roots of the problem of circumcision and its medicalization, and I provided the low effect of the impact of tightening laws without working to change the culture that accepts circumcision and supports it on the part of families and doctors.**

**Fulfilling what I believe to be my responsibility, I've paved the way for official authorities to step up and make a deliberate effort to combat the medicalization of circumcision, which remains alarmingly prevalent, accounting for 83% of circumcision in Egypt.**

**Within civil society and human rights organizations, the investigation sparked positive ripples, with multiple republications and calls for more stringent measures against medicalized circumcision.** 

**Professionally, the work garnered recognition by being nominated for the prestigious True Story Award.**","**The Egyptian government constantly highlights its measures to combat female circumcision. While some are positive, they ultimately fall short in tackling the issue's root causes, particularly the medicalization of the practice.**

**Social culture remains the primary driver in Egypt, with many viewing circumcision as both a cultural tradition and a religious obligation. This perception is significantly bolstered by the involvement of doctors, lending it an air of medical legitimacy and safety over this crime.**

**Previous government policies allowing doctors to perform circumcision have contributed to its normalization and hidden occurrences. This silence surrounding the issue is further amplified by officials' reluctance to acknowledge its causes. Data and analysis, however, reveal this underreported reality.**

**Recent legal amendments aim to crack down on both circumcision itself and its medicalization. Yet, reporting of these crimes remains exceptionally rare, often limited to cases resulting in death or serious injury. To illustrate, I combed through news archives since the stricter laws on medicalized circumcision were implemented two years ago. In that period, I found only one reported trial.**

**I gathered testimonies from various governorates, cross-referencing them to paint a clearer picture of mass circumcision – a practice occurring discreetly in homes and, disturbingly, involving medical professionals.**","**I gathered the official and ministerial decisions that played a role in the medicalization of circumcision by reviewing ministerial decisions and conducting in-depth research to uncover the reasons behind their issuance, given that they are concealed and officials decline to discuss them.**

**I compiled data on circumcision and its medicalization in Egypt from official health surveys and gathered global circumcision data from international organizations such as UNICEF and the World Health Organization.**

**I obtained the laws addressing the crime of circumcision, then scraped the news archives of two news websites and analyzed the data to demonstrate the extent of enforcement of the strict law on circumcision medicalization.**

**Data on medical college students' attitudes toward circumcision was collected through a survey conducted by a non-governmental organization.**

**I analyzed the data and visualized it using maps and graphs.**

**I employed various tools for search, scraping, organizing data, analyzing data, and visually representing data, including Excel, Flourish, Google advanced, Wayback machine, Datawrapper, and Tabula.**","**I believe that the most significant takeaway from this project is that data is highly revealing and crucial, providing analysis, understanding, and context that is markedly distinct from hasty remedies.**

**Effectively representing and simplifying data is essential since it is primarily intended for the reader's consumption.**

**In-depth research, analysis, and comprehension of the context surrounding the issues, particularly those related to society and culture, are paramount. Addressing the surface-level issues will never suffice if the problem lies deep within the roots.**

**We must continue to address the genuine problems that are deeply embedded in our societies' cultures.**

**Providing survivors with understanding and support and creating safe spaces for them to share their stories is crucial. It is their right, our responsibility, and the key to genuine understanding.**",Arabic language,https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_various/details/2023/9/26/2472851/,,,,,,,**This investigation was produced with support from the International Center for Journalists.**,"**NAME: Sara Gamal

To help the world better understand how the war is destroying Ukraine's environment and what Ukraine needs to restore it, we have prepared an infographic study.","The study had 900 downloads of the pdf version, and the promotional content had 5 million views. 

The media partner of the study was one of the largest Polish media outlets, Gazeta Wyborcza, which prepared articles, infographics and social media posts based, among other things, on the data from the study, and thus explained to Polish society the problems faced by Ukraine. 

The printed version of the study was presented at COP28 UAE - United Nations Climate Change Conference, in the pavilion of the Ukrainian delegation. World leaders read the study, including the President of Slovakia, the former President of Estonia, the Secretary General of the Estonian Ministry of Climate, the Senior Advisor for Energy Security at the U.S. Department of State, the Special Representative of the President of the United States for Climate Change, and representatives of other delegations.","When the media talks about the impact of the war on Ukraine, they primarily refer to the dead people and destroyed infrastructure. The topic of damage to the ecosystem is not in focus. But for us in Ukraine, the losses suffered by the environment are no less important than other losses.

We prepared visual content for the communication of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on the importance of maintaining silence in the information space after missile attacks. 

During the shelling of Ukraine's energy infrastructure and blackouts, we prepared a series of educational infographics explaining the consequences of the shelling, the process of repairing the infrastructure, the reasons for the electricity supply restrictions, etc. The goal of this series was to clarify what was happening and to calm the public, to counter Russian fakes about the blackout.

The infographics explain: 
* how farmers have been driving human development for thousands of years 
* how the agricultural industry has become the largest industry in Ukraine 
* and also gives a hint on how modern farmers can dramatically increase efficiency and transform themselves so that their business and the entire economy grow. 

Another 8 meters of interactive infographics, where the conference guests show how they see the future of agribusiness.

In total, the infographic took up 70 square meters.","* The infographic art wall became a key visual element at the conference. 
* This project is educational and aims to help farmers make their business more efficient. 
* Although it is difficult to measure the direct impact of such a project, our team saw the attention of the conference participants to the art wall, and this can serve as an indirect indicator that the project was useful. 
* In addition, we published an infographic from the art wall in our media, and it has 127 thousand views so far.","Ukraine is known as a country with a strong agricultural industry. Ukraine is called the ""bread basket of Europe"" because our country ranks among the world's top exporters of grain, oil, and other agricultural products. 

However, recently the profitability of agribusiness has been falling. This is due to several reasons: 
* the war and blocked ports, which is why exports are falling
* climate change 
* rising costs of plant protection products and fuel
* global price trends. 

This means that Ukrainian agribusiness will never be the same as before, it needs to be transformed. Only those who optimize processes and increase efficiency, find new sales channels, and invest in processing raw materials into finished products will survive in the market. 

Given this context, we showed farmers how they can transform their business, increase efficiency and profitability.","It was the first time in our practice that we made an infographic of such a large size, so we had to prepare it taking into account the size, configuration of the hall where it would be placed, and the materials on which it would be pasted.","* Every topic, even the most complex and unusual one, can be transformed into an understandable visualization.

Yasno, the largest electricity supplier in Ukraine, faced a flurry of appeals to its call center and social media. 

A series of infographics that we prepared and distributed in our media outlet, UA War Infographics, and through it to other media, helped explain to consumers the state of the power system, the schedule of power outages, helped reduce the load on the Yasno call center, and reassure people. 

The total number of views of the infographics in this series is 20 million. One of the infographics had 5 million views.","In October 2022, Russia launched a series of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. It lasted throughout the fall and winter. 

These attacks caused power outages across the country, as well as problems with heating, water supply, mobile communications, and the Internet, as they depend on the electricity supply. 

The government introduced an hourly restriction on electricity supply. 

One of the attacks was so powerful that for several days the entire country experienced a blackout, and the integrated power network of Ukraine was split into regional networks. 

At the same time, Russia launched disinformation campaigns about the state of Ukraine's energy system.","This project had two challenging but important aspects. 
1. We had to be quick to explain to the audience what was happening and answer questions.

United States of America,"The Marshall Project, The New York Times, The Times Union, New York Focus, Investigative Post",Big,,,How New York’s Abusive Guards Keep Their Jobs,19/05/2023,"Investigation, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Video, Politics, Crime, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Javascript and Observable notebooks","Corrections officers who brutalized prisoners in New York facilities were seldom fired — protected by a culture of cover-ups and a system that favors them. Prison leaders failed 90% of the time when they tried to fire officers they accused of abusing incarcerated people. In many cases in which guards severely injured prisoners, the department did not even try to punish the officers.

The two-year investigation relied on a previously secret database, obtained through public records requests, which also revealed that officers often appealed their terminations to private arbitrators, who reinstated three out of every four guards.","As a public service, we published the disciplinary data we received from the state prison agency. Lawmakers, other media outlets, advocates and lawyers are working with it. New York state lawmakers, who started a new session Jan. 3, recently filed a bill that cites our work and would require all prison employees to report abuse and other misconduct by their colleagues. Several senators have told us that our stories have also inspired them to work on legislation, which they plan to introduce in the current session, to reform arbitration and oversight for guards, and to require more body and wall cameras in state prisons. Meanwhile, the governor’s office is working out a new contract with the prison guards’ union, and the disciplinary process is a focus of those negotiations.","These stories highlight a fundamental public policy issue: New York’s correctional department has failed its constitutional duty to protect incarcerated people from abuse by guards. 

Disciplinary records for New York law enforcement officers were secret for decades until the legislature rewrote the law following the murder of George Floyd. We were the only news organization to successfully use the new law to obtain extensive records and uncover systemic misconduct hidden inside the state’s notoriously violent prisons. We believe this is the first comprehensive news investigation of how a prison system disciplines its officers.

It took a year and the threat of a public records lawsuit for the department to begin releasing documents. We spent months cleaning the messy data and months more interviewing prisoners, lawyers, investigators, former officers and prison officials. 

Our stories shed light on failures that threaten the integrity of the department, including its broken disciplinary system and culture of cover-ups that blocks accountability and allows abuse. We revealed the high rate at which outside arbitrators reinstate officers and the reasons they cite in their decisions, adding important context to an ongoing dispute between the state and the officers’ union about how much power these arbitrators should hold.","Our stories relied on three primary datasets. The first, the previously secret prison employee discipline database, came to us as Excel sheets exported as PDFs. 

For our second set of data, we asked the New York attorney general’s office for every lawsuit it had settled — or lost — on behalf of the corrections department since 2010. The office provided more than 13,000 pages of records in eight PDF files. After combing through every page, we built a spreadsheet containing paid lawsuits alleging prisoner abuse. 

We built a third dataset after obtaining, from the corrections department, hundreds of decisions in which arbitrators ruled whether to uphold punishments the agency meted out to employees.

To analyze our datasets, we used the Python programming language and the Camelot library to turn PDFs, which were messy and inconsistent, into standardized data. We used the dedupe library to try to identify employees with similar names, and used the pandas data analysis library for our calculations. 

We used natural language processing and the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm to identify similar cases of misconduct that may have been miscategorized by the corrections agency. 

We used Excel and its pivot tables feature for some of our analysis.","Systemic police misconduct has come under increasing scrutiny over the past decade. New York’s new transparency law allows reporters to examine how law enforcement officers are disciplined for wrongdoing. Many other reporters have focused on the state police or New York City police; we decided to use the new law to uncover misconduct hidden inside the state’s notoriously violent prisons. 

It took a year and the threat of a public records lawsuit for the department to release the documents. This was difficult, painstaking work to get the records and then to verify and understand them. It took a considerable amount of reporting to review and understand the thousands of pages of documents we obtained and to build our own databases. But with persistence on our part and the unflagging support of our editors and colleagues, we were able to shine a much-needed light on a part of the government that is so often ignored.

CBS News compiled data from nearly every state labor department, then shared that data with its local stations in a national-local collaboration that revealed shortcomings of the wage theft claims processes across the country.","The work has been cited extensively in other reports, and we've shared the data we gathered with researchers at a US university for future study.","Wage theft siphons billions from American workers every year. Victims have little recourse except for these state systems. Yet no comprehensive research has ever been done on their effectiveness. Through records requests to nearly every state in the country, this project compiled a database of over a million cases. The process of cleaning and standardizing this data was painstaking due to the poor quality of many states' computer systems and varying policies.","The data cleaning process was done in Python. I built a data processing pipeline that read files from various states' FOIA responses, converted the records into a standard format, removed any records with apparent data entry issues. We then developed a process to identify the outcome of a case, which depending on the quality of the state's data could be surprisingly challenging. We then collected claim amount and payment data so we could evaluate the amounts people claimed vs. the amount they were awarded.","Many public programs operate with little to no evaluation of their effectiveness. In at least two cases, we were told by state officials that no one had ever requested this data, and that no audit of the state's wage theft claims process had ever been done. By requesting case management data from such programs, you can do what the government can't or won't, and can often identify problems hiding in plain sight.",English,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/owed-employers-face-little-accountability-for-wage-theft/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab8d&amp;linkId=198446092,https://github.com/CBS-Innovation-Lab/wage-theft-data,,,,,,"Authors: Chris Hacker, Ash-har Quraishi, Amy Corral, Ryan Beard.

This controversial statement only applies to the Ukrainian imported drone market. The OSINT agency Molfar found evidence China continues to supply drones to Russia using various covert schemes. Also Chinese manufacturers are supplying components for UAVs to Russian soldiers.","The media community strongly responded to the investigation. We received over 40 quotes from global media outlets, including Gazeta Wyborcza, Radio Free Europe, and The Australian Financial Review. To increase the audience's coverage, our team shared the findings with the Telegraph, which triggered a double wave of discussion about China's supply of drones to Russia. 

It is important to note that China has imposed supply restrictions on Ukraine. This has made it difficult to supply drones to the Ukrainian army. The Ukrainian media and volunteers actively discussed the material and were able to assess the scope of the problem. 

We also demonstrated the truth that society deserves with this material. Even though China claims to be neutral in Russia's war against Ukraine, in reality, it is just words. China is, in fact, secretly helping Russian troops in this brutal war.","There are several non-obvious problems that the article needs to demonstrate. 

It once again proves the thesis that China is secretly supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine. 

Our investigation also demonstrates the danger that has emerged for global democracies. Authoritarian and dictatorial states unite quickly and seamlessly in critical moments. 

Another factor worth noting is that modern wars differ from those of a century or even a few years ago. Modern warfare is not only about tanks and machine guns it’s also about technology. It was Ukrainian troops who successfully used a drone for military purposes for the first time in 2022. Today, this type of UAV has proven itself so well that the Russians have adopted it and are rapidly learning how to fly drones and see the need for ordinary civilian drones.","As OSINT specialists, we used the techniques and technologies it includes. Russian registries and the international 52wmb transportation database played an important role in our investigation.","This article is important for the journalist because it highlights a critical topic related to security and wars: the supply of iFlight drones (and their subsidiary DJI) to Russia. The article points to double standards in a Chinese company's activities that significantly impact Russia's war in Ukraine.

The significance of this article for a journalist is as follows:
1. Exposing schemes to circumvent sanctions and international law: The article details how companies from Russia and China are creating sophisticated schemes to circumvent international sanctions, including the use of intermediaries and undercover operations. This provides journalists valuable context for understanding how international norms can be violated.

2. Impact on military strategies and tactics: The article emphasizes the role of drones in modern military conflicts, including Russia's war against Ukraine. The investigation also reveals the topic of drones being used for reconnaissance, precision strikes, and support of military operations, which is a critical aspect of understanding modern military strategies.

Los datos nos muestran desigualdades educativas que prevalecen en Bolivia: del total de premiados, el 82% son de colegios urbanos, frente al escaso 9% de estudiantes de áreas rurales; además, el 60% de los estudiantes premiados son de colegios privados, y sólo el 30% provienen de colegios públicos.","El artículo llegó a viralizarse.

El Ministerio de Educación tampoco libera datos sobre el rendimiento académico de los estudiantes, lo cual es grave pues por la falta de información no se ha podido evaluar la reforma educativa impulsada en el gobierno de Evo Morales (la 070).

Por ejemplo, para elaborar el artículo, los datos de las Olimpiadas no estaban disponibles ni eran fáciles de descargar. Tuvimos que hacer un trabajo, muy minucioso y largo, para encontrar PDFs con los medalleros nacionales y luego convertirlos a tablas.

Creo que el artículo fue bien recibido, porque la información que encontramos sirvió como un proxy para observar la desigualdad del rendimiento académico de los estudiantes bolivianos, en medio de una carencia de datos.

Por otro lado, este artículo fue escrito sin ningún apoyo económico.","Usamos Wayback Machine para recuperar los PDFs con los datos de las ganadores de las olimpiadas, que estaban en la página caída de la Biblioteca del Ministerio de Educación. Convertimos los medalleros en tablas, y almacenamos la información en Google Sheets.

Luego, hicimos un join de la tabla de ganadores, con una tabla con los diferentes colegios de Bolivia, usando el lenguaje de programación R. Hicimos algunas visualizaciones exploratorias usando Flourish.

Luego utilizamos HTML, CSS y JavaScript (particularmente una librería llamada Scrollama) para armar el artículo y visualizar la información de manera interactiva e interesante para los lectores. Para presentar la historia en forma de scrollytelling. Los datos y los pdfs utilizados están disponibles en Google Drive y en nuestro repo de GitHub.","Creo que lo más interesante fue la presentación interactiva de la historia y los datos, mediante un scrollytelling que, al menos aquí en Bolivia, todavía no es un formato de historias muy popular o explorado.

Netherlands,"This project is a collaboration between the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Radio Ozodlik (Uzbekistan), Vlast (Kazakhstan), and Kloop (Kyrgyzstan).",Big,,,The Shadow Investor,27/04/2023,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Fact-checking, Corruption, Money-laundering, Crime","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OCCRP Aleph","For years, shadowy Central Asian operator Khabibula Abdukadyr colluded with corrupt customs officials to dominate the vast flow of Chinese imports that sustain the region. Previous investigations detailed the alleged smuggling and money laundering that enabled Abdukadyr’s monopoly.

This new investigative series shows how Abdukadyr and his family have transformed their shadowy fortune into a business empire that spans Central Asia. 

Our reporting uncovers how his family’s companies, which once funneled laundered funds around the world, became investors in gleaming residential and office towers, busy markets, mosques, and factories — and how government officials have welcomed these investments with open arms.","The region’s authoritarian political environment and the close ties of some of the main figures named in the project to powerful political figures make immediate impact unlikely. However, the reporting clearly had resonance in society: An Uzbek-language video presenting our findings had over 3.1 million views on YouTube and another 1.1 million on Facebook.

Impact from such investigations typically takes time. Previous investigations about Khabibula Abdukadyr, his family, and his allies eventually led to arrests and sanctions of corrupt officials. This investigation adds to the record, which we expect to lead to greater accountability down the road.","Central Asia’s limited public records, repressive political environment, and difficult security situation — all of which made this reporting an enormous challenge — is well attested to in the published stories. 

What may be less obvious is how much effort was taken to ensure the project would be available to all of the region’s citizens, not just English or Russian-speaking elites. Every element — including the introductory text, stories, interactive database, infographics, and promotional material — was translated not only into Russian, but also into Kazakh, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek. These publications appeared simultaneously with the English version.

Achieving this required devoting enormous resources into translation and project management among the project’s multiple partners. Ensuring that each language version was fully up-to-date, accurate, translated in high quality, and published on time was a considerable challenge. Meeting it enabled the project to reach a much larger audience.

In order to leave a firm historical record and solid trail for further investigation, the project’s interactive database documents the corporate ownership chain of each Abdukadyr asset, its connection to the tycoon and his family, and any ties to money laundering. This required painstaking research and double-checking to ensure there were no unexpected last-minute changes before publication.","To maximize this project’s contribution to the public interest, editors developed an interactive database of Abdukadyr assets to accompany the narrative stories. 

The database includes a searchable page featuring “cards” of each asset, which can be opened to reveal detailed profiles. This enables the general public to get a sense of the vast scope of the Abdukadyr’s business empire while letting specialists drill down into assets of the most interest.

Key reporting techniques were developed by participating local journalists, whose savvy and local know-how helped them find inventive ways to get information no one else could.

In Uzbekistan, for example, looking up a person in the land registry or other databases requires knowing their personal identification number, which is not public. One workaround developed by our reporters was downloading corporate certificates in text format: As it turns out, among the encoded information is the company director’s ID number. In other cases, reporters were able to look up ID numbers for people of interest through their passport numbers, obtained in paperwork that appears in foreign databases.

Such techniques enabled the reporting in this project to reach a level that would otherwise be impossible.","This project provides a useful case study in how to approach reporting about a shadowy business empire with multiple, but difficult-to-prove, connections to alleged criminal activity.

Our strategy was to combine two main elements: An interactive database of the relevant assets that included their corporate owners and ownership chains; and detailed, long-form stories that explained how these entities, and the people behind them, were connected to alleged organized crime and corruption.

Presenting these findings in multiple languages at once helped us ensure we were serving the public interest of the most important audiences — the people of Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and other Central Asian countries.","English, Russian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek",https://www.occrp.org/en/the-shadow-investor/,https://cdn.occrp.org/projects/the-shadow-investor-abdukadyr/en/,https://www.occrp.org/en/the-shadow-investor/the-abdukadyr-family-made-a-fortune-in-collusion-with-corrupt-central-asian-officials-now-theyve-built-a-global-business-empire,https://www.occrp.org/en/the-shadow-investor/frequently-asked-questions,,,,"Editing: Miranda Patrucic, Ilya Lozovsky, Carl Schreck, Julia Wallace, Drew Sullivan, Pete Baumgartner

United States of America,Documented,Small,,,Tracking Wage Theft in New York State,28/08/2023,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Business, Immigration","R, PostgreSQL","Documented obtained the largest repository of confirmed cases in New York State. We built a searchable map of the data in order to get the data into the hands of workers who are likely to be affected by wage theft and the people who work with them. We partnered with ProPublica to analyze the data and report on it to further understand how the NY DOL was investigating wage theft and recovering stolen dollars, as well as which industries were accutely affected by wage theft.","The database was used by local news outlets to write stories about businesses in their areas committing wage theft. It is also being used by advocates and labor lawyers to investigate businesses to either strenghten wage theft claims or warn potential employees about the possiblity of wage theft. After the project launched, reporters from news outlets in California and Ohio reached out about creating wage theft projects in their area and advocates in Colorado and Florida also expressed interest. 

Since the project launched, there has been considerable movement on the issue of wage theft in New York State. Governor Kathy Hochul signed a bill into law giving law enforcement the ability to charge wage theives with a felony. A story Documented published on wage theft in the horse racing industry resulted in an immediate promise from the New York State Gaming Commission to crack down on wage theft. Gov. Hochul named recovering stolen wages a top priority in 2024.","We first requested the data that underpins our project from the New York DOL in December 2019. The federal DOL proactively produces the same information, so we thought it would be straightfoward. After filing, the agency kept delaying its response, which forced us to eventually file a lawsuit through a probono law clinic. The DOL settled that lawsuit, but gave us an incomplete data set, with no data dictionary. 

We followed up with them, but they were unhelpful and at sometimes, outright hostile. They gave us data that they refused to explain and then took months to respond to our request to provide more information about which certain terms and numbers meant. It took years to get the full data set, which enabled us to build the map and complete the stories.

Documented is a small nonprofit and had few full time employees when Co-Executive Director Max Siegelbaum filed the first request. After collecting the data, Documented was able to form a partnership with ProPublica to learn from their data expertise. The Wage Theft Monitor was a Documented exclusive project. For the purpose of this award, we are submitting the map as our entry and providing the stories as context.","Once we had both data sets, we had to normalize them to make sure we were comparing the same information. Through various sources, including federal and state government employees, we had to deeply understand the systems used to collect information. Once we did, we used different programming languages to do the data analyses themselves, including R and SQL. We came up with questions to ask of the data itself, aimed at understanding what was the most newsworthy information we could find and how we could provide workers with valuable data on how this issue could affect them.

We created the map with the assistance of a firm who helped us design a tool for workers, advocates and interested New Yorkers using Figma. Our developers then built the map on a webpage of its own.","This project was born out of a listening tour conducted in 2019 by Max SIegelbaum and Mazin Sidahmed, who spent several months traveling the New York area speaking to various stakeholders who work with immigrants. They learned that immigrant advocates will often go directly to a worker's employer, trying to settle wage theft matters outside of the lengthy New York Department of Labor complaint system and expensive courts. An advocate they spoke to pulled out two judgments from the Connecticut Department of Labor against the same business—the judgements had been roughly a year apart from each other, and it was clear the business owner had not been dissuaded from cheating workers. That got Siegelbaum wondering: What would have happened if the second worker had known about the first case of wage theft? Would that have changed anything?

Journalists can learn that data projects can come from community need, rather than just reporters and editors instinct. If a project does come from the community, it also should be designed to address their needs. Documented had this in mind at every step of the process in reporting and creating this project.",English,https://www.nywagetheft.com/,https://documentedny.com/2023/08/21/nys-department-labor-wage-theft/,https://documentedny.com/2023/08/22/wage-theft-restaurants-new-york-nyc/,,,,,Max Siegelbaum,"Max Siegelbaum began his career in post-revolution Egypt, reporting on politics and culture.

United States of America,Rest of World,Small,,,How AI reduces the world to stereotypes,10/10/2023,"Explainer, Infographics","AI/Machine learning, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","We ran an experiment using AI image generator Midjourney and prompts related to six different countries: China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and the U.S. The prompts were based on the concepts of “a person,” “a woman,” “a house,” “a street,” and “a plate of food.” We generated 100 images for each prompt and country combination (e.g. “an Indian person”), creating a database of 3,000 AI images in total. 

The results show a hugely — albeit unsurprisingly — stereotyped view of the world.","This story received over 100,000 pageviews from over 100 countries. It spawned conversations across the globe about the use of AI — from graduate student discussions in Washington, D.C. to roundtable events on AI Safety hosted by the UK to assignments from professors in Australia. Researchers and engineers at AI platforms shared the article, too, urging each other to consider the possibilities of bias in the AI tools that they're building. It was shared by Data &amp; Society, a nonprofit research institute that studies the social implications of AI. We were very early in shining a light on this issue, one that’s subsequently been investigated by numerous media outlets; additionally, we used much larger and more statistically significant datasets than other investigations into these phenomena. (The Washington Post published a similar investigation weeks after ours, with datasets less than a tenth of the size of the ones that we generated and analyzed.)","We decided to use Midjourney (version 5.2) for our project, which was largely a practical decision as we already had familiarity with the tool. We limited our experiment to one AI generator for logistical reasons, but it would be interesting to repeat our experiment using other image generators, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, to see if they give different results. We also judged skin tone, using the Fitzpatrick scale — a tool used by dermatologists that measures how skin responds to sunlight, but which is often used to classify skin color into six types. Again, while we tried to keep our methodology as unbiased as possible, this was done visually and was therefore vulnerable to our own biases and human error. 

Editorial and product teams worked together closely on this project to develop a custom grid to display specific image sets and highlight some relevant information for readers. It would be excessive to show all 3,000 images in our story, but we included a variety of examples to show a representative sample. You can access a complete archive of the images here: https://github.com/row-engineering/everything/tree/main/2023/midjourney-images

And read more background here: https://restofworld.org/inside/how-we-analyzed-3000-ai-images-to-uncover-bias/","The predominant tool used was Midjourney, as well as a lot of hand categorizing in Google Sheets. Midjourney creates four images for each prompt. We ran each prompt 25 times in order to create 100 images per prompt. The prompts were kept exactly the same each time. This resulted in a total data set of 3,000 images. We stored these in GitHub. 

In order to quantify some of the trends we noticed in the generated images, and to be able to better compare the results for different countries, we came up with some standard criteria by which to analyze the images, including age ranges, gender, race, and cultural signifiers. These methods are imperfect, but we tried to be as objective as possible. Hand categorizing all 3,00 images gave us a strong sense of some of the overall themes in the data we had gathered, and allowed us to directly compare images across countries and prompts in a systematic way.","You can create a dataset out of anything and present it in a really cool way! You don't need access to proprietary data in order to do interesting and meaningful data journalism, particularly around the bias inherent in many AI systems that are prevalent these days. Noticing patterns and creating your own robust dataset takes time, but is a doable and worthwhile endeavor for journalists. Academic researchers have done analysis of perceived bias in ChatGPT responses based on prompts; recreating this in a newsroom and presenting the findings in an engaging, creative way — alongside the researchers, even! — could be an excellent and impactful piece of journalism.",English,https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/,https://restofworld.org/inside/how-we-analyzed-3000-ai-images-to-uncover-bias/,,,,,,"Victoria Turk: Author, project director

United States of America,The Baltimore Banner,Big,,,Tax sale nightmare,26/01/2024,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Economy","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, QGIS, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","The Baltimore Banner has published an investigation of the tax-sale system in Baltimore, showing how it forces low-income homeowners to pay thousands of dollars in owed taxes, interest and fees to lien holders — or face the loss of their homes. This in turn contributes to prolonged vacancy in disinvested areas of the city. 

Homes land in tax sale at much higher rates in the city’s majority-Black census tracts and that each and every one of the 1,763 homes across Baltimore that The Banner identified as having changed hands through the tax sale since 2016 was located in a majority-Black neighborhood.","This story has become the go-to text for understanding tax sale in the City of Baltimore. We have been cited by academics, activists, and public officials as they introduced legistlation to fundamentally change the tax sale.

This series was cited in several written testimonies to the Maryland General Assembly and convinced several state senators to change their vote on a tax sale amendment that would limit the tax sale moving foward. After the series published Mayor Brandon Scott removed 2,000 lower-income homes from the tax sale. 

We have been cited in proposals to alter the City's property tax rates and structure by the University of Baltimore, Maryland Volunteer Lawyers Service, Maryland Legal Aid, The National Latx Lien Association, and various others.","This series represented a first-of-it's-kind data analysis, not only for Baltimore, but in the country. We were the first group to join GIS files for properties, tax lien data for addresses, and Census data to examine the relationships between race, income, home value, and property tax liens at such a granular level.

To do this, we filed public records request for state assessment data and property lien data. The City of Baltimore's Bureau of Revenue Collections didn't comply with the timeline for records requests, so The Baltimore Banner employed a First Amendment attorney to acquire the records.","We used many different methods in R. Effectively, the goal was to join a dataset of property liens by address with a dataset of state home assessment data by address, and then use the GIS information in the state assessments data to join it with ACS data. 

The difficulty is that because the addresses in the liens data and home assessment data come from different sourecs, a great deal of preprocessing was needed to standerdize them. We were able to do so with parsing and ML techniques in R. 

After this, we examined differing rates of home liening and home sale by race and income. However, it's not enough merely to find differing rates when looking at summary statistics. We wanted to test the differences we found more robustly. To do this, we built a series of generalized additive models and generalized linear models to estimate the relationship between race, income, and lien rates in the presence of other nuisance variables. The modeling efforts agreed with the initial summary statistics.","Other journalists can both use our code and methodology, publicly available on GitHub, to examine property tax rates in their own cities (an topic of increasing importance since the Supreme Court ruling in 2023), and a broader methodology for testing differences in summary statistics using more robust inferential techniques.",English,https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/housing/baltimore-tax-sale-lien-auction-64APUHOPUFB6VJ4Z6IX6WC7NMU/,https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/housing/tax-investors-distressed-neighborhoods-D47ZGPFQBZEBHKLG7IKMTFSLJA/,https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/housing/baltimore-property-tax-sale-guide-4DNWF6THQBEBTNTJM7IXVWO5NI/,https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/housing/how-to-protect-your-home-from-tax-sale-a-resource-guide-U54KQTDWBBEQVG6QYVPRCYSCPM/,,,,"Nick Thieme, Sophie Kasakove, Laila Milevski","Nick Thieme creates rigorous data journalism with the goal of exposing and undoing systemic inequities by using the tools of statistics to discover reliable information about Baltimore.

They found a lack of transparency that obscures how billions of dollars are being spent.","Shortly after publication, the special report garnered widespread attention among climate negotiators and UN officials. The article sparked discussions on social media platforms. 

""The drawing says it all: our planet is burning, and we are not putting efforts where it matters,"" Reena Ghelani, UN assistant-secretary general, wrote in a LinkedIn post about the project. 

Weeks later, the special report provided insight at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris. Journalists’ findings were repeatedly referenced, shedding light on problems with the climate finance system, according to sources who participated in the closed-door talks.

More recently, at COP28 in Dubai, our work was repeatedly referenced in crucial discussions between climate leaders and negotiators, according to sources. An article in Foreign Policy, “[The Dark Side of Climate Finance](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/12/01/cop28-climate-finance-global-south-development-aid-energy-wind-solar-renewable/),” published at the beginning of the COP, highlighted our research. 

A key component of the project was to make the data publicly available, so that other journalists and researchers can explore it further. We placed it in a [public repository](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:dx902xg3463/bln_reuters_climate_finance_2015to2020.csv) at Stanford, and we have heard from researchers who are keen to conduct their own analysis.","The global nature of this project added to its complexity. To identify $3 billion in spending that didn’t align with the goals of climate finance, reporters reviewed thousands of reports, conducted interviews in multiple languages and requested information from more than a dozen different governments. Gaining access to information in some countries proved difficult. For example, we had to solicit help from colleagues in Tokyo to submit records requests and schedule interviews in Japan.

Some countries submitted their reports in different languages which added extra wrinkles to our data standardization and analysis.

We also had to overcome the weight of diplomatic pressures. While many sources were willing to talk off the record, reporters struggled with obtaining on-the-record interviews with climate finance negotiators who didn’t want to hinder their bargaining power.","Wealthy countries document their climate finance contributions within a larger report submitted biennially to the United Nations. Our reporters obtained each country’s reports covering 2015-2020, the most recent year available. Subtle reporting differences among nations required us to write Python code to standardize the information before combining files. To trace where the funding goes, we used the Pandas library and regular expressions to extract locations from funding descriptions. Some countries reported their contributions in different currencies, so we added a field that standardizes amounts in current US dollars. 

Analysis of the data was conducted in Python and R. Reporters relied on international records requests, online sleuthing and discussions with sources to uncover details about where money went. We provided this additional information in a [searchable database](https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/2023/WoTYrm4EG5A/) published with the story.","This project hinged on information that was public and readily available online. It demonstrates how powerful it can be for reporters to gather, clean and standardize such information to produce an original data analysis. This project also highlights the importance of going beyond the data. Because countries are not always transparent in their reports about climate finance, it’s important to look further than columns and rows to uncover the truth.

This required pulling in information from many other sources, including documents requested via open-records laws, additional databases and interviews with climate experts and other sources. While often frustrating and time-consuming, this project exemplifies the importance of sticking with the story. With grit and determination, our reporters were able to illuminate long-standing problems related to climate finance by using information that was hiding in plain sight. 

What our reporters uncovered is just the start. Other reporters around the world can now mine the data we’ve made available to uncover how climate finance is playing out in their countries.",English,https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-finance/,https://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/testfiles/2023/WoTYrm4EG5A/,,,,,,"Emma Rumney, Irene Casado Sánchez, Jaimi Dowdell, Misato Nakayama, Sakura Murakami, Kiyoshi Takenaka, Sam Hart, Simon Newman, Eve Watling, Janet Roberts",This project was reported and produced by a team of Reuters Journalists.
United States of America,The Hechinger Report,Small,,,Beyond the Rankings: The College Welcome Guide,16/10/2023,"Explainer, Database, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics","Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python, Flourish",A first-of-its-kind College Welcome Guide shows how state laws and school policies influence campus culture. The accompanying story shows how these changes affect students.,"We heard from other journalists using our data (as intended), and families and college counselors learning more from it about colleges they were considering. Because of the nature of the topic, people who work in higher education were more circumspect, but privately we heard enormous and overwhelmingly positive feedback – especially from people feeling besieged by outside influences on what and how they are allowed to teach. The ultimate intention (and one that is so far hard to measure) is to influence institutional behavior; the project originated from a panel discussion in which an audience member asked how universities and colleges could be pushed to defend diversity and free speech, and a panelist said the best way would be by exposing their policies to the broader public.","There’s an abundance of data in this country about higher education and state laws around such issues as abortion rights. But it’s scattered and hard to access for families who could most benefit from knowing it. Tracking down and vetting all the data sources that we used for this project took months, and some had to be collected manually. Some data was available from the federal government but housed in different places. Other pieces were gathered independently by interest groups or researchers – that information had to be, painstakingly at times, matched with the federal datasets. And, of course, the information we gathered about state policies was changing in real time and needed intensive fact-checking to make sure we were as up to date as possible before publication. 
As a nonprofit newsroom that took this project on with no additional funding and no staff developer, we faced limitations in how to present the data. Building a custom tool was not an option. In the end, we used the free version of Flourish, which presented challenges and prevented us from doing everything we would have liked. However, we were able to overcome many of the obstacles through creative hard coding within Flourish.","We used a combination of Excel and Python to create, clean and analyze the various datasets that were used in this project and used Flourish to create the visuals. We had a great deal of data to display, but wanted it to be as neat and easy to navigate for the user as possible.

After much trial and error, Fazil Khan, our data reporter, found a way to hard code HTML and CSS in Flourish that allowed us to add several features and functionalities to our graphics that aren’t otherwise available in the free version of the tool. The buttons that allow the users to toggle between 10 separate tables/maps within a single window and the colored dots identifying the type of the institution are two of the several key features we developed. These allowed us to pack a huge amount of information in a dashboard-like format without having a news application developed from scratch which not only saved us precious resources but also makes the maintainability of the tool far easier and manageable for a small newsroom like ours.","Other journalists have already let us know that they were using our data to inform their own coverage of colleges and universities in their areas. As for lessons from the broader project, one is that off-the-shelf technology can be used to create ambitious interactive tools at lower cost. Another is that information is available from sources other than the ones that beat reporters often use. We pulled information from free-speech organizations, advocates for rural students, student veteran associations and groups that track reproductive rights, among many others. In addition to helping us produce the data project, they also introduced us to new sources of information for our ongoing coverage of this beat",python,https://hechingerreport.org/beyond-the-rankings-the-college-welcome-guide/,https://hechingerreport.org/culture-wars-on-campus-start-to-affect-where-students-choose-to-go-to-college/,https://hechingerreport.org/how-we-made-our-college-welcome-guide/,,,,,"Jon Marcus, Fazil Khan, Sarah Butrymowicz","Jon Marcus writes and edits stories about, and helps plan coverage of, higher education.

Three hashtags were pushed by a network of accounts, coordinated to discredit the Nation Media Group. Some of the accounts pushing the misinformation are verified accounts. The hashtags became top Twitter trends with the help of over 1,800 posts prominently from about 15 Twitter accounts that tweeted about 50 posts within a span of three hours, from 12PM to 3PM on June 20, 2023.","The investigation gained traction both locally and internationally, as it was republished by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).

The material received resonance, in particular, because in Ukraine a large number of people are under regular rocket shelling. Ukrainian officials also mentioned the material. The journalistic material was included in the shortlist of the National Competition of Investigative Journalism, and a member of the jury reported that it would be studied together with students at the university.The material is an important reminder that the decisions that are made today can have far-reaching consequences for the future, and that the citizens of Ukraine are suffering because of the shortsightedness of the decisions that were made by Ukrainian leaders in the late 1990s.","The implementation of the journalistic material took place under martial law in Ukraine. This imposed certain restrictions and challenges that are worth describing.

Access to data on missile attacks and information sources was complicated due to security issues. We had to look for alternative ways to verify facts, these included both open data and sources in law enforcement agencies. The search for documents in the archives also took a considerable amount of time, as even archive employees admitted that they had tried to find these documents unsuccessfully.","Investigative journalism: conducted a thorough review of archival documents, including the 1999 agreement between the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers and the Russian government, as well as other documents related to the transfer of missiles and other weapons.

Nigeria,HumAngle,Small,,,The Curious Case Of The ‘Unknown Gunmen’ And IPOB’s Internet Propaganda,23/06/2023,"Long-form, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Crime, Gun violence, Terrorism","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Datawrapper, Flourish, Media Cloud.","The report examines the connection between Nigeria's armed separatist group, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), and rising violence in the southeastern region through an analysis of hundreds of posts on social media by accounts affiliated with the group.","This is the first time any journalist would scrutinise the possible links between IPOB and the Unknown Gunmen, let alone with this amount of rigour. For this reason, the report attracted a lot of public attention based on its own merits. There was also positive feedback from numerous people who have had the same hypothesis but no means of corroborating it. 

The article was read by thousands of people on the website. It was also picked up and cross-published by Nairaland, Nigeria’s largest internet forum, where it has been read over 14,800 times and triggered a debate among scores of users (here: https://www.nairaland.com/7741947/curious-case-unknown-gunmen-ipobs), with many people agreeing with the conclusions.

Additionally, the article was promoted by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies (here: https://africacenter.org/daily-media-review/africa-media-review-for-june-26-2023/) and republished by other blogs such as this one (https://niyitabiti.net/2023/06/the-curious-case-of-the-unknown-gunmen-and-ipobs-internet-propaganda-2/).","I identified six prominent pages used by IPOB for propaganda on Facebook and extracted all the posts that mentioned “Unknown Gunmen” and “UGM”. The total number of posts catalogued was 210. Because I could not find a data scraping tool that worked for the purpose of this research, I manually collected a range of data.

Using this method, I was able to statistically determine how many of the posts amplified unknown gunmen attacks, how many supported these attacks, how many were indifferent, how many opposed them, when these posts were made and their frequency over the years, etc. I was able to determine what differences there were in how the two major IPOB factions approached the security crisis.

I also collected other datasets. One to show the significant rise in violent attacks in Nigeria’s southeast since IPOB publicly launched a militia known as the Eastern Security Network (ESN). The second was a collection of over 26,000 local press reports from 2013 to date that mentioned “unknown gunmen” (scraped using MediaCloud). These helped to establish a connection between IPOB’s activities/propaganda and the rise of insecurity in the region as well as increased use of the phrase “unknown gunmen” in local media.","I manually scraped data from hundreds of Facebook posts ranging from the text to page name, page affiliation, nature of post, URL, engagements, and reactions.

These helped to establish a connection between IPOB’s activities/propaganda and the rise of insecurity in the region as well as increased use of the phrase “unknown gunmen” in local media.

I used Flourish, an online data visualisation tool, as well as Datawrapper to illustrate the information gathered.","Out of all the insurgencies Nigeria is facing -- ISWAP/Boko Haram in the Northeast and Fulani militias in the Northwest and North-central -- the separatist insurgency in the Southeast is the only one that is virtually faceless. It is why the assailants have come to be known as “unknown gunmen”. And without identifying the actors or possible actors behind these attacks, it would be difficult to develop and implement solutions. You do not know who to dialogue with or who you are truly fighting. This report shows to what extent the Indigenous People of Biafra can be said to be involved in these violent incidents based on a thorough study of their social media propaganda.

Es importante remarcar que el acceso de rastreo de armas es algo que no ha salido en medios. Es algo muy relevante porque ambos gobiernos el mexicano y el norteamericano han negado en distintos auditorios y por transparencia. 
En el reportaje también usamos información de una filtración militar para poder mapear armas usadas en crímenes en los últimos años para poder explicar que lo que les presentamos no es un caso único.

Для анализа мы взяли стоимость 10 наиболее потребляемых продуктов — говядину, картофель, лук, хлопковое масло, молоко, морковь, рис, сахар, хлеб и яйца (10 штук) за 2002-2022 годы. 
В результате анализа мы выяснили, что стоимость нашей условной корзины, состоящей из 10 продуктов, увеличилась примерно в 9 раз за последние 20 лет.

Ukraine,Радіо Свобода (Radio Free Europe/RadioLiberty),Big,,,Власник Київстару та Моршинської співпрацює із Росгвардією та охороною Путіна (розслідування),01/05/2023,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Breaking news, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Infographics, Video, Politics, Business, Economy","Animation, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Російська компанія «АльфаСтрахование», співвласником якої є підсанкційний олігарх Михайло Фрідман, надає Росгвардії послуги зі страхування службового транспорту її підрозділів. Знайдено підтвердження того, що військові частини, з якими підписані контракти, беруть участь у війні проти України та підтримують режим на окупованих територіях.

Інша компанія X5 Retail Group Фрідмана під час вторгнення продовжує співпрацювати з військово-промисловим комплексом Росії, а саме – з підприємством «Военторг» Міноборони РФ, яке забезпечує російських військових формою та продуктами харчування. Йдеться про діяльність мережі роздрібних магазинів в Росії під спільним брендом «Военторг-Пятерочка», яка була створена у 2014 році і продовжує розростатись і під час повномасштабного вторгнення Росії в Україну.","1. Після виходу розслідування материнська компанія ABH Holdings, власником якої є олігарх Фрідман, заявила про вихід з російського страхового бізнесу ""Альфастрахование"".
https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-skhemy-fridman-prodazh-biznesu/32393609.html
2. Після виходу розслідування президент Зеленський запровадив санкції проти ""Альфастрахование"", а пізніше проти X5 Retail Group та афілійованих осіб. В обгрунтуванні накладенню санкцій зазначена інформація з розслідування ""Схем"".
https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-skhemy-kompaniya-fridmana-sanktsiyi/32491890.html
3. У вересні 2023 року Фрідману оголосили підозру, зокрема за фактами, оприлюдненими в розслідуванні ""Схем"". У грудні 2023 року Фрідмана оголосили в розшук.
https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-skhemy-fridman-sbu-pidozra/32578981.html

Наразі готується позов про конфіскацію активів Фрідмана в Україні.","Вважаю, що поєднання методів аналітичного дослідження контрактів Росгвардії з Альфастрахуванням, та порівняння номерів вантажівок Росгвардії з тими підрозділами, які вказані в контракті, дозволило довести, що компанії Фрідмана підтримують вторгнення.

На противагу певному сприйняттю Фрідмана як російського олігарха, який не підтримує вторгнення, це стало першим підтвердженням того, що і після 24 лютого 2022 року його компанії беруть участь в допомозі збройній агресії Росії проти України.","В ході проведення розслідування мною було використано інструменти розпізнавання обличчя, інструменти Excel для аналізу інформації, також я використав дані державних закупівель РФ.

Окремо, мною були використані бази даних про реєстрацію транспортних засобів на території РФ, які дозволили з'ясувати, за яким підрозділом Росгвардії закріплені автівки. Пізніше ці ж підрозділи ми відшукали в офіційних контрактах з ""Альфастрахованием"" Фрідмана.","В Україні з травня 2022 року діє законодавство, яке дозволяє конфісковувати активи росіян на території України за умови, що вони підтримують повномасштабне вторгнення або в будь-який спосіб сприяють збройній агресії Росії.

Таким чином, якщо орієнтиром для журналіста є імпакт, то це є одним із шляхів пошуку підтверджених фактів, які дозволять державним та правоохоронним органам виконувати свою роботу з конфіскації активів російських олігархів та упередять їхній вплив на органи влади в Україні з метою запобігти втрати активів.","Українська, Англійська",https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/skhemy-fridman-alfastrakhovanye-roshvardiya/32382279.html,https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-fridman-russian-military-vehicles-schemes-scandal/32404641.html,,,,,,Георгій Шабаєв,"Журналіст-розслідувач проєкту Радіо Свобода «Схеми».

Kyrgyzstan,"Peshcom.org, Kloop.kg",Small,,,"Daily waste woes: Bishkek сitizens discard tons of food packaging, yet the majority Is recyclable",24/04/2023,"Explainer, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Chart, Environment","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV","This data-journalism project explores the possibilities of recycling packaging of goods from Bishkek’s supermarkets. In order to determine the nature of the packaging materials and assess their recyclability, over almost 6500 items were marked and analyzed. The project, a result of several months of manual research and assigning recycling codes, concludes that over half of food packaging is recyclable. 

The uniqueness of the project is that previously in Kyrgyzstan and other Central Asian countries no one has analyzed waste from goods packaging in such detail and on a large scale.","Before the official release of the article, it was presented at an online discussion event. In addition to the material's author, speakers included eco-activists with deep knowledge of waste recycling in Bishkek and issues surrounding the landfill where the waste is dumped. Thanks to these activists and promotion through Instagram, the Waste Management Business Network (Wastenet.kg) found out about the online meeting. Their representatives attended the online meeting and later shared the published material through their communication channels, recognizing the data project as beneficial to waste recyclers.

The project's success is reflected in the average reading time metric, reaching an impressive 5 minutes and 16 seconds during its peak popularity. It's noteworthy that one of Kyrgyzstan's largest and well-known media outlets, Kloop media, reposted the material.

It's worth mentioning that the timing of the material's release was particularly fitting. In 2023, Kyrgyzstan actively addressed the issue of the burning landfill mentioned in the article. Shortly after the material's publication, the ongoing landfill fire was successfully extinguished. In the fall, the construction of a sorting plant began. This article has already contributed to raising awareness of the problem, and it will remain relevant when Kyrgyzstan's authorities address waste recycling more seriously.","The idea for this project originated in 2020 when Kyrgyzstan's parliament members proposed a bill to ban the import and production of single-use plastic bags. At that time, I questioned whether this initiative alone would be sufficient to reduce the amount of plastic waste polluting the environment. Almost all the products we buy daily are packaged in plastic, making it essential to investigate and confirm the hypothesis.

It's crucial to note that the bill initiated in 2020, was passed by the parliament in 2023. It will take effect in 2027. While this is a significant step, the next crucial step should involve monitoring product packaging and its recycling.

Additionally, the overall project took about three months. The majority of the time was dedicated to manually labeling different types of packaging for each product. It was a challenging task, involving searching through Google, reviewing websites, and, in some cases, physically visiting stores to find each product. If we had more resources and capabilities, we might have attempted to optimize this process. However, optimization would have required more people and substantial financial resources, which we didn't have. Ultimately, the extensive analysis was carried out by a few individuals manually.","The data, including product names, was extracted from the hypermarket chain's website using the Data Miner tool. Subsequently, most of the work was carried out using Google Sheets, where we labeled, filtered, and analyzed the data. We visualized the data using Datawrapper.

It's essential to note that the database was created from scratch. To properly label the types of packaging, we relied on recycling codes that manufacturers are obligated to include on products. Additionally, we examined the countries of origin to understand where products are imported into Kyrgyzstan.

To ensure uniformity in the data, we developed our methodology and categories. Review websites played a significant role — information about many products was found there, often through user-posted photos. We also actively utilized Google Lens to find the necessary information.

To understand which packaging could be recycled in Kyrgyzstan, we directly contacted recyclers, studied a considerable amount of literature, and referred to other research on waste recycling.","The methodology and concept of the project can be applied in any other city or country since environmental pollution and waste recycling are global issues. This article serves as a guide on where to find data — thanks to the digitization and the shift to online commerce, more data is becoming openly accessible. Through scraping, one can gather information from supermarket websites or even large online marketplaces for further study and analysis.

Our dataset also provides an easy understanding of recycling codes.

Furthermore, journalists covering environmental topics can reference this data material in their work. We believe that our comprehensive analysis is suitable for representing the issue not only in Bishkek but in any other city.","Russian, Kyrgyz, English",https://peshcom.org/plastik-bishkek-en,https://kloop.kg/blog/2023/04/25/desyatki-tonn-kazhdyj-den-bishkekchane-vybrasyvayut-upakovki-ot-edy-no-bolshinstvo-iz-nih-mozhno-pererabotat/,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrqvpX4oKdQ/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=,,,,,"Author: Alexey Juravlev

Інтерактивна мапа щодня оновлюється та доповнюється.","Через російську окупацію Криму, Збройні сили України називають російські військові об'єкти у Криму своїми законними цілями. Через те, що величезна кількість цих об'єктів знаходяться у безпосередній близькосьті до цивільних житлових будинків, журналісти Крим.Реалії вирішили попередити кримчан про місця потенційної небезпеки, аби жителі півострова могли прийняти певні міри та убезпечити себе. Як виявилось, наша робота стала корисною не лише для кримчан, але й для аналітиків, що досліджують мілітаризацію Криму. На корпоративну пошту та в інтерв'ю ми неодноразово отримували слова вдячності від користувачів ресурсу. Також публікація проєкту створила великий резонанс в українських та міжнародних медіа.","Ми вважаємо, що завдяки використанню інноваційних технологій, а саме поєднанню супутникових знімків та розслідувальною журналістикою, ми створили унікальний медіа-продукт, який щодня стає при нагоді жителям Криму, аналітикам, військовим експертам та медійникам.","До того як опублікувати ми збирали інформацію з відкритих джерел протягом півроку, але цю роботу продовжуємо й зараз. Також півострів Крим ми досліджували користуючись сервісами **Google Street View**, **Яндекс.Панорамы** та **Planet Labs**, буквально в ручну переглядаючи кожен метр півострова. Також усі пункти верифіковані, як мінімум з двох різних незалежних джерел. Для верифікації точних координат місць вибухів, ми часто використовували сервіс **NASA FIRMS**.
Зібрану інформацію заносили до **Google Таблиці**. Далі для первинної візуалізації, перенесли дані з таблиці в **Google My Maps**. Там створили окремі колонки по категоріям, датам, джерелам, тощо. Орієнтуючись на отриману візуалізацію ми за допомогою **Java Script** та **HTML** створили власнуий мікро-сайт з інтерактивною мапою на основі OpenStreetMap.

But Whose Privacy Was He Protecting?,10/02/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Infographics, Corruption, Money-laundering, Business","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Why did a man who runs a private aircraft company become a central figure in rolling back corporate transparency across Europe? In November 2022, beneficial ownership registries closed public access following the court ruling made after Luxembourg businessman Patrick Hansen filed a lawsuit. He argued that his personal safety could be compromised, despite his extensive social media presence sharing personal details. OCCRP found that Hansen was involved in 110+ companies and he was directing companies for wealthy Russians, including the families of a United Russia MP &amp; the Kolikov’s, which, through an offshore, loaned nearly $100M to Hansen’s aviation company.","After the project was published, Austria changed the law on UBO (ultimate beneficial owner) registry making it accessible to journalists if they work on money laundering or similar topics when asking for UBO data. One of the Austrian partners on the project was able to dig into UBO data again and publish a follow up story. Two months after the project was published, Transparency International sent an open letter, signed by nearly 200 individuals and international organizations, to the European Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union, asking the EU to uphold corporate transparency in the 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. In March 2023, the European Parliament adopted new measures regarding UBO setting the rules for all member states – access rights should be valid for at least two and a half years to all persons with legitimate interest.

It was republished in numerous media outlets and widely spread on social media. Journalists’ findings were elaborated on by Tax Justice Network and one of the authors of the project was the guest in their monthly podcasts.","In November 2022, the EU Court of Justices struck down public access for beneficial ownership registries. Immediately, UBO registries across Europe start shutting down making it harder to trace dirty money. Corporate transparency is crucial for identifying illicit activities, hidden assets, and so fighting corruption and organized crime. Following this, a group of investigative journalists at OCCRP and other media partners decided to investigate the plaintiff – a businessman Patrick Hansen from Luxembourg. Before starting this investigation, OCCRP and some other media partners published the OpenLux project, revealing shady deals and hidden assets managed through Luxembourg companies, thanks to UBO data that was publicly available. While investigating the Luxembourg plaintiff, some of the UBO registries, including Luxembourg one, were accessible to journalists again, but researching corporate structures was much harder than it was before. This project revealed that the plaintiff was involved in over 110 companies, which raised concerns among the experts with whom journalists talked that he was likely a proxy for those whose companies he was directing – including Russian oligarchs. The significance of these findings is higher considering that the EU has imposed sanctions against Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.","Besides those used traditionally (i.e. interviews, FOI requests), this project combined many other tools, investigative &amp; research methods, and techniques. Significant part of the project was obtaining &amp; analyzing company data of more than 110 companies worldwide. Authors of the project collected hundreds of company documents &amp; financial statements analyzing their business deals and connections. They created an extensive database with company data published on OCCRP website as an interactive database (using the visualization tool Flourish). All obtained information was confirmed with the official government sources (i.e. official company registries). Besides tracking people and their assets, investigating companies’ ownership structures and financials, journalists were also using different tools (i.e. Icarus, FlightRadar24) to track planes linked to the aviation company managed by the plaintiff from Luxembourg. They used other tools (i.e. Maltego, Skopenow) for analyzing posts and social media accounts. Among other tools, journalists used some for face recognition when investigating people (i.e. PimEyes) &amp; tools for investigating phone numbers and email addresses (i.e. Pipl, Epieos). All the information and documents regarding the investigation and project coordination were shared among authors and other partners on the platforms that OCCRP network uses for collaboration (i.e. OCCRP Aleph, OCCRP Wiki).","For journalists, publicly available beneficial ownership registries are a key tool for exposing corruption and financial crimes like money laundering. Registries are crucial in almost all investigative stories when journalists are digging into corporate structures, finding illicit activities and hidden assets. Journalists should not only stick to investigating individual cases looking into who are the real owners of companies, but also investigate the case which is an obstacle to discovering wrongdoings and find these stories – like closing down UBO registries. This project is a comprehensive cross-border investigation in which journalists were digging into many different angles – from how the new court ruling threatened transparency, to who was behind it and what their background was. It means that the project also covered the investigation of the lawyers, judges and others making this happen, but not all the information gathered ended up in the publication. Journalists should always cover all different aspects – researching companies, their business activities, and connections, tracking people and assets, digging into social media, etc, using different tools to obtain all information available and put them together to find a story.","German, Flemish, French, Spanish, Greek",https://www.occrp.org/en/beneficial-ownership-data-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-corruption/this-luxembourg-businessman-got-europes-corporate-registries-shut-down-but-whose-privacy-was-he-protecting,https://www.transparency.org/en/press/open-letter-european-commission-beneficial-ownership-transparency-6th-amld,https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230327IPR78511/new-eu-measures-against-money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing,https://taxjustice.net/press/one-year-on-russian-oligarchs-can-more-easily-evade-eu-sanctions-thanks-to-eu-court-ruling/,,,,"Authors of the project:

United Kingdom,"The New Humanitarian, Mongabay",Small,,,Is the UN really climate neutral? No.,13/09/2023,"Investigation, Illustration, Infographics, Environment","Animation, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Sentinel Hub","The UN claims to be almost entirely “climate neutral”, yet that claim is based on buying millions of carbon offset credits that experts say do little to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, The New Humanitarian and Mongabay found in a year-long investigation. Reports of environmental damage, displacement, or health problems were also found to be linked to at least 13 carbon offsetting projects that received UN funds.

The investigation also found that the UN’s selection of offsets was done “randomly”, without regard for the low-quality credits that dominate the market.","Our investigation reached a global audience. On The New Humanitarian website, the investigation was viewed more than 5,000 times by readers from more than 20 countries. Reporter Jacob Goldberg was interviewed about the story by outlets including TRT World and ABC Radio National, garnering thousands more views. 

The New Humanitarian organised an online conversation with Jacob Goldberg and Paisley Dodds from The New Humanitarian joined by Médecins Sans Frontières planetary health coordinator Dikolela Kalubi and University of Pennsylvania offsetting expert Joe Romm. Held just before COP, panellists discussed the wider implications of the findings of the investigation, and looked at the widespread use of “junk” credits.

More than 40 UN staff, from various agencies, registered to attend. On the day, more than 100 people joined the conversation, with 500+ watching the recording. An anonymous UN source told us during the event that the investigation triggered a lot of internal discussion at the UN about its approach to carbon offsetting. A source at UNHCR told us that they have taken note of concerns raised in our investigation and are assessing their carbon offsetting initiatives accordingly.","This was a year-long collaborative investigation that used data journalism and deep reporting techniques. 

As the world comes out of a deeply flawed climate meeting in Dubai, what is needed now is clear leadership from the UN, but our team found that their offsets not only do little for the climate, some of these projects also cause environmental damage, displacement, or health problems in surrounding communities.

Lead reporter Jacob Goldberg learned of rumored problems with the UN’s carbon offset program while reporting a previous, related story for his outlet, The New Humanitarian, and so his editor brought together a team and partnered with Mongabay to investigate.

The data on what carbon offset projects are in the UN portfolio were very difficult to obtain, and these are split among 33 branches of the organization, which required the team to repeatedly follow up with liaisons at the various agencies before they complied. Once compiled, the data pointed toward one overall conclusion: the UN’s portfolio is largely made up of low quality, ineffective, and sometimes detrimental projects.

Because the UN is largely exempt from regulatory oversight, its offset portfolio has remained unexamined, until now.","This investigation used basic data analysis to collate data from more than 50 UN agencies related to their carbon offset purchases. This required manually entering data related to more than a thousand transactions into a database and analysing multiple variables: the type of project each offset came from, which country the offset was based in, and the price of each offset. After collecting the data, we compared our analysis to existing professional analyses of offsets, such as those conducted by BeZero Carbon, the Carbon Offset Guide, and the Carbon Credit Quality Initiative, and we sought comments from more than a dozen experts to verify our analysis. We manually searched online for news reports implicating UN-purchased offsets in human rights abuses or environmental destruction, and after we uncovered instances of harm, we backed up our findings with field reporting in Brazil and India. Our dataset allowed us to determine the average price of the UN paid for its credits, which was far below the price of any credit considered to be high-quality. Finally, we used Datawrapper to visualise our data and satellite images from Sentinel Hub to visualise the impact of a UN-funded dam on the Amazon rainforest.","Our investigation serves as a blueprint for any journalist seeking to assess an organisation’s climate neutrality claims – a task previously reserved for professional analysts. The process includes:

* Identify an organisation making a climate neutrality claim. 
* Ask the organisation what evidence they use to substantiate their neutrality claim. Obtain offset certificates, either from the organisation or through freedom of information mechanisms.
* Analyse the composition of the organisation’s offset portfolio: what types of projects are included, how much did they cost, in which year and which country are the projects based?
* Compare the composition of the portfolio to best practices using resources such as BeZero, the Carbon Offset Guide, and the Carbon Credit Quality Initiative.
* Search for existing media reports to determine each project’s social and environmental impact. Bolster findings with field reporting. International collaboration is key.
* Use data visualisation tools to summarise conclusions about the quality of the organisation’s offset portfolio. 

Journalists could also learn the value of persistence. We spent months persuading UN agencies to share their offset purchase data, even up to the week of publication. Each additional dataset we received further confirmed our thesis that most of the UN’s offsets had no climate impact.",English,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/investigations/2023/09/13/is-the-un-really-climate-neutral-climate-experts-say-no,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/podcast/2023/09/14/whats-unsaid-un-not-climate-neutral,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2023/12/21/un-defends-questionable-offsetting-practices-new-emissions-report,,,,,"Jacob Goldberg

CNS performed a data analysis of the removed books to see what other characteristics the books shared. We found that 67% of the authors of the removed books were female, 28% were LGBTQIA+ and 12% identified as non-binary. Nearly half of the books contain LGBTQIA+ characters and at least 16 include characters of color.",The project was picked up by The Baltimore Banner – published on their website and shared on social media– and widely distributed throughout the region as a result. The project also used data to show that common threads and characteristics ran through the removed books.,"The challenges were driven by Moms for Liberty, a conservative group focusing on parents’ rights that, according to The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/05/23/lgbtq-book-ban-challengers/), has been responsible for a surge of book challenges across the United States in recent years.","Reporting -- we reported on the effort to remove books from Carroll County schools by talking to parents, administrators and others.

Data collection - We collected data about all of the books being removed and created a small database of the attributes we were interested in (for example, author race and gender, the presence of LGBTQ+ characters, ect).

Kenya,"Code for Africa, through the African Digital Democracy Observetory (ADDO)",Big,,,Inside Al-Shabaab's digital propaganda machine,23/11/2023,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Cross-border, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Terrorism",Google Sheets,"This investigative story exposes the intricate digital network of Al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization in Somalia and Kenya, revealing how the terrorist organization strategically exploits platforms like Chirpwire and Telegram for disseminating extremist content. Focusing on two key media outlets, Shahada News Agency and Al-Kataib, this report uncovers key data points, like registration information and other connections between the two outlets. This investigation emphasizes the challenge of countering digital extremism and the need for global cooperation to neutralize the threat posed by Al-Shabaab's sophisticated propaganda machinery in the region and similar extremist groups in the Sahel region.","The project on Al-Shabaab's digital network had a profound impact, evident in heightened public awareness and engagement metrics. By uncovering the hidden layers of extremism, this investigative story not only informed society but ignited a collective commitment to tackling the complexities of digital propaganda, making a lasting difference in shaping the narrative around counter-terrorism efforts. The story's profound influence is reflected in heightened public awareness and engagement across various platforms including:

Facebook: Generated 127 impressions, reached 118 individuals, and elicited 4 engagements.

X Platform: Garnered 567 impressions, with 44 engagements and 22 link clicks.

LinkedIn: Achieved 695 impressions, 29 engagements, 20 reactions, and 37 clicks.

Notably, the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) shared the story on their Facebook page. The engaged audience on LinkedIn comprises communication specialists from Francophone Africa, journalists from diverse regions (East and West Africa), technologists, and security intelligence and risk advisors. This diverse engagement shows the story's broad impact across professional spheres and regions.","Beyond the visible aspects of our investigation into Al-Shabaab's digital network, we faced significant contextual challenges. Accessing data proved challenging due to the covert nature of extremist activities, compelling us to employ innovative technologies like open-source intelligence tools and email lookup platforms to piece together the intricate connections.

Delving into the dark socials associated with Al-Shabaab carried inherent risks, heightening the complexity of our exploration. The language barrier, despite Arabic proficiency in one of the contributors of the story, posed difficulty as a substantial portion of the data was in Somali context, requiring high-level translation.

The psychological toll was evident, particularly when sifting through graphic content depicting the aftermath of attacks. Around 80-90% of extremist messaging celebrated attacks and as evidence, the extremists included dead bodies in their messaging. Contributor Khattab Hamad, a Muslim, grappled with the personal impact of Islamist propaganda, struggling to distinguish between true religious information and the propaganda being shared.

Coordinating with Hamad, based in Egypt with limited media freedom, added complexity. Accessing evidence links required stringent digital security measures to avoid exposure as a suspicious entity, potentially facing threats from extremists or their affiliates.","Maltego played a pivotal role in illustrating social links, providing a visual representation of the intricate connections within the extremist network. Epieos was instrumental in email investigations, helping trace individuals and affiliations behind online activities.

WhoisXML and Website Informer were crucial for uncovering website histories, offering insights into the inception and evolution of platforms like Shahada News Agency. Meltwater proved invaluable in identifying copy-paste related accounts on Twitter, shedding light on coordinated dissemination efforts.

In addition to these tools, we used manual Telegram investigation techniques, delving into the platform to uncover affiliations and connections among users.","This project offers valuable insights for fellow journalists interested in the use of data in investigations, specifically of extremist networks. Firstly, leveraging a diverse toolkit, including Maltego, Epieos, WhoisXML, Website Informer, and Meltwater, enhances the depth and accuracy of findings. The strategic use of open-source intelligence tools proves instrumental in unraveling complex networks.

Furthermore, manual investigation techniques on platforms like Telegram remain crucial, especially in navigating the clandestine nature of extremist activities. The project underscores the importance of language proficiency in contexts like Somalia, where translation skills are essential for understanding and interpreting content accurately.

The psychological toll of engaging with graphic extremist content highlights the need for mental resilience among journalists covering such sensitive topics. Lastly, the project shows the critical role of stringent digital security measures when accessing potentially risky evidence links. Overall, this investigation serves as a roadmap for journalists, providing guidance on the use of data to strengthen investigations, ensuring digital security in accessing online data, especially those found in dark socials, and ethically informed reporting.",English,https://disinfo.africa/inside-al-shabaabs-digital-propaganda-machine-05cbdb04ed4f,https://disinfo.africa/5-tactics-extremists-use-to-evade-or-delay-detection-online-45b531e8acbd,,,,,,"Mitchelle Awuor, Khattab Hamad, Allan Cheboi, Athandiwe Saba, Theresa Mallinson","Khattab Hamad is an Investigative Data Analyst at iLab, CfA.

Serbia,Center for Investigative Journalism of Serbia,Small,,,Femicide in Serbia: Crime and Lesser Punishments,18/05/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Women, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Python, Pinpoint, Open Refine, Flourish, Canva, Knightlab","In the past decade, more than 300 femicides have occurred in Serbia, while killers often commit suicide. Families of the murdered persons look for justice in court, but CINS’s investigation reveals that they often do not get it. 

Our two journalists analyzed 117 cases of femicide that went to court between 2014 and the end of 2022. Nearly 70% of the verdicts resulted in sentences of up to 15 years in prison or psychiatric treatment.

In some of the cases, judges cited bizarre mitigating circumstances and imposed lesser sentences, while shifting part of the responsibility onto the murdered women.","CINS's database is the first of a kind in Serbia.

It sparked the debate (in public and within institutions) about making femicide an aggravated murder offense. MPs spoke about this in the National Assembly, and an opposition MP stated that CINS journalists should speak about our work in the Assembly.

The Commissioner for Protection of Equality commented in public the issues reported by CINS. Since femicide is a major issue in Serbia, the story went viral, and our journalists were invited to be guest experts on TV.

Serbia is a patriarchal society and abuse and violence are omnipresent in the society. As institutions fail to protect victims in Serbia, civil society has a crucial role in fight against the problem, and people trust them more than the official institutions. Civil society is now using our findings as a tool for the fight.

This story is one of the most widespread on our social media channels. The story was translated into English and Italian, and republished by independent media in Serbia and in the region.

Recently, CINS journalists won the Annual Tolerance Award presented by the Commissioner for the Protection of Equality for this investigation as the best story this year.","In Serbia, femicide does not exist as a criminal offense, and courts do not have statistics regarding these cases. That is why we had to send at least 125 FOIA requests, conduct interviews with experts, gather all the court verdicts, filter femicide cases, analyze them, and create an internal database - and after months of work, we were at the starting point of an investigation.","CINS's two journalists analysed 117 cases of femicide that were in court between 2014 and 2023. We sent over 125 FOIA requests to 25 high courts, asking for verdicts covering 3 types of criminal offenses.

After that, we analyzed all of the verdicts (over a thousand pages) through Pinpoint, Python and Open Refine, created an internal database in Google Sheets and, analyzed it in Pivot and visualization software (Flourish, Canva, etc.), and gathered conclusions. Our visualizations were created in Flourish, Canva and Knightlab's Story Map.","Our project can give journalists know-how. It doesn’t have to be femicides: by learning from our experience, they will know how to create their dataset and how to get a story from it. 

Also, they can learn more about finding a different angle and how to report the errors in the system. We were the first to tell the story of how our institutions let down the victims and their families once again after the femicide. Our approach shows that, even though a topic is in focus, journalists can be innovative when reporting on it. Since we didn’t report on one place or one court, we showed it is an error in the entire system and not an exception. 

Journalists can learn the importance of storytelling. This story was (mostly) based on court documents, but we told it from a human perspective, making it relatable for our readers. 

It is crucial to report ethically, and journalists can get tips on what mistakes to avoid and the use of gender-sensitive language. 

Also, they can learn the importance of connecting with relevant experts from civil society. They helped us during the investigation, but also after publishing by sharing it, increasing the visibility.","Serbian, English, Italian",https://www.cins.rs/en/femicide-in-serbia-crime-and-lesser-punishments/,https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/13822131/embed,https://www.canva.com/design/DAFjW4FOFqY/view?embed,https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/9e4bd52b685c6c79fc88f959df2b0b07/femicid-story/index.html,,,,"Teodora Ćurčić, journlist

Spain,"Civio, El Confidencial, EDJnet's website",Small,,,The share of Europe's territory at high risk of fire has doubled in the last 50 years,17/10/2023,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Map, Environment","D3.js, Canvas, Json, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js, Svelte.js","This data-driven project meticulously analyses a 50-year increase in Europe's wildfire risk, with a doubling from 20% to nearly 40% of areas experiencing high or extreme fire weather conditions. The article, anchored in precise data analysis and visualisation from the Copernicus Climate Data Store, highlights the impact of ""very extreme"" risk levels on climate change hotspots such as Portugal, Spain and Greece. A key revelation is that countries with historically low fire risk are now grappling with an increasing percentage of at-risk areas. This investigation highlights the changing dynamics of wildfire risk across the continent over the last five decades.","This investigation was significantly enhanced through collaboration with partners from the European Data Journalism Network. Our joint effort allowed us to replicate the European investigation, honing in on specific countries. For example, we delved into the regional dynamics in Spain and addressed Ukraine's wildfire risk, providing a localized perspective. The collaborative approach facilitated a more nuanced examination of unique challenges and trends within individual countries. Several prominent news outlets, including Le Soir (Belgium), Texty (Ukraine), Dennik (Slovakia), and El Confidencial (Spain), published articles stemming from this data analysis. Notably, the Spanish article was cited in the Top 10 data journalism stories by the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) on September 15, 2023.
Additionally, the investigation reached another milestone as we presented our findings in a scientific talk, engaging with professionals at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) from the European Commission. This session served as a valuable platform to share insights into the challenges faced during our work, elucidating the intricacies of our analysis, methodologies, and the tools and technologies employed.","This investigation has presented numerous challenges, with the technical aspect emerging as particularly formidable. Analyzing 262 million data points, spanning each day from 1970 to 2022, for all countries in continental Europe (excluding Russia and certain islands) was an intricate task. The complexity deepened during the analysis and comprehension of this extensive dataset. While predominantly employing the R language, we sought scientific expertise at every juncture. Occasionally, we received guidance steering us away from certain methodological directions, emphasizing the meticulous approach taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our findings. Despite the hurdles, navigating through these technical intricacies has been integral to the rigor and robustness of our investigation.

On the other hand, visualizing such an extensive dataset posed a significant challenge. Despite creating several mockups and charts throughout the process, we deliberately chose a simple approach. Prioritizing clarity, we aimed to make the information accessible to every reader, regardless of their background in the field. This decision was rooted in the intention to enhance comprehension and ensure that the findings could be easily grasped by a broad audience without losing the scientific rigor inherent in our investigation.","In crafting this report, we employed a diverse set of tools and technologies. Data extraction was achieved through the Climate Data Store API, focusing on historical fire danger indices from Copernicus. Initial exploration of raw NetCDF-4 data was conducted using NASA's Panoply, followed by comprehensive cleaning and analysis in R using the tidyverse and terra packages. The data, organized on a 0.25ºx0.25º grid, was filtered according to the spatial boundaries of Europe and each country using giscoR maps. The overall process was informed by expert interviews and encompassed additional analyses, such as studying extreme value increases and examining data seasonality, though these findings were not included in the final report to maintain clarity and avoid information overload.

Visualization prototypes were created in Observable and Plot, with the final interactive graphics developed in Svelte. This entailed utilizing Javascript, D3, and Arquero to clean and adapt the data for specific chart requirements. SVG was employed for most visualizations, while Canvas optimized performance for map points. The visualizations included radial charts, stacked bar graphs, and an interactive map that highlighted specific regions.","The engagement of experts in the decision-making process throughout our data analysis has been indispensable in achieving precise and meaningful outcomes. Environmental challenges, especially those related to fire risk, are inherently complex, compounded by the intricacies inherent in climate science. The expertise provided by specialists in this field has proven invaluable in navigating these intricacies.
The incorporation of experts into our analytical approach has significantly deepened our comprehension of the intricate relationships embedded in the data. Their insights have played a pivotal role in guiding us through informed decision-making, preventing potential pitfalls, and upholding the reliability of our findings.","English, Spanish",https://civio.es/espana-en-llamas/2023/10/17/the-share-of-europes-territory-at-high-risk-of-fire-has-doubled-in-the-last-50-years/,,,,,,,"MARÍA ÁLVAREZ DEL VAYO, ADRIÁN MAQUEDA, CARMEN TORRECILLAS, LUCAS LAURSEN","María Álvarez del Vayo is a journalist specialized in investigation, data and visualization.

The project's impact on the audience and community can be summarized as follows:
Awareness and Education: The investigation has raised awareness about the consequences of rising sea levels on agricultural lands, particularly in the Nile Delta region of Egypt. This has led to increased knowledge and understanding of the issue among the public and has inspired further research and discussions on the topic.
Community Engagement: The project has sparked conversations and debates among the community, with many individuals expressing their concerns and sharing their experiences related to the issue. This has fostered a sense of solidarity and collaboration among people who are affected by the rising sea levels.","Due to the scarcity of data, we dedicated two years (1990 and 2023) to building data using geographic information systems. This effort demanded a significant amount of time and effort to address the region's data limitations. This context is crucial for understanding the extensive groundwork required to gather and create the necessary data for the project. The scarcity of existing data necessitated a comprehensive data-building process, which significantly influenced the project's timeline and resource allocation.","**The investigationutilized various tools, techniques, and technologies, including Geographic Information Systems (GIS), satellite imagery, and data analysis software. The following tools and methods were employed:

Geographic Information Systems (GIS):

The study utilized ArcGIS to analyze satellite visuals from Landset 8 in 2023 and Landset 5 in 1990. This involved downloading satellite visuals from the EarthExplorer website and then converting the data into the ArcGIS 10.8 program.

Satellite Imagery Analysis:
The analysis of satellite images involved specific bands such as 8BAND 3 _ BAND 5 in Landsat images 8 and 7BAND 2-BAND 4 in Landsat images 7 to separate water from agriculture and salt lands and extract the area of water bodies.

Data Representation:
Excel was used for data analysis, and Flourish was used to visually represent the data

Other Maps and Analysis:
Various maps were created, including agriculture, urbanization, coastline, observer classification, soil salinity, fish farms, submerged areas, Lake Burullus, and a map predicting areas affected by sea level rise.","The project's comprehensive approach to the investigation, which includes geographic information systems (GIS), satellite image analysis, and data visualization, demonstrates the power of data-driven journalism in understanding and communicating complex environmental issues. The use of specific tools such as ArcGIS and Excel for analysis and visualization highlights the importance of leveraging technology to produce in-depth reporting on climate-related challenges. Additionally, the project's focus on documenting not only climate impacts but also social and economic trends affecting the region, such as internal migration, provides a comprehensive view of the situation.

This data reporting project investigates how leaks from government-owned pipelines in a district without oil wells or deposits led to widespread hydrocarbon contamination - first detected in a school well in the '90s.

Now, 30 years later, water sources in the district of over one million people taste and smell like gasoline, according to laboratory analysis of water samples collected from some homes in the district.","For the project, we took samples from wells in 5 different homes, had them analysed by 2 different labs, including one run by the state Environment Ministry that confirmed hazardous contamination.

Then we sent the results to Lagos's Environment Ministry and the Federal Environment Ministry.

In December, few months after we shared the results and published our story, government officials met with the community and said they will soon receive clean water. 

The state environment chief also said residents complaints have been escalated to the presidency.

https://thenationonlineng.net/lagos-environment-agency-promises-clean-waterto-community-blighted-by-decades-of-oil-pollution/","The Poisoned Wells of Baruwa stands out because for many years, the government oil organisation had claimed that the ruptured pipelines have been repaired and that no pollution was going on.

But we took water samples 30 years later from homes in the area to laboratory testing and the results show data that the pollution and hydrocarbon contamination is still happening and that water still tastes like gasoline. Without those extra efforts to test water samples and also share results with the state and federal officials, the pollution would continue to be denied or blamed on residents.

Residents have also used the laboratory results sponspored by the Pulitcer Center and Context Newsroom to renewed call and campaign for clean water and compensation for the hardship families that buy water to drink, cook and bather have endured for three decades.","We took water samples from five homes and water sources in the Nigerian district of over one million people and tested them in two environmental labs as part of our evidence-based reporting on the three-decades-long pollution.

A team of analysts and journalists from 13 countries analyzed vast data from social networks and websites. Reporters connected the patterns from data analysis with further research in their countries. In a series of articles, journalists depict the findings starting with the big picture of the eco system towards greater details and profiles of individuals involved in the disinformation spread in various countries. The project also presents a visualisation of the information spread and explains the intentionality of the entire system.","After the confrontation with Telegram, the platform deleted about 10 propaganda channels (around 100K followers together) connected to Kremlin related NewsFront. The .info domain administrator removed the entire Newsfront from their domain. Although we did not reach out to the domain administrator ourselves with questions about sanctions, it was our request to Google which caused the removal (Google alerted the domain administrator). The project created a database of Telegram channels where citizens of European countries can check what are the most popular desinfo sources in their countries and who stands behind them. The series of articles was read by around 60K people in Europe and beyond.","Although according to our findings Telegram is rapidly growing in terms of desinformation spreading, in the first place the platform refused to pay attention to our concerns, saying that it gives the voice to everyone. After the second round of questions Telegram deleted a bunch of channels, which is an unprecedented case.","For our research, we used a variety of methods to identify Telegram accounts in Central and Eastern Europe. Initially, we used data from Ahrefs for our search, followed by Google Custom Search, data from CrowdTangle, and TGstat. Using the Telethon library, we downloaded the content of the Telegram channels and groups that we discovered, and then analyzed their content. We extracted several pieces of information, including the names of other groups and channels whose posts were shared. We repeated this “snowballing” method multiple times, eventually collecting data from 17,749 channels and groups (ranging from a few dozen posts to several thousand). We used machine learning algorithms to analyze their content, including their language, links, and posts shared from other channels and groups.","Our catalog included 7,700 German-language accounts, 800 in Polish, 548 in Czech, 366 in Slovak, 281 in Serbian, 192 in Romanian, 185 in Bulgarian, 159 in Hungarian, 128 in Croatian, plus accounts in other languages. The most prominent spreaders were published in our articles which allows other journalists who research Russian desinformation monitor the channels and narratives in their respective countries.

Spain,Civio,Small,,,18 days of calling every half hour for someone to answer the Minimum Living Income helpline,18/05/2023,"Investigation, Database, Infographics, Audio","Scraping, D3.js, Ruby","The Minimum Living Income is a social benefit introduced by the Spanish government to help people in difficult financial situations. However, months after it became available, many families still couldn't access it. In Civio, we conducted an investigation to assess how badly one of the main means of getting help to apply for this social benefit was working: the helpline. We set up a robot to call the helpline every half hour from 9:00 to 12:00 and proved that the helpline was indeed saturated. It took 150 calls and 18 days for a human to answer the phone.","The research on the saturation of the Minimum Living Income Helpline provides objective data on how difficult the application process was for potential beneficiaries. In a context where potential beneficiaries were complaining about the difficulties of getting help to apply, it was difficult to assess what was wrong with the process. Using technology such as automated calls combined with traditional journalism, we showed the real scenario behind these complaints. The article showing that it took 18 days for a human to answer the helpline was first published on Civio's website in Spanish. However, several national media picked up on the investigation and also published it, such as La Vanguardia, La Razón, 20 minutos and Telecinco. It was also featured in Antena 3's news programme and El País' daily podcast. Although we don't have metrics for these news outlets, the article was widely shared and It received over 20k visits to Civio's website. But the impact that made us prouder was that the administration in charge of the helpline promised Civio that they would strengthen the helpline with 195 more operators.","The Spanish government has announced several social benefits in recent years. However, many of them haven't reached the total number of potential beneficiaries. In Civio, we decided to focus on one of them: the Minimum Living Income, designed to help low-income families. Applying for social benefits is usually a bureaucratic and complex process, designed to be done online in most cases. Sometimes families don't have the means or the capacity to do it correctly, so they end up not getting the help they are entitled to. In a context where there were long waiting lists for face-to-face appointments with the administration, a helpline such as the one set up for the Minimum Living Income could have been a solution. But again, there were complaints about the impossibility of getting a human being to answer the phone. It would have been difficult to prove this right or wrong using only traditional journalistic methods, so we used technology to reveal that the helpline was in fact saturated. It took 150 attempts for a robot to finally get a human to respond.","In this journalistic investigation, we took an innovative and unconventional approach to data collection with the aim of highlighting important social issues. For several days, a robot diligently dialled the helpline every half hour during the 9:00 to 14:00 hours. It took 18 days before a human finally answered the phone. To monitor the helpline, we created a robot using a Ruby script and the Twilio service, which allows you to make and record phone calls. The robot picked up the phone, pressed '1' to skip the privacy information, and stayed on hold. The call ended when the administrator hung up. We then downloaded the recordings of all the calls and classified them according to their content. We also classified all the calls and made them available for the reader to listen to throughout the article. With this interaction, we wanted to show the reader the real number of calls made and make them feel the fatigue of trying. We developed the interactive audio using D3.js, Scrollama.js and Observable, as well as Soundcite, a tool created by the Knight Lab at Northwestern University for integrating audio clips.","The gap between people who could benefit from the Minimum Living Income and those who actually get it is something we've done our best to minimize at Civio. The investigation we are presenting for this award is just one of the aspects we cover, because we have realized that public service journalism, especially for people with lower incomes, is the work we are more passionate about. In fact, we have gone beyond informing about this social benefit and developed an application where anyone can check if they are entitled to it. The Minimum Living Income online assistant on the Civio website has been used more than 14,700 times. Furthermore, anyone, including major media, can easily embed this application on their website.",Spanish,https://civio.es/2023/05/18/18-dias-llamando-cada-media-hora-para-que-alguien-responda-al-telefono-de-ayuda-del-imv/,,,,,,,"Eva Belmonte, David Cabo, Carmen Torrecillas, Adrián Maqueda","Eva Belmonte is a journalist and co-director; she designs, leads, and monitors all of Civio's journalistic investigations.

India,IndiaSpend,Small,,,Chasing Methane: Emission Spikes,13/10/2023,"Database, Open data, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Environment","QGIS, CSV, Python","IndiaSpend's initiative, ""Chasing Methane: Emission Spikes,"" utilizes satellite data to monitor elevated emission occurrences near Indian oil and gas facilities. Analyzing methane concentration data from the Copernicus Sentinel 5-p satellite enables the identification of abnormal levels in proximity to these reservoirs. Often overlooked, these heightened emissions, contributing disproportionately to greenhouse gas levels, pose a substantial threat to environmental and climate objectives. By shedding light on these events, the project aims to enhance awareness and facilitate efforts to mitigate their adverse impact on our environment and sustainability targets.","The project helped identify over 300 emission spikes or potential super-emitter events. Over half of these high spike events have been observed in four locations--the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) refinery in Vizag, the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRLP) refinery in Mangalore, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) refinery in Tatipaka and Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL) refinery in Manali.","Globally, there is a significant underestimation of methane emissions, particularly in the oil and gas sector, with industry emissions being undervalued by 25-40%. India, currently the fourth-largest methane emitter, relies on the less reliable Tier 1 methodology for estimating emissions in this sector, leading to substantial inaccuracies in energy and industrial emission estimates. Methane, over a 20-year period, has the potential to trap 80 times more heat than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide, and approximately 25% of current warming is attributed to human-induced methane emissions. Tackling methane emissions offers a crucial opportunity to temporarily slow the rate of global warming and bridge the emissions gap towards achieving the 2°C or 1.5°C temperature goals.

IndiaSpend's August 2022 report emphasized the oil and gas sector as low-hanging fruit for mitigating methane emissions and combating climate change. Emissions vary across different stages of oil and gas extraction, processing, and delivery, with recent scientific literature referring to high emission sites as the 'fat tail' of the emissions distribution. Identifying and addressing these few high-emitting sources can significantly and rapidly reduce overall methane emissions, presenting a strategic approach to environmental sustainability.","Data collection from satellite feed - Sentinel 5-p methane concentration data from European Space Agency’s Copernicus hub is downloaded via APIs. Data for previously identified geolocation of oil and gas reservoirs and a few pixels in its proximity is filtered

Identification of possible super-emitter event - Generate a relationship between satellite methane enhancement and super emitter leak events using prior research-grade data from SRON Netherlands Institute for Space Research","Addressing data gaps, particularly in estimating methane emissions, poses a challenge without established standards mandating reservoirs in India to measure emissions. This absence of a regulatory framework makes it challenging to gauge the extent of inaccuracies in calculating methane emissions. While ensuring the accuracy of estimations is crucial, it is imperative to initiate efforts to tackle this issue using the tools currently available.

Utilising satellite data serves as a starting point in this endeavor. However, it becomes essential to explore alternative methods, like using satellite data to estimate upper bounds of emission figures. This proactive approach allows us to shed light on the magnitude of the problem before waiting for authorities to implement measurement standards and provide precise figures. Taking these steps now is vital in addressing the challenges posed by data gaps and advancing our understanding of methane emissions in India.",English,https://methane.indiaspend.org/emission-spikes,https://www.indiaspend.com/earthcheckindia/indias-methane-emissions-challenge-addressing-the-data-gap-in-the-oil-gas-sector-878598,https://www.indiaspend.com/explainers/chasing-methane-why-the-methane-emissions-data-gap-needs-filling-830292,,,,,"Nileena Suresh, Karthik Madhavapeddi","Nileena - Nileena works as a data journalist at IndiaSpend.

Jordan,"Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ), Daraj Media",Small,,,Article 308 Bis: Injustice for Minors In Jordan,13/12/2023,"Investigation, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Chart, Women, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python","**Leniency in Punishment for Sexual Assault Perpetrators on Minors In Jordan Despite Available Legislations.**

This investigation sheds light on the implications of “dropping a personal claim” in crimes of sexual assault against minors in Jordanian courts, violating article 308 bis of Jordan’s penal code, which prohibits reduction to the sentence for perpetrators of sexual assault who are over the age of 18, even if the victim’s personal claim was dropped.","This investigation was published just a few days ago, and not much time has passed since then.

Despite this, it was circulated by many websites and local human rights organizations, such as the “Feminist Movement in Jordan.”

But we have a plan to share it with human rights organizations in Jordan and convey it to lawyers and judicial authorities to draw their attention to these violations concerning minors and their rights.

We also plan to reach out to regional human rights organizations to share it on their platforms, creating the desired and impactful effect in line with this important issue.","This data-driven investigation sheds light on significant deficiencies and violations within the courts. It is a sensitive topic that is not easy to discuss in our Arab region.

Journalists worked with extreme caution, and concerns about legal repercussions were present. Until the last moment before its publication, we hesitated to put our names on it.

In addition to this, the cases were extremely limited, and there were significant concerns about individuals speaking with us. We worked on publishing the cases utilized in the investigation using pseudonyms. Not only the cases but also the sources, one of them works in civil organizations, requested the publication of their information under a pseudonym out of fear for her life.

The lawyers also refused to cooperate with us. Those we reached out to denied the existence of these legal violations and were shocked when we informed them about these infractions and their actual presence.

Accessing information was not easy; the judicial authorities refused to cooperate with us, withholding data and completely ignoring the requests we submitted under the Right to Information (RTI). This led us to delve into open data sources and archives of news, as well as available data and rulings.","In this investigation, we conducted research within the case archives, identifying 400 judicial rulings from Jordanian courts over a span of 10 years. Over the course of several months, we used Microsoft Excel to build an organized database from these rulings.

After that, we worked on transcribing the texts of the rulings, organizing them into columns and rows within Excel, cleaning and studying them. We conducted a search within this database to identify prominent keywords and then focused our attention on legal violations discussed in this investigation related to minors.

We focused the research on this specific legal provision. The subsequent challenging task involved identifying victims and seeking additional sources from individuals working within this system to gain further insights into the violations.

We followed this clear methodology during the data analysis process and discovered from the sample that rulings issued by the primary courts constitute 85% of the court decisions in Jordan. Furthermore, violations were found in all types of courts handling these cases and observed that the Police Court, specifically, does not provide explanations for the reduction of sentences in its rulings.

In the visualization, we utilized the ""Flourish"" program to prepare charts that facilitate the results.","We believe that this project is important because rarely do we see work on such legal topics due to their gravity and sensitivity. Journalists can benefit from it:

Understanding the methodology of collecting, filtering, and reading judicial rulings.
Learning how to search in the database of judicial rulings to access a specific story with explicit violations. ِAs a example among the rulings we worked on, there were three cases involving girls who were sexually assaulted and were under the age of twelve. In one of the cases, the perpetrator was over 50 years old.
In some of these cases, the Supreme Court in Jordan was unable to change the rulings and grant the assaulted individuals their rights because the Public Prosecutor's Office did not appeal the verdict according to the established legal procedure. The Supreme Court, being unable, only indicated the existence of a violation.

Hong Kong,South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.,Big,,,‘Lifestyle rather than performance’: a visual guide to wearing Chinese hanfu,24/11/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Documentary, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Arts, Lifestyle, Culture, Women","Animation, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","The project is to explain the nationwide phenomenon of wearing ancient Chinese clothing ""Hanfu"" as daily clothing. Through a combination of text, visuals, charts, illustrations, and diagrams, readers are offered an in-depth understanding and appreciation of hanfu's heritage and its place in contemporary Chinese culture.","Although the article had a modest number of page views so far (around 10,000), it had a significant impact on other publications and fashion enthusiasts. This is based on the positive feedback we received in comments and on social media. It is an evergreen project that will be permanently available to the audience and will gradually reach more users over time.","The project required extensive research. In addition to traditional research methods such as reading throught research papers and interviewing expert, we took a more hands-on approach to understand the contemporary significance of hanfu.

We joined a hanfu enthusiast chat group for six months. This allowed us to understand the specific terminology used within the community and gain insights into what hanfu means to them and what aspects they prioritize.

The hanfu enthusiasts we worked with for the project also doubled as hanfu models. One advantage was that the outfits they wore during the studio shootings were their authentic daily attire, including the complete ensemble from head to toe and the makeup. This aspect added a genuine level of authenticity to our photographs. However, the challenge we faced was that they were not professional models. During our studio shoots, we had to provide art direction on the spot, making adjustments and suggestions to ensure the best possible outcome.","The story is straightforward, and our production method follows suit.

We used traditional research methods like studying books and research papers on Chinese hanfu and conducting interviews with experts and hanfu enthusiasts.

When it came to the illustrations, we wanted to capture the true spirit of hanfu visually. So, we opted for hand-drawn illustrations inspired by the traditional Fine Pen painting style. Although we created them digitally, we carefully merged cutouts from ancient Chinese paintings in a subtle way to add an authentic touch. This approach enabled us to present a well-rounded depiction of hanfu, blending its historical significance with modern perspectives.

To create the 360-degree stop-motion animation featuring the Hanfu enthusiasts, we had to work within the limitations of our studio. With just one camera and a tripod, we took a humble and analog approach. We asked the Hanfu ladies to spin themselves bit by bit to achieve the 360-degree spinning effect. Although they weren't professional models, we persevered through a few trial and error attempts and eventually captured some perfect shots.","For topics related to heritage, traditions, and even fashion, readers often feel distanced from the subject being discussed. To address this, we took a straightforward approach by showcasing the Hanfu enthusiasts as models. Our visuals aimed to establish a closer connection and make readers feel more engaged with the topic. 

Additionally, the active participation of experts in our project greatly improved the quality of the information we presented.

Sweden,SVT,Big,,,Putin's spies,26/04/2023,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Corruption",Microsoft Excel,"This investigation was part of an unprecedented collaboration between the Nordic public service broadcasters NRK (Norway), DR (Denmark) Yle (Finland) and SVT (Sweden), in which the Swedish team focused on investigating spies posing as diplomats and the Russian diplomatic mission. 

The investigation was presented as a three-part TV-series, ‘Putin's Shadow War’, as a single one-hour documentary on Swedish television SVT1, focusing on the Russian spies, and as this unique in-depth investigation online – mapping all the 21 diplomats we could expose as spies. 
 
The investigations made headlines world-wide and caused a major diplomatic crisis between Russia and the Nordic governments.","The special site had almost 200 000 visitors - and several hundred thousands more read the news articles created from the information. The 21 Russian spies in Sweden made headlines both in Sweden and internationally. The investigation sparked a serious diplomatic crisis between the two countries. 
 
The day before publishing the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that five Russian diplomats were going to be expelled as “Persona non grata”. In an interview he said: 
 
“Today Sweden summoned Russia's Ambassador Viktor Tatarintsev and informed him that five employees at the embassy in Sweden are asked to leave the country as their activities are incompatible with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations”. 
 
A few weeks after, the Russian Foreign Ministry responded by expelling five diplomats from the Swedish embassy in Moscow. Additionally, Russia shut down the Swedish consulate in Saint Petersburg and the Russian consulate in Gothenburg. We could later reveal who these five expelled Russian intelligence officers were. All are on our list. 

A total of 15 Russian diplomats, affiliated with the Russian intelligence services, were expelled from Scandinavia as a result of the joint investigation. 
The story has been spread by several heavyweight journalists and academics around the world.","Russia’s political landscape has tightened its grip on journalism. Media outlets has been harassed and forced to cease operations. During 2021, a number of independent media outlets were declared foreign agents. Roskomnadzor required several media outlets to delete reports by the investigative news outlet Proekt. This creates resilience, but also explains why it is nearly impossible to do investigative journalism inside Russia.
To call the war in Ukraine a ‘war’ is punishable with up to 15 years in prison. This needs mentioning, given the theme of our investigation and the time it was made, and that we did use material from a cinematographer working in Russia, to provide footage.
To emphasize the uniqueness of the online site it could be good to highlight the databases from inside Russia that we worked with. We worked with leaked data from these state databases, which we corroborated in other ways also, relying on sources from western security and intelligence agencies. The data could be used in innovative ways, proving the chain of accountability – starting from Russia and tracing the espionage activities to Sweden. The data was combined with open source information which also was used to strengthen and validate our research.","Russia is famously corrupt, one related consequence is that a large number of Russian state databases have leaked over the years. These databases have been gathered by organizations such as the Dossier Center. They have then built their own systems and interfaces to be able to research the millions of points of data. Later we built our own database in Excel with the names and all the gathered info of Russian spies in Sweden. One important part of this work was security. The part we were investigating has huge resources. We never used any cloud or internet-based tools. Everything was stored on offline equipment. We also shared most sensitive information with each other in physical meetings rather than on encrypted message tools. This was really time consuming and difficult.

When building the site we used our homemade cms, enabeling us to create a page using javascript, html and css. We chose to collaborate with a designer from within SVT to get a ""spie like"" feeling.

Hong Kong,South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.,Big,,,The history and revival of ancient Chinese hanfu,17/11/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Documentary, Illustration, Infographics, Arts, Lifestyle, Culture, Women","Animation, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","The project is to explain the nationwide phenomenon of wearing ancient Chinese clothing ""Hanfu"" as daily clothing through a combination of text, visuals, charts, illustrations, and diagrams.

It starts with addressing a common misconception that ancient Chinese clothing, is often mistaken for the Japanese kimono or Korean Hanbok, following with some hanfu knowdage like basic layering system, making-of, distinctive design elements that are shared with us by the hanfu enthusiasts, that provide insights into the personal significance and deeper meaning that Hanfu holds for these individuals.","Although the article had a modest number of page views (around 10,000), it had a significant impact on other publications and fashion enthusiasts. This is based on the positive feedback we received in comments and on social media. It is an evergreen project that will be permanently available to the audience and will gradually reach more users over time.","The project required extensive research. In addition to traditional research methods such as reading through research papers and interviewing expert, we took a more hands-on approach to understand the contemporary significance of hanfu.

We joined a hanfu enthusiast chat group for six months. This allowed us to understand the specific terminology used within the community and gain insights into what hanfu means to them and what aspects they prioritize.

With gathered information and valuable insights, we employed a unique approach in visually presenting the project. Combining elements of illustration and old paintings cut-out, referencing the Chinese Fine Brush Painting technique but took a modern twist. This drawing method was consistently applied throughout the entire story, creating a sense of coherence and unity. By adopting this artistic approach, we aimed to convey the juxtaposition of traditional hanfu within the context of the modern world.","The story is straightforward, and our production method follows suit.

We used traditional research methods like studying books and research papers on Chinese hanfu and conducting interviews with experts and hanfu enthusiasts.

When it came to the illustrations, we wanted to capture the true spirit of hanfu visually. So, we opted for hand-drawn illustrations inspired by the traditional Fine Pen painting style. Although we created them digitally, we carefully merged cutouts from ancient Chinese paintings in a subtle way to add an authentic touch. This approach enabled us to present a well-rounded depiction of hanfu, blending its historical significance with modern perspectives.","Incorporating original illustrations and in-depth visual explanations, particularly for topics related to heritage, traditions, and even fashion, can provide readers with a unique and engaging experience. By immersing them in complex information, these visuals offer a distinct perspective.

But its scale and implications on truck drivers, the government and the economy, were largely unknown until this two-part investigative series revealed them.

Using undercover means and secret intelligence techniques, this reporter exposed at least 36 points where corrupt security personnel, touts and hoodlums impose illegal taxes on importers and exporters.

Through a meticulous data gathering process, the reporter also documented how state and non-state actors illicitly rake ₦6 million daily and approximately ₦2.16 billion a year from each of the checkpoints.","Following ICIR publication of this exposé, the port authorities saddled the Ports Standing Task Team with the responsibility of investigating its findings. The team, through a crack operation, disbanded the extortion points and launched further investigation into the issue.

The story also provided an estimate of the illegal taxes being ripped from citizens by violent state and non-state actors operating at port corridor. This is very crucial for future investigation and research.","Access to these dangerous illegal checkpoints was the major challenge I faced in approaching story. But I was able to use undercover and secret intelligence(Spy camera) to access these places where port users are harrassed and killed. This gave me the opportunity to tell and show the story using text and multimedia simultaneously.

Rather than drawing conclusions from a limited sample, I extensively investigated the total count of extortion points and the amount forcibly extorted from port users. I manually collected this data to estimate the daily, monthly, and annual losses to violent actors. This comprehensive approach provided authorities and readers with a clear understanding of the severity of the issue.","1. Undercover methods, data gathering and secret intelligence : To accesss the illegal checkpoints, I had to disguise as a truck driver and armed myself with a secret camera to expose the activities of these violent actors extorting people. Under this guise, I was able to go to all the 36 extortion points one after the other to gather the average amount being extorted from people who want to access the port.
2. Canva : I worked with our data team to visualise the data on the value of extortion per illegal check point, daily, monthly and annually as well as the distribution of illegal checkpoints along the access roads to the port.","1. Bravery and tenacity : Lagos is a state with high number of hoodlums also known as Agbero. They are a law unto themselves and perperate all sorts of violence in the broad day light without being held accountable. Apapa is a part of the state with one of the highest numbers of these hoodlums but yet the story needed to be told. At a point in pursuing the story, I was nearly caught by a section of these hoodlums who threatened to destroy my phone but I was lucky that I was backing up all the images and videos as I took them and I was deleting them immediately.
2. Interviews are the lifeblood of journalism, and this story breathes with their details. Through meticulous interviews and on-the-ground verification, I mapped the extortion points along the ports access road and their ""tax"" rates. But raw data doesn't tell the whole story.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,,,Europe's pollution divide: see how your area compares,20/09/2023,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Cross-border, Database, Infographics, Map, Environment","D3.js, QGIS, Google Sheets, Node.js","This project took a Europe-wide view of air pollution revealing a stark top line and some surprising patterns.

We showed that 98% of Europeans breathe air with fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) above the maximum level recommended by the World Health Organisation, based on modelling by academics.

And while you’d expect the worst affected places to be the big cities of Paris, London or Madrid, the hotspots revealed were regions with specific geographic features, specific polluters and in the east of the continent. 

Skopje in North Macedonia, Serbian capital Belgrade and the Po Valley in Italy topped the list.","Over 450k people viewed the interactive with an additional 900k reading the news story, in-depth reports from affected cities and a solutions piece advocating changes that could be made now. The news piece in this package was the most viewed story of the Guardian’s Europe edition launch in September. 

A representative from the World Health Organisation called on European politicians to take action, and our reporters raised the issue with politicians from Spain to North Macedonia. The Belgrade and Skopje pieces were picked up by TV stations in Serbia and Macedonia, and one channel grilled the Macedonian environment minister on it.

The series raised awareness of the astonishing extent of air pollution: with all Europeans exposed to harmful levels except a few in northern Sweden, Iceland and northern Scotland. 

The package also drilled down into the specific factors making the worst areas so bad - wood burning stoves and a ring of mountains in Skopje, power plants fuelled by ligonite, a particularly dirty form of coal in Belgrade. And the agricultural practices turning Italy’s Po Valley into a soupbowl of bad air. 

All pieces raised awareness of the critical medical damage caused by these invisible particles - from strokes to fertility issues.","This project was built on innovative research by academics from the cross-European Expanse project which combined many different air pollution data sources with a model. Allowing for pollution levels to be estimated without placing sensors in every local authority area in 32 different countries. 

The original data work from the Expanse project was the core of the project though also abstract and hard to use, as seen in the original paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412022004123?via%3Dihub 

Heavy data lifting on our side was required to both simplify and geolocate the data in ways that allowed us to convey this to readers. 

We needed to ensure we displayed the results in a way that retained accuracy, awareness of the margin of error. This included bracketing the data into meaningful buckets, grouping areas at the top and bottom end of the spectrum eg under 5 and over 19, to avoid giving a false sense of specificity. And lots of communication with the academics to keep checking our work. 

This work and the underlying data was also sent to an independent academic in the field who had not worked on the project to assess the validity of the research.","The data was cleaned up on Google sheets, converted to json and plugged into a React app that displayed the areas on a map of Europe at a local authority level (LAU) - administrative blocks that varied in size from country to country. 

QGIS was used to provide an initial view of what the data looked like geographically. And to assign reporters to particular stories. 

The interactive map itself was built using MapLibre ( an open-sourced version of Mapbox) and was given design attention to ensure that the UX of this complex data made sense to users and worked at mobile and desktop. 

The search functionality was another technical challenge as it had to allow for searching in different languages as well as by standard point and drag map navigation. 

Our design team developed a colour scheme that was both clear at a glance and highlighted the worst areas without flattening areas in the middle.","Working with academics allowed us access to a really interesting dataset that only real experts could have compiled. 

However, taking this data from an academic paper into something that we could use for a series of news stories, required some heavy lifting on the data side. 

Investing in the work required to convert this complex dataset into an understandable spreadsheet paid off - as it then gave us a platform from which we could unfold the results of this work across multiple story formats. 

It allowed us to pair the pollution data with population data to confirm the topline figure from our news story, that 98% of Europe’s population lived in areas where the World Health Organisation guidelines were breached. 

It also allowed us to produce an interactive map where reader could find their own areas, it directed in-depth on-the-ground reporting, and also a solutions journalism piece identifying the most impactful changes that could be taken now. 

The large geographic scope both pulled in a wide audience - from across all the 32 countries represented - and also allowed patterns to emerge that would have been missed in a more traditional single country or single city dataset.",English,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2023/sep/20/europes-pollution-divide-see-how-your-area-compares,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/20/revealed-almost-everyone-in-europe-breathing-toxic-air,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/20/air-tastes-like-burnt-plastic-skopje-chronic-pollution-problem-north-macedonia,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/21/what-can-be-done-to-combat-air-pollution-in-europe,,,,"Pamela Duncan, Ajit Niranjan, Matthew Taylor, Antonio Voce, Anna Leach and Ellen Wishart","Pamela Duncan - data editor

The route of climate funds in an increasingly warmer world,31/01/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Environment, Business, Human rights","Scraping, Canvas, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Data visualization, Tableau, Flourish, Data wrapper","This journalistic investigation, based on data analysis and visualization, unravels how the global financing system for climate change operates. It reveals how the wealthy countries, backed by influential banks and multilateral institutions, have created a powerful, yet unequal, financial architecture. A structure that favors their own interests and profits at the expense of making the most vulnerable countries drown in debt. The mechanism forces nations with high inequality, such as those in Latin America and the Caribbean, to resort to high-interest loans to pay for the consequences of global warming, for which, overwhelmingly, their own creditors have been responsible.","The project had a significant, multi-layered impact:

Award Recognition: The investigation won the Lincoln Award for Journalism on Climate Change at COLPIN 2023, outshining 141 regional entries. It was acclaimed for its detailed exposure of the inequitable global climate financing system and its effects on Latin America and the Caribbean.

Funding and Support: Initially funded by the Press and Society Institute and The Centre for Investigative Journalism in London, the project's relevance was further affirmed by additional support from Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism for its subsequent phase.

Dissemination and Collaboration: The investigation was widely circulated in Latin America, backed by the Journalists for the Planet network. This collaboration of 26 media outlets, journalists, NGOs, and digital creators enhanced the storytelling about the climate crisis from diverse perspectives.

Media Exposure: Extensively covered by the University of Costa Rica's broadcast network and the Radio of the University of Guadalajara in Mexico, the project achieved significant media visibility, amplifying its reach and impact.

International Promotion: Climate Tracker, an organization dedicated to improving climate journalism globally, featured the project in its newsletter, expanding its reach to a broad Latin American audience and highlighting its findings on a global scale","During the course of this investigation, a major obstacle was the difficulty in finding and deciphering climate financial information online, which is often disorganized and lacks clarity and consensus in terms and overall system understanding.

Due to the lack of transparency, people are unaware of the repercussions these mechanisms have on their lives and those of future generations. It's not just the citizens who end up paying for these debts through taxes, but they are also the ones who face the impacts of:
- Social and environmental conflicts stemming from projects imposed by developed countries and multilateral organizations, which, in exploiting critical natural resources to maximize loan profitability, often overlook their impacts.
- Delays in mitigating and adapting to climate change, as well as in addressing emergencies caused by global warming-induced disasters affecting populations, such as floods, droughts, and wildfires.
- Lastly, due to the unfavorable conditions and interests of these climate credits, the finances of countries suffer, and governments delay investments in key sectors like education and health.

This journalistic work delivers a clear message: climate debt is not just a governmental issue, it's a noose around the neck of people at one of the most distressing times for the planet's life.","This investigation commenced at COP27 in late 2022, driven by critical questions: Why is a new fund for loss and damage necessary, and what has become of existing funds since the start of the century?

Tackling these questions required months of gathering and organizing scattered data into comprehensive volumes. Our aim was to understand the intricacies of loans and donations, the variety of projects financed, and the flow of money through multilateral organizations.

A significant challenge was the elusive nature of climate financial information online, which often appeared fragmented and inconsistent. The lack of clarity and consensus in database terminology and the broader financial system posed additional hurdles.

Programming emerged as an invaluable tool in this quest, transforming complex data into coherent insights. We utilized R to enable the creation of logical functions for efficient data extraction and organization, merging disparate databases on shared variables, and performing detailed analyses to answer journalistic queries. Early graphical representations were also developed in R.

Moreover, we employed visualization tools like Tableau, Flourish, and Datawrapper, enhancing our ability to present our findings compellingly. This blend of technology and investigative rigor was pivotal in unraveling the complexities of climate finance.","From this journalistic project, several vital lessons emerge for other journalists:

Data organization and analysis: The project exemplifies the importance of meticulously gathering and organizing scattered data to expose the complexities and inequalities of systems like global climate finance. This underscores the value of thorough data handling in investigative journalism.

Exposing transparency issues: The investigation highlights the opaqueness surrounding climate change financing, demonstrating how journalism can reveal hidden practices affecting public welfare.

Long-term impact analysis: By examining the extended consequences of financial decisions, including social and environmental conflicts and reduced investment in critical sectors, the project showcases the importance of reporting on far-reaching implications of current policies.

Bridging information gaps: The series acts as a bridge, explaining the intricacies of the climate financing system, especially in Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Global South, emphasizing the journalist's role in educating and informing the public.

Debating sustainability and economic models: The project contributes to crucial debates on overreliance on climate credits and fossil fuels, advocating for more sustainable economic models and renewable energy transitions.",Spanish,https://ladatacuenta.com/2023/06/20/finanzas-climaticas/,https://fb.watch/pBr58xADOv/,https://fb.watch/pBr7cwYFJt/,http://www.ecosmedia.org/post/finanzas-clim%C3%A1ticas-mu%C3%A9strame-el-dinero,,,,"Hassel Fallas, Michelle Soto","Hassel Fallas is a Costa Rican data analyst.

An increasing number of people are living alone. They're not necessarily single; many have had long-term partners, and some are even parents of one or more children. However, today, they officially form a single-person household. De Tijd delved into the historical, current, and future statistics of different family compositions in all cities and municipalities in Belgium. We conclude that Ii more than nine out of ten Belgian municipalities, the single-person household has become the most common type.","De Tijd's statistical research resonated across other media and led to new discussions and policy attention for the profile of people living alone. Conversations initiated by journalist Rik Van Puymbroeck following the publication of the visual, interactive page indicate that this attention is absolutely necessary.","De Tijd's data team - Olaf Verhaeghe, Thomas Segers, Thomas Roelens, and Raphael Cockx - dissected the numbers behind this societal evolution in all its facets. They analyzed the data over time and geographically, by age and other underlying factors such as gender. The study covered a range from recent graduates in big cities, divorced parents, to seniors over 65 and 80 who lost their life partners but still live independently at home. The group of individuals living alone continues to grow each year, as future forecasts also show, while policies regarding taxation, housing, support services, and social incentives are often not yet adapted to this change. The wide diversity among people living alone also makes it difficult for them to speak with one voice, making it hard for their needs, concerns, and grievances to reach the political agenda.","The data was gathered and analyzed using R.

The areas in question included a wide range of high biodiversity value sites ranging from a dozen of marine reserves to a UNESCO world heritage site, various mangrove parks and dozens of natural reserve. 
 
The project also revealed over 400 new cases of pollution by the company in Cameroon, Gabon and Peru. 
 
#PerencoSystem was led by EIF (Environmental Investigative Forum) in partnership with InfoAmazonia, InfoCongo, Convoca and Mediapart.","This project was published as a serie of 3 episodes in France's leading investigative media Mediapart, in addition to Inkyfada (Tunisia), Convoca (Peru), InfoAmazonia (Brazil), La Republica (Peru), InfoCongo (Congo Basin), Times of Cameroon (Cameroon) and Media241 (Gabon). 

This project did make a difference for local communities in Subsaharan african countries were the company's wrongdoings are well known but otherwise not communicated by the local press. 

In Peru, a field trip from our partner InfoAmazonia allowed to make indeginous aware of several cases of environmental pollution which the company had never informed them about, before leaving their region of activity from one day to another. 

In France, the information we revealed was carefully reviewed and reshared by civil society organisations such as Sherpa and Friends of the Earth, who are engaged in a prosecution case against the company since 2022 following a prior investigation EIF had contributed to in paternship with medias Disclose and Investigate Europe. Since then, the company is sued for ""ecological prejudice"" which was a first in France. 

Several experts got back to us with the intention to increase their advocacy and legal work regarding the company following this new wave of publications and revelations we initiated.","The innovative aspect of our reporting came from using GIS (Geo Informatic System) in order to confront the company's official borders against protected areas, for every single country where the group operates. This enabled us to reveal that Perenco's overlaps with protected areas, that we had already revealed in Tunisia and Democratic Republic of Congo in the past years, were not isolated cases but rather part of a systemic corporate approach, within 9 of the 14 countries where it operates. 

Our local partners InfoCongo and InfoAmazonia also had to engage in sensitive field reporting in areas that were heavily surveilled and military guarded (in Cameroon) and extremely remote and difficult to access (in the Peruvian Amazon) in order to establish contacts with local communities of indeginous tribes which previously were in good terms with the company before learning that it had gotten sanctionned over 58 environmental violations in the area were they strive to make a living. 

Our articles were published in arabic, french, english, spanish and portuguese.","For this project, we used QGIS to process and retrieve oil and gas block data and geo-referenced the information from official oil and gas maps, to be then cross-referenced with protected areas data retrieved from Protected Planet. We've also used remote sensing data in order to locate gas flaring sites but also volumes to be attributed to the company in Gabon and Cameroon, where flaring should be either restricted or forbidden depending on local regulations.","Journalists can learn how to take a global approach into investigating a single oil and gas operators, by attempting to look-up and cross-reference all of its sites in one single data work, to then narrow down which countries to focus on for an eventual field trip.

What was supposed to be a cheerful week was overshadowed by an online misinformation and hate campaign. The Rutgers sexuality expertise center, which develops teaching materials about this topic received several death threats. Pointer extracted and analyzed all the tweets that mentioned 'Spring Fever'. This allowed us to see that the commotion began with misleading tweets from an alt right politician and prominent figures, who falsely linked the teaching material to controversial topics.","The article was read often that week. At the end of the year, it is one of our website's best-read articles. It also received attention in the public debate. Many well-known politicians and prominent Dutch people shared our acticle on social media. TV shows also paid attention to the publication.","The publication caused a stir. We refuted misinformation shared mainly by right-wing politicians. I was called a pedophile for days. Especially by people who are more right-wing. And all because we would ""sexualize children,"" according to them. But in the end it was the politicians who fueled the debate based on misinformation. The result of that misinformation is that parents kept their children at home because they did not want to 'expose them to this matter.' The creators of these teaching materials also received death threats. These are typical effects when prominent influencers and politicians spread misinformation.","We searched for tweets that had relevance to the topic, terms such as ""Spring fever"" (Dutch for Spring Fever). We then collected all tweets from January 1, 2023 to March 24, 2023. This allowed us to start mapping the prelude to Spring Fever Week. In the end we scrapped 15,000 tweets. We scraped the tweets using Trollrencics' software. This software not only collect social media posts, but can also easily analyze them via the dashboard. The software puts the data on a timeline and also analyzes how much views and engagement a tweet had. This analysis also allowed us to see what misinformation was frequently shared. We checked and refuted the misinformation with information from public sources.","While we see that misinformation is being spread on a regular basis, this approach also allows you to see where that misinformation starts, who is sending it and what the effects of are.

During the lifetime of the scheme, a Detektor journalist has registered to eMagnetix Telegram group and secretly collected evidence about the fraud, by saving hundreds of shared messages between organizers and members, which were later used to reconstruct and explain in detail how this scheme works. Based on the Telegram groups to which journalist gained access, as well as on dozens of conducted interviews with , Bilajac with his colleagues managed to reconstruct organization of the fraud presenting in through the multimedia page which will be valuable source for the police.","Just a few days after publishing the investigation, Bilajac received a phone call from the Federal Police Administration asking for a meeting. At the meeting, the police inspector shared with the team that a criminal investigation has been initiated. They were interested to hear about the interviews Bilajac conducted, especially with the local organizers and about information collected, focusing on the main organizer Peter Tamas Kasza in Budapest and Vienna.
The investigation had lots of public attention: it was read over 10,000 times on detektor.ba website while the accompanying TV show – TV Justice was shown at 21 TV stations across BiH and gathered over 6,000 views on YouTube. The investigation was shared over BIRN BiH social media channels (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) reaching around 50,000 people. Also, the investigation was republished in 21 other media outlets.","After many ads on social media about „quick and easy way to become rich“ there were several indications that the job in question was part of pyramid scheme. The idea behind easy and quick earing was simple – only a smartphone and internet connection were needed for a job which required a few minutes of clicking on ads in the application. To join the group, a person had to pay a deposit between 75 and over 3000 euros, depending on the level they wanted to enter, while recruiting of new members was rewarded by receiving a percentage of the daily earnings of those, they brought in. 
During the research, journalists interviewed local organizers, who insisted that they were not aware of the scheme, saying they also lost thousands of euros, as well as they family members and friends.
The investigation took the journalists to Budapest and Vienna, searching for the main organizer, Peter Tamas Kasza Kasza, a Hungarian, who has registered businesses in Slovakia and Austria, where police are investigating his company over an alleged million-euro fraud.","At the beginning, journalists infiltrated in Telegram group. They have print screened hundreds of received messages from organizes which were lately used to reconstruct the whole story. After the scheme ended, Detektor journalists conducted dozens of interviews with local based organizers and participants in order to track the main organizers which operated from abroad. Story led journalists to Budapest and Vienna. To present investigation in the best way a special sub-page on the website was created, showing interactively messages from the group. Also, investigation was followed by a short TV documentary.","Importance of organizing documentation in the project of this size is crucial as well as insuring enough storage space for all collected data. Since many print screened messages were saved it was important to organized them in a proper way, to follow the timeframe but also to be clear who sent the messages, especially for the sake of fact checking. Additionally, when it comes to stories with international actors involved it is valuable to have funds for international trips in order to follow the lead, as Detektor journalists did with the name of the main organizer who was tracked in Budapest and then Vienna.

United Kingdom,"Airwars, the Guardian",Small,,,The hidden casualties of Britain's wars,20/03/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, OSINT, Video, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Human rights","Animation, 3D modeling, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Node.js","By building a dataset to cross check public statements, official data and allegations of harm from Iraqi and Syrian civilians, our investigation disputed the UK Government’s claim that it has killed only one civilian in an eight-year long battle against ISIS.

The 18-month investigation mixed open-source investigative methods, extensive freedom of information act requests, document analysis, 3-D modelling, and victim-centred storytelling. The multi-media series was published over several weeks in The Guardian – on the newspaper’s front page, as an episode of their flagship podcast, and as a visual investigation on the Airwars website.","We see this case as emblematic of a wider and deeply concerning trend: that military actions are increasingly remote, operate without public oversight, and are driven by an unaccountable political agenda. As part of a follow-up action from this investigation we challenged the UK’s Ministry of Defense in an Information tribunal in November over their failure to release documents relating to the one admitted civilian death.

We have already seen significant impact with our investigation: an NGO has now offered medical assistance to the family interviewed during our reporting in Iraq, a UK-based human rights firm has now taken on their case to pursue compensation from the British government, and similar investigations have been released in the Netherlands with journalists and the public calling on their own government to take action for the civilian toll of their actions. We want this investigation to catalyse action on this important area of transparency and accountability across the UK, Europe and beyond, and overall promote the dignity of civilians in conflict.","Airwars has been engaging with the UK Ministry of Defense for several years to try and understand one question – how many civilians have been harmed because of the UK’s involvement in the war against ISIS. Yet, we’ve never received a clear admission of the true toll of this harm, and requests for transparency around how the British military operates with regards to civilian casualties were continuously rebuffed.

To date, the UK still refuses to accept it killed more than one civilian despite dropping more than 4000 bombs. Yet by designing a methodology to cross check public statements and claims, we were able to link the UK to eight specific civilian harm incidents.","The investigative process began in June 2021, with a series of Freedom of Information Act requests to the UK’s Ministry of Defence (MoD), asking for the date, location and weapon used in every British strike that killed or injured ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria between 2014 and 2021. We then compared this to Airwars’ archive of civilian harm for the same operation, and found around 40 potential matches. 

Our reporters later travelled to Mosul, Iraq to track down the victims of these airstrikes, including Enam Younis. Through cross-checking declassified documents with other records, we found this was almost certainly a UK strike. We matched Enam's testimony to a chat log between drone pilots included in declassified materials, with Airwars reconstructing the failures which led to Taiba's death, through 3D models.

In the final part of the investigation, we searched for the only civilian that the UK admitted to killing in this campaign : through open source investigation, documents, FOIAs, witness interviews, we revealed that no local sources had heard of this incident. We felt it was also important to be transparent about our own methods; Airwars therefore produced an immersive visual explainer outlining our investigative approach in full.","There are several parts of this project which may be instructive for other journalists – particularly as we drew on work carried out by many of our colleagues to bring this project to fruition. Our project built on public government data in the form of simple FOIA requests, which we then cross-referenced with our archive through an arduous but straightforward process, to achieve our initial set of findings. We then combined this with newer journalistic methods – such as 3D modelling – to tell one family’s story visually, providing a level of depth and a narrative that showed readers the human toll behind the statistics.

This demonstrates that using a range of methodologies – from the traditional to OSINT to on the ground reporting - can work more effectively than simply relying on one toolkit. 

We also found that even if a story seems to be several years out of date there are still victims and victims stories which deserve to be told and which the public are interested in.

Uma chacina é um evento em que 3 ou mais civis são mortos.

Nos últimos sete anos, 1.137 pessoas foram mortas em chacinas policiais no Grande Rio. O Fogo Cruzado mapeia esses dados desde 2016 e percebeu que era hora do público acessar essas informações para entender o quanto a polícia do Rio de Janeiro é violenta.

O projeto Estado Letal é uma iniciativa inédita que reúne dados e relatos sobre chacinas cometidas pela polícia no Rio.","Esta é a primeira vez que tantas informações sobre chacinas policiais são publicadas agregando aos dados histórias reais e relatos de pessoas que perderam seus familiares nesses eventos. A violência policial é uma realidade conhecida no Rio de Janeiro, mas a bárbarie das chacinas ainda é algo pouco documentado. 

Estamos falando de ocasiões bárbaras, como o dia em que a polícia matou 27 pessoas na favela do Jacarezinho. Ou quando um adolescente de 14 anos, usando uniforme escolar, foi morto com mais oito pessoas na favela da Maré. 

O grande impacto do projeto foi mostrar o tamanho desta tragédia: a navegação mostra para a população do Rio de Janeiro que as chacinas acontecem em toda a cidade. Não importa onde você esteja, já aconteceu uma perto de você. E mostra quem são essas vítimas. 

O retorno das comunidades atingidas foi imediato e elas contribuíram diretamente para a divulgação. Além da média de 4.000 visitantes por mês no site, fomos convidados para apresentar o projeto em 7 favelas do Rio de Janeiro. Além disso, o Ministério Público, responsável pelo controle das polícias, solicitou acesso aos dados completos mapeados desde 2016.","A primeira coisa a se saber sobre esse projeto é: o Brasil não produz dados sobre mortes provocadas pela polícia. Estas são informações de difícil acesso e os dados que temos são produzidos pela sociedade civil. O Fogo Cruzado produz dados de maneira aberta e colaborativa desde 2016 e hoje possui o maior banco de dados sobre violência armada da América Latina. Nossa metodologia de produção de dados é inovadora e inédita. Nós recebemos dados dos cidadãos e também coletamos na imprensa e redes sociais para com isso produzir estatísticas. Somos os únicos produtores de dados sobre chacinas policiais no Rio de Janeiro. Mas o nosso banco de dados não se resume a números, tentamos também contar histórias das vítimas e o projeto Estado Letal é exemplar. Acontecem, em média, 3 chacinas provocadas pela polícia todos os meses. Em muitos casos estas chacinas são altamente letais, porque são Operações Vingança: acontecem depois que um policial é baleado por criminosos. Nessas ocasiões, como mostram nossos dados, as operações policiais chegam a ser 71% mais letais. Sem acesso a essas informações a população não tem como exigir que a polícia atue de maneira menos violenta.","O Fogo Cruzado possui um app onde recebe informações sobre tiroteios e operações policiais enviados pelos cidadãos. Além disso, raspamos dados da imprensa e das redes sociais. Essas informações alimentam um banco de dados sobre violência armada no Rio de Janeiro.

A partir desses dados separamos as chacinas cometidas pela polícia e buscamos formas inovadoras de possibilitar sua visualização. A partir daí desenvolvemos um site onde é possível inserir seu endereço e consultar qual chacina policial aconteceu próximo a você (em um raio de até 3km). É possível também consultar um infográfico que situa as chacinas ao longo dos anos e das regiões que compõem a cidade.

Como forma de complementar a experiência, selecionamos 18 chacinas policiais e publicamos uma reportagem para cada uma delas. Entrevistamos moradores, familiares dos policiais e pesquisadores para reunir essas histórias e mostrar quem são os cidadãos por trás dos números.","A cobertura de segurança pública no Brasil é altamente pautada pelas políciais. Os policiais são as principais fontes e a ausência de dados públicos contribui para isso. O projeto Estado Letal mostra que é possível cobrir violência de maneira autônoma, com apoio dos cidadãos e do que é produzido pela sociedade civil. 

Todos os anos a polícia do Rio de Janeiro mata mais de mil pessoas e mantém a população das favelas e periferias sob constante medo. Estamos falando de uma das polícias mais letais do mundo. O jornalismo tem um papel importante para informar sobre essa realidade, uma vez que, como dissemos, os governso divulgam poucos dados e informação. O projeto Estado Letal mostra como informação é importante e poderosa e pode servir de inspiração para projetos futuros.",Português,https://chacinaspoliciais.com.br/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJx3iqDDszw,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/17/free-rein-rio-residents-police-violence-far-right-rule,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct31yn,,,,"Marianna Araujo,

Bosnia and Herzegovina,Balkan Investigative Reporting Network in Bosnia and Herzegovina - BIRN BiH,Small,,,Internal punishments do not prevent police violence and misconduct,07/12/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Illustration, Video, Women, Human rights","Animation, Scraping, Google Sheets","Hundreds of disciplinary proceedings against police officers have lapsed due to procedural deficiencies, and cases of police violence that have disturbed the public in Bosnia and Herzegovina have gone unpunished according to this research on the actions of all police agencies in the last five years based on documents and data that most of them try to hide. One of the biggest discoveries was that police officers respondent for domestic violence were not fired from the work, but punished with a certain percentage of deduction of their salary for a certain period.","The biggest sucess was to developed the database with limited number of resources and make this data publicly available to interestedd public. Out of 18 relevant institutions seven replied to the request s while only three (one cantonal Ministry and two judicial polices) delivered necessary documentation. Based on this data distinguishment between violations and punishments was made, which helped in creation of the database consisted of statistical data on the number of procedures conducted in each police agency. After the publication of the text and the data base, a conference was held where the data was discussed, and conclusions were reached on the basis of which further steps will be discussed regarding the handling of such requests and where it was concluded that it is necessary for the procedures to be more open, as well as archive of guided procedures.

Nowadays, there are still procedures in courts BIRN BiH is waiting to be finished and based on their decisions we are going to conclude if whole process is going to be more transparent.","At the begining of the project journalists sent Freedom of information requests to 18 police agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We requested initial reports and disciplinary decisions in these proceedings. After the first requests, most agencies refused to provide us with data. The Judicial Police of the Republika Srpska and the Judicial Police of the Federation have granted access to BIRN BiH. The reasons why other agencies refused us were the protection of personal data, the lack of public interest and the protection of the rights of third parties in the process. In our appeals to the agencies, we stated that police officers are public persons, that they receive their salary from the budget, and requested that initial requests to be reconsidered. The answers to the appeal were the same, after which we sent the lawsuits to the competent courts. Two courts accepted our request and ordered the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Una-Sana Canton and Ministry of International Affairs of Zenica-Doboj Canton to reconsider the original request. After this decision, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Una - San Canton provided us with the data that is part of the investigation.","Freedom of Information requests were sent to public institution in order to receive relevant data. Since law number of replies on request were received BIRN BiH sued institutions and agencies (some cases still ongoing). Using Excel sheets journalists managed to develop a database which was lately transferred to the web-site and was also adjusted to the mobile-friendly view. Investigation and the databased are followed by a comic as well as a short documentary, making them suitable for sharing on different platform and interesting for younger audience.","The main message this project sends is not to give up. Although at the beginning of the project it seemed that not enough information will be collected, by using all available means, including law suites, journalists managed to obtain necessary information and data for development of a representative database. Also, different form of presentation were used (investigation form, database and video documentary, as well as comic), to present findings in most suitable way for different kind of users/readers and also different generations.",Bosnian,https://detektor.ba/interne-kazne-ne-sprecavaju-policijsko-nasilje-i-nedolicno-ponasanje/,https://detektor.ba/2023/12/07/epizoda-156-cetiri-price-o-policijskoj-brutalnosti/?lang=en,,,,,,"Nermina Kuloglija-Zolj, Jasmin Begić","Nermina published many investigations about far-right groups in Bosnia and the Western.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,,,"41,000 deaths at work: anatomy of three decades of the most invisible labor scourge",04/03/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Chart, Health, Employment","Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, JQuery, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio","In 35 years more than 40,000 people died in a workplace accident in Spain. How and when do these accidents occur? What are the professions with the highest accident rates? How do they affect people by age and gender? elDiario.es wanted to shed light on this scourge, invisible in most cases. 

We compiled, analyzed and visualized historical labor accident and death data and combined it with testimonies of the families of some victims and unions’ demands. With it we delved into the socioeconomic and regulatory context of the country and pointed out the causes behind them.","This special article begins with a victims meter that resembles those which stand at factories doors. This specific visualization was updated and reused in the following months, each time new figures were available. Its aim was making this phenomenon visible, accumulating for the first time all the deaths and accidents since 1988 (the first year with official data on work accidents available), instead of setting the counter to zero each year.

Often only the most scandalous cases make the headlines or when, unfortunately, more than one person dies at the same time. Putting the data on the table, with the people behind it, is essential to understand and be able to combat accidents at work. 

Also, with the same data analysis and victims’ families testimonies elDiario.es recorded a podcast chapter that tried to give voice to those who usually are only a number, trying to humanize the statistics. 

This project accumulated 30,000 page views and was popular among elDiario.es subscribers. It was also shared by many on social media, pointing out how necessary it was to publish data and stories about this topic.","The data about accidents at work is published in multiple statistical documents in different formats. That is why the tasks that took more time to complete were obtaining and combining multiple data in comprehensive and clean databases that were suitable for succeeding analysis. It was also needed to ensure that the indicators in the different files were the same and to note some modifications in different years’ methodology. 

It is important to note that it is not common in Spain to publish workplace accident figures with this level of detail. Also it is rare to find victims identified with their names, stories and the voice of their family. It was a very important part of the feature.","The data is published in different formats depending on the detail and year. Mainly it can be downloaded using monthly and yearly Excel spreadsheets that have many sheets. That is why we used the coding language R to automatize the extraction of specific indicators present in more than one Excel file (taking into account modifications in the methodology) and compiling them all together. We also used Google Spreadsheets to work with the data collaboratively.

The different visualizations were coded using D3.js, Canvas, Javascript and Datawrapper. All the workflow, from extracting data to visualizing it, was ready to be updated automatically with an R script each time a new monthly statistic was published.","The main value of this report is that it is the first time that such a complete and exhaustive analysis of official data on workplace accidents in recent decades has been published in Spain. This was useful as a way to raise awareness of a usually silenced scourge like this. 

In addition to the shocking figures and the valuable stories of the victims' families, the report is very visual and has numerous interactive graphics that make it easier to understand the data and the magnitude of the tragedy. A wide variety of visualizations work as visual metaphors and emphasize each victim.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,,,15 elections in Spain: a comprehensive data-driven coverage,23/07/2023,"Explainer, Breaking news, Database, Chart, Map, Elections","Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, JQuery, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","Our data team covered 15 local, regional and general elections in Spain, providing in-depth analysis from pre-election dynamics to election night and post-result analysis.

Our published stories delved into how the electoral system benefits two major parties, lower participation in poor neighborhoods or exposing small town majors inflating their census.

We also developed more than 40 live results pieces highlighting an automated contested seats tracker, demographic profiles of voters using live granular data or a specific live results page for every region in the country. The day after, we conducted insightful analyses by ideology and income.","Election results maps and charts are usually among the most viewed articles in elDiario.es. That is why this year’s big election nights were among the days with major traffic on our website. It was mainly accumulated by the data team's live updated pieces, which accumulated more than 4 million unique views.

Also, it is very popular in Spain the block by block results map, the data of which is published early morning on the next day of the elections, and ours is among the most shared because of our speed and detail. We don’t only show the winner in each block, but the turnout, the variations or the distribution of the votes by ideological groups. 

For the coverage of the general election this year, we not only coded the results pages, but also other live updating charts showing contested seats, the voting count evolution by demography of the municipality, the composition of the congress seats (with names and surnames). These more innovative articles had great feedback among our readers.

We also try to link the results analysis to our editorial. For example, using block by block voting data to reveal how right-wing votes skyrocketed in the 5% richest.","The biggest challenge of the election-coverage was to inform our readers the results of a multi-party proportional representation election system with only a small team of three data journalists. 

Obtaining the data from all the election results, live and historical, is not easy in Spain. While general and municipal elections data is published by the central government, the regional elections results are handled by regional governments and published (when publicly shared) in a variety of formats. 

It also takes time to classify the many different parties that participate in the multi-party system, which sometimes change from election to election, and have different names in different regions and municipalities. For example, there are over 2.000 different parties contesting in local elections.

Before the elections there are months dedicated to the compilation and preparation of election results and complementary data. Also, we dedicate time to think about how to explain the complex electoral systems and variations in the different regions. 

The live updating of all charts and maps was also a challenge. We used different ways to wrangle and transform the data every time new results were being published.","We used R and RStudio for downloading microdata, scrapping lists, compiling and wrangling historical and live results data, and merging with other demographic databases from different sources. And also for the live update of charts and maps during the electoral nights.

For the visualizations, we used Javascript, D3.js and Mapbox.","All the election coverage we did this year corroborates us that even a small journalists team can report on such big events live and can publish a variety of charts and maps live updating. It can be achieved with a lot of preparation and understanding of the data and the electoral systems. 

Also, it is very important for us to learn from each election. Every time we reuse and reformulate part of what we have done before, but that doesn’t stop us from adding new features each time, focusing on the specific topics that will be of most interest on each occasion.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/politica/resultados-elecciones-generales-23j-por-municipio_1_10377802.html,https://www.eldiario.es/politica/ultimo-escano-provincia-ganadores-perderdores-en-directo_1_10394283.html,https://www.eldiario.es/politica/voto-renta-23j-pp-disparo-5-rico_1_10407656.html,https://www.eldiario.es/politica/sistema-electoral-beneficia-provincias-pobladas-grandes-partidos_1_10336601.html,,,,"Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres, Ainhoa Díez","Raúl Sánchez: Spanish data journalist covering stories of inequality, gender, health, taxes and urbanism at elDiario.es.

Malaysia,Macaranga Media,Small,,,Navigating the Multiverse of Forest Data,03/03/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment","Scraping, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap, Google Pinpoint, scrollama.js (Mapbox)","This interactive story exposed the many inaccuracies and inconsistencies in Malaysian government forestry data and maps. Government data appears to be a multiverse where it contradicts independent sources and even itself. For this project, we reported on and compared 20 years of national documents (statistic compendia, gazettes, maps), satellite imagery, scientific studies, EIA reports, and company records. We laid bare the gaps in government data, and then reported the consequences on auditing, research, flood management, conservation, and certification integrity. We also enquired experts for solutions to the messy data.","The story revealed clear evidence of gaps in national forestry data and its consequences and solutions. It is a multiverse – where forest reserves could be cleared for quarries and oil palm estates and not make a dent in forest cover statistics; official maps are outdated and misleading for years; huge gaps in forest reserve figures persist between two authoritative government datasets. 
Still, the story did not go viral or changed policy (yet). What our story did was to educate and make “a complex issue very easy to understand”, as an environmental documentary filmmaker said. Our story was shared widely among researchers and environmental groups and received much praise for the analyses and sharing of forestry and project data. A prominent pro-conservation family of the Malaysian royalty found the story “insightful”. Furthermore, because we made our data available in spreadsheets and maps, journalists in other newsrooms used our data to inform their reporting (we know because they consulted us). Because of this story, we were invited by several embassies and foreign forest consultancy agencies in Malaysia to present our findings and inform their policies with tracking and preventing deforestation.","This project grew from our frustration which is shared by all who researches Malaysian forestry data. Granular data on something as basic as forest area and forest reserve changes is tightly state-controlled, and available data is often of lousy quality. We took up the challenge to describe the state of lousy data and also presented the consequences and solutions. We patiently collected a variety of datasets to compare: from hardcopy reports to satellite images and certification reports. Each document is hundreds of pages thick. There isn’t any advanced techniques needed for this work, just needed to doggedly find datasets, comb through the data, get the EIA reports, look up projects to pinpoint clear evidence of discrepancies, and speak with diverse stakeholders. 
While the reporting and analyses needed determination, the storytelling required creativity. We had to overcome the challenge of making an investigative story on numbers relevant and useful to our readers. And we had to use graphics and simple language to explain technical details like the different definitions of “forest” used by stakeholders, or how forest data affects flood management. 
For transparency and to encourage others to pick up future work, we published our data and methodology with the story.","We used Adobe Scan to turn hardcopies into PDFs, and then used Google Pinpoint to OCR almost all the PDFs. Tables were extracted using Extractable. We used Pinpoint to search gazettes for specific keywords that indicate forest reserve changes, and recorded those changes in Sheet. All data analyses were done in Sheet. 
Satellite images were downloaded from Sentinel Hub or Planet Labs. Physical maps were scanned, and all PDF maps or JPEGs were georeferenced in QGIS. We used QGIS to compare discrepancies in forest borders, look for plantations inside forest reserves, and study forest loss in river basins where floods occurred.
For graph visualisation, we used Flourish. For story layout, we used Mapbox coupled with Scrollama.js to create a scrollytelling interactive effect, and drew illustrations on Canva.","This project offers an example of how to increase the appeal of a data story that wouldn't usually grab public attention. It would be very hard to catch the Malaysian public's interest on something abstract like weak forestry data. The challenge is to help the readers know that their lives are directly affected when the government does a bad job at collecting and presenting forest data. There’s also the extra hurdle of helping general readers understand technical details like how data quality and its interpretation depends on how it is defined and acquired – e.g., forest area measured by satellites is grossly different from paper records.
We met the above challenges by casting a diverse host of stakeholders that work with data and tell the story through their experiences and perspectives. We wrote from the point-of-view of mangrove ecologist to illustrate real-life instances of data problems, and how the problems could be solved. We adopted a conflict-action-resolution arc to carry the data story. We also employed simple scrolling graphics to bring readers into forests with questionable data, and to explain the links among data – forests – floods.",English,https://www.macaranga.org/navigating-the-multiverse-of-forest-data-peninsular-malaysia/,https://www.macaranga.org/projects-that-replaced-natural-forests-peninsular-malaysia/,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cu4pRxZecYvf5E615T_3gI3bZWA3t5HD,,,,,"Yao-Hua Law, Siew Lyn Wong","Yao-Hua Law and Siew Lyn Wong are co-founders of Macaranga Media, an independent environmental journalism media company registered in Malaysia.

Energy reporter Tom Brown and data scientist Christina Last used satellite data and on-the-ground footage to expose that gas flaring had continued despite the government deadline, with the help of Iraqi reporter Stella Martany and freelance journalist Alannah Travers.

Visiting refugee camps, Kurdish industrial towns, Yazidi heritage sites, and oil and gas facilities themselves, we documented systematic and regular flaring occuring under the watch of the regional government","The minister responsible for the oversight of the flaring targets resigned during the course of our investigation.

MIT Urban Planning highlighted the impact of the article: https://twitter.com/MITdusp/status/1603135989651804160

It has recently been shortlisted for the Fetisov Awards under the Excellence in Environmental Journalism category.

The project was also broadcast on Kurdish TV and covered by Kurdistan radio stations.

After we published the initial investigation in Rudaw, BBC panorama released a documentary on gas flaring in Iraq.

Using the same investigative techniques, we lead an investigation into gas flaring in Nigeria: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/gas-flares-nigeria-oil-africa-pollution-health-crisis/

Subsequently, flaring became an important topic at COP28, where nations renewed their commitment to eliminating gas flaring by 2030.

Unfortunately, gas flaring continues in Iraq, where thousands of refugees and native Iraqis continue to be exposed to the health impacts of the oil and gas industry.","Gas flaring is one of the leading contributors to both CO2 and methane emissions, releasing more greenhouse gases annually than the airline industry.

Flaring, where oil companies burn gas which can't be captured economically, releases benzene and toluene, linked to premature birth, chronic lung disease, and cancer.

Whatsmore, gas flaring wastes billions of dollars every year at a time when enegy security threatens the stability of countries worldwide.

As part of a World Bank project to eliminat all flaring by 2030, dozens of countries signed a commitment to elimminate gas flaring by 2030: https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/gasflaringreduction/publication/financing-solutions-to-reduce-natural-gas-flaring-and-methane-emissions

Iraq, due to its ageing infrastructure and decades of underinvestment, is one of the world's leading contributors to gas flaring. US sanctions under previous administrations have left oil and gas facilities in disrepair.

Kurdistan voted for independence from federal Iraq in 2017, and its forces have fought for control of oil fields across the country. Disputes between the federal Iraqi government and the Kurdish Regional Government make flaring a political chessboard, where powerful families attempt to manoeuvre international markets to their advantage.

Iran, whose militias regularly launch missiles into Kurdistan, sees the region as a proxy for Israeli influence. The dispute over Iraq's oil is ongoing.","Recent developments in satellite technology has allowed researchers and journalists to pin point flaring locations. The VIIRS Nightfire satellite passes over the earth once per night, allowing it to photograph the surface and identify bright spots.

MIT researchers were able to detect ‘hot pixels’ over oil and gas infrastructure in Iraq. We cross-referenced the hot pixels against oil and gas infrastructure identified through Open Street Maps. Other fires burning at temperatures lower than gas flares were excluded, as otherwise many smaller fires may have erroneously been identified as a flare.

Once these flaring sites were identified, we worked with local reporters to film gas flares, documenting them in a systematic and organised fashion before sending the footage to the oil and gas companies responsible by way of a request for comment.","Data is not an end unto itself. It informs the scope and precision of an investigation, but is not necessarily the whole story. Combining data visualisations with on-the-ground investigative reporting is one of the most impactful ways a reporting team can contribute to conversations on climate change and to report accurately and fairly on polluting industries.

Satellite data is also a powerful tool not only for image-based investigation but also for wider analysis of climate and conflict zones.

The material is based on the content of pro-Russian Facebook pages and Telegram channels. Based on the analysis, we were able to find out that their content is aimed at strengthening Russia’s influence on Kyrgyzstan. Also, we were able to find out that propagandists use various propaganda technologies, such as provocation, threat of war and others. We also found that Russia is against the rapprochement of Kyrgyzstan with Western countries. Propagandists also discredit the activities of independent media and non-governmental organizations.","The project showed the audience how propaganda works and helped reveal the mechanisms of Russian propaganda. In addition, our readers were able to find out that Russian propaganda operates not only through television, radio and controlled media, but also through social media. The main effect can be said that the audience now carefully checks the information. In addition, other journalists learned what narratives Russian propaganda operates with. They also republished our project in their media platforms.
Separately, we can mention the experts who use our project in their reports and publications.","With this project, our team wants to show how Russia is trying to take our country under its influence. Propaganda, along with economics and politics, is a powerful tool of subjugation. Considering its current position in the political arena of the world, with the help of propaganda, Russia is trying with all its might to find and keep countries with low economies under its influence. This situation occurs in all countries of Central Asia. Based on the political context, she intends to continue to promote Russian power. Our team would like the jury members to pay attention to the political background of this project.","To identify the ways propaganda works and the context of Russian propaganda, we scraped the content of four pro-Russian social media channels and analyzed it. Scraping was carried out with the help of a programmer who helped quickly download the data. The analysis was carried out using fact-checking tools, data analysis and investigative journalism. During the analysis, we divided the content by type and type of propaganda. This helped us understand the context and methods of propaganda.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,,,Spain at flood risk: over a million homes stand at hazardous areas,04/09/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Economy","Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, JQuery, Json, CSV, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap","""Spain at Flood Risk"" is a groundbreaking journalistic project uncovering a critical issue: over a million homes in Spain are situated in flood-prone areas. This investigation meticulously cross-referenced flood risk zones with the footprints of more than 12 million buildings across the country, revealing that at least 4.3% of Spanish homes face the imminent threat of river or sea flooding, with potential escalation due to climate change and increased torrential rains. The project exposes how the lack of regulations has facilitated urban development of thousands of homes in flood-prone regions nationwide.","This journalistic project has made a significant impact by providing unprecedented access to a comprehensive map that details the vulnerability to flooding for every house and building in Spain. The primary goal was to offer this information as a public service, empowering public administrations, citizens, and the private sector. For example, potential homebuyers can now assess flood risks associated with a property, and city councils can make informed decisions about urban expansion based on flood-prone areas.

The collaborative effort of the core investigative team and regional editions resulted in locally relevant stories that explored the causes and explained how some regions in Spain are living with the constant threat of floods and rising seas. The multifaceted approach, including a podcast episode, not only engaged the audience but also contributed to a broader understanding of the implications of flood risks.

The impact is measurable through the project's wide-reaching viewership, with all publications of the project attracting over 275,000 users and securing a prominent position on the elDiario.es front page for three consecutive days. This initiative has not only informed and empowered individuals but has also set a benchmark for data journalism excellence in the field.","This pioneering journalistic investigation introduces a groundbreaking approach by consolidating, for the first time, cartographic plans of all existing buildings in Spain, which are available only municipality by municipality, into a comprehensive database. Each building's location was meticulously cross-referenced with 8,000 square kilometers of flood risk areas defined by the National System of Cartography of Flood Zones (SNCZI). The magnitude of this endeavor is evident in the creation of a custom R script to download cadastral data from over 7,600 municipalities, accumulating a data set exceeding 200GB on hard disk.

Our innovation extends to automatic processing, where each building's position in the database was verified against areas at risk from fluvial and marine flooding with return periods of 100 years. Recognizing disparities in flood risk mapping across river basins, we implemented an automated process to standardize limits, defining flood-prone areas as those of less than 3 hectares completely surrounded by a flood risk area.

The project's uniqueness is further exemplified by an interactive map, granting readers detailed street-level access to flood-prone regions. This format unveils entire villages within the potential fluvial flooding perimeter and highlights extensive new housing developments under the imminent threat of coastal flooding.","R, Rstudio, QGIS and Tippecanoe for data compiling and data analysis. D3.js and Javascript for data visualization. Mapbox for mapping buildings footprint and flood zones. HTML and Javascript for personalized content and connected events.","The 'Spain at Flood Risk' project offers valuable insights for other journalists, showcasing an innovative approach for using building footprints geographic data for journalistic investigations, a practice that is scarce in the Spanish media landscape. The project's value hinges on our capacity to compile and analyze cartographic plans of every building in Spain, cross-referencing them with extensive flood risk areas. This advanced methodology not only provides a detailed understanding of each home's vulnerability to flooding but also involves optimizing and correcting government-identified flood zones under their guideline.

The pioneering nature of utilizing such detailed geographic data underscores our newspaper's commitment in exploring new frontiers in data-driven journalism. The use of an R script to download cadastral data from over 7,600 municipalities and cross-referencing it with established flood risk zones highlights the technical intricacies involved in the project.

This investigation stands out not only for its immediate and future relevance, particularly in the context of climate change, but it also establishes a precedent for continuous innovation in our future geographic data-driven projects. Other journalists can draw inspiration from this approach, emphasizing the importance of thorough data analysis, cross-referencing, and technological tools to push the boundaries of investigative journalism in Spain.","Spanish, English (translated only main story)",https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/spain-at-flood-risk-over-million-homes-stand-at-hazardous-areas_1_10568651.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/mapa-viviendas-zona-inundable-riesgo-inundacion-riadas-calle-calle_1_10485917.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/litoral-mediterraneo-foco-burbuja-inmobiliaria-zonas-inundables-construccion-nuevas-viviendas-riesgo-inundacion_1_10486894.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/inundaciones-riadas-espana-7000-millones-indemnizaciones-tres-decadas-seguros_1_10488314.html,,,,"Pau Rodríguez, Victòria Oliveres, Raúl Sánchez, Erena Calvo, Alba Camazón, Ana Ordaz, David Velasco, Nando Ochando, Clara Rodríguez","Pau Rodríguez: journalist and reporter at elDiario.es Catalonia regional team.

We analyzed reader responses, exposing the gap between perceived and actual income distribution. Our findings reveal a tendency for individuals to place themselves within the average, sparking a widespread public debate in income inequalities in Spain.","The project wielded a powerful impact on public discourse, sparking a widespread debate on income inequality in Spain. With hundreds of thousands of readers using the salary calculator, the initiative became a viral sensation, prompting extensive discussions on social media. Thousands shared calculator screenshots, amplifying its reach organically.

The personalized content allowed readers of all ages and regions across Spain to discover their actual salary positions, often yielding surprising revelations. Garnering over a half million visits, it emerged as one of elDiario.es's most-read articles of the year and a significant driver of new subscriptions.

The interactive narrative that explains how a lot of readers are not aware that many people are paid very little using readers' responses illustrates the gap between perception and reality, improving the understanding of income distribution.

These innovative strategies, including TikTok formats, contributed to the project's impact, expanding its influence. The journalistic experiment also wields significant influence on public opinion, as evidenced by academic studies illustrating how individuals shift their perspectives on public policies related to income redistribution, and contributes to shaping a more informed and nuanced debate of economic and social dynamics.","The journalistic project stands out for its innovative approach to use detailed salary data, typically inaccessible at such personalized levels. Using data from 13 million tax declarations, elDiario.es made earnings distribution data accessible to hundreds of thousands of readers through an intuitive calculator. Users only needed to input their gross salary, region and age to know their position on the Spanish salary scale and detailed insights about income distribution. We faced a challenge because this was the first time we collected the responses of our readers and used them for journalistic purposes.

Also, complex concepts related to income distribution, such as median and percentiles, were translated into easily understandable and personalized information for the average user. In Spain, where initiatives with this level of personalization are rare, this project emerges as a benchmark, using technology to empower the audience and reshape public understanding and public debate about income inequality.","We utilized a combination of tools and technologies to conduct a comprehensive analysis.

This causes damage not only to the health of inhabitants living close to those garbage dump sites, but also creates a health hazard for all living creatures, and increases environmental pollution.","After its publication, this investigation had an impact on Egyptian society. The Ministry of Local Affairs and Public Utilities issued a decision to implement a new mechanism to collect garbage and waste from public dumps in a much faster manner, to avoid or reduce the chances of it catching fire in the Egyptian streets.

The Egyptian Parliament also issued a decision to refer a number of local leaders to investigate the mistakes that were committed and caused an increase in the number of fires inside Greater Cairo","Work on the investigation continued for 11 months, to be able to collect data related to the number of garbage collection vehicles and the number of fire engines, as this data was not easily available inside Egypt.
There was also great difficulty in finding cases who agreed to speak to record their suffering due to their presence near street fires in Cairo. All of these cases suffer from health problems documented by medical reports to explain the extent of their suffering due to their proximity to the fires.
This is in addition to being subjected to some harassment from people who work individually in collecting garbage and selling it within the Egyptian governorates","During the work on the investigation, I used the analysis of the data obtained to obtain the average number of fires within each governorate, as well as to calculate percentages and find out the highest and lowest governorates in terms of number due to the high number of fires, which are the most dangerous to their residents.

This perpetual circle, echoing across generations, systematically limits the opportunities of families with fewer resources. Through dynamic data visualization and human-centric storytelling, our project explores the deep connections between one’s birthplaces, educational journey and socio-economic outcomes.

Blending rigorous data analysis and traditional journalistic reporting, we delve into a complex web of challenges faced by those who were born in poor neighborhoods. From childhood to the labor market, we dived into the obstacles hindering upward social mobility.","This journalistic project has made a significant impact by weaving a complex phenomenon into a cohesive narrative that explains all the factors that cut the opportunities of those born in poorest neighborhoods. It became one of the most read journalistic investigations of the year, attracting over 230,000 users and being among the top articles of the year with higher engagement times. 

Endorsed by thousands of positive comments and recognized by stakeholders, including members of the Spanish Congress and experts in social and educational inequality, the project started a widespread debate on meritocracy. It reveals the breakdowns in the social elevator and emphasizes how one’s initial conditions significantly influence the probability of ascending the social ladder. 

The use of clear and interactive data visualizations, shared by thousands, were combined with personal stories to humanize the statistics. Also, it offers access to a detailed street-level mapping of education inequality and income that allow readers to explore disparities in their own communities. An interactive calculator showed readers how their probabilities of reaching their educational level could have changed with a different family background.","While the project sheds light on well-known issues, it offers a groundbreaking perspective by weaving these disparate threads into a comprehensive narrative, providing an unprecedented understanding of the cycle fueling income inequality in Spain. The project compiles data from thousands of individual records of PISA survey in 2018 and 2022, Spanish Census 2021 and Economically Active Population Survey and massive geographic data from Atlas of household income distribution to prove the existence of a cycle that reduces the opportunities of those born into families with fewer resources.

We used publicly available records to uncover compelling human stories that resonated with the statistical trends. Elsa, Milagros, and Iker emerged as central figures, anchoring the entire narrative. This approach not only added a human touch but also exemplified the pervasive impact of systemic inequalities on individuals. In the intricate tapestry of Spain's socio economic landscape, this project stands as a testament to the power of data-driven journalism to expose hidden narratives and stimulate meaningful conversations about inequalities.","The data for this series of articles came from multiple sources. We mainly used R and RStudio to compile and merge microdata databases and further analyze them. To enhance visual storytelling, we employed D3.js for chart coding, ensuring dynamic and engaging visualizations. Smooth transitions were achieved using Canvas, while Mapbox facilitated the geographical representation of educational segregation in Spanish cities.

A noteworthy aspect involved the creation of a simulation using R, Javascript, and D3.js. This simulation, driven by Census data, calculated the probability of individuals reaching specific educational levels based on their family backgrounds. This interactive chart simulated the educational paths of 5,000 individuals, providing a nuanced understanding of the impact of parental education on educational outcomes.

The integration of these tools and technologies allowed us to present a multifaceted exploration of educational disparities, enriching the storytelling experience and promoting a deeper engagement with the audience.","This project exemplifies the importance of unifying multiple data, indicators, life experiences and expert voices in a sole narrative to tell a complex but humanized story. The numbers presented in this investigation come from a variety of sources but, put together meaningfully, explain all the sides of the same phenomenon. 

The visual effort put on the different articles, programming a variety of charts specifically for each topic, with all their details and annotations and unifying the colors, is also relevant to convey the idea that what seems a lot of complex information can also be read as a more simple and bounded problem.

Companies were shown to have used false documents to apply for quotas to import hundreds of migrant workers. 

By exploiting loopholes, the traffickers were able to bring in hundreds of workers, who end up jobless and starving in Malaysia. This series is unique because it shows a paper trail used by the traffickers and is able to trace in detail how the scheme works, and each level of pay off.","The main article attracted more than 40,000 views in at least two languages, with engagement of at least two minutes. This far eclipses the average Malaysiakini article where readership is usually less than 5,000 per article.

The reporting prompted parliamentary debates, and subsequent investigations from the Human Resources Ministry. This was amid outcry from stakeholders and pressure groups. 

Following the series, the Human Resources Ministry was also sacked. While we cannot claim full credit for the minister losing job, the evidence of poor management of migrant worker recruitment placed incredible pressure on him in the last months of his tenure. 

Police are also currently investigating the fraud, after companies whose names were fraudulently used in the scheme were alerted of this by Malaysiakini, and lodged police complaints. 

There is also a Labour Court case pending involving the workers involved. Malaysiakini is closely following the outcome.","The report was published amid threats of a defamation lawsuit by some of the parties proven to be involved in the scheme. Since then, Malaysiakini has been slapped with a cease and desist order, but it is intending to stand by its story and continue to fight the case in court. 

Such cease and desist actions are common when it comes to reporting on issues pertaining to corporate bigwigs, as is in this case, and is a costly risk to take.

We also relied heavily on whistleblowers to obtain a large part of the data, with the sources taking on a considerable legal risk. The whistleblowers contacted Malaysiakini via an intermediary, after the publication of the first part of our series on migrant worker recruitment fraud in June 2023.","We used traditional investigative journalism techniques to obtain and corroborate information from whistleblowers and stakeholders. We used encrypted communications with the whistleblowers and in many cases, the documents were provided in print format and copies were made from there to ensure no metadata trail on them. 

For documents which were in a different language, we used Google translate for some documents, but sensitive documents had to be translated by colleagues in collaborating newsrooms. 

Documents were shared and organised among the two collaborators via cloud.","Although this is an issue that has been reported on for years, it doesn’t mean it should be dismissed as an old story. What was uncovered was something that has not been reported on or established before, and really underscores the multilayer scam resulting in the issue of the glut of migrant workers in Malaysia and why.

By tracking the stories of at least four women, the project shows how this community is targeted for baby snatching and how their status puts them in a precarious condition when it comes to access to healthcare. 

It also shines a spotlight on the issue of statelessness, and through gamification, distils the complex bureaucracy and legal framework stopping indigenous people from obtaining citizenship.","The series generated around 150,000 views. 

The article brings forth a really damning issue, which has gone unreported or hidden from the larger population. 

Since the publication of the article, it was confirmed by the relevant agencies that at least one of the children was taken away without consent from the mother. She was reunited with the child, but not permanently because the adoption was already finalised. 


Since the series was published, the issue has been debated in parliament as well as attracted attention from international human rights organisations who have engaged Malaysiakini as part of their move to further investigations and conduct advocacy on the matter. 

Malaysiakini was also approached by another media house to produce a documentary on the issue and is currently collaborating on this project.

We’re also doing further reporting based on subsequent tip offs on the same issue, from insiders who read the report.","The reported incidents occurred in Sabah, a state in Borneo located far from the capital of Malaysia across the South China Sea. Malaysian news is highly centralised, and while there are local media outlets, the issues of people living in areas far away from the capital hardly make it into the mainstream headlines. Our report made this part of national consciousness. 

However, there were challenges in access to the community, who are semi-nomadic, and do not speak fluent Bahasa Malaysia. Tracking down the sources and ensuring there was nothing lost in translation required considerable effort.

While the project is not data heavy in the traditional sense, accessing this information and uncovering this trend of targeted baby snatching in this community involved extensive leg work in corroborating data obtained through multiple interviews. 

Since publication, there have been police reports lodged by the authorities against Malaysiakini, underscoring the legal minefield which news outlets have to navigate to produce such reporting.","To build the webpage, we employed React Nextjs and the Tailwind framework, along with various libraries like react-scrollama.

We developed a quiz to enhance readers' awareness of this topic.

We employ the scrollytelling method, complemented by illustrations, to effectively convey the narrative.

Additionally, we incorporate videos and a photo album to provide a glimpse into the real-life experiences of stateless families.

The data collection was done through traditional investigative journalism techniques of interviews and corroboration with insiders and whistleblowers.","The use of evocative illustration and interactive elements can help raise the impact of the report. This reporting would not have reached the same level of engagement if it was a plain text article.

This project was also first conceived as a simple access to healthcare feature, but by connecting the dots and seeing patterns and parallels between the cases uncovered, we were able to establish a larger issue at play.","Bahasa Malaysia, English, Chinese",https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/stateless/en/,https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/679579,https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/680868,https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/680882,,,,"S Vinothaa, Aidila Razak, Ooi Choon Nam, Affan Amrish, Basil Foo, Aedi Asri Abdullah, Low Choon Chyuan, Tan Hong Kai and Lee Weng Keat.","The Kini News Lab is a team specialising in data journalism and visual storytelling.

Because there aren't that many weather stations recording temperatures, satellite data was extensively used.

Instruments named MODIS aboard two NASA satellites detect the radiation emitted by a surface, and from those readings, they estimate surface temperatures for every square kilometre of earth.

The temperature for each square km within the territory of the panchayat is then taken and averaged to arrive at figures for the panchayat itself.","To be honest, the project didn't really have that much of an impact. The [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/shijith/status/1628993778555170817) about the project got a little viral but that's about it. Other journalists did take notice of it, and the hope is that they'll be encouraged to switch to a code-only workflow and so make their findings more reproducible.","One thing that's kind of innovative with this story is the extensive use of Microsoft's Planetary Computer. One of the problems with using geospatial data is how big the files are sometimes, so your computer's memory and processing limits can get in the way.

Using services like Planetary Computer can help avoid that by offloading work to remote servers that are more powerful and have instant access to data.

Another thing I've worked hard at doing is to make the results in this story completely reproducible. The code is all there in a jupyter notebook [on Github](https://github.com/shijithpk/hottest-panchayats-kerala), and it can be run cell by cell to get the original results.

While in 2016 the Union government had said that it aimed to rescue 18.4 million bonded labourers by 2030, at the present annual average rate, it is estimated to achieve only 2% of the target. Many bonded labourers do not get their entitlements--financial and nonfinancial--due to weak enforcement of the scheme and delays in issuing release certificates which are needed to ascertain their bondage.","Following my queries to the Chhattisgarh government on the lack of rehabilitation support for the workers rescued from Kushinagar in Uttar Pradesh, the state's labour department wrote to the Kushinagar's District Collector requesting them to share details so that rehabilitation procedures can be initiated. The case is ongoing and remains unresolved. I have forwarded the letter to an NGO that is working on the case. This story was republished on other media websites like Scroll and India Development Report.","Bonded labour is illegal in India since 1976. Yet there is widespread reporting of bonded labour, often in brick kilns. Retrieving data was a challenge. Some data were shared by the government two weeks after the publication of the story via Right to Information Act. Further, the quality of data is low. People rescued from bonded labour and rehabilitated did not match with the number of cases registered against bonded labour in the National Crime Records Bureau.

Despite many rescues being reportedly conducted financial and non-financial support for the labourers who are mostly from oppressed social backgrounds meagre or not available. The wage and livelihood insecurities force them into a vicious cycle of bondage. The story highlights how data from various sources, government and non government, can explain the characteristics of a problem like work bondage.

Also known as PFAS, these hazardous compounds do not degrade in the environment and will accompany humanity for thousands of years. Using ground-breaking methodology and innovative “expert-reviewed journalism”, the investigation revealed 20,000 contaminated sites, 21,500 sites presumed to be contaminated, and 230 known PFAS users across the continent.","The Forever Pollution Project showed that “expert-reviewed journalism” can contribute not just to the information of the public, but also to scientific research and regulatory efforts. The project has catapulted PFAS into the news and public debate in many European countries. 
Pollution is, most of the time, as pervasive as it is invisible. With our map, we materialised the magnitude of PFAS contamination across the continent. From print to TV, radio and online, including big multimedia, scrollytelling projects, the team published over 80 stories in 12 countries.
Our dataset, available in open source, has been used by dozens of journalists to investigate local sources of pollution and generate new knowledge. Major regulatory and scientific circles have solicited us to present our methodology in order to use it as a basis to investigate or remediate pollution, including the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the European Commission, the Belgian Presidency of the EU in 2024. 
Valentina Bertato, a EU Commission official, publicly praised our project as “a huge achievement” and said the EU chemical strategy for sustainability, published in 2020, would have made “an even more compelling case of action on chemicals” had our data been available at the time.","The thirty journalists on the project collected over 100 environmental monitoring datasets measuring PFAS concentrations in rivers, lakes, wildlife etc. from 136 organisations such as national and local authorities and scientific research teams. Data that were not publicly available were obtained through FOIs. Then, adapting a peer-reviewed methodology developed by a research team to map PFAS pollution in the United States, the journalists located an additional 21,500 “presumptive contamination sites” all over Europe. ""Presumptive"" because their industrial activities, whether past or present, were documented as both users and emitters of PFAS. This approach is now widely considered a valuable tool for governments and remediation initiatives to prioritise sampling campaigns and tailor action plans to protect the public.
An informal advisory group of 7 scientists from 3 disciplines (social sciences, environmental science, environmental law) participated in this “expert-reviewed journalism” experience to help us make sound decisions on the science aspects. Our project has raised major interest in journalism and science circles about the 'good recipe' to work with scientists. As a conclusion to this adventure based on the model of peer-reviewed scientific work, the project’s methodology will be published in the form of an article in a reference scientific journal.","For data gathering, scraping, cleaning and analysis, we used Python scripts, Google Sheets and CSV. This task was quite daunting, since data came from different sources, countries, languages, units of measurement and collection modes (FOI requests, open data, research papers…). We automated the reupload of our datasets via Python and Gspread, a Google Sheets API for Python.
We’ve also used OpenStreetMap and Google Earth for identifying industrial sites producing and / or using these chemicals.
We crafted our interactive map with vector tiles, which offer a smoother user experience, since we knew readers would need to zoom into very specific locations on the map. The tiles are rendered via Javascript and MapLibre GL JS, and the data symbols via DeckGL (a WebGL data visualization library). Our vector tiles are hosted on MapTiler’s servers. We used Javascript and Highcharts to create our charts.
To enable all of our partners, even the smaller newsrooms, to display this European map, we created an embeddable iframe with custom parameters, allowing them to pick their native language and what type of data they wanted to display – not all countries had the right to display presumptive contamination sites depending on local press freedom laws.","The international scale, the multidisciplinary ""expert-reviewers"" panel, the scaling-up from five to thirty journalists in twelve countries, and the considerable amount of generated data: we believe the Forever Pollution Project set a new milestone in investigative, cross-border and cross-field collaborative journalism.
Cross-field projects involving journalists with civil society organisations have developed significantly in the past years. However, journalistic projects aiming at generating data in collaboration with scientists and social scientists, rather than reporting on already-produced data, are not common. 
The FPP journalists are eager to share the lessons learned from this experience. They concluded such efforts require a trustful win/win relationship based on the following principles: 1) before anything else, journalists have to reach a high level of expertise about the topic and a good knowledge of the scientific ecosystem and customs to avoid time wasting, misunderstandings and errors; 2) clearly stated boundaries regarding published outputs; 3) the experts' contributions have to be recognized in any final 'products'; and 4) both parties should benefit from each discipline's methodologies, such as press requests and FOI material collected by journalists and OSINT methods.",English,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2023/02/23/revealed-the-massive-contamination-of-europe-by-pfas-forever-chemicals_6016906_8.html,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/les-decodeurs/article/2023/02/23/forever-pollution-explore-the-map-of-europe-s-pfas-contamination_6016905_8.html,,,,,,"Stéphane Horel, Raphaëlle Aubert, Gary Dagorn, Luc Martinon, Stéphane Mandard, Thomas Steffen, Tim Luimes, Gianluca Liva, Elisabetta Zavoli, Sarah Pilz, Daniel Drepper, Catharina Felke, Johannes Edelhoff, Lea Busch, Sarah Wippermann, Ralf Wiegand, Nadja Tausche, Manuel Bewarder, Andrea Hoferichter, Eurydice Bersi, Ana Tudela, Antonio Delgado, Zuzana Vlasatá, Tiina Lundell, Rachel Salvidge, Leana Hosea, Ģederts Ģelzis, Maj-Britt Horlacher, Felicitas Flohr, Brigitte Alfter","Stéphane Horel is an investigative journalist at Le Monde.

United States of America,ProPublica,Big,,,The Inside Edge,09/02/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Economy","Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python","The IRS possesses a vast resource that offers unique insight into stock trading: Every stock sale a person makes is reported to the agency. But the IRS doesn’t share that information with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which polices trading. ProPublica obtained records for a portion of the country’s wealthiest taxpayers, and performed an unprecedented analysis, revealing how top executives and investors make themselves wealthier through dubious means. The series “shows how pervasive insider trading is in our markets, exposes the myth that markets are fair,” said a leading insider trading academic, and “illustrates an appalling lack of enforcement.”","In two of the stories, we revealed how dozens of high-level corporate executives have traded shares of their competitors and partners with exquisite timing. One focused on how the practice is prevalent in biotech and other healthcare enterprises. Experts called the practice an abuse that should be pursued by prosecutors and regulators. By making millions through trading on nonpublic information, executives could contribute to the perception that the stock market is rigged to benefit the privileged. The former chair of the SEC said that corporate officials shouldn’t be betting on competing companies at all.


In another story, ProPublica analyzed a different stock-trading strategy of the ultrawealthy, which helps them save big on taxes. The reporting uncovered how billionaires like Steve Ballmer and Mark Zuckerberg were able to sidestep a century-old law that bars selling a stock to generate a tax loss and then immediately re-buying it. The article, which showed that wealth managers had devised a suite of products for just this purpose, had an immediate impact: Goldman Sachs said it would halt transactions like the ones described by ProPublica. Ballmer said he would amend his tax returns.","The sheer size of the dataset – millions of stock trading records – presented obvious challenges. But even more vexing was the complexity of these records, known as 1099-B forms. Because this sort of database had never been made public, there were few places to turn for assistance. To make things murkier, brokers notoriously fill out these forms inconsistently, and they’re often missing key information, particularly in earlier years. Moreover, the IRS has frequently changed its guidelines on what information is required to be reported. And the stakes were high: Our subjects are among the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country, some of whom are litigious and made that threat known to us. 

We spent over a year reporting, writing and editing the stories. Our reporting also relied on the significant time and energy we placed into transforming the leaked records into a usable database at the outset of the reporting for an earlier series of stories, called “The Secret IRS Files.” All aspects of the reporting were very time-intensive: from data cleaning and analysis, to developing expertise on securities law, to normal investigative work, to then working to render our conclusions in clear prose for readers.","To uncover well-timed trades among corporate executives, we calculated the performance of individual trades made by investors, and then used statistical methods to isolate those that were abnormal given typical movements of the firm and the broader market. This analysis found several instances where the days executives traded in their competitors’ stock were more opportune – if not the most opportune – over certain windows of time.

For our story on tax-loss trading, we reconstructed the trading strategies of individual investors. We built tools to analyze the activity of investors generating suspiciously large and consistent losses. This included conducting analyses over time to understand the pattern of losses, and deeper studies of a single day’s trading to study the securities being swapped. While these investors often made thousands of trades per year, the tax-loss trades were often concentrated on around a dozen days annually.

To report on the trades of fund managers, we paired the quarterly holdings data that firms report to the SEC with our own records. We then isolated personal trades made by fund managers in stocks that their funds were also trading during the same quarter, the quarter before or the quarter after they traded the stock themselves.","While obtaining a vast trove of personal trading records isn’t common for most journalists, the method we developed to surface suspicious trading activity across millions of private trades could be applied on a smaller scale for trading activity that is publicly disclosed. 

For example, we developed queries to isolate whether a trader’s well-timed bet was their first or only investment in a security. This led us to the chairman of one of the largest privately owned oil production companies in the U.S. He purchased a half million dollars worth of shares in a company he partnered with, the day before it announced incredible earnings. He had never before bought the company’s stock.

We also queried our records for traders who didn’t just make one well-performing trade, but several lucky ones. This led us to the CEO of a company that handles clinical trials for biopharma companies. He had a string of remarkable trades, including selling more than a million dollars worth of stock in a competitor, the day before a management shake-up caused the company’s stock price to plunge 16% – its largest one-day decline in price that year.",English,https://www.propublica.org/series/the-inside-edge,https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-irs-files-trading-competitors-stock,https://www.propublica.org/article/irs-files-taxes-wash-sales-goldman-sachs,https://www.propublica.org/article/dodge-cox-exec-david-hoeft-made-millions-trading-same-stocks,,,,"Robert Faturechi, Ellis Simani, Paul Kiel, Jeff Ernsthausen, Mariam Elba, Lucas Waldron",Ellis Simani is a data reporter at ProPublica and Jeff Ernsthausen is a senior data reporter at ProPublica.

The Met was holding, then, at least 1,109 pieces that were previously owned by people who had been either indicted or convicted of antiquities crimes; 309 of those pieces were on display at the time. Additionally, fewer than half of the 1,109 relics had records describing how they left their country of origin. The Met is North America’s largest museum.","Just days after ICIJ published its largest Met investigation in March, Manhattan prosecutors seized more than a dozen pieces linked to an Indian trafficking ring that ICIJ’s story had cited extensively. Later in the year, the Met returned several antiquities to their countries of origin, including 16 Khmer pieces that had been owned by a notorious art trafficker whom ICIJ had started writing about in 2021. The Met’s press release published at the time of the repatriation in December 2023 said those relics were the last Khmer pieces the Met held that were tied to Latchford. Additionally, just weeks after the publication of ICIJ’s March story, the Met pledged to hire a four-person team — led by a new “manager of provenance” — to root out suspect works among the Met’s many treasures, with a view to returning them to the countries from which they were looted. The Met also announced it would convene a panel of 18 art experts and curators to examine its policies and practices. The move signaled a profound change in how the museum approached the numerous claims of looting and trafficking in its collection.","Art trafficking is a known problem throughout the world, but how looted artifacts can be repatriated is a complex and open question. For many years activists have called for looted art pieces to be returned to their countries of origin–often with little consequence. 


What primarily makes tracking the art difficult is the various standards for provenance used by museums worldwide. Only some museums publish detailed previous ownership information of pieces in their collection online. But art can be held by private collectors or galleries, which makes it much harder to track. Additionally, the political will to prosecute art traffickers is sometimes lacking. 

ICIJ focused on the Met museum for this story because its catalog is online and much information – although not all – is readily available for analysis. 

Because the data analysis was conducted over several months and museums update their collection regularly, the information tied to the pieces analyzed as part of the story is only current as of the publication date. Since then, the Met has returned additional pieces.","ICIJ reporters compiled a list of indicted art traffickers and dealers as well as the galleries they own or used to own. ICIJ’s Data &amp; Research Unit then fact-checked the allegations against the alleged traffickers to make sure the methodology was cohesive. The team then searched the Met’s online collection using keywords (names of people and galleries that would appear in the credits or provenance information tied to a piece).

At first, the information was manually extracted and collected into Google Sheets. Later, ICIJ used a scraper to gather information faster and more effectively. We then cleaned the dataset to root out duplicates and items that shouldn’t be included in the count for the story. Because of the use of certain terms such as “antiquities” or “relics” in the story, ICIJ tracked the period attached to each piece to confirm which ones predated 1800 -- an arbitrary cutoff date applied to the whole dataset to keep the analysis cohesive. We also included a specific count for the pieces on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, since those would be visible to the public.","Reporting about art can be difficult because the information about a particular piece can be so scant. However, focusing on a specific museum or collection and showing the controversies surrounding certain pieces can help the public understand what is at stake when it comes to returning art to the countries it was trafficked from. Our project was about holding museums accountable, especially institutions with a budget dedicated to documenting the provenance of the pieces they proudly display. Having a cohesive methodology to include specific pieces both helps to focus the story and helps the reader to better understand the issues at stake.

ICIJ found that over the last 25 years at least 340 companies in the forest-products industry were cited by government agencies and environmental groups for a wide range of destructive practices after auditors had already certified their operations and products as sustainable. Those companies were later accused of overharvesting old growth forests and other illegal logging practices, bribing forestry officials, importing wood products in violation of trade restrictions, and performing sloppy checks on suppliers.","The investigation not only re-energized the global debate about greenwashing and deforestation, but it has alerted readers all around the world to the urgency of the crisis. And with that awareness came swift new measures to combat these practices.

Following the project’s publication, EU lawmakers drafted new rules that would force companies to substantiate the “green claims” they use to market to European consumers. In the U.S., the Justice Department announced a new interagency task force to bolster efforts to identify, investigate and prosecute trafficking in timber linked to environmental and other crimes.

In Canada, lawmakers called for an investigation into one of North America’s largest pulp and paper manufacturers, Paper Excellence. ICIJ and partners had uncovered hidden links between Paper Excellence and Asia Pulp &amp; Paper, a Chinese-Indonesian forestry company that has long been accused of deforestation and human rights abuses.","At the 2021 United Nations COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, U.S. President Joe Biden and more than 100 other world leaders vowed to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030. Soon after that pledge, private certification firms stepped up to offer services they said would help fight the climate crisis. Deforestation Inc. exposes the broader flaws in the global system meant to prevent deforestation and combat climate change.
Deforestation Inc. also sheds light on governments’ weak efforts to stop the trade of conflict wood from authoritarian regimes in Myanmar and elsewhere. ICIJ found at least 10 teak traders and retailers holding green certifications while buying from Myanmar suppliers. These certification displays continued after some European authorities began restricting the import of Myanmar wood in 2017 and after the EU and the U.S. imposed sanctions in 2021; the sanctions prompted certification companies to stop allowing the use of their logos on Myanmar wood or by the country’s forest programs.

ICIJ’s findings of green-certified companies later cited for environmental wrongdoing likely represent only a fraction of such cases because many government agencies don’t identify companies by name in environmental crime data.","ICIJ examined hundreds of court filings, violation data and leaked documents in more than a dozen languages. The team then shared the results of the data analysis with the partners. 


ICIJ used Google Sheets to organize and fact-check the research. Each row of data contained information about a forestry certificate (FSC, SFI, PEFC, etc), the company that held the certificate, the auditing company that delivered it, countries where those companies are based, and a description of the allegation made against the company at the time. Additionally, each claim that led to a fine or a conviction was included in a specific, separate count. 

Separately, ICIJ investigated Myanmar’s continued teak trade by analyzing leaked files from Myanmar’s tax agency and publicly available trade data. The confidential files were shared with ICIJ by Justice for Myanmar, a human rights group, U.K.-based news outlet Finance Uncovered and Distributed Denial of Secrets, a data transparency group. The files were shared with partners on Datashare, ICIJ’s secure research platform.","Deforestation is a complex issue that can be approached from many different directions. ICIJ chose to focus on sustainability claims and green certificates awarded to companies, since those are part of a bigger issue of weak enforcement and oversight. 

In the context of a cross-border investigation, it was important to keep a focus on sustainability claims and greenwashing, but reporters used a variety of tools and approaches to make the issues relevant to their audience in their respective countries. Reporters that worked on this nine-month investigation looked at Indigenous forestland in western Canada; inspected the teak fittings in luxury yachts at boat shows in Fort Lauderdale, Amsterdam and Paris and visited the warehouses of teak traders in India; others staked out wood pellet mills in North Carolina to follow the supply chain to energy plants in the Netherlands; or used drones to capture the extent of deforestation in Finland, South Korea and Indonesia.",English,https://www.icij.org/investigations/deforestation-inc/auditors-green-labels-sustainability-environmental-harm/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/deforestation-inc/about-deforestation-inc-investigation/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/deforestation-inc/myanmar-teak-trade-sanctions-military-regime/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/deforestation-inc/video-deforestation-green-claims-products/,,,,"The investigation involved a total of 44 media partners in 28 countries.

ICIJ’s analysis of more than 3.6 million files found nearly 800 companies and trusts registered in secrecy jurisdictions owned or controlled by Russians who were sanctioned by Western countries either after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. For more than a decade, an astonishing flood of Russian money has poured into Cyprus. Cyprus Confidential exposes this sprawling, secretive financial system.","Immediately after Cyprus Confidential’s publication, 24 specialists from the FBI and FinCEN (the Treasury Dept.’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) were flown into Cyprus to assist with a government probe, which Cyprus President Nikos Christodoulides pledged to launch in response to the ICIJ project. “Everything that has come to light will be investigated,” Christodoulides said. “The reputation of our country, the credibility of our country, you understand, is crucial.”

Cypriot officials and the country’s attorney general met at the presidential palace to discuss improving oversight of sanctions laws and improving future investigative work for sanctions cases.

Meanwhile, EU lawmakers met in a parliamentary session called in direct response to Cyprus Confidential. They forcefully criticized Cyprus for its lax enforcement of sanctions against Russia and demanded loopholes in anti-money laundering systems be closed. And anti-corruption advocates at Transparency International released a statement urging Cypriot authorities to take decisive measures to weed out bad practices in the country’s financial services sector. 

In the six weeks since it was published, Cyprus Confidential has been written about in more than 4,000 news articles appearing in media outlets that reach hundreds of millions of people in dozens of countries.","No journalistic work has matched the scope or reach of Cyprus Confidential in unearthing the Cyprus-Russia dealings or crystalizing the transactions themselves. To actualize this massive ambition, ICIJ analyzed more than 3.6 million documents, obtained from law and accounting firms in Cyprus, and reporters under the leadership of ICIJ pooled their research as they mined those records over eight months. That analysis was possible because of ICIJ’s secure open-source technology developed and maintained by our tech team. 

Only a fraction of the documents were created after February 2022. This made it harder to find potential cases of sanctions avoidance by the Russians who are or were clients of these firms. And while access to corporate registries sometimes identify the beneficial owners of companies, the notable opacity of the offshore industry provides additional layers of secrecy. (Trusts, for example, aren’t registered.) ICIJ was able to connect the dots thanks to its previous projects, such as Panama Papers and Pandora Papers, and to our media partners’ sharing their findings. 

Given the nature of Cyprus Confidential, some reporters who collaborated on the project asked that their names be left off to protect themselves from potential retaliation in their respective countries.","The data analysis was guided by ICIJ reporters’ needs as well as those of our media partners’. We focused on identifying the Cyprus companies and trusts that the sanctioned Russians (including oligarchs, billionaires, and members of Putin’s inner circle) had controlled over the years and to which the Cyprus law and accounting firms had provided services.

Besides using Datashare and I-Hub, ICIJ ‘s Data &amp; Research Unit used Google Sheets to structure findings about the corporate entities found in the documents. We ran batch searches of names on Datashare using csv. 

For a specific data point related to clients of the accounting firm PwC, we also used Python and Pandas to scrape text from financial statements we obtained and analyzed those more quickly and thoroughly.

As not all documents were in English and many were in Greek and some in Russian, ICIJ developed a tool to determine each document's language, enabling successful OCR. For translation, we opted against third-party services like Google Translate or DeepL due to confidentiality and cost concerns, creating instead our own machine learning-based tool. This tool, initially limited to single-server operation, was redesigned for distributed use across multiple servers, significantly reducing both cost and processing time.","Cyprus Confidential is a model of using obtained records—emails, receipts, spreadsheets, financial statements, etc.—and piecing together a larger narrative by telling many stories within. But documents alone never tell the whole story. ICIJ also tracked down financial experts, historians, politicians, academics, analysts of Russia and Cyprus, ordinary citizens—and traveled to Cyprus and beyond to create this remarkably full portrait of the complex and troubling Cyprus-Russia alliance.

Cyprus Confidential was an eight-month project. It involved more than 270 journalists in 54 countries and one territory. ICIJ provided training on its platforms, supported media partners with research and data findings, and organized regular meetings to check in and share findings beyond what was already published on the online secure platform. Throughout we relied on great and consistent communication; relentless reporting and editing and a world-class fact-checking team. Everyone knew their jobs; everyone worked toward the bigger goal; and everyone worked as a team.

These encompass 422 giant sites dedicated to the extraction of oil, gas and / or coal, which were cataloged in 2022 by a team of researchers. These massive fossil fuel deposits alone jeopardize humanity’s chances of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. An international media consortium has also published the results of this multifaceted investigation.","This project was mentioned by dozens of French and international media outlets. It has circulated widely on social networks and within civil society, especially through influencers, activist blogs and associations. They called out the banks and operators we identified, especially the French companies BNP Paribas and TotalEnergies, using our revelations to strengthen a broader consumer movement advocating for holding accountable those involved in carbon bombs. NGOs such as Reclaim Finance have also leveraged this project to reinforce their call for transparency regarding data on actors implicated in carbon bombs.

Faced with a lack of credible information and amidst the Iranian government's attempts to conceal the incidents, this initiative undertook the task of daily data collection. 

Over the course of six months, the project compiled data on 409 schools with confirmed poisoning incidents.","The information collected through this project has been widely referenced and utilized by reputable journalists, featuring in numerous reports. Notably, it was cited in an article published by The Nature Magazine and subsequently echoed in newspapers across Greece, Italy, and Spain. Several peer-reviewed scientific journals also acknowledged and incorporated the data and information collected by this initiative. Additionally, Persian-language news outlets such as Radio Farda published a couple of articles providing descriptions and analyses of the data collected through this project. The project ensured daily data updates at the school-level, offering a comprehensive dashboard for data visualization. This dashboard garnered significant attention on social media, becoming a valuable tool for tracking the situation in Iran during that period. The project website hosts a comprehensive list of all news reports and scientific papers grounded in the data collected.","From November 2022 to May 2023, a total of 409 schools reported incidents of gas poisoning, affecting an estimated 15,000 students, predominantly girls, who required varying levels of medical assistance. In the absence of transparent data practices in non-democratic nations like Iran, the scraping of news outlets emerged as a crucial source of invaluable information.

To manage and analyze the collected data, Google Sheets and Google Sites were employed. Leveraging the features of Google Sheets, the original daily data in Persian was automatically translated into English. The graphs and charts, available in both English and Persian, were hosted on Google Sites, ensuring automatic updates whenever the underlying data changed.

While an independent investigation was unattainable to identify the root cause of the poisonings, leaving it unknown, this project meticulously recorded detailed information about the affected schools, revealing a systemic pattern. Although the cause remains elusive, this data may serve as a valuable resource for future reference, particularly if additional evidence comes to light.","A data collection framework was defined at the project's outset and subsequently adapted as necessary throughout its progression. The project commenced by extracting information from various official media outlets within Iran. However, after a few months, the Iranian government imposed a ban on all domestic media outlets from reporting on school poisoning occurrences. In response to this restriction, the project adapted its data collection methodology. The revised framework stipulated that at least two out of three selected reliable news outlets from outside Iran must confirm an incident for it to be considered a verified poisoning case in a school. 

Advanced Google Search was employed to locate news articles containing information about incidents from specific media outlets. 

To verify the information regarding poisoning incidents in schools reported by news outlets, the school's name was searched in online school databases. Additional information about the schools was then extracted for the project's dataset.

Google Sheets and Google Sites played crucial roles in the project, serving as platforms for storing collected data, conducting data cleansing, translating data from Persian to English, visualizing data, and maintaining the dashboard or tracker.","Basic tools and information can yield invaluable data and visualizations, offering critical support for news reports and facilitating effective situation monitoring.","English, Persian",https://sites.google.com/view/poison-tracker/english,https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00754-2,https://jglobalbiosecurity.com/articles/10.31646/gbio.209,https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/bcb-2023-0100#body-ref-ref1,,,,Mahmoud Azimaee,"Mahmoud Azimaee is the Director of Data Quality and Information Management at ICES, a medical research institute in Toronto.

And what preventive methods should be followed to maintain the health of children.","There was a strong interaction from the public with the investigation, especially as it monitors the nutritional status among children, which is what many Egyptians suffer from, and they are trying to find solutions to malnutrition among their children, demanding that the Egyptian government have a treatment for children that contributes to reducing infection rates.
The investigation also received great interaction from the concerned authorities because it reveals real figures on malnutrition that have not been announced by the official government agencies, and reveals for the first time a map of the spread of diseases in numbers in the governorates, the highest rates of infection among children, as well as the reasons that led to the increase in the number of infected people. 
In addition, a doctor specializing in malnutrition diseases relied on the results of the investigation, in order to work on it in a study on the map of the prevalence of malnutrition in the Arab Republic of Egypt, with a research team at Yale University.","Over the past 8 years, the Egyptian government has liberalized the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound more than once, which led to the loss of much of its value, which led to an increase in the prices of basic commodities for citizens, and affected the dietary pattern on children in particular, and on pregnant women, which caused malnutrition to spread more than it was before the exchange rate was liberalized.
The Egyptian government also recently announced a decrease in the percentage of stunted and wasting sufferers, but the investigation revealed that on the other hand, the percentage of people suffering from anemia almost doubled, and the investigation revealed that the rise in commodity prices was one of the reasons for the increase in infection rates among children. 
In addition to the above, the world suffered from the disruption of supply chains after the Russian-Ukrainian war, which negatively affected the nutritional status of children in Egypt in particular, in connection with the liberalization of the exchange rate.","This report is the product of a training course in data journalism and it was the graduation project, I resorted to many sources to obtain and collect data, and the data was unstructured and most of them were PDF files, and then I cleaned the data through Excel, Data Miner and Tableau.
Many design sites were used, including Florish, Data Rapper, and Microsoft PowerBay, but the site did not support PowerBay, so it was dispensed with, and switched to Graphic on the Florish website.
Interactive maps on Data Rapper were used to monitor the map of the spread of diseases in the governorates.","Journalists can learn from this investigation how to collect data, especially since there is no official data in Egypt on child malnutrition, as well as how to choose graphs that express the topic, in addition to knowing the criteria on which malnutrition is classified.
It also illustrates the link between poverty rates and the spread of malnutrition, the impact of inflation on the lives of Egyptians, as well as the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war on the dietary pattern, and identifying the social protection programs implemented by the Egyptian state.

Kyrgyzstan,PolitKlinika,Small,,,Energy Production Declines: How Climate Change and Glacier Degradation Affect Power Sector,03/11/2023,"Open data, Infographics, Chart","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","There are thousands of small and large glaciers in our country. This water is also used to generate electricity. But in 70 years we have lost 16% of glaciers. In this project, our team tried to show the impact of melting glaciers and global warming on the energy system of Kyrgyzstan. The country's energy system is most dependent on hydroelectric power plants, which depend on the volume of water to operate. We were able to reveal that melting glaciers negatively affects energy production.","Our project helped our readers find out the reasons for the problems in the energy sector in the country. The public, in the comments under the publication, began to share their ideas for preserving glaciers and reasonable energy consumption. In addition, we managed to interest that part of the audience that had previously remained passive. Now more people are interested in the problem of the energy system and the preservation of glaciers. To this we can add the fact that after the publication of our project, this topic began to be addressed more by responsible persons in the form of officials. And the president began to pay more attention to this problem and made a speech about strengthening measures to preserve glaciers at the One Planet Polar Summit in Paris.","It is important for us to draw attention to the problem of the disappearance of resources such as glaciers, irrational use and waste. With this project we wanted to show why it is important to take care of glaciers and water. After all, their disappearance will affect not only the energy system, but agriculture, the landscape and, most importantly, there is a risk of losing sources of drinking water.","We used a method of comparing glacier areas with data from the 70s of the last century and today to identify the extent of glacier losses. This made it possible to find out more accurate losses, which amounted to 16% of the entire area. We obtained data on the water level in the hydroelectric power station thanks to online data that measures the inflow and outflow of water every day.
Data on the volume of electricity production were obtained from the country's Ministry of Energy. Using and analyzing all the data, we were able to find out how glacier degradation affects the energy sector of Kyrgyzstan.","Our colleagues from other editorial offices and countries can familiarize themselves with the problem of glaciers and the energy sector of our country.

The provision in the Clean Air Act has allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to strike pollution from clean air tallies in more than 70 counties, enabling local regulators to claim the air was cleaner than it really was for more than 21 million Americans. The loophole allows regulators to forgive pollution, and avoid costly cleanup work, caused by “natural” or “uncontrollable” events, including wildfires.","Within a month of our series publication, we collaborated with a freelance journalist for the Chicago Tribune who used our data and documents to find that dozens of states in the Midwest and beyond were discussing the possibility of banding together to file the largest exceptional events application ever.
In response to our findings, Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who represents Detroit, said that excluding data to say that the air is clean is a “disservice to the public and the community.” And in California, Michael Benjamin, the chief of the state’s air-quality planning and science division, told us that the state will continue to use exceptional events rule in the face of increasing wildfires because it may be the only thing that allows parts of the state to meet EPA standards.
In response to our investigation, the EPA acknowledged the changing landscape of wildfire pollution and sources inside the agency said officials are planning to convene several regional and state air agencies with a group of atmospheric scientists in early 2024 to discuss major changes to the exceptional events rule.","First pushed into law in 2005 by former Republican senator Jim Inhofe, the exceptional events rule has become a “regulatory escape hatch” for states that want to meet increasingly strict federal air-quality standards. Local regulators are turning to the exceptional events rule for wildfires more and more often to reach air-quality goals – goals that are harder to meet as the climate crisis gets worse. Our four-part investigation found that air regulators are turning to the exceptional events rule more often, in an attempt to meet air standards as they face wildfires escalating in frequency and severity. But before our team of journalists started digging into the impact of this legal tool, even experts on the law were hard-pressed to say what agencies across the country used it the most and for which types of events. It took a full year of dogged requests and a three-newsroom collaboration to unearth the data and documents to answer those questions.","MuckRock, The California Newsroom and the Guardian negotiated with the EPA to receive detailed data that the agency does not provide in any pre-generated datasetsIn addition to the data we received on exceptional events, the newsrooms filed state open-records and federal Freedom of Information Act requests for emails, contracts and written “demonstrations’‘ for exceptional events. Local air agencies submit a written demonstration to the EPA to formally ask the federal government to agree to exclude some or all of the data that the agency has flagged. In response to our open-records requests, we received 138 demonstrations submitted to the EPA, covering January 2016 through February 2023. We also consulted with five atmospheric scientists who have experience studying air pollution and its health impacts. As we received data and documents from the EPA, these experts helped shape our methodology. Once we finished our analysis, we shared our findings with them, to help validate and interpret the data. In collaboration with one of these experts, Dan Jaffe, a University of Washington-Bothell professor of atmospheric and environmental chemistry, we presented our work at the annual American Geophysical Union conference for a forthcoming paper.","To help other journalists and the public explore Environmental Protection Agency data we obtained and analyzed for our “Smoke, Screened,” investigation we have also published the raw data and code in a GitHub repository. We then published the data in a more user-friendly way through a tool called Datasette. In a webinar with the Society of Environmental Journalists, we demonstrated how other journalists can explore the data in Datasette to kick-start reporting on exceptional events.

Metadata (DocumentCloud)","""Atomic Fallout"" is an ongoing collaboration between The Missouri Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press involving thousands of pages of previously-unreleased government records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. They show radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project was known to pose a threat to people living in North St. Louis County as early as 1949. But federal officials repeatedly wrote off potential health risks off as ""slight,"" ""minimal"" or ""low-level.""","The reaction from federal and Missouri state lawmakers to ""Atomic Fallout"" was swift. Within days, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, and Rep. Cori Bush, D-Missouri, pledged action, calling the investigation “devastating” and decrying the federal government’s “negligence."" The U.S. Senate, with bipartisan support, narrowly voted in late July to expand a program that compensates Americans who become ill because of exposure to radiation from the country’s development and testing of nuclear weapons and the buildup to the Cold War. Senators attached the legislation to the annual defense bill; it was ultimately stripped out of the final version of the legislation after the Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost $147 billion over a decade. Still, legislators and affected families in seven Western states are vowing to reintroduce legislation to extend and expand the federal radiation compensation program in 2024 and a flurry of pre-filed bills in Missouri would increase state funding for a victims’ compensation fund, citing our reporting. And the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced in January that it would install signs along the waterway warning people of the risks — more than 70 years after workers first realized barrels of radioactive waste were left nearby.","What we found shows, for the first time, that Mallinckrodt Chemical Works, the private company that processed uranium in the St. Louis area for the Manhattan Project, knew as far back as 1949 that Coldwater Creek could be contaminated by radioactive waste flowing from deteriorating steel drums. The company thought the material was too dangerous for workers to handle. So instead, the waste was left to seep into the creek, which runs through what would become St. Louis suburbs. Over six months, more than two dozen journalists and researchers pored over 6,700 pages of federal government documents, many of which had been either newly-declassified or never before reviewed. We consulted experts to analyze the reports anew, to see if the environmental and radioactivity testing done decades ago could be seen and understood in a different, modern light. A group of journalists spent weeks carefully reading through the documents and used DocumentCloud to categorize documents, record dates and flag new details for outside review. The goal of this massive undertaking was to help reporters connect the dots between documents across decades of history.","With the new revelations about the government’s knowledge of the problem decades before cleanup would begin, we set out to draft the definitive examination of the radioactive waste saga in St. Louis. We launched a public callout to collect stories from those who lived near Coldwater Creek and the West Lake Landfill. We heard from more than 100 current and former residents of Florissant and Hazelwood, many of whom said they never knew about radioactive waste that had been dumped nearby. A group of journalists spent weeks carefully reading through the documents and used DocumentCloud to categorize documents, record dates and flag new details for outside review. We then sent some of the more notable documents, including those that included air, soil and water readings, to a group of experts, some with connections to the St. Louis nuclear waste story and others who had only read about it in passing. We also shared our lead findings with those who have covered the St. Louis nuclear story, including Carolyn Bower and Gerry Everding, who were part of the original Post-Dispatch team that published “Legacy of the Bomb” in 1989, and compared the findings with the entirety of the public record.","As part of our investigation, we created a map to follow the timeline of how radioactive waste was moved across St. Louis county and shows how nuclear waste continues to be a danger to Missourians today after decades of mistakes made in its transportation and storage. The contamination greatly increased the risk of cancer for St. Louis residents who grew up playing in the creek. That map became MuckRock's most-read article in its history, underscoring the import of interactive web elements for investigative projects.",English,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/jul/12/st-louis-landfill-toxic-superfund/,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/jul/19/atomic-fallout-methodology/,https://apnews.com/article/nuclear-waste-cancer-st-louis-army-corps-school-9e1ceb765822fc53fcbc2e42005adef2,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/jul/27/senate-expand-radiation-exposure-compensation-act/,,,,"Allison Kite and Jason Hancock, The Missouri Independent

The project is looking at the issue from both sides of it; countries of origin and countries of destination.

The significant inquiry of this project revolves around the disparity between the actual experiences of global migrants and their aspirations, as mirrored in their Google search preferences. Achieving a magical comparison between data from the tangible reality and the virtual realm holds great importance not only on the strategic political aspects but on the humanitarian aspects as well.","In cooperation with Alberto Cairo and Simon Rogers from Google, and among several suggested ideas, we collectively gravitated towards addressing a profound question about the disparity between the reality of global migrants and their dreams reflected in their Google search interests.

We use the data for regular **deep-dive analyses, live formats and to enrich all our reporting on weather and climate change**. Klimazentrale creates impact on a local level by raising awareness for climate change and fuelling discussions about **adaptation measures**, e.g. a ""heat bus"" that helps homeless people during heatwaves. Furthermore, Klimazentrale **has inspired numerous news outlets** to similar projects.","Due to the enormous interest in all sorts of weather and climate reporting, particularly during numerous phases of weather anomalies, Klimazentrale content **has reached hundreds of thousands of our readers online**. Additionally, it has been **published on a weekly basis in our print titles (circulation 200.000)** and helped to raise awareness for climate change in local contexts.
Our coverage has **fuelled local debates on climate mitigation and adaptation**. The project is cited on Social Media and in political discussions. The mayor’s office has, as a result, **initiated a “heat bus”** that serves the poor and homeless during heatwaves throughout the city. 
Klimazentrale has been **awarded with Theodor Wolff prize**, the most important award of the German newspaper industry. We have presented and discussed our project at several **journalism conferences, panels and talks** all over Germany. Subsequently, Klimazentrale has **inspired at least five other outlets to publish very similar projects**, among them Süddeutsche Zeitung and Berliner Morgenpost. 
On a technical basis, Klimazentrale has **pushed news automation** in our editorial team to new heights and we can use this expertise for other projects. Because of its **non-finite nature**, the project keeps informing and improving our coverage, until today and into the future.","While climate change is clearly a global phenomenon, **its impact is always local**. Germany is not the most-affected country, but one of the biggest CO2 emitters. Tackling climate change starts with raising awareness for the problem and its ramifications - because they can be measured in the richer part of the world, too. 
This is where the purpose of Klimazentrale starts. We use data from several official sources (e.g. the German meteorological service or the Stuttgart city council) to **compare historical ranges for temperature and rainfall with live data**. On this basis, we create automated live visualizations and analyses for &gt;500 ZIP-code areas that help to identify anomalies and can be used for deep-dive analyses.
Stuttgart is expected to be the city with the strongest exposure to summer heat in Germany by 2050. Heatwaves generate a **huge interest among our audience**, just like many other situations in which weather doesn't appear to be ""normal"" anymore. Klimazentrale helps us to cater to these information needs with e**xclusive visual and factual content that enriches our reporting on a daily basis**.

Frontend: We automate the charts with R / DatawrappR and the Datawrapper API and Vue.JS, automating the postcode-level text analysis is done with PHP.","In fact, other newsrooms have already learned a lot by developing projects clearly inspired by Klimazentrale. **Automation can be used effectively in regional journalism**, and climate change reporting is a very good case in point. The local impacts of climate change are certainly different in different parts of the world, but Klimazentrale shows that **data-driven reporting will be a valuable contribution to raising awareness and stimulating local discussion** in all cases.

Another lesson is that choosing the smallest possible unit for reporting serves the interests of the audience. Climate reporting tends to have a global focus, which may seem **too distant** for local communities. **Reporting data at a hyper-local level is an answer to this problem**.

Newsrooms need to be aware that automation projects require continuous monitoring, which clearly requires additional resources.

India,Nikkei Asia,Big,,,Bollywood's gender revolution: Women are rewriting the rules,08/03/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Arts, Business, Culture, Women, Economy, Employment","Scraping, R","Rhetoric around acute sexism in India’s Bollywood cinema – the world’s most prolific film industry that sells more than 2 billion tickets annually around the globe – has long been prevalent.

Nikkei Asia embarked on an ambitious data-forward project to examine the problems, quantify the progress, and identify the shifts that can generate inclusion.

It was the first gender-based dataset of its kind ever done on Bollywood, critical for a film-crazy country with one of the lowest female labor participation rates globally. Declining over the past two decades, it stands comparable with Pakistan and Somalia at 23% (the World Bank).","Gender representation is crucial in India, ranked 135 among 146 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index 2022.

Our analysis showed that change is afoot in this star-obsessed country of 1.4 billion people where many idolize, and even mimic, their favorite actors. 

It brought statistics to the forefront and showed that change over the last two decades has been slow, but significant.

Findings included:

*1 in 4 movies are now women-led, compared to 1 in 10.

*The percentage of women older than 35 in lead roles is now at 33%, up from 3%. 

*Women-led movies get 1/5 of total capital but perform at par or better (ROI) than the rest.

*The majority of female, often leading, characters, are still portrayed without an occupation.

In addition to arduous manual data work, we interviewed India's biggest female superstar, and a female producer who went on to win a historic Oscar. 

We featured several other high-profile change agents, and these hard-to-get interviews helped us craft a compelling, well-rounded narrative that sparked extensive dialogue on LinkedIn. We were told by Bollywood insiders that it was shared widely with financiers, producers, distributors and studio heads -- some of whom vowed to fund more equitable projects.","No database exists for Bollywood scripts. Neither is there an index for cast and crew (like IMDB for Hollywood). 

Nikkei Asia’s analysis was scraped 1,200 Bollywood movies released between 2000 and 2022. It included 1,114 top-grossing theatrical releases and 86 movies on three leading streaming platforms – Amazon Prime Video, Netflix India and Disney+Hotstar.

For theatrical releases, we scraped box office collections, budgets and names of actors in each movie’s cast. We sampled the 50 top-grossing movies for every year, except for pandemic years 2020 and 2021. 

We used R programming language for data analysis. Scraping techniques and packages included Rvest and RSelenium.

With no existing framework, we then developed a set of criteria to classify a movie as woman-led. It had to meet 3 of these 4 guidelines:
a) the protagonist was female; b) the movie’s plot revolved around the female protagonist and her agency; c) the movie’s poster prominently featured the female protagonist; d) the actress credits appeared first.

We manually tagged the lead cast of every movie, their gender and their age. For occupation of lead characters, we watched trailers of the top-grossing 30 movies each year, and relied on movie plots as mentioned in Wikipedia.","Nikkei Asia is a decade-old media outlet, operating on a small budget with tight resources. We operate independently of our parent company Nikkei, and do not have access to their resources. We have a rigid CMS that can't accommodate visual storytelling. We do not have an in-house tech team, or developers. 

Our data journalist used R programming. Rvest and RSelenium were used to compile the master database on 1,200 movies.

Most effort was spent on the tool we used to the present our findings. We brought on an external digital storytelling aid called Shorthand. It took us five months to push the company to spring for it -- but it is cost effective, requires no technical knowledge and has allowed us to do more with data visualization. Our 2-person design team took the basic featuers of Shorthand and tried to eke out as much functionality from each as we could. This is significant progress for us and has helped make our work more impactful.

It might not stand up to the big gobal players, but it was momentous for us.","Creating a database from scratch can serve as a higher form of storytelling in and of itself. 

There is no shortcut to arduous, manual work, but the rewards can be immense. 

Our database tells an important gender-based story of the last 20 years, in a country where representation really matters and from an industry that is rather opaque. We have made our database public so other journalists can use it, and we hope to build on it with further reporting of their own.

After the initial verification of the prosecution’s budget, the leading opposition Democratic Party set up a task force to monitor the prosecution’s special activity expenses. The prosecution admitted for the first time that they had abused and misused their budget and took measures to return the misused budget to the national treasury. 

In addition, the National Assembly has reduced the prosecution’s 2024 budget for special activity expenses by 10% to KRW 7.2 billion, and several bills have been proposed to increase the transparency of the prosecution’s execution of special activity expenses. A typical example is the amendment of the National Finance Act, which requires all information on the prosecution’s special activity expenses used in the investigation or trial to be reported to the National Assembly three years after the reason for non-disclosure of the information disappears, such as the end of the investigation.","After democratization in 1987, as military dictatorship disappeared, while the power of military and intelligence agencies such as the National Intelligence Service, Defense Security Command, etc., has weakened, the prosecution of Korea has grown into a powerful authority in the country with its exclusive right to prosecute.

The prosecution of Korea, however, did not disclose information on how they had been spending their budget including special activity expenses on the ground of security and investigation confidentiality. Even the National Assembly, which has the authority to deliberate on the budget, only disclosed the total amount but kept the details secret.

‘This is the most detailed portrait yet of data breaches in Australia’ grew out of a single administrative data request, and developed into an investigation into the soundness of Australia’s data breach notification scheme.","‘See your identity pieced together from stolen data’ saw significant audience interest, with more than 720,000 page views.

""Um divisor de águas sobre a disponibilidade de dados/informações sobre aborto no Brasil"";

Recebemos emails de jornalistas agradecendo nosso esforço em desenvolver o projeto, assim como feedback positivo de especialistas da saúde, pesquisadoras e profissionais multidisciplinares. 

As mensagens reinteram que essa plataforma é bastante completa com dados oficiais de saúde, sobre aborto legal, recomendações mundiais de aborto seguro, atendimentos, número de mortes, perfil das pessoas que abortam, jurídico, legislações e acessos aos direitos reprodutivos na América Latina, além de pesquisas, guias, projetos, artigos, fontes especializadas e organizações que tratam do com dados de acesso direto, facil e atualizada. 

O impacto é direto na promoção do acesso à informação sobre justiça reprodutiva no Brasil, sendo muito útil para jornalistas que cobrem o tema de justiça reprodutiva. Os/as jornalistas junto a sociedade tem o AbortoNoBrasil.Info como uma ferramenta jornalística, que se contrapõe à superficialidade e as campanhas de desinformação vistas frequentemente sobre aborto.","Até o ano de 2023, no Brasil, o aborto não é permitido por vontade da pessoa que engravida. Isso não impede, no entanto, que pessoas abortem. Mas as leva para a clandestinidade, ao risco de criminalização e de procedimentos inseguros. Os dados mostram que o aborto é um problema de saúde pública no país. A criminalização provoca mais internações, mortes e despesas para o sistema público. Há uma ação pautada no Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) que pede a descriminalização do aborto até a 12ª semana de gestação.

Um deles seria os procedimentos de saúde realizados nos hospitais públicos do país (SUS) para casos de abortos (induziduos ou espontâneos, já que a criminalização não permite essa diferenciação na hora do atendimento). Buscamos no Sistema de Informações Hospitalares do SUS (SIH/SUS) do Ministério da Saúde brasileiro dados de Amiu e Curetagem (os dois principais tratamentos disponibilizados atualmente). Com técnica de raspagem de dados coletados do TabNet|DataSUS, apresentamos no abortonobrasil.info dados de procedimentos realizados, mortes e despesas hospitalares por quantidade de atendimentos em cada mês que já foram oficialmente contabilizados e ano. Com a plataforma no ar, nosso raspador coleta toda segunda-feira as informações processadas pelo SUS, atribuída aos respectivos meses de realização. Além desses dados de saúde, também atualizamos o site com dados de justiça (processos criminais por aborto), pesquisas sobre pessoas que abortam, casos de abortos legais, avanços e retrocessos na América Latina, entre outras informações e dados úteis.","No site AbortonoBrasil.info, jornalistas podem acessar um banco de dados completo, atualizado e credível sobre o aborto no Brasil.

Recolectamos la escasa información pública disponible, porque las autoridades venezolanas no publican reportes sanitarios y creamos bases de datos para medir las desigualdades en inmunización. Encontramos una distribución inequitativa de centros de vacunación, con muchos menos centros en áreas rurales y de comunidades indígenas; bajas coberturas vacunales y particularmente menores en zonas más desfavorecidas. 

Cruzamos estos datos con estimaciones de pobreza, y demostramos una relación directa entre la desigualdad propiciada por el gobierno y un impacto más severo en las zonas con más pobreza.","Prodavinci es el único medio venezolano que ha mantenido una línea de investigación dedicada a los problemas de vacunación en Venezuela, fallas estructurales que tienen más de una década, han causado el resurgimiento de enfermedades como el sarampión y difteria en Suramérica, y que se han profundizado desde la pandemia de covid-19.

Estos trabajos se desarrollaron con apoyo del Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting, en el marco de un proyecto enfocado en las desigualdades del sistema de salud venezolano. Ambos fueron replicados por una alianza de medios venezolanos de distintos formatos. El trabajo fue reseñado en medios venezolanos en el extranjero, que incluyeron vacunación entre sus temas de interés al reportar sobre salud en Venezuela.

Además, ambas entradas fueron replicadas por varias sociedades médicas y la Academia Nacional de Medicina, que valoraron el esfuerzo de análisis de datos detrás de estas investigaciones, útiles además en un entorno de opacidad absoluta de la información sanitaria por parte de las autoridades venezolanas. 

Después de la publicación de estos trabajos, las autoridades anunciaron –sin hacer referencia directa a la investigación– un refuerzo de la campaña de vacunación en Venezuela.","Las autoridades venezolanas no reportan datos relacionados con salud desde el año 2015. Ante estas limitaciones, tomamos la poca información disponible para crear nuestras propias bases de datos y analizar las desigualdades en vacunación. 

En el caso de la vacunación contra covid-19, solo estaba disponible la lista de centros designados por las autoridades para estas vacunas. Tomamos esta lista, ubicamos los centros y cruzamos las ubicaciones con los datos demográficos, lo cual nos permitió demostrar que la designación de los centros planteó desigualdades, especialmente en áreas rurales, con comunidades indígenas, y pudimos demostrar que estas desigualdades empeoraron la vulnerabilidad de distintas regiones al covid-19.

En el caso de las inmunizaciones regulares, solo están disponibles los datos de coberturas vacunales que publica la OMS/Unicef anualmente. Tomamos los datos de coberturas municipales y pudimos armar un mapa que señala las zonas en mayor riesgo de resurgimiento de difteria, sarampión y poliomielitis. Las dos primeras enfermedades ya resurgieron en Venezuela en 2016 y 2017 respectivamente, causando el más reciente brote de sarampión en toda Suramérica, una emergencia de salud pública regional, que no fue controlado hasta 2020. La difteria todavía circula en Venezuela, 25 años después de haber sido eliminada.","Nuestras fuentes de datos fueron limitadas: la lista de centros de vacunación covid-19 publicada por el Ministerio de Salud y el reporte WUENIC anual de vacunación global publicado por OMS/Unicef. Pero tomamos otros datos: la proyección de población de Venezuela actualizada al año 2021 ( hecho por la ONU - Venezuela no realiza un censo nacional desde 2011), la división territorial oficial definida por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística y los límites administrativos subnacionales. 

Con estos datos, ubicamos los centros de vacunación covid-19 por parroquia, cruzamos la información poblacional y pudimos identificar las áreas con más centros de vacunación y cuáles tuvieron menos centros para acceder a las vacunas. Nos aliamos con la firma de análisis Anova Policy Research, con ellos cruzamos datos de pobreza multidimensional por parroquias en Venezuela y pudimos comprobar que las zonas más vulnerables a covid-19 (por falta de instalaciones médicas, peores condiciones de vida y saneamiento), también tenían menos centros de vacunación, aumentando el riesgo de estas poblaciones. 

En cuanto a las inmunizaciones regulares, ubicamos en el mapa las coberturas municipales de distintas inmunizaciones (DTP, sarampión y polio) y pudimos identificar las áreas con mayor riesgo y la relación entre este riesgo y la pobreza multidimensional.","El entorno venezolano es uno de los más complejos en términos de periodismo de datos, pues además de un entorno autoritario que viola derechos políticos, también implica una violación permanente del derecho al acceso a la información. Las autoridades venezolanas no reportan datos oficiales de prácticamente ningún área en Venezuela. Esto incluye los boletines epidemiológicos, la información sobre enfermedades que circulan en el país, no tenemos siquiera una lista completa de los hospitales públicos en funcionamiento. 

Esto ha sido un enorme reto e incentivo a la creatividad. Ante la casi absoluta opacidad del gobierno venezolano en el manejo de la pandemia de covid-19 (nunca se publicó siquiera el plan de vacunación oficial), nos encontramos con muchas dificultades para evaluar el programa de vacunación contra covid. 

Sin embargo, las autoridades tenían que publicar la lista de centros para que la población supiera a dónde acudir. Y gracias a esa única lista pudimos demostrar que el plan del gobierno creaba y fomentaba desigualdades.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,,,The true cost of childcare,06/11/2023,"Explainer, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Economy","D3.js, Google Sheets, Svelte","This interactive explained a complicated topic while delivering a personalised experience using a statistical model to show the cost of childcare. It walks the reader through the first few years of their child, visualising the eye-watering costs, explaining the new major expansion of state support and exposing the complexity of government help.

The story enhances the user’s experience by making some of the reader’s personal details an essential part of the storytelling. This information shaped the story to offer a more useful and relevant service and to explain a daunting and overwhelming topic in a more accessible and engaging way.","The Guardian has vastly covered the crisis in early years education in England, so innovating with storytelling was key to produce a strong story that had an impact internally and externally. This innovation had benefits: 

The team went out of its comfort zone in trying to explore new ways of telling personalised stories. As this isn’t a simple calculator but an interactive linear story that is specific to every reader, we had to consider how every iteration of reader response would generate a different narrative thread. Despite the unexpectedly long process, the Guardian has raised the bar for how 'find yourself in the data' stories can be told. 

The combination of visual and interactive elements contributed to a strong engagement rate, above the average of other Guardian’s visual stories. The piece was also very well received internally, being praised by senior management and reporters, including journalists who have covered this field for years, as it made a very complicated topic more accessible and improved engagement.

We also received encouraging comments from experts, who were impressed by how we were able to create a complex statistical model and communicate it in a simple and effective way.","Childcare in England is a huge problem affecting millions of parents struggling to find a place and paying amounts that can surpass housing costs. It is also a significant political topic with the government announcing a controversial major expansion of state support.

This interactive took these policy changes into account and tackled an already very complicated system to create a statistical model which is the core of the interactive to allow personalisation.

The complexity of the benefits system made it even more complicated to offer a personalised experience for low-income families. But we did not exclude them from our reporting and invested resources in providing the best solution possible. Advised by experts, The Guardian got exclusive access to data to create a scenario that represents those on benefits who would also be able to engage with a specific tailored narrative. 

The fact that the early years education has been vastly covered at The Guardian also posed another challenge: finding a new way of telling the story. The innovation came in the storytelling, combining visual and interactive elements to make it personal, which also makes the topic easier to understand and enables us to care for and reach new audiences.","The statistical model was created using Google Sheets as it is easier to share with experts consulted by The Guardian to ensure accuracy of the project. It was a complex model which involved different iterations to find the best way of telling the story and multiple revisions, so sharing the model with Google Sheets also meant that everybody had access to the latest version of the model. 

Although the statistical model was the core of the story, it did not take a relevant position, as its main purpose was to personalise the story for the reader showing the impact on their family budget. 

To build the interactive story, we used the Svelte framework to keep our Javascript code manageable. The charts are also built in Svelte, but using D3.js for things like the axes. This combination of technologies enabled us to have the story, including the charts, change in real-time, as the reader changes the input.

In addition, we also wrote unit tests, to ensure that the logic remained consistent throughout the process of building and iterating on versions of the story.","Innovation in storytelling is an excellent opportunity to revive a topic that has been covered before and to produce a strong piece that is useful for your audience and has an impact among your team. 

Our aim was not to create a calculator - as this is already an existing service - but to use part of this functionality to offer personalisation for the reader and move away from the written-through linear traditional explainers. 

Allowing the user to interact with the story and to introduce their personal details enabled us to deliver a better service, as we were able to show the impact on them - what contributes to the reader’s understanding and caring about the topic. Showing this impact - using visual elements - rather than telling it has a more powerful impact on the reader’s experience than the simple description or exposition of facts. 

This project also involved collaboration between different departments to put together complementary skills. The success of the resulting piece is an excellent combination of data and visual skills with the strong knowledge in the field of reporters. The collaboration went beyond the newsroom and we worked with leading experts to ensure accuracy and to make a contribution to society.",English,https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2023/nov/06/how-much-does-it-cost-for-you-to-raise-a-child,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/08/poorer-families-locked-out-of-big-expansion-in-free-nursery-hours-england,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/04/childcare-sector-england-not-playground-private-equity-experts-say,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/nov/06/staff-exodus-could-hinder-expansion-of-free-childcare-in-england-providers-say,,,,"Carmen Aguilar García, Niels de Hoog, Pablo Gutiérrez, Oliver Barnwell, Ashley Kirk, Alexandra Topping and Claire Yubin Oh","This project was a big collaboration between multiple teams.

It is certainly true that prime numbers are 'Odd' numbers, but excluding 2, because 2 is the only prime number, which is even. At the same time, all odd numbers are not prime numbers. Some theorems to know the prime number or the upcomming prime numbers.","Rule of Method - 1

Multiply all the Consecutive Prime Numbers from the first to the nearest, so far as the prime numbers want to know, but the digits do not include 5 in this multiplication. Remember, the first prime number is 2 digits. As-

2 × 3
2 × 3 × 7
2 × 3 × 7 × 11
2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13
2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17
2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19

Rule of Method - 2

 If we add 1 to the product obtained by taking Rule of Method-1, then it is obtained as a prime number. As-

 2 × 3 = 6 +1 = 7 (prime number)

 In the same way as from Section 1 :-

 42 + 1 = 43 (prime number),
 462 + 1 = 463 (prime number),
 6006 + 1 = 6007 (prime number),
 102102 + 1 = 102103 (prime number),
 1939938 + 1 = 1939939 (prime number)
 ...to be continued...","Rule of Method - 3

Adding 1 to the product by taking Rule of Method-2, if the unit digit of the resulting number is 0, 5 or even, then it will not be a series prime number. Therefore, leaving this type of series will come in the next series, but will not deprive multiplication of any consecutive prime numbers in multiplication of successive prime numbers. As-

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 = 44618574 + 1
 = 44618575 has unit digit 5, so it is a composite number.

 Now since the number obtained from the product and sum is due to the prime number '23', we will decide to use the prime number called '23' for the next step (series), even if the number is 'divisible', not discard it. As-

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 = 1293938646 + 1
 = 1293938647 The prime number is obtained.
 ...to be continued...","Rule of Method - 4

All the product of such series will be a composite number, but by finding the condition quoted in the above mentioned terms, find the 'prime number' by +1 in the product ! As example :-

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31
 = 40112098026 + 1 = 40112098027 Prime No. (PN).

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 37
 = 1484147626962 + 1 = 1484147626963 (PN) 
 
 Rule of Method - 5 (i)

To find out whether a number is a prime number or not, first find the square root of that number. If the square root number obtained is numbered after the decimal, it is not used, but the number that comes before the decimal, by +1 the number that is received, including all the numbers below them. Let's try to divide. Let it be known that even numbers and numbers with 0 and 5 'unit' digits are natural that they will be divisible. Except this, we will try to deduct from all other numbers or numbers, if not divided, then those numbers will be prime. 

...to be continued...","Rule of Method - 5 (ii)

As Square root of 37 = 6.0827625303 Put 6 in it, then do 6 + 1, which is 7. Now they have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, including 7, trying to divide 37 by these digits, which are not cut off from anyone. It is known that 37 is not even even. So rules do not cut 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 to 37, this is also easy to do.

Square root of 123 = 11.0905365064, put 11, then 11 + 1, which is 12. Now they have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, including 12, trying to divide 123 by these digits, which are cut by 3. It is known that 123 is not an even number. So rules do not cut 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 to 123, this is also easy to do.

This article analyzes the data from the 2023 Census in Uruguay and explains it together with three local demographers.","The project was prepared several weeks before the 2023 Census data was released in Uruguay. In fact, the interviews, the texts, and the website were ready a week before the time of publication. As the data came in, it was filled in the journalistic special. This was made public a few minutes after the census data.
 
In this sense, the project innovated, giving relevance to a very relevant dataset for the Uruguayan population, which will define several public policies. The demographers also explained very clearly the reasons why Uruguay has the demonstrated demographic characteristics. It reached a maximum of 35 cumulative views, 32 unique visits and an average engagement of 4 seconds.","The project consisted of preparing a special pre-data collection. One of the challenges was to put together the interviews and thematic sections according to the data that could come out, but also to be flexible enough to reassemble the special according to the data that was made public that day.

At the same time, the journalist in charge was present during the presentation of the data, uploading them as they were presented to achieve the greatest speed of presentation of the data. The use of testimonies from Uruguayan demographers was also an innovation in the coverage of census data, which is often published without explanations from experts.","The data was uploaded manually, because the National Institute of Statistics in Uruguay does not share the data with journalists in a file. Then, as they were revealed, the journalist in charge manually uploaded them to the interactive graphics designed through Flourish and Datawrapper.","The contribution of this project to the journalistic field was, above all, the incorporation of expert testimonies into a dataset that is usually published without explanations of its meaning.

It relies on a range of data provided by a spectrum of official sources such as institutions, research institutes and certified entities: gdp, job rate, welfare, education and cultural levels. Another noteworthy aspect of this project is its longevity and consistency. The analysis has been an ongoing effort for over 30 years, providing an extensive and well-documented archive that tracks the trends and shifts in various provinces.","The project aims not just to report data but to stimulate change and action, to enhance public and political awareness going beyond mere data presentation. Every years the ""Qualità della vita"" results have been cited by the most important national news programs, and by local newspapers interested in the ranking of their city. The results have been also discussed over the years by local councils in major italian cities, such as Milan and Turin, to mark urgent topics and problems to address. 

Plus, this project makes all its findings available in an open-source machine-readable format. This decision empowers other parties that may be interested (such as universities and local admninistrators) to conduct their analyses, extending the project's reach and impact even further. 

Audience engagement is another pillar of this project. By creating avenues for audience interaction, such as live events and social media engagement, the project transcends the traditional boundaries of data journalism, evolving into a dynamic and responsive entity that involves its audience.

The ongoing work of collecting and analyzing updated and often exclusive data persists year-round, including the publication of comprehensive studies on specialized topics on climate change, woman condition, urban ecosystems, generational comparisons, and crime trends. The final aim is to give to our readers and stakeholders a better understanding of the ongoing and future situation through an updated photography of this multifaceted ecosystem as well as trends on a national and local scale.","The project necessitates the utilization of: 


1. Excel and the R programming language are employed for data collection and analysis. 
2. A SQL database is used for data storage. 
3. Figma and Adobe Illustrator are utilized for designing layouts. 
4. Adobe Photoshop for photo editing 
5. PHP is the chosen language for back-end development. 
6. HTML and the Vue.js framework are applied in developing front-end interfaces. 
7. The d3.js library is used for crafting interactive charts.","Over its 30-year span, the project demonstrates the importance of long-term dedication to a subject, highlighting how evolving data can reveal changing trends and contextual depth. By meticulously analyzing over 90 indicators from a variety of sources, it shows the value of comprehensive, diverse data collection, emphasizing the need to look beyond conventional sources to uncover new angles and stories. The project's methodological rigor and consistency are critical for ensuring the credibility and reliability of journalistic work, especially in handling large datasets. Furthermore, the collaboration across different entities not only enhances the quality of investigative reporting but also illustrates the benefits of partnerships in data gathering and validation.",Italian,https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/,https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/udine/,https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/tabelle/,https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/game-classifica.php,,,,"Michela Finizio,

The largely informal economy and underreporting of incidents even in the formal economy mean these figures are underestimates. In this ground report from Delhi and Ahmedabad (Gujarat), I met injured workers and families of those who died in factories to understand the barriers to recovery and redress. Lack of support after accidents, delay in compensation and job loss worry them.","Following the publication of my story, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), India's apex human rights body, issued notices to all the Chief Secretaries, and Principal Secretaries of labour departments of all states and Union Territories to provide details on death and incapacity of workers due to accidents in the factories in their jurisdictions, compensation paid to workers and families, prosecution initiated against owners etc. A notice was also issued to the Secretary, Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment to submit an action taken report on the implementation of the occupational Safety Health and Working Conditions Code and the measures for improving the human rights conditions of the factory workers across the country. (_NHRC press release on the notices issued has been added in project details_)","There is limited data on factory accidents. Although I had submitted a request for data on injuries and fatalities from 2019 to 2022 under the Right to Information Act (RTI), data was shared only for 2019 and 2020 by the union government. There are no new data on the issue since 2020. Limited data were available based on Delhi labour department's RTI responses. Further, accidents in the construction sector, which attracts millions of migrant workers in India, is not accounted for. I was able to access data on Gujarat's construction sector accidents from a labour union activist who had retrieved it for different years based on various RTI's in the state.

United States of America,"The Cicero Independiente, MuckRock",Small,,,‘The Air We Breathe:’ How industry is polluting Cicero’s air,07/11/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment, Economy","Sensor, Drone, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","Poor air quality and pollution has been a persistent problem in Cicero and nearby Little Village for decades, with experts attributing it to Cicero’s century-long history of heavy industry, its residential density and a lack of parks and trees.

In March 2023, the Independiente partnered up with MuckRock to install air quality sensors on volunteers’ homes. These sensors are installed in three locations in Cicero and showed that Cicero’s air quality is markedly worse than places with other bustling industrial corridors in Chicagoland.","Nearly every scientific and health expert we spoke to underscored the sheer amount of air pollution in Cicero and its health effects. Dr. Peter Orris, chief of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois Hospital, said the Koppers plant “would cause me considerable concern and you want to see what they do to clean it up.” Susan Buchanan, an associate professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago’s School of Public Health, said having a series of federal and state air pollution violations like Koppers is “really bad. You can assume the levels that the Illinois EPA sets are not protective of everybody in the community — especially children and pregnant people.” Both the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois asked for our assistance in developing community air quality programs in Cicero, which are now ongoing. More importantly, thousands of community residents wrote to us. One note sticks out: “Like you, I am holding fast. Like you, I don’t scare easy. Like you, I know my rights
both as a journalist and as a member of my community. So I applaud what you are doing.”","Two weeks after our stories were published, Cicero’s town board president, Larry Dominick, publicly criticized the Cicero Independiente’s journalists, calling them “jerks.” He then threatened to bar their reporters from speaking during public meetings, a clear violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution, experts told us. The Chicago Tribune’s editorial board weighed in, applauding our work on “writing environmentally focused stories about rotten-smelling air in Cicero and reporting on what it has found to be the cozy relationship between polluters and public officials. He is free to defend himself, but he should stop threatening or trying to impede independent journalists in a town where transparency has particular importance.”","We obtained hourly and daily data from our three PurpleAir sensors in Cicero and compared those average readings to those in Little Village and less-polluted areas of Chicago. We also applied EPA's calibration formula to
correct the data and took our findings to three air-quality experts to help interpret it. We also shared the data with residents, at an in-person event in Cicero in August. Through a request to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, MuckRock and the Cicero Independiente received Illinois state inventory data from 2012 to 2021, for 141 pollutants released at more than 1,000 facilities in Cook County. After analyzing the amount and types of emissions from Cicero plants, we compared the plant to others nationally using the federal EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory. We pulled 10 years’ worth of data, from 2012 to 2022, for facilities that emit several hazardous or cancer-linked chemicals. We also used the federal EPA’s national air toxics risk assessment based on emissions inventories, AirToxScreen, to identify census tracts in Cicero that face an elevated risk of cancer from benzene and naphthalene. We obtained violation notices through open-records requests from the Illinois EPA and obtained other reported violations and case histories from government agencies.","To gather stories from residents, we also employed a novel engagement strategy: We created a public callout for stories from Cicero residents who live near industrial polluters, using an online form and printed 3-by-5 index cards in both English and Spanish that were distributed to roughly 250 homes. Some of those personal stories have been included in the investigation. As part of this second story, we took our findings to three air-quality experts to help interpret the data and shared that information with local, state and federal officials and representatives of one permitted polluter that ranked the highest, by far: Koppers.",English,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/nov/07/air-we-breathe-cicero-pollution/,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/dec/06/koppers-hazardous-industrial-polluters-cicero/,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/dec/18/cicero-town-president-Independiente-journalist-first-amendment/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-5YrfJ-2qM,,,,"Reporting and writing for “The Air We Breathe” by Richie Requena for the Cicero Independiente, Luis Velazquez of the Cicero Independiente and Derek Kravitz and Dillon Bergin of MuckRock.

The map was made geolocating each address from a study conducted by Pernambuco Institute of Technology. In 2023, two buildings collapsed, killing 20 people. Pointing exactly where these buildings are was an effort to allow people to take action about their living places, pressure the government and avoid more deaths.","In the months after the publication of our story, the state justice coordinated meetings with city halls, banks, contractors and the prosecutor's office to debate a plan to vacate the buildings with higher risk and demolish them. A formal proposal was presented in December, but not yet put in place. In October, Brazilian senators had visited some of those buildings and promised to push the debate to Parlament, but no concrete action was taken.","Since the 1970's, at least 20 “caixão” buildings have fallen down in the state of Pernambuco. All of them are small constructions made of masonry instead of concrete. The name “caixão” is a reference of the word “box” in Portuguese.","We use Tabula to scrap tables from the PDF of the study with the information about more than 5,300 “caixão” buildings in Pernambuco.
We analyze the data collected using Google Sheets.
Then, we geolocate every address using Open Street Map.

These preventable deaths, which occur about 85 times a day, result from a variety of causes, including car crashes, shootings, falls and random accidents.","Our reporting had an impact before we even published our first story, prompting local emergency medical providers to launch pilot blood programs. For more than a year and a half, we had repeated interviews with Dallas Fire-Rescue and MedStar Mobile Healthcare, which provide EMS in Dallas and Fort Worth respectively, as well as leaders who managed our trauma region. We repeatedly posed the question: If blood programs in other parts of Texas, including San Antonio and Austin, were possible, why weren’t they in North Texas? By the time our stories were published, there were plans for pilot programs at both Dallas Fire-Rescue and the North Central Texas Trauma Regional Advisory Council, which supports EMS providers across the region. The Dallas Fire-Rescue medical director specifically told us that we “moved the needle” on this issue for them, as they were hesitant about taking action the first few times we spoke with them. The trauma council’s pilot program was developed during the course of our reporting, which included questions from us about the topic during multiple interviews. 

Privately, our sources have told us that they have shared stories from our series during meetings with high-ranking federal officials and local stakeholders.","Telling this story required developing a deep understanding the nation's fragmented system for caring for injured patients, one that spans different types of health care entities, state and federal regulations and standards of care. The genesis of this project began in the fall of 2019, when Lauren Caruba (then the medical reporter at the San Antonio Express-News) attended a lecture about gun violence at the medical school. The speakers, a group of local trauma surgeons, spoke about how often their patients succumbed to major blood loss and a unique program that sought to prevent these deaths by making blood available on ambulances and helicopters throughout South Texas. Caruba spent months reporting on the program until the COVID-19 pandemic forced her to temporarily sideline the project in February 2020. She resumed reporting during the second half of 2021. When Caruba joined The Dallas Morning News at the start of 2022, she paired up with computational journalist Ari Sen and broadened her scope to include all of Texas and ultimately the entire country. The additional reporting transformed an explanatory local story into a solutions-driven accountability project.","For our project, we built a searchable map using the JavaScript library Deck.GL allowing anyone in the USA to see how far they are from a high-level trauma center. 

We started with data from the American Trauma Society, listing each trauma center and its designation (Level I-V, with I being the highest). We geocoded the trauma center addresses from this data, then used the Routingpy library to access the Mapbox API to draw drive-time areas in 3-minute increments. Once these shapes were drawn, we removed the next smallest area from the center (as if creating a doughnut), until we reached 30 minutes, to avoid overlapping segments.

For users further than 30 minutes from a high-level trauma hospital, we obtained a spatial file of every Census Block and computed the distance from the center of the block to the nearest center. 

To deal with areas in range of multiple trauma centers we developed a custom polygon intersection algorithm with Shapely and GeoPandas that extracts the intersecting isochrone boundaries; combines them into a multi-line shape by merging the overlapping segments; builds new shapes; and associates them with the corresponding information from the original polygons.","We hope other journalists learn the value of working with expert sources, especially medical experts. The project is based on 144 interviews; a review of nearly 300 medical journal articles; dozens of hours embedded with emergency medical providers and trauma center staff; a national review of federal death statistics and trauma center data, in collaboration with medical researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Medical research informed and elevated our findings. 

Specifically our analysis of pre-to-in-hospital deaths was informed by one particular study, “Access Delayed Is Access Denied: Relationship Between Access to Trauma Center Care and Pre-Hospital Death,” which was published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons in 2018. The lead author, UAB trauma physician and researcher Dr. Zain Hashmi, reviewed The News’ methodology and provided input during the course of reporting, allowing us to build on his initial analysis.",English,https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2023/bleeding-out/trauma-deserts-bleeding-to-death-united-states/,https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2023/bleeding-out/methodology-trauma-care-investigation/,https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2023/bleeding-out/san-antonio-texas-blood-program-success/,https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2023/bleeding-out/bleeding-out-map-north-texas-trauma-center/,,,,Lauren Caruba; Ari Sen.,"Lauren Caruba is an investigative reporter for The Dallas Morning News.

Brazil,Aos Fatos,Small,,,Golpeflix,29/03/2023,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Chart, Video, Politics, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Google Sheets, Python, Figma, Radar Aos Fatos","Designed to resemble a streaming app for mobile phones, Golpeflix exposes the falsehoods behind the January 8, 2023 attacks in Brasilia. It mirrors the experience of encountering a compilation of hundreds of videos, audio files, and images illustrating the shift of anti-democratic sentiments from social media to the streets. The digital catalog presents a curated selection from a collection of over 119,000 images, 25,000 audio files, and 321 videos identified by Aos Fatos' disinformation monitoring algorithm. This content, sourced from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Kwai, WhatsApp, and Telegram, offers insight into the authoritarian resentment among Bolsonaro's supporters following his electoral defeat.","Golpeflix was launched im March 2023, serving as a digital memorial that offers audiences the immersive experience of a streaming app user that has only access to authoritarian propaganda. Basically, the same as any social media user held captive by echo chambers for a long period of time. By using this format, we were able to illustrate the overwhelming volume of anti-democratic and extremist content that circulated among insurrectionists and coup supporters.

Golpeflix's database has been used by the Ministry of Justice and the Superior Electoral Court in ongoing investigations. 

It has also been referenced by jurists and researchers as an important source of information about the coup attempt, preventing major actors from deleting the content and evading accountability. It was featured in international events, such as Global Fact in Seoul; Asia Forum, in Taiwan; and Abraji, in Brazil.

In May 2023, Aos Fatos was honored with the DocumentCloud Gateway Grant from MuckRock. We have given over 30 academic research groups and journalists in three continents access to the database to enable more investigations.","For years, Aos Fatos has vigilantly covered the anti-democratic rhetoric espoused by Bolsonaro supporters. Leveraging automation projects such as Radar Aos Fatos – an algorithm designed in 2020 to monitor disinformation campaigns –, our team compiled a vast database of 1.4 million social media posts, a substantial portion tied to extremist propaganda. In 2023, this data proved pivotal, enabling real-time coverage of the January 8 attacks in Brasília.

Aos Fatos' data scientists and OSINT experts immersed themselves in these datasets, revealing, for instance, that the Brasilia riot had been orchestrated on social media since January 3, targeting radicalized groups supporting Bolsonaro. These stories had global repercussions.

Golpeflix, comprising 687 media elements, has been accessible on Aos Fatos' website since March 2023, serving as a memorial against disinformation and authoritarianism. This collection safeguards against arbitrary removal by platforms, holding users, politicians, and institutions accountable for their roles in fueling the January 8 riots.

Launched on the 1964 military coup anniversary, Golpeflix starkly reminds us of how a vocal faction of Brazilians was prompted to attack democracy, fostering a militaristic agenda fueled by digital platforms' leniency towards extremist propaganda.","For data collection, we utilize Aos Fatos' disinformation campaign prediction algorithm, Radar. Developed in Python, it integrates with digital platform APIs such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Through human curation of keywords associated with disinformation-prone topics, Radar captures and ranks potentially misleading posts. These patterns are compiled daily into a database accessible to Aos Fatos' data scientists and journalists. Golpeflix was built upon a foundation of 1.4 million social media and messaging app posts.

To streamline the special project's development processes, Aos Fatos employed tools like Figma for information design and Google Spreadsheets' dynamic tables to synchronize some textual content with the website hosting the special.

Data is also stored on DocumentCloud, granting access to academic researchers and journalist partners of Aos Fatos to the database that underlies the project.","Newsroom managers can learn, if they haven't already, that two stances are crucial:

- Even in the face of financial challenges, investment in long-term coverage translates into impact on the industry and politics, fostering a return of loyal readers. Golpeflix was only made possible through continuous monitoring over nearly two years.
- Ongoing monitoring projects like Aos Fatos' Radar have shifted the landscape of Brazilian journalism. Never before has there been such precise coverage of digital platforms and misinformation flows, and Aos Fatos was a pioneer in this endeavor. However, it's essential to contextualize this wealth of data and invest in creative storytelling.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,,,Voici la recette des films de Noël de Hallmark,11/12/2023,"Explainer, Long-form, Database, Culture","AI/Machine learning, Personalisation, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Python","Made by the dozen every year, the Christmas movies of Hallmark Channel offer a guilty pleasure, despite their formula, clichés and biases. We analyzed 345 synopsis of movies produced over the last ten years to identify the recipe that makes them successful, but also, sometimes, a laughingstock. Then, to make the experience more fun for readers, we used an artificial intelligence tool so they could generate their own Christmas movie synopsis, based on their choices of characters and place, but also on the recipe and the stereotypes of Christmas movies highlighted by our analysis.","From the war in Ukraine to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also public sector strikes in Quebec, the news before the holidays were rather gloomy. This fun Christmas project offered a break to readers. It was also a nice topic to work on, because movies are appreciated by everyone during this period of festivities. Few realize, however, that these movies are produced by the dozen each year. There have been more than 400 Christmas movies over the past 20 years at Hallmark alone. They are based on a formula tainted by stereotypes and biases that leave little room for diversity. This project made it possible to take a critical look at this industry and identify possibilities for change in order to make it more inclusive and representative of today's society. Its light and participatory nature also generated enthusiasm on social networks. Its publication even inspired international media who also developed their own movie synopsis generators.","To our knowledge, there is no database listing all the films produced by Hallmark since the American company launched into television. We therefore had to, firstly, build our own database by tracing the new films broadcast each year since 2013. Then, we collected their synopsis, as well as certain key information on each movie, on the channel's website and on IMDB, a directory on cinema. This data then allowed us to carry out our analysis. Then, we used our conclusions to choose the parameters on which an artificial intelligence tool would be based to generate Christma movie synopsis.","Our Christmas movie synopsis generator is asking readers to choose characters and a location based on the stereotypes found in the 345 Hallmark movie synopsis we have analyzed. Then, we gave OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo tool the following command: ""Write a title and synopsis of a Hallmark Christmas movie of no more than 50 words in French without mistakes"". The images associated with each synopsis were also created by artificial intelligence. Each of the synopsis generated was then stored in our API, allowing us to have a plan B and return one of those synopsis if there was a problem on OpenAI's side. The stereotypes were identified from recurring words found in the synopsis using the Python library NLTK. We also analyzed, from our own compilation of the origins of the actors, the lack of diversity in Hallmark movies (it is also possible to see it in the horizontal scrolling of the posters, in a scrollytelling section of the article on the matter). Our data collection also allowed us, in an additional article, to analyze Canada's contribution to these movies, in terms of filming locations and the origins of the actors, screenwriters and directors.","Over the years, there have been other articles written about Hallmark Christmas movies, but never on our scale or in such thoroughness. Most relied on their observations in general or the analysis of a small sample of movies. However, our analysis of 345 synopsis made it possible to identify solid and unequivocal results. Although the subject may seem light on the surface, the fact remains that the resulting conclusions say a lot about this industry and its lack of originality and diversity. Exposing these biases could help change the formula. Without our data collection, we would never have been able to carry out the analysis behind the project. We often stop at the absence of data, whereas finding ways to build a database often allows us to achieve more than satisfactory results.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/films-noel-television-hallmark-recette-cliches-biais/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/films-noel-television-hallmark-recette-cliches-biais/canada-lieux-tournage-acteurs/,,,,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier et Laurianne Croteau journalistes de données, Sara Barrière-Brunet cheffe de pupitre, Andréa Alvarenga et Louis-Philippe Bouvier designers, André Guimaraes et Mathieu St-Laurent développeurs et Danielle Jazzar réviseure linguistique","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Then, to dissect how the maple industry, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue in Canada, could be affected. Our project thus made it possible to simplify, using available data and illustrations, a subject studied, but still little exposed visually. By showing the potential, but very real, impacts of global warming, this project could then allow readers to realize the urgency of acting to reverse the situation. The good news is that it is still possible to change the course of climate, which is also explained by the experts interviewed for the article.","We used topographic data of the maple tree’s climatic niche from researcher Dan McKenney, based on two global warming models established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. For the first time, these data were cross-referenced with Statistics Canada data on maple taps and sugar bushes, from the Census of Agriculture. Using two existing databases, we were then able to shed new light on the impact of global warming on the maple industry, by clearly exposing the regions which could suffer the greatest impact. Our analysis also allowed us to demonstrate that the majority of regions where maple sugaring has developed over the last 10 years, and which had the greatest increases in the number of taps, would find themselves in uncertain climatic conditions with global warming. Understanding this could allow the industry to adjust in the future, based on efforts to slow, or not, global warming.","We crossed-referenced two existing databases on the impact of global warming on maple and on the Canadian maple production. The analysis was carried out in Python. Our results were then presented on a map of Canada, with the text unfolding in scrollytelling to show the shift in the maple's climatic niche, while explaining the consequences of global warming on maple syrup production. This was a simple and effective way to demonstrate it. We also used illustrations, combined again with scrollytelling, to show the « invisible », which are the metabolism of maples and the flow process activated by periods of freezes and thaws. The combination of illustrations and scrollytelling made it easier for readers to understand a phenomenon that is often overlooked (or poorly understood), in addition to better exposing to readers the potential impacts of global warming. Various graphics also highlighted the importance of the maple industry in Canada.","Over the years, various articles have exposed the impact of global warming on maple syrup production. However, most of them only highlighted the problem, without demonstrating it or quantifying the potential consequences. Our project went further, first by concretely measuring the expected impacts on the industry, region by region. Then, by illustrating the phenomenon, to put images on a reality that is sometimes difficult to grasp. In addition to our main article, and a complementary article on the potential consequences on the American maple industry (also based on our analysis), we have published all the results of our analysis, in data and maps, in methodology so that everyone can consult them and thus further their understanding of the phenomenon.",French and English,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/sirop-erable-rechauffement-climat-niche-production-acericole-cabane-sucre-printemps-seve-quebec/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/sirop-erable-rechauffement-climat-niche-production-acericole-cabane-sucre-printemps-seve-quebec/en/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/sirop-erable-rechauffement-climat-niche-production-acericole-cabane-sucre-printemps-seve-quebec/analyse-rcp8/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/sirop-erable-rechauffement-climat-niche-production-acericole-cabane-sucre-printemps-seve-quebec/etats-unis/,,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier journaliste de données, Isabelle Bouchard analyste de données, Melanie Julien cheffe de pupitre, Francis Lamontagne designer, Charlie Debons illustratrice, André Guimaraes et Mathieu St-Laurent développeurs, Danielle Jazzar réviseure linguistique et Martine Roy coordonnatrice","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Around two cyclists have an accident here every day and the number of accidents is increasing. Based on accident data and discussions with road safety officers, we analysed the city's riskiest spots. We take readers to these critical locations from the perspective of a cyclist and let them explore their own route on an interactive map.","After publication, we received feedback from both readers and other newsrooms. Based on their questions, we discovered that users were very engaged with the article and even made requests for additional features in the tool, for example.
We are aware that the topic represents a major social and political challenge and cannot be changed so easily overnight. Nevertheless, we hope that publications like ours will raise awareness of the problem and that political measures will gradually be taken to improve the safety of all road users.","The two articles are to be understood as a criticism of the city of Zurich and how it deals with bicycle traffic. Despite many announcements to promote and expand cycling, changes are slow to materialise and the network of cycle paths remains a patchwork. The issue is highly politicised in the city and among residents. This is partly because the different road users are often pitted against each other.","The videos were filmed with a GoPro, which was attached to the cyclist's body. The videos and texts in between were integrated using Svelte and JavaScript.
The map was created with MapTiler and MapLibreGLJS. The data was downloaded from an API of the city of Zurich and processed with Python. The data is stored in a CouchDB and is supplied by a NodeJS service.","We tried out different approaches in these two articles, which was instructive and interesting, but very time-consuming. By involving real readers in the form of user tests, we were able to take valuable feedback into account at an early stage. In the future, we want to make sure that we carry out user tests as early as the design/mock-up phase in order to correct any undesirable developments at an even earlier stage.
Regular weekly meetings within the project team were also helpful. These meetings gave the project a certain structure, which motivated the individual members to stay on task and not get too distracted by other things.

•توعية الجمهور بالحقائق والأرقام التي توضح الفجوة بين الجنسين في هذا المجال، والتي قد تكون مجهولة أو مغلوطة لدى البعض.
•تحفيز النقاش والحوار حول العوامل التي تحد من فرص النساء في الحصول على الوظائف العامة، والتي تشمل الأعراف المجتمعية والتمييز الجنسي والحرب والأزمة الاقتصادية.
•تشجيع النساء على المطالبة بحقوقهن ودورهن في المجتمع والحياة العامة، والسعي لتمكينهن وتمثيلهن في الوظائف القيادية والسياسية.
•إلهام صحفيين آخرين لاستخدام صحافة البيانات في تغطية قضايا أخرى تهم المجتمع، واستخدام الأدوات والتقنيات المناسبة لجمع وتحليل وعرض البيانات بشكل مبتكر ومرئي.","السياق الذي يحيط بالمشروع هو سياق صعب ومعقد، يتميز بالتالي:
* •المشهد السياسي: اليمن يعاني من حرب أهلية مستمرة منذ عام 2014، تتخللها تدخلات خارجية وانقسامات داخلية، وتنتج عنها أزمات إنسانية واقتصادية وأمنية خانقة، تؤثر على حرية الصحافة والتعبير، وتعرض الصحفيين للخطر والاضطهاد والاعتقال والقتل.
•قيود الموارد: الصحافة اليمنية تعاني من نقص حاد في الموارد المادية والبشرية والتقنية، بسبب الحصار والانقطاع المتكرر للكهرباء والإنترنت والاتصالات، وضعف البنية التحتية والخدمات الأساسية، وانخفاض القدرة الشرائية للمواطنين، وتراجع الإعلانات والدعم .
•التهديدات القانونية: الصحافة اليمنية تخضع لتنظيم قانوني متشدد ومتخلف، يفرض قيوداً ورقابة على النشر والتوزيع والترخيص، ويجرم الانتقاد والرأي والتحريض والإساءة والتشهير، وينص على عقوبات متنوعة تصل إلى السجن والغرامة والإغلاق والمصادرة، ويتعارض مع المعايير الدولية لحرية الصحافة .
•الوصول إلى البيانات: الصحافة اليمنية تواجه صعوبات كبيرة في الحصول على البيانات والمعلومات الرسمية والموثوقة، بسبب غياب الشفافية والمساءلة والديمقراطية في السلطات الحاكمة، وتضارب وتناقض المصادر والأطراف المتنازعة، وندرة وتهالك الإحصاءات والدراسات والتقارير المتاحة .
•التقنيات المبتكرة: الصحافة اليمنية تسعى إلى استخدام التقنيات المبتكرة في جمع وتحليل وعرض البيانات، مثل البرمجيات والتطبيقات والمنصات والأدوات الرقمية، التي تساعد على تحسين جودة ومصداقية وجاذبية العمل الصحفي، وتوفير الوقت والجهد والتكلفة، وزيادة التفاعل والانتشار والتأثير .","لإعداد التقرير الصحفي الذي تناول موضوع مشاركة النساء في الوظائف العامة في محافظة تعز، استخدمت الأدوات والخطوات التقنية والتقنيات التالية:
•للحصول على البيانات الرسمية والإحصائية عن نسبة النساء في الوظائف العامة، استعنت بمصادر موثوقة في الجهات الرسمية وأيضا تقاير صادرة عن جامعة تعز ومكتب الإحصاء.
• لاستخراج البيانات من ملفات PDF، استخدمت أداة تابولا، وتحليل البيانات استخدمت الاكسل.
•لتصور البيانات وعرضها بشكل مرئي وجذاب، استخدمت أداة Flourish لعرض الاشكال البيانية بطريقة تفاعلية.","هذا المشروع يمكن أن يعلم الصحفيين الآخرين عدة دروس ومهارات في مجال صحافة البيانات، وهي:

•كيفية البحث عن والحصول على البيانات الرسمية والموثوقة من مصادر مختلفة، والتحقق من صحتها ودقتها ومصداقيتها.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,,,Find out where you can afford to buy or rent in Great Britain,21/11/2023,"Explainer, Open data, Map, Economy","D3.js, QGIS, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","The project is both a hard news story revealing Britain’s ‘rental trap’, and an interactive where a reader can input their income data and housing requirements and then be told where they can (or can't) afford to buy or rent in Great Britain. As far as we know, this interactive news story represents the first time that a UK newsroom has attempted to combine detailed localised house price and rent data to come up with a holistic ""affordable housing"" tool for readers.","We had really good feedback from readers and housing specialists alike. The strong engagement time on the piece indicated to us that people were taking the time to explore the interactive tool on the page, to see not only the overarching national picture of the news story but how the housing crisis impacted them individually. We believe it leveraged data to take on a big public interest issue, casting light on an ongoing national debate about housing affordability in the UK, especially with an election upcoming and this being one of the likely key battlegrounds.","Data on UK housing affordability is not as easy to access as it may appear. There is good reliable data on house prices, at a decent level of geographical breakdown, but then if you want to go down to a further geographical level or combine that price data with house rental affordability, that will become a struggle. This is a problem as many members of the public often see areas through the prism of “can’t buy, can rent” - especially in the cities - and so this was the data we wanted to present in the cleanest way possible. We were able to overcome this data problem with the help of housing marketing services company TwentyCi. They gave us a detailed picture of the asking prices in 2,400 British postcode districts in the year to 30 September 2023, and - in consultation with other housing experts - helped us introduce several criteria for inclusion that helped with the robustness of our data. The detailed methodology section outlines this work in more detail.","A key part of this project was combining a lot of different data (localised average earnings, localised rent prices, localised house prices and then a categorisation method to show the affordability of each area based on these three metrics) and presenting them in a meaningful but simple enough way. This meant a lot of different prototypes drawn up in QGIS before the proper development of the piece took place. Google Sheets and R were the main ways with which we wrangled, analysed and shared the data. R (ggplot) and Illustrator were used to produce the static graphics. Meanwhile, QGIS, MapLibre and d3 were the main tools for the interactive graphic.","Don't forget to use third-party companies like Twentici for data sources. While it’s good to always interrogate every source we use, companies like Twentici can prove to be reliable and helpful sources of information as well as patient and helpful collaborators. We were able to verify their data with other experts and other open datasets, proving their use as an information source. 

Also, we found it successful to combine a data-driven news story and a personalised interactive in one page - rather than them being separated. This gives the reader the best of both worlds: we told them why they should care about this topic on a national level, but then revealed how this topic impacted them and their families in a very personal, relevant way.",English,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/ng-interactive/2023/nov/21/find-out-where-you-can-afford-to-buy-or-rent-in-great-britain,,,,,,,"Ashley Kirk, Pamela Duncan, Pablo Gutiérrez and Niels de Hoog","Ashley Kirk: Visuals Editor

A partir dos dados oficiais de exportações e balança comercial do governo federal, o projeto percorreu 7 países para mostrar como na prática os números se transformam em realidade e impactam na vida das pessoas. Com isso, da produção na lavoura até a casa do consumidor final na Europa ou Ásia, o projeto se aprofundou nas relações entre indústria, comércio e consumidores ao redor do planeta.","O projeto foi exibido em dois programas especiais na Rede Bahia, afiliada Globo no Estado e criou uma rede de debates e discussões que não existia. Pelo seu ineditismo, revelou detalhes da produção e do comércio em outros locais, mostrando toda a cadeia produtiva, de sua concepção ao ponto final. Por exemplo: a partir dos dados da exportação de sisal na Bahia, obtidas via Comex Stat, a reportagem visitou a produção do sisal em Valente, cidade do semiárido, mostrou a manufatura do sisal em tapete, viajou com o produto até o vendedor na Alemanha e encerrou essa jornada numa casa em Dorsten, no norte alemão, para mostrar aquele tapete na casa de uma pessoa que fala da qualidade do produto e sua relação com a sustentabilidade.

But the public never knew what happened to most of them until a CBC investigation found out. Our investigation revealed more than 50 officers were repeatedly disciplined by their own departments, and more than 90 per cent of the public's complaints were dismissed.","Over the course of the year-long project, our reporting prompted the civilian board that oversees the police to ask the force for more information about the issues we raised. We received many emails from the public of their experiences with police. Following our coverage two academic researchers from other parts of Canada reached out to me wanting to understand more about our work, as they believed it could set an important precedent. This was the first time detailed data on the disposition of police complaints has been available to the public in our Canadian province. For the benefit of future researchers we made the original raw data available through Google Sheets, and made the code that we used to check our analysis available through Observable Notebook.",In the spring of 2022 we attempted to use freedom of information laws to access data from the police to inform our project. The police denied this request. We went to court and in 2023 won a settlement where the police acknowledged blocking access was wrong. This was an important freedom of information victory in our province.,"We used eleven different freedom of information requests to various police agencies to gather the data and documents on which to base the analysis. One of these requests had to continue on through a court challenge as described above. Then I used Google Sheets for the first analysis, to answer questions such as how many officers were repeat offenders. A data editor checked my work by independently using code which can be found on Observable Notebook.","This project clearly lays out the process police use to investigate complaints against their own officers, which is similar in many areas of Canada and the United States.

However, due to corruption and the lack of adequate mechanisms for storage and traceability, these objects remain for lengthy periods on the premises of the institutions that seized them, exposing them to repeat thefts by traffickers.","CITESRDC director Augustin Ngumbi was relieved of his duties
Director of CITESRDC and former ICCN director of the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation Consmas Wilungula were sanctioned by the United States","Access to data still remains a problem for journalists in the DRC. The state organizations that hold them do not share them. Due to limited resources for journalists, research is not extensive or in-depth. In the DRC, data on environmental crimes is less accessible because their repositories consider it to be kept secret. Officials do not want transparency because some of them are in conflict of interest or have conflicts of interest in these crimes. Due to the lack of computerized databases, data record keeping is done manually. For five months during the course of our #WildEye Eastern Africa investigation, we attempted to acquire data on court cases of wildlife crime in DRC from various authorities, including police, courts, customs services, airports, ICCN and CITES DRC, to no avail.

Pakistan,Soch Videos,Small,,,Pakistani Arms in Ukraine,08/10/2023,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Business, Economy","Animation, AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","For over a year, Pakistani officials have steadfastly denied the existence of Pakistani arms in Ukraine. Nevertheless, our investigation for Soch Videos has exposed their falsehoods, relying solely on publicly available data and not on any anonymous sources. We examined an unprecedented and previously unreported spike in arms exports from Pakistan to the US in late 2022. Additionally, we unveiled two contracts outlining the acquisition of 155mm artillery rounds valued at $364 million from Pakistan by two American private military contractors. Furthermore, we discovered a press release connecting this transaction to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.","Although Soch Videos is a small digital news platform based in Karachi, Pakistan, the story was picked up by the BBC and discussed in mainstream media in India, as well as Pakistan. In Pakistan, the government has recently instituted the Official Army Secrets Act, which is being weaponised to crack down on journalists who are choosing to expose the the state's public lies regarding the military establishment in Pakistan. But by carrying out a complete investigation only through publicly accessible data, we have managed to inspire several journalists across the country to embark on a similar journey thereby limiting risk to themselves and still continuing to work on impactful investigations. Additionally, this story has sparked a national dialogue on the issue of the military establishment's chokehold on Pakistan's democratic processes, it has emboldened its critics and inserted the value of freedom of speech, especially in the context of the upcoming elections. It has also revealed the current caretaker government's inadequacy in maintaining diplomatic integrity. And above all, this story has led to a comprehensive and global collaboration with 35 OSINT researchers and experts from all over the world, in coordination with Bellingcat, under the Global Authentication Project.","Soch Videos is a small news platform in Pakistan, operating under a censorship regime that has continued to stifle dissident voices. After the Army Secrets Act, the media landscape in Pakistan has deteriorated in its ability to provide freedom of expression. This story marks a new chapter in this censorship regime, where the focus moves towards big data and publicly accessible or 'open' sources of information. Our story was also recognised as one of the best investigative reports to have come out of Pakistan in 2023 by the Global Investigative Journalism Network. We are currently working on exapnding the scope of the research and figuring out a way to track down the 'commission' acquired from this deal by military generals on either side of the deal, in a consortium of investigators being coordinated by Bellingcat.","We wrangled through Pakistan's arms export data to find prominent trends and found unprecedented trade with the United States. Between FY04 and FY22, Pakistan’s total arms exports amounted to $423 million. However, between July'22 and June'23, arms exports recorded were over $460 million. This means that Pakistan has exported more arms since the beginning of the war in Ukraine than it had in the 18 years prior to it. Through secondary source reserach, we uncovered compelling evidence that United States is unable to produce 155mm artillery shells in the quantity that Ukraine requires. Through the United States
Federal Procurement Data System, we were able to find contracts awarded to Global Military Products and Northrop Grumman Systems, which we cross-checked with a Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) press release. Then we found the same contracts listed on a public database (usaspending.gov) through which we were able to confirm the status and the terms of the parent contract. Given that Pakistan's government has been publicly denying the shipment of arms to Ukraine, our story sheds light on crucial facts, setting the record straight.","In the current environment of censorship, journalists can discover strategies to persist in groundbreaking investigations. These inquiries have the potential to either substantiate or refute elements of societal narrativization that influence our perceptions of one another. Moreover, it instills hope that technology, in the absence of an 'inside man' or a 'well-placed source,' can still assist in uncovering crucial information. Learning how to trace money, contracts, and other financial instruments often unveils a more significant narrative unfolding behind the scenes and is better discovered with the use of open source tools and databases rather than unreliable, anonymized human sources inside the system. But most importantly, this story is a lesson on democratization of information. This story aims to inspire journalists to recognize the distinctive role we play in shaping narratives. Our responsibility is to enhance access to critical information, and technology can significantly aid us in fulfilling this mission. However, without expanding our skillsets, we run the risk of becoming obsolete in an ever-evolving landscape.",English,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOSCz0qZfr0,https://gijn.org/stories/2023-best-investigative-stories-pakistan/,https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/cyd2em264ypo,https://www.dawn.com/news/1796869,,,,"Story Authors:

Para ello, utilizamos datos a nivel de sección censal, una delimitación geográfica inferior al municipio e incluso al barrio. Además, cruzamos estos datos con los niveles de renta y con el sentido de voto en las elecciones, según el porcentaje de voto a los partidos de izquierda o de derecha. El resultado es un mapa que muestra cómo se reparten las principales comunidades de inmigrantes acompañado de testimonios de los protagonistas y de expertos.","La inmigración y la política migratoria son temas de máxima actualidad en estos tiempos. España es uno de los países donde la población crece desde hace años exclusivamente gracias al saldo migratorio. El auge de partidos de extrema derecha ha avivado el debate sobre la integración de estas personas. Por ello, consideramos importante explorar con datos uno de los aspectos sobre el tema, para conocer cómo viven en nuestro país los inmigrantes y si existen niveles de segregación en algunas zonas.

La principal conclusión es que, a diferencia de lo que sí ocurre en otros países como Estados Unidos, o en algunos barrios de países europeos, España no tiene un problema de segregación de estas comunidades.

En los escasos lugares donde sí se aprecia, observamos que esta segregación responde más a un patrón de rentas bajas que de procedencia de países del extranjero.

El reportaje tuvo muy buena acogida entre los lectores. A pesar de que estaba bajo suscripción, obtuvo más de 50.000 visitas y logró hacer 19 suscripciones, una de las cifras más elevadas del año para un único tema.","Lo más destacado del proyecto a nivel técnico es la forma de visualizar los datos. Es la primera vez que visualizan así estos datos para España. No obstante, hemos seguido el ejemplo, precisamente, de un análisis sobre la segregación en ciudades de Estados Unidos publicado por el New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/07/08/us/census-race-map.html)","Para el procesamiento de los datos se utilizó excel y Python. 

Para poder visualizar la información con puntos en el mapa, en lugar de pintar las áreas, implementamos inicialmente un script en Node.js para transformar ese CSV de origen en otro CSV resultante donde cada línea representa un círculo (con la escala correspondiente) que se pintaría posteriormente en el mapa. En este script, utilizamos la librería Turf.js para obtener una posición aleatoria dentro de un polígono (sección censal).

Este CSV, pasado a JSON y posteriormente a formato MBTILES para subirlo a Mapbox, donde representamos los círculos sobre el mapa.

Con nuestro desarrollo habitual en HTML, CSS y JS implementamos el scrollytelling donde vamos pintando sobre el mapa la información que nos interesa.","Consideramos que es un proyecto del que otros periodistas pueden aprender tanto técnicamente como en lo relativo al enfoque. De hecho, la idea inicial, como se ha comentado, proviene de un mapa con la misma información realizado para Estados Unidos, donde sí hay zonas en las que la segregación es evidente.

Al final, el proyecto parte de una pregunta que pueden hacerse otros periodistas en su país. Si disponen de la información con el nivel de detalle con el que hemos contado, sería viable replicar el trabajo. Por ejemplo, se podría plantear un proyecto más amplio a nivel europeo (donde la información puede estar más accesible y estructurada de forma similar) a partir de nuestra experiencia.

En ese sentido, estamos dispuestos a compartir nuestra experiencia y aprendizajes técnicos alcanzados.

Por primera vez en diez años, tendríamos a nuestra disposición miles de datos nuevos procedentes del Censo 2021 elaborado por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística (el último es el de 2011).

A lo largo del año, en El Confidencial hemos ido desgranando y analizando los nuevos datos publicados y plasmando la información en mapas con gran nivel de detalle.

Destacamos para esta candidatura los 3 temas más originales publicados con estos nuevos datos, sobre educación, estado civil y empleo.","En conjunto, todas las noticias publicadas con información del Censo 2021 (que han sido 6 desde que se publicaron los primeros datos), han sumado más de 375.000 visitas.

A nivel de impacto, hemos sido el medio de España que más publicaciones ha hecho con esta información. Además, en la mayor parte de los casos, hemos publicado nuestros artículos el mismo día en que se publicaban los datos, aplicando gran importancia al concepto de actualidad en el trabajo periodístico con datos, que no suele ser tan habitual, ya que normalmente trabajamos en proyectos a medio o largo plazo.

Desde el propio Instituto Nacional de Estadística, el organismo oficial que elabora el Censo en España, hemos recibido mensajes positivos sobre nuestra cobertura. De hecho, hemos sido el único medio de comunicación llamado a participar en las jornadas organizadas por este organismo precisamente para contar nuestra experiencia como usuarios de los datos del Censo 2021.","Como se ha indicado anteriormente, destaca el hecho de que hacía diez años que no se publicaba esta información, por lo que muchas variables que hasta ahora utilizábamos los periodistas de datos ya iban quedando anticuadas. Es por eso que estas publicaciones eran una fecha señalada para nosotros.

El principal reto ha sido la planificación y la coordinación, ya que nuestra prioridad era publicar la información lo más rápido posible, por ser un tema de actualidad. Sin embargo, hasta el mismo día de la publicación, no sabíamos exactamente cuál era la información que estaría disponible ni en qué formatos. Es por eso que estos trabajos nos han servido para desarrollar diferentes plantillas para ofrecer datos en mapas.

Llevamos trabajando en la planificación de este proyecto desde octubre de 2022, cuando acudimos a las jornadas organizadas por el Instituto Nacional de Estadística sobre el Censo 2021, para entender mejor su elaboración metodológica y las novedades respecto a los anteriores.

De hecho, precisamente el conocimiento de la metodología nos ha hecho entender que no podemos comparar, al nivel de detalle que mostramos en el mapa, los datos de 2021 con los de 2011 o censos anteriores.","Las principales herramientas empleadas han sido excel, python y mapbox.
La información se descargó directamente desde la página web del INE en formato csv o xls. El análisis se realizó en excel y también en python, según los miembros del equipo.
Posteriormente, los datos se han pintado en mapbox.

Además de los datos nuevos ya mencionados, nuestras bases de datos permiten hacer cruces en el mapa, a través de filtros, con otras variables como el nivel de renta o el sentido de voto en las elecciones generales.","Uno de los principales aprendizajes ha sido la planificación. La creación de diferentes plantillas que podemos adaptar según nuestras necesidades ha sido clave para poder publicar esta información de forma clara y en muy poco tiempo.

This transformation, notably affecting green areas, has marginalized a significant portion of the population. The investigation, conducted with open-source tools, maps the locations of Cairo Governorate's parks within the 2018-2021 timeframe. Economic scrutiny relies on 2019/2020 data from the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, depicting urban residents' spending patterns. Published in collaboration with the ""ARIJ"" website, this story highlights the socio-economic consequences of Cairo's urban metamorphosis, advocating for inclusive urban planning principles.","While this topic has been previously covered, the publication date faced challenges due to events in the Gaza Strip. The story received considerable appreciation from various Egyptian urban experts as it was the first to comprehensively address the issue using data issued by the government and open sources. Notable figures such as Omnia Khalil, an urban expert (Here: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/omnia.khalil/posts/pfbid02ud9tpGKbppYRqnXhnHjKsNNLvUoVzaBtocS1fs6XgNmS9SpiEnjB7eWb2AEqoCHyl?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr)), open-source analyst Al Waleed Ahmed (Here: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alkangr/status/1716718624482677098)), and environmental lawyer Ahmed El Saiede (Here: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Els3idi/status/1713615260219814059)) praised the story.

""There is a type of work that requires months of effort because the underlying idea deserves all the dedication and time invested in it, such as investigative journalism. This work heavily relies on open sources. Its results indeed confirm a stark reality, at least in the last five years, which is the shrinking green spaces within Cairo."" - Eman Abdel Fattah, an Egyptian journalist ([Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/emee.press1/posts/pfbid0yz5vrsBoMqvFBcqLnVnBSo5yffB2UMm745y9pNMG8pg7MvJarHnurjudXKw4FETul))

Firstly, despite having data sources, a considerable portion had to be discarded due to concerns about its credibility. This necessitated meticulous scrutiny and validation of information.

Another formidable challenge was the outdated list of gardens and green spaces issued in 2018. Investigating each of the 400-plus sites and scrutinizing riverbank locations(+1200 site were scpared) using a Python scraping program for Google Maps added considerable workload and time to the project.

Government sources posed resistance, impeding our access to crucial information and answers needed for questions arising during data analysis. The lengthy process of obtaining official responses took three months, hampering our workflow.

This endeavor marked our first experience with open-source data, and being a team of two intensified the learning curve. The political landscape surrounding the story added an extra layer of complexity. Navigating through Egypt's current media climate, complicated by press freedom concerns and military involvement in relevant projects, presented unique challenges. Despite these obstacles, our dedication to providing a comprehensive analysis of Cairo's diminishing green spaces kept us resilient and committed to delivering a compelling and accurate narrative.","In developing the investigative story on Cairo's diminishing public spaces, a strategic blend of tools and technologies was pivotal. The story's analytical backbone relied on Excel, where meticulous data analyses were conducted to unveil patterns and insights. The spreadsheet software facilitated comprehensive quantitative examinations, contributing to the in-depth understanding of the evolving landscape.

Python, a versatile programming language, played a dual role in this investigative journey. Initially, it was employed by a programmer for web scraping, leveraging custom scripts to extract location data from Google Maps. This Python-driven process was instrumental in scrutinizing over 1000 sites along the riverbank, providing a granular perspective on the region's geographical shifts.

Geospatial tools were strategically incorporated for mapping and visualization, enabling a spatially enriched narrative. These tools effectively conveyed the distribution and alterations in green spaces across Cairo, offering readers an immersive experience.

The investigative approach necessitated meticulous validation of data sources to ensure credibility, employing various techniques like fact-checking and cross-referencing.

Despite challenges posed by governmental resistance, the integration of Excel for robust data analyses and Python for extensive web scraping fortified the narrative's depth and reliability. This harmonious amalgamation of tools allowed for a nuanced exploration, enriching the storytelling process.","This project offers valuable lessons for journalists in adopting a comprehensive, data-driven, and technologically advanced approach. The utilization of diverse data sources, including government data, open-source information, and independently gathered data, underscores the importance of triangulation for enhanced credibility and depth in reporting. Challenges in data credibility highlight the need for robust validation techniques, emphasizing the role of fact-checking and cross-referencing against multiple sources.

The strategic use of technology, exemplified by Python for web scraping and Excel for data analysis, showcases the efficiency gains and insights achievable through tech integration. This underscores the importance of building technological skills for investigative journalists. Navigating political challenges, such as government resistance, underscores the need for persistence, ethical considerations, and providing a platform for official responses.

The collaborative nature of this project highlights the advantages of teamwork, especially when dealing with extensive datasets and intricate subject matter. Lastly, the incorporation of geospatial tools for mapping and visualization introduces a spatial storytelling dimension, enhancing audience comprehension. Journalists can learn from this project to embrace diverse data sources, employ advanced technological tools, navigate political complexities, and engage in collaborative, spatially informed storytelling for impactful investigative journalism.",Arabic,https://arij.net/investigations/egypt-gardens/,https://khatt30.com/post/%d8%ad%d8%af%d8%a7%d8%a6%d9%82-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%82%d8%a7%d9%87%d8%b1%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%a7%d9%85%d8%a9/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LAW2LS12KoRfRk7Vtms3SQtor2m4470Q/view?usp=drive_link,,,,,"Eman Kamel(Journalists),

وقفنا لنتساءل؛ هل فعلا تعتبر الهجرة من القرى نتيجة حتمية مرتبطة بالجفاف والتغيرات المناخية، أم ترتبط بالسياسة الفلاحية المتبعة؟ ما مصير أولئك الذين ركبوا الأخطار للوصول إلى الوجهة التي يرون فيها نجاتهم سواء كانت بضواحي المدن أو خارج الوطن؟ هل هناك حقوق تم تأمينها للفلاحين الذين تشبثوا بأراضيهم رغم الجفاف والأزمات؟ هل لدينا رؤية واضحة لتدبير الأزمات القادمة؟",هذا المشروع كان له صدى كبير على المستوى الوطني، حيث كان أول عمل صحفي على المستوى الوطني يثير قضية اللجوء المناخي، ويضع الأصبع على حقيقة إشكالية الجفاف التي يعاني منها البلد لأزيد من خمس مواسم متتالية، وقد نال هذا التحقيق جائزة الحسن الثاني للبيئة، فضلا عن اهتمام عشرات الصحفيين بمضمونه والاشتغال على التفاصيل التي كشفها التحقيق، إضافة إلى تحرك المسؤولين وتفاعليهم مع الحقائق التي كشفها العمل الصحفي.,"ولدت حدة الظواهر الطبيعية الشديدة المرتبطة بتغير المناخ، مثل التصحر، وندرة الموارد المائية، وتملح الأراضي الزراعية والفيضانات، من بين أمور أخرى، والتي تضاعف عددها ثلاث مرات خلال الثلاثين سنة الماضية، في كثير من الأحيان عواقب وخيمة على المجتمعات الضعيفة، اضطرت معها إلى اختيار الهجرة كوسيلة للبقاء. كما أن وجود محددات اقتصادية وديموغرافية واجتماعية وسياسية أخرى يجعل تحليل ظاهرة الهجرة العالمية الحالية أكثر تعقيدا وتحديد علاقة السبب والنتيجة بين مطرقة تغير لمناخ وسندان الهجرة، وبناء على الاستطلاع الأولي بدا لنا أن التوغل في أعماق الظاهرة يتسع بشكل متزايد ويطرح إشكالات متشابكة حول الجفاف والقرية والهجرة والفلاح والمدينة والسياسات الفلاحية، لذا كان لزاما وضع فرضيات هي كالتالي:
* نفترض أن السبب الرئيسي للهجرة من القرى هو ندرة المياه نتيجة توالي سنوات الجفاف؛

Focused on adherence to standards set by Dutch Central Bank, the investigation revealed a significant exceeding of the acceptable failure rates. Utilizing a unique dataset compiled over months with ChatGPT-assisted coding, the findings highlighted the impact on residents, especially in smaller towns, and sparked responses from businesses, financial authorities, and politicians, emphasizing the importance of cash access and trust in financial systems.","This investigative report impacted both the public and journalistic communities. By revealing that Geldmaat's ATMs frequently failed to meet the Dutch Central Bank's standards, the project raised public awareness about the reliability of cash access, especially in rural areas. It spurred a societal discourse on the importance of maintaining a cash infrastructure, prompting responses from financial institutions and policy-makers. Notably, the Dutch Ministry of Finance initiated steps to enforce tighter regulations on ATM availability. 

The comprehensive nature of the research, achieved through innovative data collection and ChatGPT-assisted analysis, served as a pioneering example for journalists, showcasing the power of AI-assisted research. Additionally, the collaborative effort between national and regional media outlets demonstrated a successful model for investigative journalism, encouraging similar partnerships in future projects. The widespread coverage and engagement from diverse media, including non-traditional outlets, underscored the project's broad resonance.

There were tv reports in the main news broadcast of the NOS, the Dutch Public News Broadcaster (with over 1,2 million viewers daily) and across 10 regional broadcasters. Additionally, online articles were published on NOS.nl and the outlets of regional broadcasters, where 500.000 people read the articles.","In our investigation into ATM failures, obtaining reliable data was challenging. Our Freedom of Information requests yielded no results, prompting us to create our own dataset. This entailed several months of data collection, culminating in about 10 million rows. Innovative methods like GitHub Actions automated our script execution, enabling hourly runs for precise data. AI was crucial in script development for effective data scraping.

A significant development occurred when we analyzed Geldmaat's location finder service, allowing us to query each of the 3,600+ ATMs individually. This custom script became essential for our comprehensive data gathering.

Additionally, our data collection is ongoing. We continue to monitor whether Geldmaat now meets the set standards, an effort that has already led to a follow-up story. This persistent monitoring underscores our commitment to providing up-to-date information and highlights the evolving nature of our investigative work. The synergy of AI, GitHub Actions, and custom scripting not only helped us navigate initial data acquisition hurdles but also supports our continuous analysis, ensuring our investigation remains relevant and insightful.","In our ATM failure investigation, we combined several advanced techniques for data gathering and analysis. The primary method was web scraping, using custom scripts developed with AI assistance, like ChatGPT. These scripts were designed to query the operational status of over 3,600 ATMs from Geldmaat's location finder service. For automating and scheduling these scripts, we utilized GitHub Actions, enabling hourly data collection to maintain an up-to-date and extensive dataset.

A crucial part of our analysis involved identifying 'solitary' ATMs, which are the only machines within a 5 km radius and are held to stricter standards. To pinpoint these ATMs, we used QGIS, a geographic information system tool, for geospatial analysis. This allowed us to accurately determine the locations of solitary ATMs and analyze their performance against the stricter norms.

This blend of web scraping, AI for scriptwriting, automation with GitHub Actions, and geospatial analysis with QGIS formed the backbone of our project. It not only enabled us to gather a comprehensive dataset but also to conduct a nuanced analysis of ATM reliability, focusing on both densely populated areas and remote locations.","From our project on ATM failures, fellow journalists can derive valuable insights into innovative data gathering techniques. A key learning is the potential of website analysis as a source of data. By examining Geldmaat's location finder service, we turned a seemingly standard feature into a rich data source, highlighting how website analysis can uncover hidden information channels.

Additionally, the use of AI, specifically ChatGPT, in scriptwriting for data scraping, demonstrates how AI tools can assist in handling complex coding tasks. ChatGPT can be particularly helpful in developing scraping scripts, even for those without extensive programming experience, making data collection more accessible.

Furthermore, our project showcases the usefullness of using GitHub Actions to automate scripts. This tool enabled us to run our data collection script hourly, ensuring a consistent and comprehensive dataset. GitHub Actions can be a game-changer for journalists, allowing for the continuous gathering of data without manual intervention and without any cost. 

Overall, our approach emphasizes the importance of creativity and adaptability in investigative journalism. Embracing new technologies like AI and exploring unconventional data sources can significantly enhance the depth and scope of journalistic inquiries.

It was very challenging to get data from government institutions.Data protection laws prevented me from accessing any information for months. Until there was a breakthrough after eight months of searching,. The first migrant I managed to reach initially agreed to talk to us but later declined. So, I had to start all over again with a Ghanaian driver's licence. During the filming, the most difficult part was at the cemetery where migrants were buried. Each grave had a disturbing personal story, like the story of a five-month-old baby who slipped from the mother's hands and drowned during a rescue on the Mediterranean Sea. It was all very difficult to take in. I have done a lot of heartbreaking stories as a journalist, but this documentary was one of a kind.","We made use of a system that records information about every individual, including passport information for travellers passing through Accra's Kotoka International Airport. The Ghana Immigration Office at the airport assisted me in my quest to find the name of the migrant. They tried to discover whether he had recently passed through the airport. I got the Ghanaian driver licence from a collective that keeps objects left behind by migrants in Lampedusa. Fortunately for me, the passport information of the driver's licence holder I was looking for appeared. After that, we obtained the phone numbers he used to register his passport at the Ghana Passport Office using the information on it. That is how I reached out to the immigrant in Germany and met him.","The most important lesson for other journalists is to understand that good journalism comes with hard work and perseverance. It will not always be easy, especially if you want to produce unique, impactful journalism.

According to the National Health Policy 2007 the government bears the responsibility of training and deployment of specialized doctors so that people are treated within their places of residence.

Provision 7.1.4 (vii) of the health policy reads: ‘Every regional referral hospital shall have all kinds of specialized doctors.’ However, so far there are 28 regional referral hospitals in Tanzania that need to be allocated 14 different specialist doctors each as per the health policy.","After the publication of the project in The Guardian-Tanzania on Thursday May 16, 2023 the story sparked a debate on social media.

The project reveals how low-income earning families from the rural parts of the country are forced to cede aside additional budgets on top of treatment costs for accommodation, food and laundry for family caregivers left behind with patients who are hospitalized in the cities of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Dodoma.

Life is costly in the mentioned cities where public and private hospitals are believed to offer the best specialized treatment with the vast number of health professionals.

The debate, however, forced the government to come out with clarification from the Ministry of Health that the government had already designed the so called ‘President Samia Health Super Specialization Programme’ since 2022/23 financial year but faced a shortage of funds and it would have kicked-off the next financial year 2023/24.

The debate was basically referring to the luxurious life of politicians from the ruling party-CCM and government officials such as the use of posh cars that are worth up to USD200, 000 an equivalent of 500million/- Tanzanian Shilling while poor Tanzanians are dying in public hospitals without proper treatments.","On the political landscape, specialized treatment is one of the fundamental responsibilities of the government to be delivered to the people as a basic right as it is stipulated in the 1977 Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.

Article (1) (b) of the mother law states that: ‘The primary objective of the government shall be the welfare of the people.’

However, the National Health Policy 2007 the government bears the responsibility of training and deployment of specialized doctors so that people are treated near their homes.

Provision 7.1.4 (vii) of the health policy reads: ‘Every regional referral hospital shall have all kinds of specialized doctors.’ However, so far there are 28 regional referral hospitals in Tanzania that need to be allocated 14 different specialist doctors each as per the health policy.

This is the opposite when it comes to adopting the constitutional commitment into government’s development plans. For that reason, journalists who go deep into investigating the government's weaknesses in delivering on people centered issues are targeted.

For this project, there was no bitter resistance from government officials. Officials in the Ministry of Health are happy with the project that it brings about changes even in their home towns.","In this project I preferred to use Microsoft Excel in preparation of related charts and graphs. I dedicated my efforts in defining and data interpretation from the Ministry of Health.

I was curious to see my project delivered in terms of written words as my probe has proved that the majority of The Guardian-Tanzania readers prefer simplified information with details.

For this reason, I found no sense in using statistical and analytical tools to examine the data and identify meaningful patterns or trends.

The use of various techniques such as regression analysis, data clustering or machine learning to uncover insights had every possibility of making my project boring instead of being interesting even to non-statisticians and Mathematicians.

The use of charts, graphs and fresh photos in my data-driven projects has been attracting more readers when the stories are posted on the IPPMEDIA’s website the owner of The Guardian-Tanzania and the Kiswahili-led newspaper Nipashe.

Mwanzo Millinga, a Senior Photojournalist in Tanzania with an experience of 27 years in the Media industry once told me that data journalism is about making numbers meaningful to the common people. It is about telling how they matter or are connected to common people’s daily lives.","The project that digs deep into shortfalls coming with the shortage of specialized doctors in Tanzania has a lot of lessons to be learnt by journalists, especially the younger ones.

Through this project young journalists can learn about the importance of data in investigating and reporting on issues that can attract accountability amongst government officials.

After the project was published, debate broke out on social media that forced the Ministry of Health to come out and made a commitment of allocating a budget for training specialized doctors.

On November 29, 2023 Minister for health told the press that the government has in the current fiscal year 2023/24 allocated 9bn/- for health specialists training through the President Samia Health Super Specialization Programme.

Journalists can further learn from the project that data-driven articles can easily be found through reading different reports from the government, non-government organizations, UN Agencies and private entities.

However, journalists can learn that every data-driven project should reflect the reality about commitments made by governments and their authorities through policies, laws and regulations.

Politics, money laundering, human trafficking and various forms of illegal trade survive at the heart of the world's most dangerous migration route.

Migrants from not only Africa, but also from far-off countries in Asia risk their lives with the dream of settling in Europe. Tensions over immigration continue on both sides of the Mediterranean.

What happens remains invisible to the eyes of the common man. This video tries to give viewers an experience of a real-life rescue scene that takes place in deep dark water.","The original video is made with Bengali voice over. Half a million people have watched the video on Facebook and YouTube.

The video also became important for stakeholders in Africa, Asia and Europe. Later, various national media of the country including the leading English media of Bangladesh- The Daily Star, shared this video through their social media.

Deutsche Welle adapted the short version of this video. The video has been translated into various languages including English, German, Arabic, Romanian. In addition to Deutsche Welle TV, the documentary has also aired multiple times on ARD and Phoenix TV.

In addition, the project Infomigrant, a joint project of Italy, France and Germany co-financed by the European Union, has also adapted this video.

Individuals from various countries later informed Deutsche Welle that they were unaware of the perils associated with the route. However, upon viewing this video, they abandoned the idea of immigrating to Europe through this pathway.","Most challenging, however, was how to convey the experiences and emotions of the survivors while preserving their personal privacy. Viewers' comments, many of them could not hold back their tears after watching this video. As a result, many things can be shown without showing the appearance, in this case, this video can be assumed to be successful.

The crew members were always cautious about the rules and laws that the Italian government are trying to impose on them to stop them from going for the mission. This created a tense situation where everyone had to always remain extra careful on how to avoid conflict with the authorities and keep helping the migrants at risk.","Every space is important in a rescue ship. As a result, there was no opportunity to accommodate more than one journalist. As a result, it was not logical to take any cameraperson there. Almost the entire video was shot on a mobile phone.

In the voiceover, more emphasis is placed on the sounds that occur than the words, so the audience can take in the whole feel. Walkie-talkie talk, May Day relay, immigrants' joy, fear, frustration are all tried to be expressed through natural sounds. According to critics, this is what makes this video stand out from many others.","This is a kind of project where you can not preplan a report and excute once on the field. Noone knows, what is going to happen and how the things will unfold. Instant planning and being always ready for a Plan B or sometimes even Plan C, D or E can prove to be handy.

You have only one hand to hold the camera and the other hand is busy trying to keep you on the jumpy boat. At times like this, creativity can be a bit more helpful. You can not record everything you see, you can not risk nor recording anything important.

On the other hand, reporters also have to find the fine balance to show emotion but not to publish everything people say.

A database they helped build provides some astonishing insights.","Our readers' interest in the topic was overwhelming. The so-called “read-through factor”, i.e., which is for us a very important indicator of whether the storytelling and structure worked well, was also exceptionally high. We attribute this to the fact that we managed to pick people up through the highly personalized emotional approach and conveyed the complexity of the data in the visualizations in a way that was easy to understand.","We used encrypted channels to contact mediazona and activists in Russia, some of whom risk their lives to maintain a dataset on fallen Russian soldiers. In many conversations and video calls, they told us what the painstakingly collected data reveals about Putin's invasion of Ukraine, what patterns can be identified - and what would otherwise never become known in the great confusion of war propaganda. 
At regular intervals, they provided us with their updated, huge (Russian) data sets, which we translated, cleaned up, verified, analysed and then visualised at great expense. We also researched some of the anonymous points with the help of Russian local newspapers or social media entries. Our aim was to show that there is a life behind each of the dots. And that there are a hell of a lot of dots. 
Because that's the feeling we had as we rummaged through this terrible data set day after day. And that's exactly what we wanted to convey with the storytelling and visualisation of the story. How many 14,237 dead people are. And how incredibly complex it is to be able to name this number so precisely - knowing that the true figure is probably many times higher.","We decided to let the readers have full control over the visualization of dead soldiers. Thus we applied a direct scrollytelling technique, i.e. the transition animations between different chapters of the story is completely controlled by the user's scroll. As each soldier is represented by a single, individually colored dot, readers are able to follow along their fates.
Technically, this is only possible by calculating do positions on the GPU of the reader's device. In order to achieve a smooth solution, we thus used the regl WebGL library together with Svelte and D3. The code for this project has been open sourced.","There are three things that are very important to us in such stories: the accuracy of the data, technical sophistication and the emotional involvement of the reader. We feel that the latter in particular is often neglected in data stories. This project shows that it is worth appealing not only to the brain but also to the heart of the reader.

According to the country’s education policy of 2014 the government has the responsibility of advocating training and deployment of professional teachers of nine subjects taught in secondary schools.

The subjects are Literature in English, English Language, Civics, Basic Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography and Kiswahili. The shortage is not confined to Civics but also for the other eight mentioned subjects.

The shortage, however, has led to massive failures of students sitting for national examinations across the country.","After the publication of the project in The Guardian-Tanzania on Saturday February 18, 2023 on Monday February 20, 2023 I received a call from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology’s spokesperson questioning me where I got the data I used to develop the project.

The spokesperson admitted that the data I referred to in the project were accurate and valid but was curious to know who shared with me the so-called ‘Teachers Availability in Secondary Schools by Subjects and the Corresponding Performance Report’ I used.

However, the spokesperson argued that the ministry was considering developing a Volunteer Teachers’ Guideline Manual to address the acute shortage of the specialized educators.

He wanted the information that he verbally shared with me about the anticipated volunteer manual to be published as the project had already triggered public panic.

I demanded to be given the document once it is developed so that I can publish an article from it instead of relying on words that I couldn’t trust.

The man meant his words. The manual was developed and he sent it to me on June 19, 2023. I worked on it urgently and the impact story came out on Thursday June 22, 2023.","On the political landscape, quality education is one of the fundamental responsibilities of the government to be delivered to the people as a basic right as it is stipulated in the 1977 Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.

United Kingdom,The Times,Big,,,Autocrats playground: How the UK continues to supply Putin with key exports and acts as a piggy bank for the families of the worlds authoritarian regimes,08/03/2023,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Politics, Economy","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PythonrStudio","After the Russian invasion of Ukraine commenced last year, the British government has made a considerable song and dance about its crackdown on oligarch assets in the UK, and trade with Russia.

Analysis of property registers, trade data, and freedom of information returns shows how many loopholes remain in the system, allowing Russia and other autocratic regimes to continue to benefit from the UK's soaring property market and technical expertise.","The stories within the project have already had a significant impact.

Following our investigation into autocrat property, in which we identified the daughter of the former Angolan president Isobel Dos Santos as owning two London apartments, lawyers investigating her for alleged corruption applied to a UK court to freeze the properties.

Following our pieces showing that British microchips had been found in the gunsight of a Russian tank, and that a FTSE 250 company had been able to export oil sector equipment to Russia, the UK government announced it was introducing a new Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation to tighten up loopholes.

After we exposed that no fines had been issued to property holders who refused to identify themselves according to new transparency rules in May, it appears Companies House redoubled efforts, issuing 120 fines as of December under new powers.","All these stories took considerable legal work to report. In particular, the piece in which which uncovered how Azeri, Kazakh and Angolan autocrats owned properties in the UK faced extensive legal correspondence from British law firm Schillings and Farrers, despite the fact that the material itself was extracted from public registers. 

Managing the legal risks took several months - in one case longer than it took to research and write the article in the first place. 

Our other articles on exports between Russia and the UK also went through extensive legal reviews given the highly complex - and largely untested - nature of the UK’s sanctions laws. 

The political landscape was in part what motivated us to investigate the issue of sanctions compliance. The UK had received praise for its fast implementation of sanctions legislation in the wake of the war in Ukraine, but none had scrutinised how effectively such sanctions had been enforced, with large loopholes still present.","While the data that formed the core of our work on autocratic property ownership was disclosed publicly as part of new transparency reforms it remains difficult to access.

Extracting the full extent of overseas property ownership in the UK meant pairing several non-standard data sources: overseas company ownership from the UK’s corporate register, overseas property ownership from the UK’s Land Registry, OpenSanctions and a “familial links” sanctions database from Ukraine’s sanctions registry. 

We wrote a Python API wrapper for the endpoints of both Companies House and Ukraine’s sanctions database which - paired with a Raspberry PI 4 - was able to extract new entries on both registers as they were added. 

By pairing machine learning fuzzy matching based on the dedupe python library with more conventional algorithms we were able to efficiently find autocrats who had attempted to conceal themselves by changing their names, altering their nationalities or offloading property to their children or spouses.

Through our reporting partner Data Desk, we had access to ImportGenius, a commercial trade database, and used this data to query transactions between Russia and the UK since the Ukraine war began. We then imported the data into R and analysed the data to identify questionable exports.","I think the project shows what a wealth of information on UK property ownership is now available. While the new disclosure data still leaves loopholes which can be used to avoid transparency such as through the use of trusts, it is worth seeing what you can find there.

Except for our use of commercial trade data, all of our tools were either developed in-house or freely available. Our database of nearly 50,000 overseas owners of UK properties currently sits in an easy-to-use Google spreadsheet. 

I also think the project shows how information on trade with Russia is still widely available and could be used by other reporters to find questionable transactions in their own countries.

India,Undark,Small,,,Do women really make up 80% of climate migrants?,14/06/2023,"Investigation, Fact-checking, Environment, Women",Google Sheets,"The figure that women make up 80% of climate migrants is frequently cited by activists, policymakers, and the media. In this essay I unpack that is most likely a dubious statistic with unclear origins.","This story was retweeted by prominent journalists, academics, authors and activitists. I received a response from employees of the UN as well as data experts on how they appreciated the reporting around this statistic that they have suspected to be wrong for a long time now. 

The narrative about climate migration and women is of them as passive agents and the essay unpacks how we might conveniently use data to confirm our biases. 

I received response from journalists as well on how this statistic felt off to them, before but because it had been so widely used by the UN itself, they took it to be true. Having this piecce out acts as a counter to some extent, they said.","The UN in many documents says 80% of women climate migrants are women. This is a widely reproduced statistic but as a climate journalist reporter in the Global South I have noticed that most of the time the ones migrating out are men, while women become heads of households and primary care givers to the young and the elderly. 

When asked by my editors to look for this wave of female migrants, all I could say in response was that this is not what I see on the ground. I nevertheless spent time researching this number in the coming months and speaking to people about it and realised that the research community is aware of the lack of evidence behind this number. 

This statistic also reinforces stereotypes that we have about women being victims and passive actors. More than constraints, I would say that I was able to do the story thanks to the insight and expertise built over years of reporting from across India that allowed me to question this statistic. The data intuitively felt off to me and my ground reporting experience allowed me to strongly push back on the statistic.","I spent several weeks researching, looking for documents, and reaching out to the various UN agencies to get an answer. I was in a position to spot the story due to my location as a Gloabl South climate reporter and years of on ground reporting that I have behind me. In terms of tools, this essay has been a result of simple but old school journalism.","Other journalists can learn to question data on climate reporting and women, even when it is coming from the highest body like the United Nations. Often, we take numbers at face value and repeat them given that the data is so limited. Also, as journalists in the Global South, we have to learn to verify and fact check narratives about our region which might not be true. 

I also think other journalists can learn that data journalism is not about complex numbers but it is about interrogating the data itself, and you can apply the principles of old school reporting to it.",English,https://undark.org/2023/06/14/do-women-really-make-up-80-percent-of-all-climate-migrants/,,,,,,,None,"Disha Shetty is a science journalist who writes mainly on public health, environment, and women.

Algunos volvieron lesionados y con menos dinero del que les prometieron. Otros siguen boxeando con licencias de países ajenos. 

N+ Focus recabó testimonios en tres países, consultó bases de datos y solicitó información pública para mostrar un esquema que lucra con el sueño y la salud de los deportistas, fincado en la normalización de irregularidades, lagunas reglamentarias, descoordinación de autoridades y precarización económica.","El reportaje tiene alrededor de 10 mil visitas en la plataforma Vix. Su publicación a inicios de diciembre mermó el alcance, en comparación con otros trabajos. Sin embargo, la comunidad de deportistas y periodistas especializados lo ha compartido en redes sociales.","Las comisiones de boxeo dependen administrativamente de gobiernos locales y, por tanto, son sujetos obligados por las leyes de Transparencia del país. Pero muy pocas entregaron la información que se les solicitó. Por el contrario, las propias comisiones de boxeo recurren a páginas privadas -BoxRec, principalmente- para determinar cuestiones como la equidad de los rivales en cuanto a experiencia.

Tanto de ellos, como de otros tres, lo confirmamos a través de testimonios de otros boxeadores que coincidieron con ellos y/o con las comisiones de boxeo de sus estados. Solo los dos aceptaron ser entrevistados a cámara. Tras recabar a cámara los testimonios de los boxeadores, se cruzaron con los de autoridades, ex autoridades, entrenadores y mánagers. Además, la Federación Española de Boxeo y el British Boxing Board of Control enviaron información po correo electrónico, mientras que la extinta comisión de Pabellón de Arteaga dijo no contar con archivos. También se solicitó información a todos los municipios de México para obtener el número de comisiones existentes.","La importancia de cruzar testimonios y recurrir a diversas fuentes para verificar información cuando no existen documentos. Al tratarse de un mercado irregular, la ausencia de contratos y en la alteración de pruebas médicas y permisos ocurre frecuentemente con conocimiento pero sin participación activa de los boxeadores.
