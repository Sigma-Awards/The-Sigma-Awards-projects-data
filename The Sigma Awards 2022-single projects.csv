Nigeria,Premium Times,Big,Participant,,SPECIAL REPORT: How lax regulation allows firms ‘manipulate' Nigeria's stock market,06/09/21,"Investigation, Business",Microsoft Excel,"Nigerian regulators appear to aid a trend that is not only eroding the rights of minority shareholders, but increasingly making it possible for insiders to manipulate the market. The story is an expose on how listed firms on the Nigerian Exchange Limited are exploiting a lax rule, largely unknown to the public, to perpetrate share manipulation and related abuses. While the law demands that companies listed on the premium and main boards have at least 20% of their shares held by the public, it surreptitiously provides them an escape clause that enables them to flout the rule.",The report on publication sparked off an immediate reaction from the Nigerian Exchange Limited authority whose spokesperson called Premium Times to see what could be done to prevent the publication from causing panic in the market. The exchange later issued a statement through its public relations agency to deny some of the claims in the reports.,"Documents, statistical data and previous reports were used in the reporting.",The hardest part of the project lies in getting the regulator and chairs of the Senate and House of Representatives committees on the capital market to react.,Journalists need to be bold in challenging authorities and must be undaunted in digging up facts and documents needed in aiding their investigations.,English,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/483251-special-report-how-lax-regulation-allows-firms-manipulate-nigerias-stock-market.html,,,,,,,,Ronald Adamolekun,"Ronald Adamolekun is a financial journalist at Premium Time.

Malaysia,Macaranga Media,Small,Participant,,Forest Management In Peninsular Malaysia - You Decide,11/08/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Quiz/game, Database, Open data, Chart, Map, Environment, Economy","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","This story examines the performance of forest management in Peninsular Malaysia since 2000. In Malaysia, state governments rule over land and forests, and they manage forests via forestry departments. Forest loss to development triggers public outcry but governments often say it’s needed for revenue and the economy. In public discourse, what’s missing is a quantitative and critical assessment of how well (or not) the authorities manage forests. This story does that by analysing 20 years of data extracted from government and independent sources and compare performance under 6 indicators of sustainable management. Readers are prompted to decide which matter most.","Readers actively discussed the findings of the story – on our website itself and on social media. Many of the comments came from veteran loggers, foresters, and environmentalists who had struggled to gather enough data to form a big picture view of forest management that encompasses environment and the economy. Forestry and land-change data in Malaysia is extremely difficult to acquire and clean. Much of the data is kept physically across government agencies, and often data fail to tally between sources. This challenge likely explains why almost all NGOs and media reports focus on piecemeal issues rather than comprehensive nationwide view. The story shares its data publicly, and that has been a boost for journalists, researchers and environmentalists who haven’t been able to get forestry data. For that, this story was featured in a national “Data Journalism Assessment” report. A month after publication, the Peninsular Malaysia Forestry Department invited us into a 2-hour discussion with 15 officers, including the second-most senior officer. They wanted to hear how we acquired and analysed the data; at one point, they wanted to learn how we presented the data even. Forestry departments are often wary of media; this is the first time we have heard of them inviting the media to discuss a story. We view this as an acknowledgement.","A lot of the forestry data were in hardcopy, so I scanned or took photographs of them in government libraries, and extracted data using ExtractTable. Changes in forest reserves were recorded in state gazettes in PDF formats, and I used Google Pinpoint to quickly search through the thousands of PDFs (20 years, 11 states) Data management and simple analyses were done in Excel Maps were done in QGIS or Flourish. The interactive map that shows changes in forest reserve areas across districts across time is a unique contribution to environmental reporting in Malaysia. The Forestry Department itself was impressed and wants to emulate our approach. Satellite data on forest changes were taken from Global Forest Watch Most data were presented in graphs done in Flourish We designed a quiz to engage readers and present the data to them, as a hook to pique their interest. The quiz was done using a Wordpress plugin. The layout of the story was crucial too, and for that we used Elementor Pro and various plugins to experiment and decided on a two-column, visual – text combination.","Amassing, cleaning and analysing the data was tough, but it wasn’t the hardest part of this story. What was most difficult – also most crucial – was strategizing how to tell the story out of the data. Over months, I had collected various datasets that relate to forest management – logging revenue, reserve area, wildlife conflict reports, sustainability measures etc. But I wanted to write a story that helps readers evaluate how their state governments have been managing forests, not a technical report. My challenge was to present the forestry data and policies in a way that would engage the reader enough for them to not just see where management has failed, but also to appreciate that states that have been notorious for deforestation could actually perform quite well in other aspects. To that end, I decided to frame the story as an evaluation of forest management according to standards set by the authorities themselves. Malaysia has a sustainable forest management policy to sustain both ecology and economy, and a goal to keep 50% land forested. I chose 6 quantitative indicators and used the data I analysed to rank the states. Keeping in line with the “evaluation” approach, I piqued readers’ interest at the start with a quiz built on forestry data. As expected, most readers scored badly, and I used the readers’ curiosity for the right answer to lead them on to the rest of the story. At the end, in light of the nuances in forest management, I decided against a Report Card for all states, but rather let the readers answer a poll on how they would like their forests managed. The public poll reveals what people think, and I was surprised that the top choice was to go for certification.","Data isn’t story, and if left alone, data is hardly interesting to anybody but those who were already heavily invested in the topic. When a journalist gives context to a dataset, it becomes a lot more approachable to the general reader. But for issues like forest use, it’s even better if the readers could be engaged on their own presumptions and then showed how their presumptions measure up against data. And in the end, let them decide. This is because forest use isn’t a black and white issue, but rather a decision-making exercise balanced on many different values. It is highly subjective and yet of great public interest and importance. Smart and fair use of data journalism can facilitate sharp and spot-on public discourse. When reporting on a subject that the authorities are sensitive about, like forest use and possible shortcomings in their decades of management, we can benefit by playing the game in their court. Approach the issue by the standards set by the subject or authority in question, then use strong data to show how well (or not) they have met their own standards. Because the standards or criteria were set by them, they cannot question our choice to evaluate them. There will be nuances, and loopholes in the standards, and we can use the data to show these too.",English,https://www.macaranga.org/data-story-peninsular-malaysia-forestry/,https://internews.org/resource/data-journalism-assessment-malaysia/,,,,,,,"Yao-Hua Law, Siew Lyn Wong","Yao-Hua Law is an ecologist turned award-winning science and environment journalist in Malaysia.

Italy,International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA),Small,Shortlist,,The Great Wave,13/09/21,"Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Video, Health","Animation, Personalisation, Scraping, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, R","The Great Wave is a project developed during a year-long data journalism fellowship at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy, a research center that focuses on physics, neuroscience, mathematics and science communication. Its purpose was to think about the pandemic and its effects in a more systematic way, taking a step back from emergency writing to get a broader look at what happened in 2020. We wanted to understand what did we think about the virus, how did we know it, and whether it was the best use of available scientific evidence, especially in the West.","The results of our project were featured in national and local media in Italy, sparking debates around the timing and effectiveness of the country’s pandemic response. Some public health authorities denied our FOIA requests, and the lack of transparency around critical epidemiological data was also one of the most contested issues.","Data visualization was key to our project. We wanted to report the best available evidence we could find sifting through hundreds of papers, and talking to dozens of experts, in a concise and compelling way. At the same time, given the topic we absolutely wanted to avoid compiling a statistical atlas of the pandemic. Working with information designer Federica Fragapane, we designed our visualizations to make numbers as human as possible. Every time we showed individuals, for example, we made them look all different from each other. There are no two identical objects to represent them. For us it was very important to remind readers that we were talking about people and their stories, not abstract figures. This was the principle that led us to design many hand-made visualizations, crafted from scratch instead of using off the shelf tools.","Our goal, especially in the first half of project, was to try to give some dignity and respect to everybody involved. This was a story about people that lost family, friends, loved ones, and we wanted to do all we could to show empathy and compassion, which is especially hard when working with numbers. One such example can be found in the first chapter when we talked about what happened in Bergamo, the most hit Italian area during the first wave. To give readers an idea of the amount of destruction the virus brought, we tracked each of the excess deaths as best as we could, through all available public information. We then built a simulation of their social structure using demographic data to show how many family members were left without their loved ones.","This project taught us that data driven journalism was invaluable in understanding and reporting this pandemic, but also carried the risk of being cold and heartless. We strived for balance between rigor and humanity. Numbers are great for telling some stories, but - like when we talked about mental health - they also can have large limitations. You can't really use data to talk about feelings in a meaningful way, for example, and so we didn't. Sometimes all that's needed is just a voice. Our hope is that those lessons can be of use to other journalists as well.","English, Italian",http://www.grandeonda.it/en/,,,,,,,,Federica Fragapane,"Davide Mancino (1983) lives in Turin, Italy.

Turkey,Journo,Small,Shortlist,,News Deserts Spread in Turkey,24/02/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, News application, Map","Scraping, JQuery, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python","Over the course of two weeks in February 2021, we scraped more than a million news articles from more than 6,500 Turkish news websites in which the names of 973 administrative districts of Turkey appear. With a choropleth map, we revealed which districts have the highest or lowest news coverage per capita, and which districts of Turkey face the risk of emerging ""news deserts."" We also analyzed the authenticity of news content for each district, showing where original reporting is We hope that this research has humbly contributed to a subject area with hardly any data about digital journalism in","Until our study, there was no data about the geographical scope and originality of digital journalism in Turkey. For the first time, we presented the public data-based insights on the issue, showing that news deserts are spreading in certain parts of Turkey —particularly the Inner Aegean, Central Anatolian, and Eastern regions where President Erdogan's ruling Justice and Develıpment Party (AKP) dominates, while original reporting is surprisingly higher in other areas, including the Kurdish-majority Southeast region and in most strongholds of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) across the country.  Perhaps the most striking findings showed that 85% of the news articles published in Turkish digital media are not original reporting but are merely copy-pasted from initial sources (particularly the news agencies). Meanwhile, many provinces that seem like an ""oasis"" in the gross number of news articles are actually ""deserts"" of original journalism. Our results were reported by dozens of news outlets in national and local media. We were interviewed by seven newspapers, five national TV networks, and one national radio channel. The Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) shared our story through its social media accounts and its newsletter. According to our estimates, the project reached more than 13 million people in Turkey through conventional and digital media outlets. We were also hosted at panels to present our findings at physical and online events organized by respected institutions like Columbia University's Global Centers in Istanbul, the European Endowment for Democracy, the International Press Institute, and the Journalists' Association in Ankara. Kizilkaya will also talk about this project at the Data Visualization Society's Outlier Conference in February 2022.","We manually constructed a dataset of more than 6,500 news websites —including almost all national, regional and local outlets in Turkey. We coded a Python script and used jQuery to scrape the articles that these news websites published for two weeks. We then built a knowledge graph to analyze this Turkish-language news content, semantically pinpointing the administrative district names in each article, while also assigning them ""originality scores"" by using a custom algorithm. We computed all results in a custom-designed macro-powered spreadsheet, completing the analysis and data visualization by using Tableau and Datawrapper. As we adhere to the principles of open data, we published the dataset as part of our feature article about this study on our non-profit news website Journo.com.tr in Turkish and in English (see Project Link 3 for the dataset). Several Turkish and international communication academics contacted us to thank us for releasing the dataset and explaining the methodology so that they can replicate or expand this study on Turkish journalism. ","Turkey is a highly challenging country for media outlets. Journalists are being jailed like in China, physically or virtually assaulted like in Russia, and are forced to self-censor like in many Asian and African countries. Independent media outlets are shut down or heavily fined like in Iran, the cronies of the government capture newspapers and TV outlets like in Hungary, and the public broadcaster is under heavy government influence like in Romania and Bulgaria. Independent journalists are labeled as “traitors”, and pro-government media spread fake news like in Serbia, while defamation laws are weaponized by the ruling elite like in Poland. How these challenges affect original reporting in Turkey was a big question mark because there was no extensive study on the subject until we embarked on this route. The hardest part of our project is to come up with a viable method to answer at least a part of this question. After we figured out how we can technically scrape and then semantically analyze so many news articles, the rest was all about succinctly and aesthetically presenting the significant findings related to this Big Data. We narrated our data-based story on these findings and designed social media posts in accordance with the features of the specific audiences and algorithms on various platforms.  ","We believe that this project has humbly contributed to a subject area with hardly any data about digital journalism in Turkey. Our findings should be particularly helpful for those who try to understand the current state of local journalism and original reporting in Turkey amid so many challenges. Journalists can benefit from this study especially by focusing on the geographical discrepancies of original news reporting. In some provinces, we showed that two neighboring districts may be hugely different in this regard. Although they share similar resources and features, one district may have a significantly higher rate of original journalism than its neighbor. As an on-the-field follow-up to this data journalism study, the Journo website sent its reporters to three geographical regions to investigate the reasons behind these discrepancies (see Project Link 4 for these three news articles).   By using this work, Turkish journalists can now microscopically analyze the supply-demand of news reporting on the district level, and use these actionable insights to decide about their newsroom's operations on the ground. Our main map simply shows where newsrooms can invest (for instance, by hiring more local reporters there) because there is an opportunity to satisfy the public demand for original reporting per capita in certain districts. They can also quickly see where competition in local journalism is relatively more intense.  Local journalism is the heart of any democracy. We hope that these findings will also serve the reporters and media executives in their endeavor to inform the public, including the electorate in rural districts, in line with universal standards and rules of high-quality, original journalism.","English, Turkish",https://journo.com.tr/turkey-news-deserts,https://journo.com.tr/haber-colleri,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1UGyBHkpW2PQdIWpqdtTb1P_VzLSz3Q-vFr_6l1ISgzs/edit?usp=sharing,https://journo.com.tr/konu/neden-col-niye-vaha,,,,,"EMRE KIZILKAYA, EMRAH YILMAZ","Emre Kizilkaya worked for Hurriyet newspaper, the flagship outlet of Turkey's largest media corporation, for more than 10 years during which he served as digital coordinator and managing editor.

United Kingdom,Sky News,Big,Participant,,Amazon alert: Crime and destruction in the rainforest,28/09/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Corruption","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio","The story is the result of several months of investigating deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon. It focuses on the areas granted the highest level of protection - where deforestation should be almost impossible - and the political and business forces behind the illegal activity taking place. Data analysis revealed that deforestation in federally protected parts of the Bazilian Amazon is at record levels, and it has accelerated during President Jair Bolsonaro’s government. Using satellite imagery, government databases, and social media, we were able to expose a network of local politicians, their families, and business people responsible for industrial-scale deforestation.","The story required the combination of open-source data analysis and investigative techniques to provide a macro and micro level picture of deforestation as it occurs. This was only possible with the collaboration of colleagues from both our Data and Forensic teams.  Moreover, our ambition to present our findings in an interactive article meant seeking and utilising the technical expertise of developers from the wider company outside of our newsroom. This collaboration - with colleagues inside and outside Sky News - had a lasting impact by not only resulting in a more powerful story which readers engaged with but also by impacting the way the wider Sky News operation approaches journalism.   While it was initially formulated for our digital platform, the story was subsequently adapted for all Sky News outlets and featured on each of them.  There were, therefore, different versions of the story told on social media (Tik Tok, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook), on YouTube, on a podcast and on the Daily Climate Show on Sky News TV.  Adapting the story for each of these platforms increased our audience, reaching at least 150,000 unique viewers, listeners and readers. One of the results of this wide audience was that officials from the UK parliament, who were assessing the UK’s role in deforestation abroad, contacted us in relation to the article. Likewise, praise was received from knowledgeable experts on the topic, including Gustavo Faleiros, founder of InfoAmazonia, a respected local media outlet that investigates environmental crime.","The data analysed came from the real-time deforestation monitoring system DETER of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research, which records deforestation warnings and publishes them regularly under shapefiles. Using R, we ran a statistical analysis to interrogate the data and understand trends and patterns. The analysis revealed that deforestation warnings were at record levels in federal conservation units, the areas with the highest level of protection. It also showed that the area covered by these alerts increased during Bolsonaro’s presidency, and revealed the specific national park where the problem was most severe.  We plotted this data using the geographic information system QGIS. We also combined the deforestation alerts file with shapefiles of the federal protected areas to look into geographical patterns. We then used this information to specify particular plots of land that had been deforested, verifying it through satellite imagery. We cross-referenced these plots with government databases on land ownership and environmental fines to identify individuals involved.  By doing further research on the award of local government contracts and the messaging of local politicians on social media, we were able to build a picture of the individuals and networks who were committing or enabling deforestation in the national park.   To tell the story, we built an immersive narrative using the storytelling tool Shorthand, the mapping platform Mapbox, and the data visualisation tool Flourish. Mapbox gave us flexibility to represent several layers and to activate and deactivate them according to the narrative. We used this map to show general patterns and to place the user in a specific area. The data, in both the map and the charts, is represented with a scrolly-telling technique. This contributes to the immersive narrative and helps to present the information in a more engaging, digestible and communicative way.","This project was the first collaboration between the Data and the Forensic teams and it also involved the skills of other Sky News departments and external teams. Managing the project in an effective way given the different areas of the newsroom involved was one of the biggest challenges. This was particularly difficult given the ambition of publishing the story on several platforms, such as digital mobile and desktop, tv, podcast, and social media, requiring appropriate versions for each format. Strong editorial support was key in overcoming this challenge. In addition to providing the typical overarching strategic guidance regarding the main news lines, this support involved giving the individuals contributing the time to fully explore the story, best using the diverse skills of team members. For example, enabling the time to find the story in the data involved extensive research, and interviews and conversations with experts, to acquire a deep knowledge of Brazilian environmental law and the administrative divisions of the protected areas. This resulted in a story focused on a different aspect than many other stories about deforestation in the Amazon: the destruction of the forest in the federally protected areas and the political and economic drivers - including corruption - behind it. From a technical point of view, this was the first time that either the data or the forensic team had used QGIS software, which was key for our investigation, requiring a steep learning curve. Likewise, we pioneered a new story telling technique within Sky News by experimenting with the visual software Mapbox for the first time in the company. Finally, as with many investigations, the story revealed itself slowly. Understanding which lines of enquiry to pursue, which newly discovered facts were relevant, and when to finish the investigation, were essential in delivering a piece of original investigative","Deforestation in the Amazon is a familiar topic that will no doubt continue to re-occur in news stories. The danger is that as the topic is so well covered, little new can be discovered. Yet the work on this project can show that taking new approaches can breathe fresh insight into this issue. For example, the data team showed that by doing extensive analysis, looking at many variables in the data and combining it with deep research of Brazilian administrative divisions, significant new angles can be revealed. This story is not, therefore, a repetition of many others about deforestation but a new contribution to a topic that deserves repeated coverage given its importance. Appreciating that even small details can tell a larger story in a familiar area is something we as journalists will take into future work.  A second learning involves the collaboration of different types of journalists. While the main news line of the story was based on a data analysis, our efforts did not stop there. The analysis served as a starting point for more traditional investigative journalism, showing not just where and how much deforestation was occurring in national parks, but why.  This approach - viewing data and investigative journalism as close siblings - resulted in a more powerful story with a bigger impact. Finally, another learning was to keep innovating when covering familiar topics. A reasonable editorial question to be asked was whether a UK audience would read another story about the Amazon. Using new and immersive storytelling techniques, that required learning new software, was our way of successfully drawing in viewers and readers.",English,https://news.sky.com/story/amazon-alert-deforestation-warnings-at-record-levels-in-protected-parts-of-brazil-12416814,,,,,,,,"Carmen Aguilar Garcia, Victoria Elms, Kieran Devine, Przemyslaw Pluta, Pippa Oakley, Brian Gillingham, Nathan Griffiths, Larissa Johnsson, Marcia Reverdosa, Matthew Price, Natasha Muktarsingh","Carmen Aguilar is an award-winning journalist, specialised in data journalism.

During this time, I recorded 91 days worth of raw personal datasets and made a series data visulisations from everything I had collected - from how many times I went outside, to how many people I interacted from (both online and in person). The overarching motive was to see how these factors affected my mental and physical welbeing during a time when all other external factors were removed. I knew that this lockdown was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so I wanted to document as much as","While this unnatural environment could have a huge impact on anyone’s mental health, it also seemed like an opportunity to understand how I might take charge of my own wellbeing by understanding what factors within my control make me happy. The power of visualising this data has revealed patterns and trends about myself that I wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t have visualised them how I did. Seeing the patterns emerge I now have a clearer idea of the key things that positively impact my mental wellbeing: regular meditation, time in solitude, and tangible creative projects. Going forward, I have actively sort after these three things to help cope in stressful times. ","Over the 91 days, I used Google Sheets to document a variety of datasets. These include:   The month and year Whether I showered, got dressed, or meditated Type of exercise and distance Online and face-to-face human interaction Mental and physical health  When I started I didn’t know how long the lockdown was going to go on for, so I documented right up until some of the UK rules started to ease. I moved into a house-share 15 days before I stopped collecting data which provided a small control measure.  Near the end of the data collection I started to sketch how I thought visualising it could look. From 91 days combined into one graph, to 3 separate posters depicting the 3 different months. I often sketch first as it gives me the freedom to imagine what is possible without the restrictions and limitations of my computer. It’s instructive to look back after your data-viz is complete to study your  journey and thought process.  After sketches, I used Adobe Illustrator to piece together the project. I didn’t use any data visualisation tools for this data-viz as I didn’t want to limit myself with constraints.  Once I’m happy with my designs, I will typically share them with close colleagues and friends to check if they make sense, are readable from a design and narrative perspective, and that the back end of the data is correct. ","The hardest part of the project, was physically living out the data as I was recording it. Normally, you receive a pre-made data set on something that is fairly removed from your life. This project however, included recording some of the most difficult and intimate moments during a time that was extremely stressful and overwhelming. Physically visualising it was to reveal private habits about one of the toughest historic moments in time to an unknown audience - pretty daunting, but my hope was to inspire others to also consider what coping mechanisms are good for their well-being.  ","My hope is that other journalists and information designers would see this data visualisation and be inspired to consider what coping mechanisms are good for their well-being.

I'm a freelance journalist and filmmaker, so the thing I needed to do the work to the fullest was the financial support. I read about the emergency grant that Internews provided to journalists around the world to work on stories about the pandemic directly I submitted the proposal and then I won the grant. One of the problems in Iraq is the frequent power outages, and consequently, the weakness of the internet and the alternative networks and the internet in general is not as fast as the strong in Iraq, so almost every week I pay alternative expenses for the internet and electricity so that I can complete the video on the mobile phone because the images and clips need to be uploaded and sent, in addition to the expenses I paid to the painter to draw the idea and transportation expenses and some tools for the mobile phone, because my idea is based on animation. On the other hand, verification took me nearly a year to implement the work, because there is a problem in the Arab region in general, which is the lack of statistics for many cases. Because the story depends on the data, so some of the private sources that I contacted in the health departments in Baghdad and Kurdistan, and some of them refused to reveal their names, had to wait, for example, for a month or more, to calculate the full numbers that I needed. But in the end I was able to take information and numbers, and even official bodies in the General Secretariat of the Iraqi Council of Ministers sent me via email statistics I needed that were not published elsewhere.","The journalist's message must reach all audiences, even to the non-Arabic speaking, because technology has made it easier for journalists to make their work in a different and more innovative way. Young people today, and generations younger than 18, also have political and social aspirations and interests, etc., due to this technology, but the journalist must know how to properly communicate the issue they are covering to this generation. The point of my words is that it is possible for journalists to learn from this project that when you think more thus a story will be reaches, and the information, facts and data in a form that has innovation and a different style will attract the attention of many groups of the public, especially young people who have a great ability now to change many situations, starting with social media and to the occurrence of revolutions and demonstrations on the ground. The journalist must have a message and a case, but they must cover the issue in a professional, impartial and objective manner and not impose their opinion on the public, in order to reveal the facts to the people and draw the attention of those in power to adopt more laws and legislation that enhance human dignity and freedoms. Also, the journalists can learn from this project by searching for ideas and issues that are rarely addressed, and when they are addressed, they are not covered in a boring way. Therefore, the journalist must research and delve deeper in order to convey the voice of those who have no voice. In the end, no matter how much we learn from each other, it is important for each journalist to have their own ideas and their own stamp that they want to convey in a different way to the audience.","Arabic, English",https://raseef22.net/article/1082525-iraqs-nursing-sector-and-the-covid19-pandemic,https://n9.cl/djsc4,https://healthjournalism.internews.org/article/iraqi-woman-journalist-highlights-plight-of-nurses-in-documentary/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0QAfWUvY3w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qK-Igr1nTc,,,,"Report, edit (production, draw the data and translation), and idea via mobile phone by Farah Adnan, draw animation by Malath Salam","Farah Adnan, a freelance journalist and filmmaker based in Baghdad.

The investigation found thousands of profiles linked to SEO firms – and hundreds of Swiss businesses that bought fake five star reviews to unlawfully manipulate their reputation and page rank. SRF applied different scraping- and network-analysis-techniques to uncover those networks and used OSINT and classic reporting to investigate businesses and find victims of this fraudulent behaviour. The results show that authorities are not aware of the scale of the problem and Googles algorithms are not doing enough to stop,The investigation lead to regulation activities of Swiss authorities concerning doctors and clinics. Several businesses reacted and deleted their fake reviews. One SEO company closed down.,"To extract the data we distinguished between scraping the reviews of a place and scraping the reviews of a user. To scrape the reviews of a user we built a custom scraper written in Python. We used Selenium, ChromeDriver and a tool called BrowserMob Proxy which allowed us to cache the responses and efficiently extract the data. To scrape all the reviews of a place we used Apify.com, because of its clean proxy army integration, which allowed us to overcome Google's rate limiting and blocking wall. We were able to build a comprehensive user location graph of over 1 Mio. reviews. Initially we scraped all the reviews of a manually compiled list of places and then all reviews of the users behind theses reviews. This process was repeated several times to expand the user-place graph to multiple levels of depth. To find suspicious users we used the method published in this paper https://t.co/hm7XBVTX5l. The analysis involved folding the bipartite user-place graph to obtain a user-user and place-place similarity graph. The folding of the graph was done via adjacency matrix multiplication, which was the computationally most intensive part. We then continued our analysis in Gephi, leveraging the rich collection of graph algorithms available in this great tool. To extract the suspicious users we ran community detection algorithms on the user-user similarity graph. The resulting communities were then analysed manually to distinguish fake cliques from legitimate cliques. Checking the remaining users in these communities manually, we were able to pick up further signals for fake users, such as stock images and spelling mistakes. The Scrollytelling was built with Mapbox, React.js and Javascript.",The difficulty of this project was the development of a functioning snowballing-approach to gather the right data (more signal and less noise) and filter it to differentiate between networks of fake profiles and networks of existing people.,"That it is possible to combine BigTechAccountability and AlgorithmicAccountability with datajournalism techniques to cover different relevant perspectives on a subject and tell in through ways of interactive web apps, video and audio.",German,https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/google-maps-krieg-der-sterne-tausende-fake-rezensionen-bei-google-entdeckt,https://www.srf.ch/falsche-bewertungen-auf-google-schweizer-aerzte-kaufen-fake-bewertungen-auf-google,https://www.srf.ch/news/panorama/google-maps-frisiertes-rating-diese-firmen-kauften-fake-bewertungen,,,,,,"Lukas Frischknecht, Julian Schmidli, Pascal Albisser, Stefanie Hasler, Flurin Maissen","Lukas Frischknecht, data reporter, has a background in data science and robotics.

Ireland,"Noteworthy, The Journal",Small,Participant,,COST OF CARBON: Are companies paying their fair share on emissions?,03/05/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Chart, Map, Environment, Business, Agriculture, Economy","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap","The two-part COST OF CARBON investigation set out to highlight the companies that are the most serious contributors to Ireland’s emissions problem and what is standing in the way of achieving the cuts in emissions required to tackle the climate crisis. The investigation used data to show how, while many companies are becoming more energy efficient in their operations, the absolute, real world emissions in many of our high-emitting sectors are actually increasing, including the dairy and beef processing sectors, data centres and the pharmaceutical industry - all key and expanding sector of the Irish economy. ","This work is groundbreaking as, beyond collating the carbon emissions of hundreds of Irish companies, in an Irish media first, it took a deep dive into the substantial gaps in emissions transparency and where improvements are needed in legislation to ensure that our largest companies are forthcoming with precise data and details on their real world emissions. The series has been well received by researchers, policy experts and activists. The feedback we received from experts in this field showed that our work was important for the academic and research world as the searchable tables compiling the data was innovative and will be valuable in their work. John Sweeney, one of Ireland’s most prominent climate scientists and IPCC author, for example, requested access to our data due to its analytical value. Paul Price, one of Ireland's leading climate researcher, told us that the reporting was ""excellent"" and a first in Ireland. He said that ""given there has been so little detailed work on this, it sets a marker that can be followed up."" Graham Caswell, an expert in carbon pricing also told us that the series ""will have a long and important tail"" and that the searchable tables compiling the data that we found was a ""brilliant"" innovation.   Sustainability expert and lecturer Ali Sheridan - who has worked with IKEA - also commended the team for ""digging into this issue"", especially as ""company carbon disclosures are notoriously hard to find and assess"".  Several politicians have also picked up on the series including Deputy Paul Murphy of People Before Profit and Senator Lynn Boylan of Sinn Fein - the party’s climate spokesperson in the Seanad. ","The in-depth research for this project included sending Freedom of Information and Access to Information on the Environment requests to multiple organisations, collating and analysing years of emissions data, and interviews with scientists, academics, State agencies and campaign groups to piece together the key issues and help explain the key climate issues related to our data findings. As there is no set database for the details that we were looking for, the use of scraping was not an option, except in some specific cases where data was available on a small grouping of companies listed on the Irish EPA's website. For this, I used Octoparse and Web Scraper to scrap the data. I also used Tabula to convert emissions data tables within company reports that were in PDF.  To clean up and analyse the data, I used a combination of Google Sheets, Excel, Open Refine and pivot tables - creating and combining multile speadsheets to create several master databases of all companies for which we collated emissions data.  To visualise and present the data in a more easily digestable format for a general audience, we used Flourish, taking advantage of the detailed searchable table features to present individual companies data in a comparable and interactive fashion. We also used various graphs and tables available in Flourish to present the key findings based on our data analysis in a clear and crisp fashion.       ","The main purpose of this investigation was to find out the companies that are the most serious contributors to Ireland’s emissions problem and what is standing in the way of achieving the cuts in emissions we so badly need. Unfortunately, only a limited number of large publicly listed companies are legally obliged under Irish and EU law to report and publish detailed annual emissions data. Thus, it took months of research, access to information requests, and detailed discussions with public and private entities to get access to the right data, including:  Over a decade of public sector emissions data from Ireland's energy agency Data on Irish companies in the EU emissions trading scheme system Data sent by companies to the Carbon Disclosure Project Voluntary company data in annual sustainability reports Sectoral emissions and energy data from several state agencies  This took months to pull together, especially as many companies used different metrics to calculate emissions and there was no single website to scrap data from. Just to trawl through reports from one company can take hours, pointing to the difficulties for the public to figure out who are the biggest polluters out there. ","This work was innovative and shone a light on an area not touched on before by the media, gathering together years of emissions data from companies in various fields to paint a detailed picture for the first time of how different sectors of the economy are responding to the climate crisis. Company carbon disclosures are notoriously hard to find and assess, and, as there has been so little detailed work on this to date, our work sets a marker for any further media reporting on this subject. Beyond using the data that we compiled in their own work, I think that other journalists can learn from this process in understanding the need to push beyond what information is publicly available on carbon emissions and seek out access to more niche datasets or databases controlled by private entities. I think other media can also learn from this investigation that compromise, understanding and compassion as vimportant attributes to bring forward in investigations. It took a great deal of negotition and discussion to gain access to several private emissions databases used in this report, as well as months of correspondence and meetings with large multinational companies to explain how I intended to use the data, and to also offer them an opportunity to tell their side of the story. This took a lot of time and effort, and lots of back and forth, but paid off greatly, evidenced in the level of emissions data that companies and other private entities released to us for the investigation, in full knowledge that we were going to create our own database and graphics with the data.",English,https://www.noteworthy.ie/proposal/carbon-tax-companies-71-Dec2019,https://www.noteworthy.ie/cost-carbon-pt1-5421175-May2021/,https://www.noteworthy.ie/cost-carbon-pt2-5421615-May2021/,,,,,,Niall Sargent,"Niall Sargent is a multimedia investigative reporter with Noteworthy, a community-led investigative journalism platform with The Journal, where he is focused on issues related to climate change, biodiversity, ecosystem services and food production.

Ana analysis of data shows that they amount of money collected by these non-state actors is $300 million annually. I checked the Lagos State financial statements to asvcertain whether government keeps record of their colections but did not find the record anywhere. I contacted Lagos State Internal Revenue Service and the Lagos State Ministry of Finance but neither could give account of the money. This is the first time anybody could use data to identify financial leakages in Lagos State","The project led to several rebuttals by the Lagos State government and the Lagos Internal Revenue Service. The Lagos State government claims it is now involved in the collection of transport taxes, though there is no evidence that corruption has stopped in the process.   ","I gathered information from local governments in Lagos State and used the information to obtain an average amount collected each day, month and year.  I was able to obtain the number of vehicles, tricycles and motorcycles in Lagos from open source tools and questionnaires obtained from drivers on Lagos roads, and  transport touts.  I then used Canvas for visualisation.","It was very difficult to visit 21 out of 37 local government development areas in Lagos. Secondly, it was also difficult to obtain information from commercial vehicle divers and transport touts themselves. I had to accept to not publish their names before they could give out important information that supported the story. Originally, I went out to seek information on how much these non-state actors collected each year, with the hope that government would have that. But when I could not get it from the government agencies that should have the records, I went through Lagos State's financial statements. Government officials, including one mentioned in the story, wanted to meet me physcically to stop the story but I did not accept to meet him.  It involved some creativity to be able to generate the data myself, after intervewing up to 100 persons for the story. Interviewing those people at bus stops is hard as I was insulted and rebuffed on many occasions. Also, getting the pictures of the perpetrators was really hard. I had to use secret cameras to avoid ""being caught"" by the criminals who could have harmed me.","Journalists cam learn that it is possbible to get original data on any illegal transaction by government. All that is needed is to get micro data from the people involved and extrapolate to a larger population.  Doing this, however, involves skills .  Also, data should not be 100 per cent accurate before they are accepted as correct. The process of gathering data determines whether data is correct or not.

United States,Self-published / CINOA,Small,Participant,,The War on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Extends to Art and Antiquities,02/04/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border, Open data, Fact-checking, Corruption, Money-laundering, Arts, Crime, Terrorism",Google Sheets,"A report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 2020 called for tighter anti-money laundering regulations in the U.S. art market. Certain organizations had been urging Congress to tighten regulations on the antiquities trade; others claimed that the Senate Committee may have received misleading data to support new anti-money laundering policy. The future of the trade will require a better understanding of the art/antiquities market by parties on both sides. This project aims to highlight pertinent factors in the decision making, and the catalysts that promoted this legislative move.","     As a result of this commissioned reporting project, a Belgian art trade organization (CINOA) asked me to spearhead a ""trade position paper"" for them on the same subject as this project. That position paper was subsequently submitted to the U.S. Treasury for review and consideration upon request: https://www.cinoa.org/cinoa/perspectives?action=view&id=OdqQvHwBsdAu8mAXZEx3      The verdict on the extent of new legislation is still to be determined. ","What tools, techniques, etc., were used:      In order to gather information in an industry that is known for implementing a ""handshake"" approach to business, much of the information on the art and antiquities trade gathering was offline and came from primary source interviews.      Other data was gathered from government sources, corroborated in one-on-one interviews, and other papers sourced from think tanks.      Business data from larger businesses was mined from available databases.       Satellite imagery was corroborated where necessary.   How did I use this data:       To examine the information used to promote new anti-money laundering policy with how that information held up to fact checks and historical precedence. ","     The most difficult aspect of this process was remaining the only person in the field/industry/government who did not seem eager to take a side. Not everyone I worked with on this project appreciated my apperant ""neutrality.""       The reason I became interested in the legislation I reported on was because this new financial crime legislation was passed in the United States to target antiquities dealers (and potentially art dealers) before any hard evidence was put forth to support the legislation. Instead, Congress determined that the Treasury would have one year to investigate the extent to which this new legislation should be implemented, even though it had already been passed. Furthermore, much of the data put forth by lobbyists in support of the legislation did not hold up to a fact check, and in other instances of ""evidence"" were nothing more than hyperbole.       I took on this project because there was no available tangible information for the new legislation to be based on. I set out to figure out how promoters of the legislation felt about the antiquities trade and why they wanted it passed. I also set out to record the concerns of a dwindling industry that believed it had been the subject of a witch hunt that has the potential to erase the industry forever. ","     Today, some popular news outlets have taken for granted that the stewardship of cultural property is nothing more than a derivative of colonialism. This could not be further from the truth. While this project outlines a brief history of this misconception, it also illustrates the extent to which scapegoating the trade in antiquities has become gradually normalized. As an industry, the free market stewardship of cultural property has been nearly exterminated. While this paper touches upon some of the ways this is taking place (including the fact that new legislation was implemented without a proper investigation first to justify the scope of said measures), it is primarily an attempt to extract the information that is available for scrutiny, and allow the (presumably) lay reader to determine for themself if the legislation is justified based on the information available alone; or if what is happening to the antiquities trade is a good case study for hyperbole becoming common consensus at the expense of a group of people.",English,https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/document/C4D1FAQHRGlEnQ73KqQ/feedshare-document-pdf-analyzed/0/1619722564253?e=1640120400&v=beta&t=qOhZIV_WApSmBeolLU3B13mkip21XrSYNAG0YI7Dlo0,https://files.constantcontact.com/e2d46e59601/c200e27e-61b6-4b2a-ba2d-baf4de860d9d.pdf,https://files.constantcontact.com/e2d46e59601/45a32416-1d57-49e5-9ac6-0d79ac2b4312.pdf,https://culturalpropertynews.org/trade-delivers-reality-check-to-money-laundering-regulators/,,,,,"Conor Carman, Clinton Howell, Erika Bochereau","Conor Carman is an art world professional by trade who has been researching and writing on the trade for the past year. By relying on his deep industry knowledge to navigate unique subject matter related to arts and antiquities, he is able to report on the complicated related topics. ",

The investigation has residents' witnesses, victims' families were involved, coroner's inquests, Garda responses, FOI requests, Department of Justice responses, management of direct provision center's response.  ","I believe that the story about the death in the direct provision system was entirely untold. Since I came to Ireland, I noticed almost zero coverage on that, the investigation I did took 16 months to do, and it was during the pandemic. So the investigation has data that was never published. The data was taken after four appeals on FOI requests.    The impact is this community became more recognized. Two days after my investigation, the Fiona Fail party had a statement on my report. I have done a lot of stories in my entire life, but I feel that was the most important one since I have broken the norm of not publishing details about suicide in direct provision in Irish media. I had access to publish the story on Euro News as my previous ones on a similar topic (direct provision). But I have approached hard to publish it on the Irish media outlet as it would be more impactable, which I eventually got.  ",I used LexisNexis to collect some data about the number of deaths that occurred in specific years. I collected numbers through the FOI legislation.

It was challenging to reach the victims ' families, but with using social media searching tools, I reached them. It was challenging to convince an Irish media outlet to publish the story as there are editorial rules in many media outlets to not publish on suicide among the immigrant community; I could have published it elsewhere, such as Euronews, but I owned to publish it on Irish media outlet for more impact, and I eventually did and the great thing that this story won Ireland news brands investigative of the year award.","The story had been very well visualised specially through the draws, so I think the draws were used in the right way to explain the words.

It explains in detail persistent nature of poaching of hippopotamuses at Uganda’s Murchison Falls National Park, the drivers of the illegal activity, how they transact the trade in wildlife parts, how the Uganda Wildlife Authority and Uganda Police are struggling to combat poaching. The story also explains the community-wildlife conflict and how the government was failing to adequately address community concerns, examines the solutions and their short comings.","Following the publication, the Uganda Wildlife Authority moved in to compensate victims of hippopotamus attacks and introduced a better rewards programme whereby they are now giving cows instead of goats for people who denounce poaching.",Flourish Studio data tools were used to create interactive visualizations Google documents were especially useful in the drafting and presentation of the article. Local interpreters played invaluable role in identifying and fixing interviews with hostile and often suspicious poachers and traders of game meat. I used mobile phones to take photographs and record audios to avoid hostile response from poachers and community members who were not willing to be photographed or recorded. Data scraping to gain past literature on wildlife trade and Murchison Falls National Park ecosystem.,Tracking poachers and convincing them to accept to be interviewed proved very difficult due to fear of being exposed. The wildlife authority officers were unwilling to share data citing bureaucracy; police kept dodging due to fear of being targeted by poachers through witchcraft.,"It is possible to create interesting stories out of less popular and often neglected topics such as hippopotamus conservation and poaching in remote areas. It is also possible to track and find data that can support news reporting with scientific evidence especially if the data is presented and analyzed in simple and understandable format.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,,America's water crisis,26/02/21,"Investigation, Chart, Map, Environment, Agriculture, Health","D3.js, Node.js","The Guardian reviewed EPA records on 140,000 public water systems across the US and cross-referenced them with demographic data to determine which communities are most exposed to contaminated drinking water. The investigation revealed that water systems serving counties with large Latino communities violate contamination rules at twice the rate of those serving the rest of the country. Low-income and rural counties were also found to be at a higher risk. The data investigation was then followed up by on-the-ground reporting from California’s Central Valley which was identified as a hotspot for nitrate contamination from industrial agriculture.","To our knowledge, our analysis was the first time that the disproportionate impact of drinking water contamination on Latino communities was shown at a national level. The main news article and the dispatch from Central Valley were viewed more than 100,000 times on the Guardian website (this is relatively high for a US story that is not promoted on the Guardian’s UK or international fronts). The main article was also translated into Spanish and published in La Opinión, the largest Spanish-language newspaper in the US. The English language version of the article was republished in Consumer Reports, broadening the audience. On social media, the story was picked up by a range of environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, The Water Desk, and the Environmental Protection Network.","All data analysis was conducted in Node.js. I started from a dataset of violation points by water system, of which there are more than 140,000 in the US. These were not always associated with a county code, so I wrote a script to assign county codes to the unmatched systems, for which only the name of a town/city and state was known. Another important step of the data clean-up was matching specific violation rule codes to broad categories of contaminants. We then investigated numerous possible ways to analyse and present the data – from regression analysis to multivariate maps, exploring a range of possible demographic and socioeconomic factors that might be associated with poor water quality. The final maps were created in D3.js, drawn to a HTML canvas and exported as high-resolution PNGs to be used in a “scrollytelling” interactive, faded in and out with CSS animations.","One of the biggest challenges was to clean the original dataset of 140,000 water systems and create meaningful county-level summary views. I explored countless different ways of slicing and dicing the data before deciding to use the average number of “violation points” by water system in each county as the main metric for the piece. To highlight the prevalence of individual contaminants (eg “nitrates”), I calculated and mapped what share of systems in each county had reported the contaminant in question. Another challenge was to decide which variables and patterns in the data we wanted to explore in depth, as there were numerous possible leads. For example, early research suggested that the smallest water systems violated the rules significantly more often than the largest ones, and we were expecting this to become a major news line. But this angle turned out to be only partially borne out by the data, and we ended up focussing on other patterns (specifically, race and income). I also explored various chart formats that didn’t make it into the final piece, including scatter plots for countless metrics to multivariate maps.","For me, the two most valuable lessons to come out of this project were the following:   It highlighted the fact that extremely important and even shocking stories can hide “in plain sight” within a fully public dataset – such as the EPA’s records of water rule violations – and remain hidden if the data isn’t cleaned, summarised and reworked into a more accessible format   It is worth pulling in as many supplementary datasets and variables as possible, as the strongest patterns aren’t always immediately obvious, and anecdotal evidence, even when it comes from experts, could limit and bias your investigation","English, Spanish",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/26/worst-us-water-systems-latinos-most-exposed,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/28/california-east-orosi-toxic-america-water,https://laopinion.com/2021/02/26/los-latinos-beben-el-agua-de-los-peores-sistemas-de-la-nacion/,,,,,,"Niko Kommenda (data and visual journalism), Emily Holden, Caty Enders and Vivian Ho (reporting), Mark Oliver (editing)","Niko Kommenda conducted all data analysis and created static and animated visualisations.

Separately we had information but there was no common thread, we knew that there was an illicit enrichment but we did not have the information to prove it. With the investigation and joining the loose threads, we were able to make a timeline that allowed us to identify that the divorce of the presidential couple helped both to buy houses and land without obligation and that a lawsuit that was generated against the candidate was not appropriate because it was did after their divorce. In addition, this timeline made us prove that his partner benefited when Paulo Hernández was municipal president.  For three years I personally began to investigate the official, but due to lack of resources I was unable to access information that would give me more understanding, due to the lack of time derived from the daily journalism tasks that I had to do. In 2021 we managed to have two more people in Decisions and that helped us to be able to clearly identify through an alternative job, information that helped us to know more about Paulo Hernández.

I was born in the state capital and at 18 I traveled to Ocotlán to study journalism. Since I started my job as a reporter, I realized the discrimination suffered by people who live in regions outside the capitals. I got to know the periphery of the periphery and I realized that there were good reports and notes but that they did not transcend Guadalajara and therefore the state governments or decentralized entities did not take them into account. To date they continue to make us less. For that reason I decided to stay to report. First at Radio UdeG, then after an incident of insecurity, I decided to work for a local newspaper called Mi Región. Finally, when Marcelo Ramírez Herrera invited me to collaborate on “Decisiones” -a recently created project- I joined as a co-founder. Since January 17, 2015, I have been working as a reporter in this medium in which we seek to write about what other colleagues do not always write. I like to report mainly political and corruption issues, but also environmental issues, gender agenda and diverse community. We seek to be the reporters who ask about minority groups. Currently at 29 years old, I am the general director of Decisions and I work with a small team that learns quickly and that helps me motivate my work. Our reports and notes have helped to generate opinion in the Cienega region and that satisfaction has been very important to me in particular. I see journalism as a way to empower people and more to new generations, which makes me very proud. I have some personal aspirations that I will surely carry out in later years that have to do with academic research, but for now journalism is still my world.

Many readers have and colleagues spoke of the tremendous change of view of these workers and their lives and how they are treated. After the report was published in Zenith magazine in German, it gained wide traction in the German speaking world since it touches on a very mysterious world. The report also shed light on the COVID-19 risks for the morgue workers and stressed the need for them to get the required PPE. The investigative report had a great role in reconsidering the aid and the foreign grants that the forensic department in Egypt gets. “Forensic doctors leave Egypt mainly in search for better financial offers. They are usually offered salaries that are 10 times higher than what they get at home, in addition to the modern equipment they can find in other countries. ","The report was produced using cross media and included photographic pictures, illustrations and animations that documented the lives of the morgue workers and photocopies of some of their documents.

Some of the people we talked to were already infected with highly infective diseases so I had to take extra precautions while interviewing them. The third challenge was extracting official information and numbers from official institutions in the country, since officials don’t really talk to the media and some of the institutions involved in the forensic work hide information about their workers. After many months of attempts I managed to convince the people I interviewed to get to talk to me and open up about their secret careers, which was the key to write the first investigative report about the morgues in Arabic.","Believing in the idea and insisting on getting it to fruition no matter what.

We were interviewed on TV shows and invited to some universities to talk about it. For the first time, the business chambers spoke about the water consumption of these industries. For the public, it was shocking to know the amount of water used to make a bottle of Coca Cola, there was a wide discussion on social networks on the subject. Activists used the information to create campaigns to promote the sustainable use of water","Tools for scraping, parsing and processing data:   Python   Pandas   BeautifulSoup4   NumPy   Selenium   MongoEngine     MongoDB   Tools used on the website   Aqueduct: https://www.wri.org/aqueduct via query parameters in an iframe.   Angular   Mapbox.js   RxJs   NgRx   Kubernetes   First, we had to crawl the whole database contained in https://www.wri.org/aqueduct as the online explorer at the time wasn't usable for research work. The website had 2 components, a registry of all the concessions that matched a query and the details page for each concession id. The first was a ASP.Net website with a secured REST API that we couldn't use outside the browser. We wrote a crawler using automated chrome instances via selenium to interact with the ASP.Net query component and collect the Ids of each concession. As the website crashed and hanged pretty often, we decided to use MongoDB as our crawler's database engine and rewrited the script so it could run on multiple threads and recover from the website constantly crashing while avoiding duplicated or missing data. Luckily the details page worked via path query parameters. Once we collected all the Ids, we were able to use a much simpler python script using requests, b4s and pandas to collect and process the details of each concession. With MongoDB, we were able to easily query and extract subsets of data which were used for research by our journalist team. The website was built on Angular v11. We exported the final dataset as json and used NgRx as a state manager for the data explorer. Using RxJs, we built a reactive dashboard that filters the data and shows the concession details, the associated brand, geographical position on a mapbox.js map and the water stress level of the region with WRI's aqueduct platform. Currently the website runs containerized on a K3s Kubernetes cluster for high availability.","Companies use different social reasons to request water concessions, so once the database was extracted we had to review the hundreds of thousands of permits, one by one to verify their business line, since not all of them have permits for industry. So we had to resort to public trade records to identify them and in some cases we called by phone to ask directly what brand they belong to. The database provided by the National Water Commission is not entirely transparent, so we hope that this database will help citizens to locate these companies.","That official information, even if it is public, has a hidden layer that must be explored and that from it, stories of impact can be told","English, Spanish",https://pozoschatarra.poplab.mx/,https://pozoschatarra.poplab.mx/explorer,https://docs.google.com/document/d/11HNSCgeNE6lKPBfE8wi7b5ZUQsfYPfIh9GXVqa1yiJo/edit,,,,,,"Kennia Velázquez, Alonso Merino, Arnoldo Cuéllar, Einnar Espinosa, Emilio Jiménez, Juan Jose Plascencia, Nicolas Aranda, Miguel Cabrera","The project was carried out by the Laboratory of Journalism and Public Opinion, a media outlet in Guanajuato, Mexico, which was formed in March 2019, made up of 12 people: long-term journalists, other young people in training, and a production team. visual and web development.

The report exposed how corrupt government officials at Federal Marriage Registry, Ikoyi, Nigeria’s prominent marriage registry, divert millions of naira (Nigeria’s currency) into their personal bank accounts through illegal, extortive practices. It details how the corrupt officials of the registry bypassed the online portal meant for the marriage registration process with the aim of extorting prospective couples by charging above the official rate and forcing them to pay bribes to fast-track the wedding processes.","After the publication of the investigation, the story sparked an outcry from the Nigerian public on social media, who shared their experiences of official bribery and extortion at the same registry. The victims narrated how they were frustrated and made to part with more money after their marriage certificates were withheld. A few days after the publication of the story, the registry stopped physical registration for marriage applications, citing orders from the management. Applicants were referred to the online registration portal that was initially sabotaged to pave way for systemic corruption. As a result of the story, applicants now register for marriage certificates on the portal from the comfort of their homes, pay government-approved fees and avoid physical contact with the registry officials.",I used a mobile app called background camera while at the agency to uncover the corruption being perpetrated by public officials.

At the time of the report, killings were rife in South Eastern Nigeria and also being exposed to wanting to reveal a government corruption left the team at mercy of the unknown. At various occasions we were unsure of our safety but the need to gather the data propelled the report.  The report played the role of exposing abandoned projects, non-existent projects and underutilization of funds despite monies released already.  It at same time played the role of exposing contract irregularities, showing that companies that shouldnt get contract got it.  This was not just exposing corruption but informing people and the media about using data to expose corrupt deeds while also setting reportorial standards on use of data journalism for societal good.",Other  journalists can learn the art of leveraging on existing data pool to expose corruption.

The project against femicide is extremely important for the future of women's rights in Russia. Although several dozen articles appear annually mentioning femicid.net, the project received the first real professional recognition from foreign human rights defenders and from the UN (even the leading anti-xenophobic organization in Russia does not think that femicide can be calculated and does not support us in the form of recognizing the importance of of our work).

The work of journalists is key to solving social problems. 5.

However, it is at the local level that people can change Russia. 100–150 votes are enough to become a deputy in most districts. However, data about local elections are difficult to find and analyze. We mapped all 19k+ districts on one map and created landing page for each. Now it is easy to find out where the elections are taking place, what is the turnout, who are the deputies there now, who they are, how many votes were enough to win. Anyone can find the candidates for the next elections.","The project has focused massive attention on local elections in Russia, which has never happened before. He was widely quoted by federal and regional media. More than 300 thousand visitors, thousands of reposts. More than 80 thousand people watched the video with information about the project (proportion of likes — 10%). The main article about the project were published in a newspaper with a circulation of 100,000 copies. Ekaterina Shulman, one of the most famous and prominent independent educators of the country, spoke in detail about the project for an audience of thousands.","We gathered all the data from the Central Election Committee website using complicated parsers due to barriers that include obfuscation, captcha, ban based on IP and so on. Data was kinda dirty and we built an automated system to clean and organize it. For that, we used Python scripts. Backend is based on PostgreSQL and Django. We refreshed all data (more than 90k pages) in one week. Map data we collect from openstreetmap.org and it's also an automated weekly process. To build an interactive map with more than 20k polygons and 3 levels of borders we used sophisticated technique based on Leaflet.js and cache from Cloudflare. The solution is extremely cheap and could withstand a heavy load.","1. The hardest part is the elegance of the concept. We cannot parse tens of thousands of websites of local districts to understand who are the deputies there.

One story is about serial candidates running in many elections on the same day. Some do it 40 or more elections at a time. Moreover, different regions are divided between different parties. This is necessary for fictitious competition for candidates from the ruling party, who almost always win. 3. We also found and wrote about the dominance of the ruling party's candidates in local elections, about the fact that Siberia and the Far East are the most oppositional. About the fact that there are almost no women among the deputies in the Caucasus. 4. It's very easy for journalists to download cleaned and updated data to learn everything about local elections. 5.

The petroleum bill proposed and in the process of implementation will provide a remedy to the issues surrounding oil revenue and its corporation in Nigeria.  The project put in a voice for the full passage of the bill which has passed through various hearings at the national assemble.,"I used statistical tools and other online tools.

Also, I made some projected estimates by using the average cost of crude oil per barrel to find the estimated amount of revenue generated. This was arrived at by multiplying the price by output.","The hardest part of this project was arriving at the estimated revenue generated from the sales of crude oil by the Nigerian government.

Spain,"Civio (main publishing org), El Confidencial, DW Deutsche Welle, VoxEurop, H-Alter, etc.",Small,Participant,,Mental health access in Europe,09/03/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Infographics, Health, Human rights","D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","A 17-month investigation coordinated by Civio has led to the first in-depth journalistic publication on mental health access in Europe. We have investigated whether the public systems of each country provide this care, the cost for the patient of accessing through the private system, the effects of confinement for many of them, the violation of rights in psychiatric centers and the use (and abuse) of psychotropic drugs. A complete landscape that, in the absence of reliable official data, led us to create our own repository from scratch covering 28 countries, asking national governments, associations and patients in each of them.","In theory, every European country has access to mental health services for its citizens. However, reality says otherwise. This investigation results in a series of three in-depth articles that enlightens the current situation. First, not all countries of the European Union grant access to mental health professionals in the national health system. But even countries that on paper do cover it have important gaps. The main piece, 'Pay up or put it off: how Europe treats depression and anxiety' shows that, although all countries claim to cover access to mental health in their public health system, the reality is very different. The existence of copayment, long waiting lists, a shortage of public psychologists or a limited number of consultations pushes patients to private care, if they can afford the prices -revealed for the first time in this investigation.  We complete the coverage with a revision of the status of the model that ended the old psychiatric internships and discovered that there are still serious human rights violations in some countries in these dependencies. We performed an analysis of the abuse of psychotropic drugs such as anxiolytics and antidepressants in Europe, which can be explained by the lack of resources in mental health services, among other reasons. Across Europe, at least 30 outlets have republished or echoed this research in 9 different languages, as Deutsche Welle, El Confidencial, VoxEurop and H-Alter, among others. A coverage that today is an international reference on the challenges of mental health in the present and in the coming years. As a result, the barriers that we bring to light have reached the legislative debate in the Spanish Congress, conditioning the future drafting of a national law of Mental Health.","In the process of gathering the information, we have used several tools. One core tool in our work is the Information Act, key for accessing the information regarding the Spanish situation on mental health. Also, we carried out data analysis of our own databases, to which we used the traditional data driven investigation tools, such as Excel. Nevertheless, most of our efforts were set to visualize the complex information in an easy way. The main infographic is a visual and interactive tour in which the reader can explore a large amount of data in an innovative way: ‘pulling the thread’ of their own country but also have an overall view of the main findings of the 26 countries at once. We have reinforced its narrative side technically via ""scrollytelling"", a form of interactive experience that unfolds the visualization content as the user scrolls. Detection of the reader IP location was also implemented in order to highlight the user's country along with the whole piece. Plus, several static visualizations were included along with the articles for clarification purposes, adding context to the main piece. All of them are responsive, adapting to the different device sizes including small mobile displays, and are easily embeddable in multiple languages through Iframe HTML code. They are developed in JavaScript, combining D3.js, ai2html.js and scrollama.js libraries. Also, at the end of the main article, the reader can use a search engine with all the data available for each country and every source of information in one place. Therefore, information is available as a public service where people who need help can look for resources and check their possibilities.","In the process of investigating the issue, we discovered that the official data did not tell the whole story. They remained on the surface. So, we decided to create our own database from scratch. This was, without a single doubt, the most difficult part of the investigation. We sent a questionnaire on access to psychological treatment to each of the national health systems in the European Union (including the United Kingdom). We sent the questions to professional organisations of psychiatrists and psychologists in all EU countries, to various mental health non-profit organisations, to mental health experts and to journalists from the European Data Journalism Network (EDJnet). We also sent them to the press offices of all EU health ministries, with the exception of Spain, where we made a public information request.  In order to create our database and make it as up-to-date and rigorous as possible, we also asked all EU health ministries for the most recent data on psychologists per capita in their national health systems. Finally, we asked national organisations of psychology professionals to give us an estimate of the price ranges in private practices in their respective countries. We worked tirelessly to have the most truthful data. When using other databases, such as the OCDE one on the use of antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication, we observed that numbers were abnormally low, so we sought confirmation from the Italian Pharmacy Agency. Their data differ from the OECD's and we replaced it in our analysis. This is just one of many examples of the manual comprobation of the official data that the whole team had to carry out for months for this investigation.","This investigation has been a rollercoaster for the whole team. For instance, datasets that were available and ready to use ended up being not trustable, which added several months of work. Also, we learned a valid lesson: sometimes data makes things look good, but the barriers in reality are not shown. For example, one country can have free access to mental health treatments and data says plenty of people use these. However, data doesn’t show how long people had to wait until they received help in some cases. Or why antidepressants consumption is increasing in recent years. Data means nothing without context. We talked and interviewed all the actors involved in these numbers: from patients to psychologists, psychiatrists, and health administrators. And they were the ones who told us the problems behind the data. Making them the center of the investigation was important for the team. Mental health is frequently a taboo conversation and people who suffer from it are stigmatized. By giving them a voice, we have gotten closer to the problems that matter for the people and we are proud of not sticking only to the data. Finally, journalistic investigation on access to mental health care in Europe would not have been possible without the partnerships built within the European Data Journalism Network (EDJnet). Collaborations with journalists and local media have allowed us to get to know the social reality of each country, contextualising the data obtained, as well as interviewing sources of great interest to offer their vision of the national situation. This is a great lesson for the development of cross-border investigations that seek to address neglected issues such as mental health.","English, Spanish, German, Italian, French",https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2021/03/09/access-to-mental-health-in-europe/,https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2021/04/22/mental-health-schizophrenia-europe-deinstitutionalization/,https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2021/04/30/antidepressant-use-in-europe-continues-to-break-records/,https://datos.civio.es/dataset/numero-psicologos-sanidad-publica-paises-europa/,https://datos.civio.es/dataset/limite-sesiones-psicologia-europa/,https://datos.civio.es/dataset/precio-de-una-consulta-de-psicologo-privado-en-europa/,,,"Eva Belmonte, Ángela Bernardo, María Álvarez del Vayo, Carmen Torrecillas, Antonio Hernández, David Cabo, Olalla Tuñas, Miguel Ángel Gavilanes, Lucas Laursen, Aspasia Daskalopoulou, Monica Georgescu","The Civio Foundation (Fundación Ciudadana Civio) is an independent, non-profit organization based in Spain which monitors public authorities, reports to all citizens and lobbies to achieve true and effective transparency within our institutions.

Now you can explore This way voters could see what candidate or party were making the best match. To cover the elections in 98 municipalities and 5 regions we collected data from more than 7000 candidates. Apart from guiding voters in learning about the candidates and whats at stake in the election we also provided autogenerated texts about the results for every single of the 10515 candidates based on election","The voting advice applications have documented impact on voting behavior, and Altingets tool have helped more than 500.000 voters (15 pct of the electorate) to decide how to cast their vote. The application both contain the answers of the candidates on a row of political statements (on which the result is calculated) and some background questions about the candidate fx campaign topics, personal description, and other personal information that the candidate can choose to share. This way, voters have a unique way to get to know the candidates - or use this information to make up their choice. The data we collected from more than 7.000 candidates was available for the newsroom for journalism. Many conclusions could be made on politics based on this large survey of political actors’ opinions. A row of articles about all from schools, environment, sports, health, and culture were published during the runup to the election based on how the candidates distributed their answers in the survey for the application. We also made an automated text generation tool that publishes a personal online article on the election result for every single candidate. As soon as the votes were counted and calculated we could publish no less than 10515 articles in a single moment to give both candidates and readers a better insight in how the votes had impact. The articles were connected to the candidates’ profile in the voting advice application and were sent to every candidate by email. The candidates themselves shared their article on social media.","We built the voting advice application in our own system containing database, API, backend, survey tool and frontend. In the system we also had the calculation method/algorithm to make the most fair matching between candidate and voter.  We also took public available data about the election result and used it to generate personal articles for evey candidate. We used Python and a system of if-sentences. ","Many aspects of this project were complex: - It was a challenge to develop the right calculation method. Many critics point at the risk of bias according to what algorithm you use as well as how you choose your answering ouptions. After extensive tests and analysis, we came up with the ""5-minus-1 method"", that we deem as the most fair calculation. - It was also a challenge to choose and distribute the right statments in the application. The choice of statements is really sensitive as it is very easy to formulate in a biased way or let out important topics. Therefore we have been working on the statements in an editorial process for one year including methodology, research, formulation, tests on candidates, on usersegments, on experts and finally a large internal test and analysis to make the sheet of statements balanced and relevant and with adequate discripancy between parties, so we can present a useful result for the voters. Technically we developed a system for the statements to be more adaptive to the municipalities. That means a devision of statement classes. 1. ideological statments goes for all (also acros regional and municipal elections) 2. basic questions goes for all municipalities (or all reggions). 3. we made five groupings of municpalities according to size and location. We made statements for these specific groups. 4. Specific statments for each municipality or region made the application more relevant around the country. this meant more than 300 statements in total. It was a challenge to make sure all Finaly we introduces a word merger to substitute ""my municipality"" with the name of the municipality in each statement to give more local feel. - It was also a major challenge to collect all relevant info from the more than 7000 candidates as well as profile","One learning is that methodology is very important. Since the tool have effect on the election results, it is important to remain unbiased and that statements and calculation have high quality. Another leatning is that it takes time to prepare and especially during complex/multiple elections as municipal ones, it is important to start working on the allpication early on.

Spain,"Civio (main publishing org), El Confidencial, VoxEurop, Internazionale, Euractiv, etc.",Small,Participant,,Access to assisted reproduction in Europe,02/11/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Infographics, Women, Health, Human rights","D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","The number of babies born through assisted reproduction is increasing. In Europe, there are countries where 5-8% of births are through artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation. However, there are people in many countries that do not have access to these treatments. Those who can afford it travel to other countries to circumvent these vetoes. Civio has led a cross border journalistic investigation into the problems of access to assisted reproduction in 43 European countries. The work shows the discrimination that many people still face in accessing reproductive health care because of their sexual orientation, marital status and other conditions.","Differences in access to assisted reproductive technologies (ART) across Europe are large. Sometimes there are even serious differences within a single country. However, there is one kind of discrimination that happens to repeat itself in a large number of countries: legal barriers prevent LGBTIQ+ people from accessing ART. For instance, 24 European countries ban access to ART for female couples and the situation is even harder for trans and intersex people.  How to pay for it is the other biggest issue, as the investigation reveals. Countries such as Ireland and Switzerland do not cover ART techniques at all, while others pay only part of it. Waiting lists are the main problem with publicly funded ART, since they are years-long in many countries. As a result, thousands of people have to resort to so-called “reproductive tourism”, if they can afford it.  The series is composed of three long form articles: two of them, originally published in Spanish and English, about Europe; the last one, published in Spanish, covers the differences within regions in Spain. The cross-border articles have already been translated to six languages and distributed through the network, reaching a broader audience (difficult to quantify). We have counted at least 14 re-publications by European media as in Euroactiv, Il Post, Internazionale and El Confidencial, among others. We aim not only to make the audience aware of the difficulties of accessing ART, but also making governments accountable when it comes to discriminating collectives such as LGBTIQ+ people or single women. Although the EU has no jurisdiction to regulate these matters and political and cultural sensitivities are still very different, we intend to share our findings with the Commissioner of Human Rights of the Council of Europe and the Ombudsman of the EU to help collectives whose rights are being infringed.","The article for this application covers the differences in access to ART (assisted reproductive technologies) in 43 European countries. In general, extra attention was put to make the information easily comprehensible to a general audience. The database was built almost from scratch with the help of some members of the European Data Journalism Network. The main innovative component is the interactive visualization that maps the main barriers that narrow access to ART treatment. Readers get customized information adapted to their personal situation or marital status (i.e single woman, woman in a female couple or woman in a heterosexual one) and age through an avatar that accompanies the whole piece as a ""sticky"" element, allowing the user to change the profile while navigating through the different topics of the piece and therefore experience different scenarios. The visualization covers what the legislation of each country says about what can or cannot be done and what part is publicly funded by the national health service through general cartogram maps designed to give an overview pattern despite each country's actual size, plus extra detailed information presented visually when clicking on each country. Detection of the reader IP location was also implemented in order to highlight the user's country (if physically in Europe) along with the whole piece. In addition, several static visualizations were included along with for clarification purposes, adding context to the main piece. All of them are responsive, adapting to the different device sizes including small mobile displays, and are easily embeddable in multiple languages through Iframe HTML code. All the visual elements have been developed entirely in the JavaScript D3.js library on the Observable platform through different modular notebooks that were combined all together in the main visual piece.","Discrimination faced by many people in Europe is a reality in access to health care. In this work, we initially relied on data compiled by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology to find out what barriers exist in access to assisted reproduction. However, the Civio team carried out a thorough verification work to check and update the data from the most important European countries. This involved corroborating current legislation (sometimes in other languages), contacting dozens of sources and health ministries.  In addition, we tried to find personal stories that conveyed the discrimination suffered and the problems faced by thousands of people in assisted reproduction. Our idea was to contextualise the data we found so that readers could empathise with the barriers faced by many people in Europe. Emotionally it was hard work to learn about the problems faced by LGTBIQ+ people and single women, but we believe that their first-person experiences are invaluable in understanding this issue.  Another major problem was the lack of reliable data on some of the issues we addressed, such as reproductive tourism. This forced us to make an intensive search in the scientific literature on the studies carried out and to consult multiple sources in order to give an updated, rigorous and truthful perspective on this sensitive topic. We also sought out patients who travelled to other countries to tell us their stories and the problems they had in accessing assisted reproduction. It was not always easy to find these personal stories as there is still a sense of shame and stigma attached to talking about it.","When we talk about discrimination, we often imagine very harsh situations of inequality. However, there are also examples of discrimination in everyday life, such as access to health care. In this journalistic investigation, Civio has shed light on how certain groups in Europe are discriminated against in access to assisted reproduction, even though discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and other personal circumstances, such as marital status, is prohibited by law.  In addition, another lesson from this journalistic work is the importance of verifying and contextualising the data used. In the field of assisted reproduction, national legislation in European countries has been changing rapidly in recent years. The legal analysis of the main European countries has also helped us to extract data and information very relevant to this journalistic investigation. To do this, it is very important to have specialization not only in data journalism and investigative journalism, but also in the complex administrative language, often bureaucratic and complex for the general public. Furthermore, it is very important to translate technical concepts and ideas related to the topic, such as the techniques currently used in assisted reproduction, in order to provide clear and rigorous information.  The reader is the center of the story in the visualization of the data in this investigation. To include all the complex information from so many countries in a simple infographic has been one of the most challenging parts of this publication.

Germany,Der SPIEGEL,Big,Participant,,Die wir verloren haben (Those we've lost),25/11/21,"Explainer, Documentary, Infographics, Map, Arts, Health","Animation, Personalisation, D3.js, Canvas, CSV, R, RStudio","In the end of November 2021, German health authorities registered the 100,000th dead person as a consequence of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. On the occasion of this sad landmark, we created a map of Germany showing every death by the location where it has been registered. But not all deaths are shown at once. Instead, viewers are encouraged to scroll through time from March 2020 until winter 2021 while seeing more and more deaths burning as little dots into their screens. Eventually, to complete the rather emotional setting, we added short stories underpinned with fitting photos.","In a short amount of time, the article reached an above-average number of readers and provoked numerous comments directly on the website. Some commentators where literally scared by the sheer number of corona deaths appearing on their screens. Obviously, the dot-density representation of the data coupled to the user-controlled time scale opened a new perspective to many readers. Usually, our readership is more comfortable with the standard death-rate curve that does not show individual deaths. One reader got quite affected by the scroll mechanism: “My fingers are sore from scrolling.” Thus, by letting the users control the addition of deaths, we succeeded in fueling the convenient data with emotions. Next to the scrollytelling experience we created an animated video to be shared via Twitter and Instagram. On the latter platform, for example, we reached more than one million views. After all, we faced the challenge that a large majority of our readership knows corona fatality data inside out. The curve of daily deaths is continuously exhibited on the spiegel.de frontpage and presented by many other news outlets as well. This and the rather impersonal nature of a statistical curve gives rise to psychic numbing. Here, we tried to bring back the human stories behind the numbers and the public reactions on our website, in letters to the editor and multiple social platforms seem to prove us right.","We got daily death numbers by county from the Robert Koch Institute, our in-house data journalism team and – for some early death cases – through own research. The data was cleaned and aggregated using R with RStudio. The frontend of the article was built with Svelte. Selected D3 functions were embedded in Svelte components to for example draw the map outline and the line chart. The Turf.js library allowed us to randomly position dots within a county. The 100,000 dots were drawn on canvas through WebGL using the Regl library to allow for the best possible performance.","Taking a publicly well-known data set and shedding a new light on it can be challenging. The idea of a map of Germany with 100,000 dots was born quite quickly. But soon we got some doubts and questioned ourselves: Will our readers understand how the visualization works? Will there be misinterpretations? Or are they maybe just ignoring the new perspective? In a nutshell: We needed to make sure that we always focus on the raw numbers and underpin them with built in and well-defined emotions. Certainly, the hardest part of the project. Our solution was to couple the time axis with the mouse wheel and touch fingers. Then we personalized the Covid-19 deaths by using one dot per person. And, with the map, we added a geospatial personalization layer. Thus, people could really feel how the death rates evolved. It is real people behind each dot. They lived somewhere in Germany. Even close to the hometown of our readers. Surprisingly, the subsequent addition of dots by scrolling solved an issue many dot-density maps come with. They are often just population-density maps in the end. However, here, we were able to show the death rate dynamics over time rendering additional layers of information on a simple dot-density map.","This project taught us to think outside the box. Dominated by the rapid news cycle we produce veritable amounts of graphics and visualizations all day. But sometimes we forget about our readers. We hope that this project – published on one of the most visited web pages in Germany – encourages other data visualization designers in the newsroom to come up with creative and user-centric ideas as well. After nearly two years in this pandemic, we urgently need to develop new ways to access the vast amount of data that we collect every day.

Companies replied to the court that villagers are against the development. Papers shows that these companies violating the court’s orders and devastating the pasturelands. These pasturelands are the lifeline of the Thar actually.","After the publication of this report, the local villagers increased their protest.

The authorities reassured that it would be transparent and fair. The source code and full voting data were never released to the public. Data from officials was decoded and independent analysts were able to convincingly prove the existence of falsifications in favor of the pro-government candidates and the ruling party—United Russia. In half of Moscow's districts, opposition candidates won at physical precincts but lost due to e-voting.","The project summarizes a series of materials by independent researchers convincingly proving the existence of falsifications in e-voting to the Russian parliament. The most striking were the articles by the physicist Maxim Gongalsky and the developer Pyotr Zhizhin. The presented article summarizes the previous findings and adds several new proofs. The main one is a sudden and simultaneous increase in the share of re-voting among ALL opposition candidates on the second and third days of voting. The second is a synchronous gap in all districts between voting for pro-government candidates and a pro-government party, which cannot be explained by any real reasons. Articles on the topic of fraud in electronic voting caused a wide response. There were street protests in Moscow against the results of electronic voting. A public group was created to investigate electoral fraud. Legal proceedings are still ongoing. The charts presented in this material were quoted by popular YouTube bloggers and journalists and were discussed at meetings of the Moscow City Duma. The material was published in Novaya Gazeta, on the website (57 thousand views), and in the newspaper with a circulation of 102 thousand copies.

The most difficult part was to create clear data visualizations to exactly show the details of the fraud.

Spain,Civio,Small,Winner,,Use and abuse of emergency contracts during the pandemic,23/03/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, News application, Infographics, Corruption, Economy","Scraping, D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Node.js","In 2020, due to the COVID pandemic, Spanish public administrations used emergency procedures to grant companies - in a discretionary way and with minimal control nor transparency -16,589 contracts for 6,445 million euros. And, although the vast majority of these contracts were used to purchase health supplies against COVID-19, they were also used to grant public television concessions, to purchase tasers and even to hire camels for a parade on Christmas. In this data-driven investigation, Civio analyzed for the first time the emergency contracts of all the Spanish public administrations -national, regional and local- awarded and published in 2020.","This investigation is a series of three articles. To work on the issue, the team extracted, cleaned and structured and completed data for months (finding omission of information, errors, incoherent codes, delays and differences in the forms of publication of each administration...) to make up the most exhaustive emergency contracting database available in Spain. Understanding the data required the knowledge accumulated for years investigating public contracts and the technical capacities of the team. Sparing no time, cost or effort.  We reveal three facts: 1) There was a lot of concentration of the money granted in a few companies. Four companies took 10% of all 6,445 million euros. And the one which was awarded the most was not even related to health matters before the pandemic; 2) The supply price gouging which unleashed as the pandemic evolved. There was a lack of stock of many products and intermediaries eager to do business, on occasions, deceived public administrations. For example, while some public bodies paid 25 cents per unit for FFP2 masks, others paid 8 euros each. 3) The rules of emergency contracting were not followed. More than half of the contracts were published late, and many had not yet been made public when this investigation came to light. This series was published by Civio -with El País acting as republishing partner- and reached tens of thousands of readers. Additionally, many other Spanish outlets echoed the investigation, e.g. La Sexta, RTVE, TV3 and La Razón, among many others. One of Civio’s main goals is to lobby when we, after spending months working on an issue, find something that should be changed. For this purpose, we have shared our datasets with almost twenty public procurement and anti-corruption monitoring bodies and have met with some of them to share our recommendations.   ","The data used in this article comes from the Public Sector Contracting Platform (PLCSP), where the majority of Spanish public entities publish procurement data. We scraped all contracts published from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. They total 119,976. In addition, we have also added the contracts that some regional administrations (such as Madrid and Catalonia) publish on their own websites and only summarise on the PLCSP. We found 53,838 such contracts. The goal was to create a comprehensive database for understanding emergency procurement in 2020 and detect potential abuses of the rules. Once we created the database, we reviewed it for possible errors through a combination of automated and manual processes: duplicate files, mis-classified procedures, lots with the wrong prices, mistaken fiscal identification numbers or names written differently each time… Once the dataset was cleased and stored in a PostgreSQL database, a numer of SQL queries were performed to provide data journalists with subsets to analyse. E.g. total awards per company, evolution of unit prices along time for specific products, time delays. Interactive visualisations were a key element of the final product, in order to explain to a general audience a complex subject. A variety of visual elements were custom developed using the JavaScript D3.js library on the Observable platform through different modular notebooks. All of them are responsive, adapting to the different device sizes including small mobile displays, and are easily embeddable in multiple languages through Iframe HTML code.","We have been investigating public contracting for years in Civio and it is always one of the most complex subjects we put ourselves to work in. Data has mistakes: duplicate files, mis-classified procedures, wrong prices, mistaken fiscal identification numbers (especially in the case of non-EU companies, which tend to be inconsistently filled in) or names written differently each time, and separate contracts published together that we have had to extract and separate ourselves manually or any other problem that you can imagine. We always plan these projects for a work load of months knowing the difficulties, and we always end up spending, at least, a couple more months to finish them.  We have filled in as many gaps as possible using the information we had, so we have had to dig up the original award documents when needed. And, sometimes, we couldn’t even find basic information in those documents, such as what had been bought from whom and for how much money. The two main barriers have been missing information and inconsistency and typos in the data. But the end result has been worth it: we have the most comprehensive emergency contracting database available in Spain. It has served to radiograph how our public institutions have been contracting during a time when everybody was looking at the pandemic and to detect abuses. And also, we designed a search engine to facilitate any query about emergency contracting in public administrations and have released all databases on our site.  ","We take public contracting very seriously and have been advocating for changes for many years. We believe that transparency in this issue could, at least, make it easier to find abuses within the system. Since it has been very difficult to pursue these kinds of changes, we always make the subject knowledge available for everyone, specially, journalists. For instance, we have recorded a series of short videos in which we explain basic principles for investigating public contracts: legal framework, sources of information, essential concepts, red flags (signs of possible fraud) and how to find journalistic stories in the fine print of the contractual information. All videos are available in both Spanish and English on our webpage or Youtube.  Also, we made public all of the four repositories of emergency contracts that we created for this investigation. They have already been downloaded about a hundred times. Mainly by journalists, academic institutions and civil society organizations. Many of them even made their own stories with our data. For example, Carlos Otto, from El Confidencial, used the data to put the magnifying glass on emergency awards in a particular area: the cybersecurity of administrations; the newspaper Las Provincias looked at the public administrations of the Valencian Community in this information. And El Comercio focused on Asturias: it used our data to report emergency awards in the region and how the price paid there for some products tripled in less than 10 days. We are proud to create information that can be used and analysed with different angles for common knowledge and for the fight for transparency in public administrations.","English, Spanish",https://civio.es/quien-cobra-la-obra/2021/03/23/four-companies-won-one-in-ten-euros-from-2020-emergency-contracts/,https://civio.es/quien-cobra-la-obra/2021/03/24/from-25-cents-to-8-euros-a-mask-the-price-war-that-paid-millions-to-middlemen/,https://civio.es/quien-cobra-la-obra/2021/03/25/transparency-delayed-officials-published-at-least-half-of-2020-emergency-contracts-late/,https://civio.es/quien-cobra-la-obra/buscador-de-contratos-de-emergencia-en/?lang=en,https://datos.civio.es/collection/contratacion-de-emergencia/,,,,"EVA BELMONTE, DAVID CABO, CARMEN TORRECILLAS, ANTONIO HERNÁNDEZ, ÁNGELA BERNARDO, MARÍA ÁLVAREZ DEL VAYO, MIGUEL ÁNGEL GAVILANES, LUCAS LAURSEN","The Civio Foundation (Fundación Ciudadana Civio) is an independent, non-profit organization based in Spain which monitors public authorities, reports to all citizens and lobbies to achieve true and effective transparency within our institutions.

Dominican Republic,Diario Libre,Big,Participant,,Exoneration of vehicles to legislators,26/09/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Corruption, Business, Economy",Microsoft Excel,"Since 1996, Dominican legislators can import up to two vehicles duty-free in a four-year legislative period. An exhaustive analysis of the historical data of these vehicles since 2010 to 2021 revealed the large number of sports cars and luxury vehicles that are imported on behalf of deputies and senators. When consulting legislators, they recognized that the exemptions are sold to dealers and individuals for up to US$20,000, meaning a loss of taxes for the State.","When this story was published it was a scandal. The same day it went viral on social media and WhatsApp, something rare in the Dominican Republic, as newspaper reports do not tend to go viral. Everyone spoke of the issue scandalized by the high number of expensive vehicles imported on behalf of legislators. Also, because of how legislators during the last 11 years have sold many of the exemptions with which deported cars and luxury vehicles have been imported tax-free, for the use of individuals and entertainment people. Some of those vehicles have been involved in traffic accidents. The uproar over the publication was such that a public opinion campaign began to repeal the law that privileges legislators with the exemption of vehicles. To the point, that a group of 29 out of 32 senators included in a bill to be eliminated. The proposal was approved in a first reading (the second is missing). But there were also deputies who took advantage of the sessions in the Chamber of Deputies to criticize those who question the privilege of exonerations and accused the press of having colluded with a private sector to harm them. The resource we included of the search for vehicles by brand and model was also widely used. Readers filtered by name of legislators and were shown with screenshots in social media the luxurious vehicles in their name. We really did not think that the story would have such an impact. Even other media, as a result of the stories we published, also continued to cover the issue.","To analyze the data, we rely on two documents received after a request for public information. One from the Ministry of Finance, with the authorization of the exoneration to the legislators, and another from the General Directorate of Customs with the application of the exoneration (which is the one that has the amount finally exonerated). We organize that data in Excel. We took three full days to organize it by legislator, brand and model. And organize that data in an interactive search engine in which the reader can search for the legislator or vehicle of interest. The search engine resource was novel, because, although it was not the first time that the press spoke of vehicle exemptions, it was the first time that so much detail was shown and the reader could be a participant in the data. We use Infogram to empty and organize the data, as it is an easy and intuitive tool.","The most difficult thing was organizing the 11-year data and more than 1,100 vehicles, so that it was possible to search for a vehicle by brand, model and legislator. Also, extract a story from that data and go further. Understand the meaning of those luxurious vehicles, buses ... and why they were there.","Journalists, especially those who do daily coverage, can learn from this story to present a topic perhaps already covered in the press, but in a way in which the reader feels part of it. Sometimes it is believed that data journalism only encompasses large databases, such as the Panama Papers, and it does not. The database that we managed, although it was not voluminous, was very revealing, since it was organized by years, names of legislators, the types of imported vehicles and their exempted amounts. When journalists receive data, the ideal is to stop and think about how to present it to the reader and interpret it meaningfully, not just add it up and give totals or percentages. In regular coverage, like this one, data can be presented in a friendly and impactful way.",Spanish,https://www.diariolibre.com/especiales/reportajes/exoneracion-de-vehiculos-a-legisladores-un-costoso-privilegio-que-paso-a-negocio-AH28947326,https://www.diariolibre.com/especiales/reportajes/consulta-todos-los-legisladores-que-importaron-vehiculos-exonerados-desde-2010-LH28949727,https://www-diariolibre-com.translate.goog/especiales/reportajes/exoneracion-de-vehiculos-a-legisladores-un-costoso-privilegio-que-paso-a-negocio-AH28947326?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US,https://www-diariolibre-com.translate.goog/especiales/reportajes/consulta-todos-los-legisladores-que-importaron-vehiculos-exonerados-desde-2010-LH28949727?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US,https://www-diariolibre-com.translate.goog/actualidad/diputados-defienden-su-exencion-de-autos-con-un-ataque-a-los-empresarios-DP29041332?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es,https://www-diariolibre-com.translate.goog/economia/funcionarios-le-cuestan-menos-al-erario-que-los-legisladores-IG29583209?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es,https://www-diariolibre-com.translate.goog/actualidad/senado-aprueba-en-primera-lectura-proyecto-de-ley-para-eliminar-exenciones-fiscales-DJ29578391?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=es,,Mariela Mejía,"MARIELA MEJÍA Dominican journalist with more than 15 years of journalistic experience.

United States,Virginia Center for Investigative Journalism; VPM (Virginia Public Media: NPR/PBS); WHRO (Hampton Roads' NPR station); Rappahannock News,Small,Shortlist,,Few Virginia Employers Pay Fines For COVID-19 Violations,30/08/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Business, Health, Economy, Employment","Personalisation, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Python","Virginia workers have filed more than 1,450 ""valid complaints"" that employers failed to protect them against COVID-19, government data shows. Only seven states have logged more complaints than Virginia. But workplace health and safety inspectors have cited only about 70 Virginia employers for coronavirus-related violations – and as of Aug. 13, only 25 of them have paid fines. In 24 cases, including instances in which workers died from COVID-19, inspectors did not impose a financial penalty or dropped the fine during negotiations with employers. In the vast majority of complaints, employers were told to correct problems voluntarily, without an inspection.","The Virginia Department of Labor and Industry stepped up enforcement of the state's rules for protecting workers against COVID-19 after the story was published on Aug. 30. Before publication, DOLI was citing about four employers a month for coronavirus-related violations. Since publication, the agency has been citing almost six employers per month – even though complaints tapered off as vaccines became available. Between Aug. 30 and Dec. 30, DOLI posted 23 coronavirus-related citations. The Walmart store in Yorktown, Virginia, for example, was cited for three ""serious"" violations of COVID-19 standards and fined $22,845. The story had noted that Walmart operations in Virginia had drawn more complaints than any other employer but that none had resulted in a citation. Workers' rights organizations praised the investigative project and thanked me especially for writing a sidebar about how to file a complaint with government agencies about health and safety issues in the workplace. Since the project's publication, more employees have filed complaints with DOLI and OSHA alleging violations of COVID-19 rules. OSHA has posted more than 115 such complaints against Virginia employers since Aug. 30.","This project required multiple tools and techniques to execute various data-related tasks: Tabula — To extract text and data from PDFs of workplace citations I received from the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI) under the state Freedom of Information Act. Open Refine, Notepad++ and Microsoft Excel — To clean datasets, including OSHA's downloadable list of ""closed and valid"" COVID-19 complaints against employers nationwide (about 60,000 records); a list of employers cited by OSHA for COVID-related violations (obtained under the federal FOIA); and a list of employers cited by DOLI for COVID-related violations (obtained under Virginia's FOIA). I used these tools to standardize spellings, correct misspellings and split and reformat fields. I also used Microsoft Access to add each employer's industry sector to the complaints data. Microsoft Excel and Access — To conduct most of the analysis. For example, I summarized the complaints data, counting the number of complaints filed in each state. I also extracted all complaints against Virginia employers and summarized those records (counting the number of complaints by employer, by industry sector and by date). I also used Excel and TextBlob (a Python library) to conduct a word analysis of the complaints — to see how many involved masks or face coverings, for example. Using Microsoft Access, I joined the complaints dataset and the citations dataset — to identify complaints that led to citations. Google Sheets and Google Drive — To post all of my data and analysis. I also posted full-text PDFs of citations and inspection reports. Caspio — To create a tool for the public to search the complaints data. StoryMapJS — To create a map of ""19 Employers Cited for COVID-19 Violations."" Datawrapper — To create data visualizations, including a chart of employers drawing the most complaints.","I faced three main challenges in reporting this project: 1. I had to submit FOIA requests for the data and documents I needed. OSHA eventually agreed to post the COVID-19 workplace complaints dataset online. However, OSHA and the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI) would provide information about employers cited for COVID-19 violations only in response to formal FOIA requests. It took persistence and cajoling to get FOIA officers to respond to requests promptly. When I asked DOLI for the full text of citations and inspection reports, the agency said its policy was to provide paper copies only. It took me four months, and a $21 fee, to get the documents. 2. Data cleaning was a significant challenge. OSHA's file of COVID-19 complaints contained numerous misspellings and inconsistencies in the employer name field, and I had to split a field that contained both the number of alleged hazards and the number of employees affected. Moreover, the file included only a code for each employer's industry classification. The citation files also had inconsistencies: In many cases, they listed an employer's DBA or parent company — not its common name. As a result, joining the complaints file and the citations data required creativity (""fuzzy"" joins on names or joins on addresses, for example). 3. It took persistence and time to fact-check and contextualize COVID-related complaints and citations. By email and phone, I contacted every employer mentioned in the story, and I visited three of the cited businesses to seek comment. I received responses from many of the employers and wrote a sidebar about a restaurant that received DOLI's steepest fine for violating COVID workplace standards. But in several cases, employers refused to comment on COVID-19 complaints and citations filed against them.","Keep track of your FOIA requests with free online tools like iFOIA (from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press) and MuckRock's FOIA letter generator. My project required filing 21 FOIA requests (for COVID-19 workplace complaints, for constantly updated lists of employers cited by state and federal agencies, and for the full-text of citations). These tools can monitor the status of each request and remind me when to send a follow-up letter. Make your FOIA requests polite (""I understand that the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted work schedules …"") but firm (""The law requires agencies to respond within …""). Document and automate your data clean-up and analysis routines. This was important because I was constantly getting fresh data: The COVID-19 complaints dataset, for instance, was updated about 50 times while I was working on this story. (And the updates didn't simply include appended records. OSHA often added or revised records in the middle of the dataset.) I kept meticulous notes on how I scrubbed or manipulated each field so that I could repeat each step on new data. I used consistent file naming conventions and audit trails to track how the data had changed. I also used a tool called Workbench to replicate my analysis each time datasets were updated. (Workbench has since been shut down.) Let readers drill down to the data details that most interest them. People reading my article would want to know about complaints and citations involving their employers, their industry sector or their locality. So I put all of my data online: COVID-19 complaints nationwide; COVID-19 complaints in Virginia; OSHA citations; and citations by the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry. And I created a tool for easily searching the data. I also posted the full text of citations and workplace inspection reports.",English,https://vcij.org/stories/few-virginia-employers-pay-fines-for-covid-19-violations,https://vcij.org/analyzing-government-data,https://vcij.org/calabash-covid,http://bit.ly/vosh-citations-map,http://bit.ly/va-covid-complaints,https://bit.ly/vosh-covid-citations,https://c0ect156.caspio.com/dp/43422000d70210c42f294de188d7,,Jeff South,"Jeff South was a newspaper reporter and editor for 20 years in Texas, Arizona and Virginia and then taught journalism for 23 years at Virginia Commonwealth University, where he is an associate professor emeritus.

Nigeria,NewswireNGR,Small,Shortlist,,David Hundeyin,13/05/21,"Investigation, Satellite images, Crime","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap","The story is an investigation of the circumstances surrounding the horrific rape and murder of a Nigerian jobseeker, Iniubong Umoren, whose tragic story gripped Nigeria in May 2021. This story brought together leaked call data from a source at the telecoms provider used by the primary suspect, OSINT and brute-force sleuthing to establish that the suspect had help and was part of a syndicate regularly targeting young women to be raped and murdered. Using the data I gathered and the timeline I conclusively established, the story identified another suspect and a key witness, who were then summoned to court.","The project led to the removal of the case from the jurisdiction of the Akwa Ibom State Police Command, which I was able to prove was actively collaborating with the suspects and sabotaging the crime scene so as to hobble the criminal investigation. As part of the project, I made a live TV appearance opposite the Akwa Ibom State Police Commissioner, Frank Amiengheme, whom I confronted with proof from my story that one of his officers was in contact with the suspect long before any police involvement in the case. His inability to muster a coherent response was instrumental in getting the case transferred out of his hands to federal prosecutors. Using my story as the new centre of the investigative framework, the federal prosecutors who took over the case then identified the suspect's sister Francisca, and his associate Kufre - both identified for the first time by the project - as a key suspect and star witness respectively, Without the project, which used OSINT tools like Truecaller and Facebook to establish their existence and identities. they would both have remained completely unknown to the prosecutors and to the public. In the aftermath of the story, a large number of women also came forward with their stories of almost falling into the same trap that Ini Umoren fell into, including a lady called Blessing Godwin, who was identified in the story as a potential alternate victim chosen by the suspect before he ended up murdering Ini Umoren. Essentially, this project proved the capacity of OSINT to help solve complex crimes in Nigeria, and for the first time, provided evidence of the long-rumoured existence of a criminal ring specialising in illegal harvesting of human parts and organs from young women in Akwa Ibom State.","The most important tool I used was a free global cell tower locator tool called cell2gps.com. Researching, learning and using this tool without any prior knowledge of the subject, I was able to make sense of the cell tower data from the leaked call records I gained exclusive access to, and present it as clear and readable information in the story. I also used Truecaller extensively in the story, as one of my 3 main OSINT sources. Running the numbers from the leaked call records through Truecaller, I was able to get names and photos of key characters in the story including Kufre Effiong, who is now a key witness in the ongoing murder trial. Without Truecaller in particular, this story could not have happened. My second main OSINT source was Facebook. Using the information I gleaned from Truecaller, I searched Facebook to identify Frank Akpan. Eventually - after scrolling through hundreds of profiles with the same name - I found the man from the Truecaller photo. Using the information on his profile, I was able to find him on LinkedIn and establish that he was a senior civil servant in the Niger Delta Ministry working in the office of the cabinet minister and former Akwa Ibom State governor, Godswill Akpabio. My third tool/OSINT source was Google Maps. Using satellite views and Google Street View in conjunction with the cell tower location data, I was able to prove that a serving police officer who would later be hailed as part of the team that ""arrested"" the suspect, was in fact in physical contact with the suspect and Frank Akpan, in addition to calling the suspect on the phone at least 24 hours before he should have been aware of his existence.","For me, the hardest part of the entire project was processing the huge volume of data I was dealing with and presenting it in a coherent narrative that would pass across the maximum possible information without compromising my source. To this end, I had to completely avoid using the screen captures my source sent to me, for fear of inadvertently identifying them. I sat with Google Sheets for the best part of 12 hours and I meticulously transcribed all the data from the screen captures into colour-coded cells, using a simplified format that the audience could understand. I then had to go through all this data line by line where the Vlookup function might not be useful, in order to find links, patterns and calls that might be of interest. Every single cell under the ""incoming call"" and ""outgoing call"" columns had to be manually matched to a name and photo via Truecaller, which was a gruelling, time-consuming task.\ For reference, the snippets of this reproduced data published in the story were less than 10 percent of the total data leak I got my hands on. With no other option however, I had no choice but to go through this data manually, line by line, meticulously marking each cell with a rudimentary code system linked to Truecaller names and photos, until I had turned this big data file into actionable information. This process of manually sifting through data took the best part of an entire week. By comparison, writing out the story draft following this process of research and data purification, took just one night.","In this part of the world, journalists could certainly learn to be more skeptical about publishing statements sent out by authorities as though they are incontrovertible facts of a matter. The entire reason I was driven to do the story in the first place, was that in the aftermath of the social media campaign that actually identified Frank Akpan as the culprit when Ini was declared missing, several videos and photos emerged of his hideout, with several telltale signs suggesting that this was not his first time. There were womens clothes'and shoes, notebooks belonging to female students with dates going back to 2013 and several unexplained holes and mounds in the compound. Following my story, a subsequent investigation by another journalist established that there were several eyewitness accounts describing a foul stench similar to that of putrefying flesh, permanently enveloping the compound in question. Despite all of this readily available OSINT indicating that something big and monstrous was happening there, Nigerian media was generally happy to report the press release sent out by the Akwa Ibom State Police Command as news. This completely uncritical, lazy and hasty approach to journalism is what I think of as a crime against the profession in this part of the world, where governments and authorities have extensive track records of telling lies and putting out statements filled with deliberate distortions and omissions. The job of a journalist in the Global South cannot be to simply parrot what someone in authority said. This project became the basis for the removal of the case from a clearly corrupted police command, and served as the basis for the new ongoing prosecution. Without this project, the Akwa Ibom Police Command's false statements and sham investigaiton would have flown unchallenged.",English,https://newswirengr.com/2021/05/13/murder-in-uyo-who-killed-hiny-umoren/,https://www.nextedition.com.ng/investigation-iniubong-umoren-new-evidence-show-police-mishandled-case-another-victim-speaks-out,https://thenationonlineng.net/court-summons-council-chair/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asj73JFyg4g,,,,,David Hundeyin,"I am a writer, investigative journalist and broadcaster whose work has appeared on CNN, The Africa Report, BBC and BusinessDay.

France,Disclose,Small,Shortlist,,Disclose,21/11/21,"Investigation, Long-form, OSINT, Video, Satellite images, Human rights","3D modelling, Drone, Scraping, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV","Disclose has obtained hundreds of secret documents, circulated at the highest levels of the French state, which reveal the responsibility of France in crimes committed by the dictatorship of Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Egypt. Discover “the terror memos” in a long series of investigative reports. ","Following the Disclose revelations, French MPs have called for a parliamentary commission of inquiry. NGOs such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called the French state to account for its responsibility in extrajudicial killings in Egypt. They have asked the UN rapporteur on judicial executions to launch an investigation following our revelations.  The government has acknowledged the existence of a secret military operation in Egypt since 2016. It announced the opening of an internal investigation in the Ministry of Defence into the information revealed by Disclose about the Egyptian army's use of intelligence provided by France to repress civilians. But at the same time, the government announced that it was launching legal proceedings against Disclose for leaking secret state documents, in order to identify Disclose's sources. This is an attack on the confidentiality of journalists' sources and their freedom to inform citizens about matters of public interest. In Egypt, despite the dictatorship's censorship of the Disclose website, the investigation has been read and commented on by millions of people on social networks. It has liberated the word on the arbitrary executions of Abdel Fattah Al Sissi's regime  ","Disclose obtained hundreds of secret documents by secure means from a whistleblower. We cross-checked information on the existence of a secret military intelligence mission in Egypt, using satellite imagery to identify the aircraft subcontracted by the French military to carry out this mission. We were able to confirm its presence on an Egyptian base from 2016 to 2021, thanks to satellite images cross-checked with secret documents. We also used aircraft tracking software to find the aircraft used by France.  We were able to cross-check and geo-locate, thanks to the analysis of hundreds of secret documents, 19 bombings against civilians in Egypt for which France is responsible.   In order to trace the responsibility of France in the extrajudicial executions in Egypt, we used the information contained in the secret documents and we used the 3D modeling of one of the strikes in a short video.  We scanned the hundreds of alerts issued by Amnesty International on the repressive actions in Egypt. This allowed us to create a chronology putting into perspective the arms sales from France to Egypt, the secret diplomatic cables obtained by Disclose, and the acts of repression carried out by the authoritarian regime.  ","The hardest part of this project was to work on this unprecedented leak of secret documents from the French state. During several month, Disclose journalists had to implement unprecedented digital security processes for investigate highly sensitive material in secret.  We also had to protect and censor the hundreds of documents obtained in order to protect our sources but also the safety of the French military present in Egypt.  A source has sent Disclose several hundred “classified” documents. These reports from French military intelligence, the Ministry of the Armed Forces and the French military general staff reveal the existence of a secret operation by French intelligence in Egypt called 'Operation Sirli'. Page after page, these documents highlight the abuses of an operation that began in 2016, and raise the question of France's responsibility in the crimes committed under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's dictatorship in Egypt. This brutality must have been known about at the highest levels of the French state. Dozens of classified reports show that several military departments tried to alert the government of the operation's abuses, both during President François Hollande's term of office and then under the current presidency of President Emmanuel Macron. But in vain.  Given that these “classified” documents involve a subject of major public interest, we have taken the decision to inform citizens of them. In our view this decision is further justified by the fact that this military cooperation project has taken place without any democratic scrutiny.  This investigation is unprecedented in France because it reveals the secret relations with the Egyptian dictatorship.  It reveals how the French government compromised itself in possible crimes against humanity, with the main reason being to sell arms to Egypt. ","This project teaches how to investigate sensitive issues such as secret military operations, using both closed and open sources. It is an example of how to cover both a national issue - in this case military cooperation with Egypt and arms sales - while allowing readers to learn about the impact of cooperation with dictatorial regimes on the population of the country concerned. This project also shows that investigations on sensitive subjects such as military operations can bring together field journalism, data journalism, digital security, OSINT and 3D modelling. This meeting only increases the strength of journalistic investigations and their impact.   The documents obtained by Disclose were not published without a filter. We have reproduced documents in their entirety, we have censored words, document numbers, signatures, names in all documents.

And in certain areas, officials responsible for economic recovery are the same people in charge of that remediation.   ","According to the National Land Bank Network at the Center for Community Progress, there are over 200 land banks nationwide. Eighty-two of those are Ohio county land banks, and several Ohio cities have land banks as well. Over the years, the legislature has been gradually expanding powers to land banks. Under an Ohio Revised Code Section 294’s “expedited administrative tax foreclosure,” Board of Revision officials theoretically only hear foreclosure cases where the properties are abandoned and there are no other legal issues. But we found  in most small counties, BOR members bring the cases in the first place, and later decide who gets the properties. That’s because of overlap between city officials, the BOR, and the Land Bank. Unlike a traditional levy, it's the land bank board, not voters, who determine how much money goes to the land bank. Is diverting $500K+ from schools worth it for ~115 properties? Until this project, most people didn't even know the details of how this worked. Each land bank has a policy that essentially says ""we do the best for the community with what we have."" What does that mean, mathematically? This is the first project that has shown the inherent conflicts of interest built into the system have affected those decisions. This just published so it's too early to tell the full impact, but this project has been making waves among our readers, listeners, and viewers. Land banks are supposed to ""clean up communities"" and for the most part they do that. But we found they could also be away for public officials to deny applicants in choice spots or to deny political rivals.","This is the culmination of months of work, over 5,000 lines of code, hundreds of public records requests, and several trips to counties all over the state to see how this works in practice. This project is an example of some of the really cool things R does: machine learning! HTML maps! Geolocating stuff! The st_distance() function for Cuyahoga county alone produces a matrix that's 11 GIGS! We used Github, Google Sheets, and Google maps for version control and to flag suspect problems. We used RStudio to create Rmd scripts, and within RStudio we used many built-in packages to pull in data, read databases, clean data, combine data, map parcels, etc. For a detailed explanation of each step, please see our github repository.","The hardest part, conceptually, was to think about how location affected decisions. What does it even mean to be in a good location? The school district? What if the county has open enrollment? Is it location to amenities? Does a 5 or ten minute drive matter or overall distance? By picking out spots that our maps showed might be interesting, and by talking to people near those properties, we were able to get a sense that it was distance to several key locations that mattered. The hardest part, logstically, was putting data from six different counties in the same format- some data was missing or wrong, too. That was the most frustrating and time-consuming.",They can learn a lot- this project is open source! We started with property because there's a lot of great parcel data out there and it's all public records. This is a technology that the government and thousands of companies are using to save money.

United States,Pulitzer Center,Small,Participant,,Us and Them: How Soviet-era Thinking Divided Immigrants Over Trump,13/04/21,"Investigation, Long-form, OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Elections, Politics, Culture, Immigration","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Over the past several years, Soviet immigrants in the U.S. were divided over Donald Trump. Scarred by forced collectivism under the USSR, many Soviets saw democratic values as an existential threat to their rights and individualism. Others saw Trump as a triggering reminder of totalitarianism under Soviet rule. Leading up to Trump’s run for reelection, this chasm was particularly evident on Facebook, where groups as vastly different as “Anti Trump Soviet Immigrants” and “Russian Speaking Americans for Trump” thrived. This investigation tracked these ideologies and how they played out on the platform.","Most of the right-wing groups I tracked for the project were taken down by Facebook as I continued reporting this story (I sent Facebook a no-surprises letter detailing my findings, but did not receive a response). The left-wing groups remain, as they do not violate the platform's policies. The story was shared across the groups and based on feedback I received at least from the groups still running, members felt seen for the first time amidst this complicated, nuanced culture war.","I relied on my Russian language skills (I am bilingual) to join groups and connect with members and adminstrators across the political spectrum. I used CrowdTangle to analyze key words in posts and the types of external links being shared in these groups and any associated pages ahead of and after the election. (For private groups, I did this by hand.) I wanted to track whether there was any evidence of coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform among these groups, so I looked for connections between the webpages (mostly news sites) being shared. To do that, I used digital verification tools like WhoIs to track domain registrations, as well as the source code to track potential shared Google codes across sites. I created spreadsheets of the most active users within each group and what links they posted and when, and where else on Facebook those links were also shared. I created pivot tables to see things like what user shared the most links and in what groups. Through that, I could plot out connections, if they existed, between the posters, webpages and groups. I also had to verify the profile of each group member I reached out to, so I ran their profile images through TinEye and examined their profiles for clues as to when the account may have been set up. I also ran my own survey to gather data on the community in terms of political leanings, social media use and news preferences. ","One challenge I faced was getting sources in right-wing groups to speak with me. I was ultimately able to get a few on the record by approaching them in an op and listening to them intently. I did my best not to form conclusions or assumptions before I had done my reporting, and I believe that all my sources felt heard through that. Another challenge was weighing whether to include the comments of one source who unexpectedly passed away during the project (in the end, I included his story). It was tricky to figure out how to structure the story. Should I include more sources? Should the piece be cultural criticism or a data-driven feature? In the end, it was a bit of both. I had to rewrite the draft for weeks until I got at what was really important and worth including. After my reporting, it was difficult mentally to deal with several trolls who called me a ""communist"" and ""ungrateful, spoiled leftie."" I had to disable comments on my Facebook page. What was most challenging was writing the story post-election after Trump had lost and pitching it to other publications. In hindsight, I would have started the project sooner and published it sooner, so that it could be more timely and have maximum impact. I wish that another publication would have accepted the story to give it a bigger platform, but after Trump lost, lots of publications expressed fatigue around publishing election-related stories, particularly ones that centered around Trump. I was nevertheless able to make the story relevant by showing that for most Soviet immigrants, because of their lived experiences under the Soviet Union, Trump was more than a public figure; he represented a way of life. That is not going to disappear because he is gone from","Start these types of digital forensic investigations early, and track them over time. Findings are very powerful that way. Even after the election passed, the groups remained active for months as concerns about the election being stolen swept through the Right. I was able to include that in my story as additional evidence of the groups' ideologies. I recommend taking lots of screenshots, as you never know when a group might get taken down or frozen (as did happen). Take precautions to protect your identity from those who are inherently distrustful of media or women. That could mean setting up a separate social media profile for this project only, using an alternative phone number, not meeting in-person in a private environment, etc.  I think the story itself could serve as a powerful learning tool for other reporters looking to figure out the best way to tell this type of story. By mixing polarizing political commentary of these groups with hard data, the story comes across as both fair to all perspectives and committed to rigorous fact-checking and research standards. I believe all reporting should begin with an open mind, and the final product should reflect that you took that approach while also being accompanied by context that shows you got the bigger picture.",English,https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/us-and-them-how-soviet-era-thinking-divided-immigrants-over-trump,,,,,,,,Anastassia Gliadkovskaya,"Anastassia Gliadkovskaya is a staff writer at Fierce Healthcare.

United States,USA TODAY Network,Big,Participant,,Diversity Failure: Little progress on executive hires after George Floyd,14/07/21,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Business, Women, Economy, Employment","Scraping, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","At America’s largest and most powerful companies, 1 in every 97 white workers is an executive, but only 1 in every 443 Black or Hispanic workers can say the same. USA TODAY reached these findings after hounding dozens of firms in the Standard & Poor’s 100 for previously undisclosed hiring records following George Floyd’s murder. Employers send numbers on race, gender and ethnicity to the government annually; regulators keep the records hidden. With its unique database, USA TODAY revealed stark disparities in top hires, even as blue collar ranks diversified. And we made all the data searchable for readers.","More and more companies have agreed to share their hiring records with us since publication. Some of them said they did not wish to appear on our list of S&P 100 firms that refused to disclose data. From an initial 54 companies, we now have a database of 83. And the numbers are growing nearly every week. Existing participants have also contributed additional years of data, enabling us to begin analyzing trends over time.","Our analysis consisted of two major data components. First, we ingested, cleaned and tabulated race, ethnicity and gender data by job category. Second, for comparison, we compiled a matching set of data for all employers in each filer's industry using data from the Census Bureau.  Federal hiring data: Firms emailed tech us their federal EEO-1 forms, which they send to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission annually. All raw data was in PDF or other image files of scanned paper forms. We used ABBY Fine Reader for OCR and Tabula for parsing. We used Pandas to clean and test the data for inconsistencies caused by bad OCR. Census data: We used the Census Bureau's special Equal Employment Opportunity Tabulation, which uses responses from the five-year American Community Survey of individuals to tabulate occupation, race, gender and ethnicity data by industry. The Census Bureau applies the same job and demographic classifications used by the EEOC.  Using R, we married the Census Bureau data to the form EEO-1s by company. We then examined, in R, how closely employees in top jobs, especially, matched demographics of all U.S. workers and those in a particular industry. Lastly, we published the data in searchable form using a simple WordPress content management system.","The hardest part was working the phones and email boxes to cajole corporate PR people and their bosses to get us documents. Senior tech and economic opportunity reporter Jessica Guynn took on the complex task of tracking contacts with 100 companies.  When dozens of Form EEO-1s arrived, we needed to apply OCR and parsing software to extract structured tables from scanned versions of paper documents. Often the scan was of very poor quality, requiring extra verification after parsing. Once the data was in shape, wer took the unusual approach of comparing the share of Black and Latino workers who held executive positions with the share of white workers who did. Many of us assume that people of color are under-represented at companies generally. We wanted to see, regardless of what a company’s workforce looked like, the odds that a person of color had made it to the very top. But reporters didn’t stop there. To get behind the numbers, they interviewed employees at these top companies in each of the major sectors for which we had a significant number of submissions. They drilled deep on specific barriers and opportunities facing individual industries. They interviewed current and former executives who were successful at recruiting and retaining people of color to key positions, pointing the way to possible solutions. We published the resulting package of stories, visualizations and searchable data over the course of a week, offering entry points for readers in every business sector -- including the sizable chunk of the American workforce that the S&P 100 employs. The series constituted a truly unique public resource. Academics who study the EEOC and its history told us that because of the agency’s stubborn secrecy, they had never seen so many companies’ form EEO-1s until our searchable database went online.","Some data projects provide a public service not because of their sophisticated techniques, but because they present previously hidden data for readers to use and understand. One important reminder for us in this project was that even if a public record is treated as exempt from disclosure under FOIA, you should never assume it's impossible to get. Always consider the possibility that a company or individual (or many of them) can be persuaded to divulge their data voluntarily. The more high-profile players you get on board, the more others will want to join in to avoid looking unfavorable next to their peers. The effort becomes a rolling snowball if you invest some hard work in pitching people.    ",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2021/07/14/diversity-corporate-systemic-racism-employment-inequities/7639595002/,https://databases.usatoday.com/corporate-diversity/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2021/07/14/amazon-tesla-disney-walgreens-fedex-diversity-employment-stats/5248188001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/business/2021/07/18/workplace-diversity-struggles-break-into-corporate-boardrooms/7906529002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/tech/2021/07/14/apple-facebook-amazon-microsoft-google-diversity/7719204002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2021/07/16/top-executive-jobs-retail-white-men/5246684001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/money/2021/07/16/banks-diversity-black-hispanic-white-executives/7593523002/,,"Jessica Guynn, Jayme Fraser, Craig Harris, Charisse Jones, Dian Zhang, Carlie Procell, Jarrad Henderson, Jack Gruber, Colin Smith, Andrea Brunty, Kyle Omphroy, Josh Rivera","Jessica Guynn is a senior technology and economic opportunity writer; Jayme Fraser is a data reporter; Craig Harris is an investigative business reporter; Charisse Jones covers retail and workplace issues; Dian Zhang is a data reporter.

Egypt,Arij- cairo 24,Small,Participant,,Medical greed or indulgence. Caesarean section scalpels deliver newborns to incubators,10/12/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Women, Health","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","I prepared a data-driven investigation about caeserean section in Egypt to prove the relationship between the responsibility of medically unexplained caesarean deliveries in increasing the need for newborns to enter incubators and exposing them and their mothers to health risks and unnecessarily financial costs. Egypt stopped issuing official data on caesarean section rates in 2014, so I prepared a database of 6,500 mothers who gave birth during the period from 2014 to 2020 to provide the necessary data to detect the escalation of caesarean section rates during those years, in addition to using official and international data and medical studies.","The investigation resulted in emphasizing the doctors’ responsibility in increasing the caesarean section rates and that they lead the decision-making regarding the caesarean section, contrary to what is being promoted that women are the ones who request a caesarean section.  A number of women MPs in the People's Assembly submitted parliamentary requests to question the Minister of Health regarding the escalation of caesarean sections and endangering mothers and newborns, The Parliament's Health Committee discussed some of these requests and decided to assign some women representatives to prepare proposals to solve this problem. Discussion about the risks of cesarean delivery was sparked through the media, and through social media platforms, and a group of male and female students at Beni Suef University launched a campaign to raise awareness of the risks of cesarean deliveries.  The most important impact, in my opinion, was the reaction of mothers who were alerted to the danger of an unjustified caesarean section for them and their newborns, which doctors do not tell them, according to the official data and the data of the questionnaire that I prepared as well. It was also necessary to activate the right of women to know the risks that they may be exposed to with their newborns, as half of the newborns are exposed to complications and one out of every 5 caesarean births needs incubators that are found with difficulty and at a high cost. This should not happen without mothers realizing that they can avoid it and also protect themselves from complications Caesarean section by avoiding unexplained caesarean sections, which is what the investigation aimed and focused on.","I used Google Form to set up the survey, and after I had collected 6,500 mothers' submissions. I later pulled the survey results into Excel, and there I cleaned and analyzed the data to get the data I used in the investigation. I used specialized tools to help me translate reports and studies related to the subject matter of the investigation. I used an audio recorder to record the testimonies of participants and sources in the investigation. I used Google Drive to save all the materials I collected, drafts, surveys, studies, reports, everything.","The absence of updated data and information was the biggest challenge to prove the investigation hypothesis. The latest official data on caesarean section rates were issued in 2014, so it was necessary to produce data that revealed the extent of the phenomenon in the years following 2014, in addition to obtaining data that disclosed the cost of cesarean delivery. The financial gain represented an incentive to increase these surgeries, the percentage of newborns exposed to complications and the percentage placed in incubators, the difficulty and cost faced by families in providing these incubators, the complications faced by mothers, and whether doctors tell mothers about the possibility of their and their newborns being exposed to complications, in addition to revealing the owner of Cesarean decision. All of this data was revealed through a questionnaire that included 6,500 Egyptian mothers who gave birth from 2014 to 2020, and the questionnaire data was used to prepare a database, and the analysis of the data provided a lot of information that proved the hypothesis of the investigation and confirmed beyond doubt the continued exacerbation of cesarean deliveries and their effects. The problem of unexplained caesarean sections, despite its serious impact on mothers and newborns, does not receive official, medical, or even real societal attention. Therefore, I faced great difficulty in communicating with official sources, and medical sources were content with emphasizing their lack of responsibility for the escalation of caesarean section rates and accusing women of being the ones who decide on caesarean sections. I translated dozens of medical papers, most of them contained accurate medical terminology, and this forced me to contact more than one doctor to verify the accuracy of the information I was getting. The last and most minor difficulty was the visualization and the distribution of graphs, maps and data.","I think that the most important thing in my investigation, which I hope will be useful to others, is not to give in to the absence of data and information even if we have to create it!.  Taking numbers and static data for a human context makes stories and investigations more impactful.  Attention to data analysis to obtain detailed and new information often achieves new and important additions.  Attention to the visual representation of data and the diversity in the use of expressive visual models achieves a smooth reading of data and information.","Arabic, English",https://arij.net/investigations/Caesarean-section-en/,https://arij.net/investigations/Caesarean-section/,https://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/2018PGY_CesareanSectionEgypt.pdf,https://gh.bmj.com/content/6/6/e005671.full?ijkey=JgilzebteZPF03j&keytype=ref#F1,https://www.unicef.org/egypt/reports/egypt-demographic-and-health-survey-2014,,,,The investigation conducted with the support of Arij,"I am Sara Gamal, an Egyptian journalist.

India,People's Archive of Rural India,Small,Participant,,Societal Fallouts of Covid-19,21/05/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Corruption, Women, Agriculture, Health, Economy, Employment, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","For the three months of April, May and June of 2021, the second wave of covid-19 devastated the countryside in India. It penetrated the rural areas like the first wave had not. And exposed the inadequate public health infrastructure.  This project looked at the fallouts of that second wave. We picked a region that was already struggling with debt and distress, and wrote a series of stories examining how an impoverished region deals with a raging pandemic. Through this project, we did reports on child marriage, migrant labourers, rural journalists and so on. ","Central to this project were people living on the margins of the society. The people that are hardly covered in the mainstream media.  This project made them visible. It gave voice to the voiceless in the society, where the readers could read their raw, unembellished and compelling stories.  The stories were noted by some of the lawmakers in the state and country.  After each story, readers reached out to the writer and organisation to help out the people we quoted in our stories. The help, in most cases, exceeded $1000, which is about as much as the people concerned earned in a year. Several NGOs reached out and offered to look after the education expenses of children we had written about. ","It was good old fashioned, shoe leather journalism with eyes and ears on the story.  I did not use any extraordinary tools or technologies or techniques. The most important tool during this project was a pen and my notebook. The stories came through conversations with local contacts, sources and activists.  The pictures taken during the course of this project were taken on my smart phone, which has one of the better cameras around. ","The hardest part of the project was to keep your own anxieties in check. I had been on the road through the second wave and after that as well. I visited hospitals, met relatives of covid-19 patients, spoke to healthcare workers. And I was not vaccinated at the time.  One of the biggest challenges during that period was to deal with the possibility of catching covid-19, and worse, passing it on to people you love. It was particularly a traumatic thought, considering several journalists had died reporting on the second wave of covid-19.  During that period, the state governments and lawmakers were being extremely inaccessible, for there was considerable data fudging happening at the time. Authorities were trying to downplay the number of covid-19 deaths. So an important challenge was to overcome that and source accurate data points to explain the gravity of the crisis unfolding in rural India.  It was not easy to navigate these obstacles. It was mentally and emotionally draining. The project should be selected because it worked out in spite of these challenges. The stories are in depth, compelling and hard hitting. The data points are revealing. And it talks about the region that relatively less explored in the mainstream media.",The most important aspect of this project was profiling the marginalised sections of the society -- a bit of a lost art in the age of social media. What this project tells you is that there is no substitute to good old fashioned reporting.

India,People's Archive of Rural India,Small,Participant,,Farming and Its crisis,20/02/21,"Explainer, Politics, Environment, Agriculture, Economy",Microsoft Excel,"In September 2020, the union government of India passed three farm laws, which privatised the farm sector. Protests errupted over the laws, for the farm unions and farmers did not want private players and corporations entering the farm sector without government regulations. However, Bihar, one of the Indian states, had made changes similar in nature to the three farm laws in 2006. Therefore, the state of farmers in Bihar became a test case for what the rest of the farmers could expect. This two part series exposed the plight of farmers in Bihar and busted government claims about farm laws","The protests over farm laws lasted a year.

Yet historic shifts in the way rain falls, explained in shocking clarity through USA TODAY’s reporting, make clear the danger is already here. ""Downpour"" features an analysis of a century of precipitation records from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a unique collection of snow and rain extremes computed by a private climate researcher. These revealed stunning increases in intense rainfall in vast sections of the country over recent decades. Through brilliant visualizations and innovative musical auralizations of rainfall data, ""Downpour"" provided deep contextual grounding to understand this year’s ​weather.","The general rise in temperature over the past century has become fairly well known in the collective mindset. The increase in rainfall is a phenomenon less widely understood. This explanatory investigation empowered readers to make sense of weather changes that have tangibly altered people's lives. Our approach was unique in the types of data points we assembled in one place, and scientific sources told us it was both sound and compelling. We achieved this kind of impact through the careful selection of numbers:  At some point over the past three years, 27 states – all east of the Rocky Mountains – hit their highest 30-year precipitation average since recordkeeping began in 1895. A dozen states, including Iowa, Ohio and Rhode Island, experienced five of their 10 wettest years in history over the past two decades. Of 285 weather stations in the continental United States, 44% get at least one more top rainfall event per year now than they did three decades ago. That means what used to count as their top three wettest rainfalls of the year now happen at least four times a year. Intense rainfall events can cause three times as much fertilizer runoff as other precipitation, contributing an outsized share of pollution associated with algae blooms in the Mississippi Basin and Gulf of Mexico, based on our analysis of one Illinois watershed. Among cities with sewer systems designed to discharge untreated waste into streams during heavy rains, 97% have experienced an uptick in both annual precipitation and extreme rainfall over the past 30 years. These cities are ill equipped to pay for sewer upgrades. The median household income in the 728 cities and towns with these vulnerable sewer systems is $45,520, compared with $67,520 nationally, and the poverty rate is 50% higher than the national average.","This project was powered by analyses in R, QGIS and ArcGIS and came to life via innovative visualizations and auralizations.  Rainfall changes. We used R and NOAA annual data to isolate record-setting precipitation years and average precipitation. For changes in high-intensity rainfall, we used statistics from climatologist Brian Brettschneider. With each U.S. weather station, he identified rainfall thresholds exceeded, on average, just three days a year from 1951 to 1990. He then calculated how often each station recorded that amount 1991-2020. There were widespread increases in downpours. Vulnerable sewers, residents. Some sewer systems overflow into rivers when storm drains fill. We used QGIS’ inverse distance weighting algorithm to interpolate Brettschneider’s weather station data into polygons, joining them on coordinates of overflow systems. Nearly all such systems had rising rainfall. The American Community Survey showed these cities averaged higher poverty rates and lower incomes, making infrastructure upgrades a struggle. Increased pollution. We identified one Illinois watershed with continuous, long-term USGS nitrate data, then scraped watershed precipitation levels from Daymet, an online dataset from Oakridge National Laboratory. About 10% of rain events contributed to 33% of pollution. Hearing rainfall. Composers from Full Sail University produced musical representations of state-level data. They combined traditional instruments, sampling and generative audio to embody annual rainfall. We matched each piece to an animated bar chart of underlying rainfall data with a custom player that lets users experience tones and bars simultaneously. Changes near you. We used Datasette, Svelte, the Mapbox geocoder and Turf.js to take a user’s location, find the nearest weather station and climate division, and present a century of local precipitation highs, lows and trends. Guessing trends. We presented a half-drawn line chart showing rainfall over time and let readers draw the remainder for recent years. The interactive then revealed the actual trendline.","The range of separate data analyses and visualizations this project called for was daunting. We set out not only to establish that climate-driven rainfall extremes are real, but also to quantify impacts on humans and ecosystems. We wanted data unassailable among climate researchers yet approachable by any audience.  Choosing the right weather measurements was key. The United States has many distinct climates, and accounting for that is a challenge. Reporters read numerous academic studies and consulted with top climate scientists who specialize in precipitation, formulating with their guidance a unique analysis that would measure how many record wet years and dry years each state had since 2000. The analysis also measured changes in average annual precipitation from 1895 to 2020 by state and in NOAA’s 344 climate divisions.  No database lists extreme precipitation events, and there is legitimate scientific debate about what constitutes “extreme.” To break through that obstacle, USA TODAY worked with a dataset assembled by climatologist Brian Brettschneider. Each U.S. weather station was measured against itself for two time periods, 1951-1990 and 1991-2020. This revealed numerous statistically significant increases in days with heavy downpours.  Another hurdle was missing data. Capturing the impact of heavy rainfall on sewer overflows demanded nationwide coverage. Yet while rain and snowfall amounts are collected each day, hour and minute at weather stations in hundreds of U.S. cities, big swaths of the country have no station. To fill data voids, reporters used an inverse distance weighting algorithm in QGIS to spatially interpolate Brettschneider’s weather station data. It enabled us to say that almost all cities with combined sewer systems are in areas that are having more days with heavy rainfall. Similarly, our analysis of how heavy rains wash polluting fertilizer into streams called for watershed-level rain data interpolated by researchers at Oakridge National Laboratory.","This project affirmed how crucial it is to enlist experts in the field to develop a sound methodology and choose appropriate data, especially when approaching a topic as complex and controversial as climate science. Your stories will have far more resonance, credibility, accuracy and nuance if you leverage these sources from the beginning. The scientists we consulted guided us toward the right data source for the right level of geography. We learned that NOAA's annual average rainfall figures are considered the most accurate for portraying change by state and at the level of climate divisions, which are sub-state regions drawn by NOAA scientists. For high-intensity rainfall events, climatologists encouraged us to talk with Brian Brettschneider, an Alaska-based researcher who shared with us his unique, apples-to-apples calculations on rainfall amounts that previously qualified as extreme for a given location -- and that have become more common in recent decades. His findings are rooted in U.S. weather stations, which, unlike climated divisions, are observation points at a single latitude and longitude.  To correlate fertilizer runoff pollution with downpours, we started out by examining data for the weather station closest to each waterborne U.S. Geological Survey nitrate gauge. But experts noted that even if a station is nearby, it might not actually be within the same watershed. We instead turned to (and scraped) the specialized Daymet dataset, compiled by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which interpolates weather readings onto a uniform grid of North America. These data enabled us to connect rainfall levels to each square kilometer of the watershed we analyzed.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/11/30/climate-change-extreme-rainfall/8550366002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2021/11/30/climate-change-impact-on-rainfall-in-your-state-explained/6249484001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/11/30/fertilizer-runoff-rain/6201498001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/11/30/sewer-systems-climate-change/6201425001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/11/30/music-rainfall-climate-change/6354880001/,https://www.usatoday.com/storytelling/news/investigation/rainfall-lookup/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2021/11/30/wildfire-rainfall-mudslides-disasters/6201564001/,,"Kevin Crowe, Ignacio Calderon, Dinah Voyles Pulver, Kyle Bagenstose, Cheri Carlson, Ramon Padilla, Mitchell Thorson, Stephen J.

The explosive volume of the confirmed cases made the information released by the command center lack details. At the same time, the local government was authorized to disclose information based on epidemic prevention work. The channels for people to receive information suddenly became lots and miscellaneous. READr integrates public information, and through the help of visualization, it fully presents the process of the virus outbreak. ","It was the first report at that time to fully show the path of the virus spreading at that time.  Taiwan is often praised for ""disclosure of information"" in terms of epidemic prevention, but just throwing out information cannot help the public understand the overall situation. READr began to update the data of COVID-19 confirmed cases when the first case  appeared in Taiwan in early 2020, and publicly published the information on the Internet (Github). If the information provided by the government is not comprehensive, we will take the initiative to obtain it.

And all of the data are in open data.","READr has maintained and updated the data of each Covid-19 confirmed case every day when the epidemic first entered Taiwan, including age, symptoms, date of onset, etc., and made it public on the Internet for everyone to view and use. After the outbreak, the way to obtain this information changed from watching the press conferences of the central government to watching the press conferences of 22 local governments across Taiwan. We still have not given up on updating these case information.    Perhaps the change in information sources was the government's way to publish information more quickly, and people everywhere only need to pay attention to the information in their own counties and cities. However, when we look at the overall situation, we found that there were many epidemic breaches caused by cross-county and city movements, as well as epidemic prevention breaches caused by different policies between counties and cities, or the explosion of capital city's inspection or medical volume. Although these are public information, it is impossible for the normal readers to analyze and digest such a large amount of information.   When the epidemic is still at its peak, we visualized these processes through data and organized them into easy-to-understand report, so that readers can quickly be aware of the spread of the virus.

The accident killed 49 people and injured more than 200, the deadliest train crash in Taiwan for decades. After the tragedy, people in Taiwan were really angry because the Puyuma express train derailed and overturned at Su’ao Xinma Station in rural Yilan County, resulting in 18 deaths and more than 200 minor and serious injuries on October 21, 2018. People were confused why there were two serious train derailments in Taiwan Railways in less than three years.   According to the preliminary investigation report released by TTSB, the derailment accident occurred not only because Li Yi-xiang, the site supervisor, was negligent in his duties, but also because of serious problems with the safety procedures of Taiwan Railways. The report spent more than 500 pages analyzing personal causes and systemic problems. After reading all the report documents, this article uses 3D modeling, monitor screens, illustrations, as well as chronological summary, to try to reconstruct the scene of the incident and what happened before and after the accident.   In addition, since the TTSB’s report mentioned the negligence of Taiwan Railways, we interviewed the frontline staff of Taiwan Railways, and asked them to share what they observed after the 2018 Puyuma accident, and the changes Taiwan Railways should do but did not do, and whether inaction is one of the reasons to this tragedy. We want to realize why derailment accidents happen repeatedly through analyzing a single incident and the institutional problems of Taiwan Railways.","When users are reading this report, they can not only return to the scene of the incident from 3D modeling, monitor screens, illustrations, and other elements that emphasize the sense of reality, but also review the time of about 7 or 8 seconds before the accident is about to happen. After the accident, the internal conditions of the Taroko train and the changes in the surrounding environment can also be found from the interviews with the firstline staff of Taiwan Railways. The accident is not accidental, but is caused by a series of systemic issues and the lack of training.

Singapore,CNBC.com,Big,Shortlist,,The Quad Project,23/09/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Documentary, Database, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Business, Economy","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","CNBC International employed quantitative game theory to generate a digital feature that forecast the future of the ""Quad""—the strategic security grouping formed by the United States, Japan, India and Australia—and what it means for the economic and political future of the Indo-Pacific. To our knowledge, the Quad Project marks the most ambitious, data-intensive use of game theory by any major news organization in history. CNBC worked on the Project for seven months, publishing two days before Joe Biden hosted the first heads-of-state Quad meeting at the White House with Prime Ministers Narendra Modi, Yoshihide Suga and Scott Morrison.","The future of the Quad has tremendous and growing significance as China has become an increasingly assertive global power. The Quad digital feature, entitled ""The 'Quad' is on the rise in Asia-Pacific: Game theory has a prediction about its future,"" was formally distributed within the U.S. State Department and read widely in the capitals of Japan, India, Australia and other countries in the region.  The project's findings sparked intense interest at institutions that helped to ""populate"" the game theory model, including the Hoover Institution, Observer Research Foundation America, Eurasia Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, Brookings Institution, Asia Society, CSIS, Stanford University, New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and others. Especially noteworthy is that the piece was circulated and referenced among academics within China. The digital-first project prompted several live international TV interviews on CNBC with its author, Ted Kemp, and the creation of a feature TV documentary about the project that began airing the week of 3 January 2022 throughout Asia, Europe, Africa, Latin America and Australia. Jonathan Grady, the applied game theorist who worked closest with Kemp on the project, discussed findings on live radio in Seoul, South Korea. Policymakers, risk managers, investors, CEOs, and regular citizens in Asia, the United States and beyond are increasingly aware of rising stakes in the Indo-Pacific region. CNBC International's Quad feature has attracted 150,000 unique readers online, with an impressive average engagement time of almost four minutes. Even before project was published, it generated great excitement within policy circles. Among the 37 individuals who provided data to construct CNBC's Quad game theory model were two former Australian foreign ministers, a former U.S. Defense official, former officials from France and Taiwan, and senior policy experts at several think tanks and top universities.","The Quad Project was based on a proprietary game theory architecture designed by Hoover Institution's Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and his protégé Jonathan Grady of New York University. The Bueno de Mesquita model is well known within the highly specialized world of game theory. In short, game theory uses computing power and logic to predict what individuals will do when they're competing against each other. It creates a model that forecasts the decisions and counter-decisions within a scenario or ""game"" between those people, who are called ""players."" The Quad Project crunched inputs on almost 300 individual ""players""—most of them policymakers at the highest levels of government—in 15 countries and territories. The model ran millions of individual calculations to generate its final forecast. The game theory architecture designed by Bueno de Mesquita has been used internally by the CIA on more than 1,200 intelligence projects, and it was found by the agency to have an aggregate 90% accuracy rate, according to unclassified CIA documentation that was published Yale University Press. The model has also been used commercially by Fortune 500 companies, and it has been cited by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times Magazine. CNBC International's Quad Project model is the largest computation ever run by the Bueno de Mesquita model in its history—more complex than anything the CIA did. CNBC ""populated"" the Quad model with input data from 37 of the world's top experts on policymaking in China, the United States, India, Japan, Australia and 10 other countries and territories. ","The first challenge was constructing the Quad model itself—what's called ""populating"" the data that fed the model. It took seven months to find experts who could provide the data, to interview them in depth, to cross-check data points from experts against one another, and to format the data for the model. Running the model itself was by far the easiest part. Second, most people are not familiar with game theory. Therefore, the feature article had to educate readers on game theory, including its shortcomings and criticisms, in addition to explaining the results pertaining to the Quad itself. This made writing a serious challenge, because it was necessary to balance introductory explanations of game theory and the Quad as a political grouping with a brisk, interesting narrative that delivered the actual predictions. Third, almost as soon as we ran the model, some of its predictions began to actually take place in the real world. The final phases of publication were a race to incorporate those developments into the feature itself quickly so that events wouldn't outrun the predictions we generated. More on that below. This project was a first, not just for CNBC International, but on this scale a definite first for the Bueno de Mesquita model architecture, and we believe a first for any media organization anywhere. We strongly believe this project broke new ground for game theory and for an underexplored, data-driven journalistic practice.","Other journalists should learn from the Quad Project that quantitative methods, applied with rigor, can be used to render accurate predictions of the future, not just to analyze or assess events that have already happened. At CNBC, we came to see game theory as a new adjunct to the qualitative predictions—from analysts, strategists and others—for which we are well known on TV and online. Specific predictions made by the Quad Project began happening almost immediately after we ran the model. The model said other, non-Quad countries would align with the Quad or come close to its position on security, specifically naming the United Kingdom among others. After CNBC ran the model and generated that prediction—but just days prior to the Quad Project's publication online—the United Kingdom made a surprise announcement that it would join a new security partnership with the United States and Australia that will, among other things, equip Australia with nuclear-powered submarines. The UK is not the only non-Quad country that is stepping up maritime security work in the region since then. The model said that leaders in Australia, India, Japan and the United States would become more heavily focused on Indo-Pacific security, and the countries would act in an increasingly coordinated way. The joint statement by the Quad heads of state following their meeting at the White House testified to this new coordination, as have other events.  The model also singled out Vice President Kamala Harris as taking an increasingly sharp interest in the Quad, and it did so a week before she delivered pointed remarks about Indo-Pacific security while in Singapore and Vietnam. There are early, tantalizing indications that the model's most controversial prediction—that factional politics would develop within China in response to the Quad—may be taking shape as well.",English,https://www.cnbc.com/quad-summit-and-china-game-theory-predictions-for-the-future-of-the-quad/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVWvPyb6JZw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPKxlwomDlo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caDm0fuvC9Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6J_FMdAvlEQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVKP--chMtM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sTDJzc76rU,,"Ted Kemp, Bryn Bache","Ted Kemp has more than 20 years of experience as an editor and writer covering geopolitics, economics and business.

Australia,The Regional,Small,Participant,,Big four' banks casting a dangerous shadow: Are cashed-up and bankless towns just watching the money go round and round?,11/05/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Map, Business, Economy, Human rights",Microsoft Excel,"Australian banks have been able to avoid questions on branch closures for decades due to a lack of transparency in official data.  Frustrated by this, I spent a year building my own database to get to the bottom of what was really happening in regional areas where most banks have been lost, creating human rights and other issues due to isolation.  From this statistical base I reported on the impact these closures have had locally and – as a consequence – on the national economy. My research also exposed errors in official data that I discovered was being published unchecked.","I published independently to maintain control of the intellectual property of my data maps. In doing this I was reliant on the work being shared organically, but this proved a good strategy. The main story (‘Big four’ casting a dangerous shadow) and its companion piece (Why I spent a year counting every bank in regional Australia) were picked up and shared widely by people who have been lobbying government to do something about the human rights issues being created by the behaviour of the major banks for years. They included members of grassroots groups and political parties fighting for services in regional Australia, unions concerned about bank workers’ jobs and finance commentators informing the general public. “This is the kind of information that can be used to pressure MPs to implement real banking reform,” one tweeted. Other reaction included it being described as a “massive thought-provoking work” by economics academic and commentator Peter Martin AM and a former prime minister saying the story was “tremendous and important”. My stories were referenced in public calls for action on the issue and as a direct result of this pressure, the Federal Government announced an inquiry into regional bank closures in October 2021 – the first in 17 years. In response to this I followed up with another story summarising my research and providing regional communities with numbers, facts and strategies they could use to push for a meaningful outcome. The enduring impact of my work is a database that allows for banks’ behaviour in regional Australia to be reported on in accurate detail for the first time (see 2021 update).  Analysis of this data, combined with other research, has revealed impacts that could finally jolt the government into action. With mapping regularly updated, it will continue to inform for years to come.","My project utilised a combination of old-fashioned journalistic elbow grease and technology that is now available to help engage readers with visual and interactive elements. I collected my data manually using traditional research techniques. My sources included print copies of historic bank and banking industry records, electronic BSB listings, media reports, bank websites and independent research. I used Google Maps to help verify locations and when branches closed.  The information was collated in Excel spreadsheets and I cleaned the data manually. The main findings from the data were written into my stories but I also displayed the full database in interactive maps embedded in the copy. I used a program created by Batchgeo, which produces an interactive Google map from spreadsheet data pasted into its mapping tool.  There are limits on the number of categories it can show so this had to be taken into account when preparing the spreadsheets. The program can be finicky about what information it picks up for toggling and sensitive to errors in the copy, so there was much trial and error before the maps were ready to be published. The maps can be embedded into a story like any image and they are easily updated whenever a new branch is closed.  Writing the stories began with a process of research in which I read every banking inquiry report back to 1981, research papers on cash and the shadow economy and trawled through countless bank annual reports. I sought comment and offered right of reply when necessary. I also visited the town featured as my case study, conducting face-to-face interviews and taking the photographs featured in the main story. ","To report on this issue properly I needed to quantify and measure something that had never been independently scrutinized. I started from scratch, inputting by hand nearly 4000 banks I had identified as being “regional” and then classifying them into service level categories that would help me tell my story. This information was not easy to find. Banks no longer publish branch footprints and will not give that information to journalists. I spent months sifting through BSB records to pull my core data on major banks. Smaller institutions were harder again to find as they don’t use this system and I had to go to each bank’s website and individually note, by hand, branch details. Historic records were also manually incorporated. One of the most difficult aspects of reporting on bank closures has been obtaining figures for regional Australia. (Where does regional start and finish?) The government database journalists are routinely pointed to doesn’t differentiate between regional and metropolitan, so this was something I again had to tackle from scratch. Full branch lists had to be pared back to “regional” line by line by cross-referencing locations against local government lists. Once I had finally sourced and verified my data, I taught myself mapping, which is far more complex than just dropping information into a program. I found designing a spreadsheet within the mapping tool parameters that could be toggled to find answers to questions readers wanted to know required complex thought processes not unlike writing, but in data. Refining datasets to reveal information banks have been hiding – such as identifying the towns in which they are the last banking presence – has been the most satisfying achievement of this project because it is a tool that is being used by communities to help fight for their rights.","Journalists should be able to trust official government data but in the course of writing my story I discovered that the information being provided by banks contained errors and it was not being checked before publication. These errors have been skewing the statistics journalists have been using to report on bank closures in regional Australia for decades. All it took to expose this was to drop their raw data into software that is generally not available in newsrooms, so I can highly recommend adding this sort of technology to the arsenal of any journalist who is working with sourced data. The warning here though, is that it is important to know your subject well. I recognised errors in classification, which I wouldn’t have if I didn’t have the background knowledge, so the more you know about your subject, the more you will get out of working with data and the better your stories will be. Investing in technology has other benefits. While I don’t want to run maps with every story I write, having a mapping program on hand allows me to check newly released bank data, or any other geo-location spreadsheets that come my way. Tools like Batchgeo can also smash production time, which is a boon after the slog of collecting and verifying your own data, a process that can’t be hastened. The time I took to compile my own data was also good investment. My database may have taken a year to build but it will continue to inform my work for years to come and allow me to make expert comment on my special subject. It also lifted my story from what could have been just a comment piece to a credible news feature based in fact. It makes a journalist hard to ignore.",English,https://www.theregional.com.au/post/big-four-banks-casting-a-dangerous-shadow-in-regional-australia,https://www.theregional.com.au/post/why-i-counted-every-bank-in-regional-australia,https://www.theregional.com.au/closure-update-first-half-2021,https://www.theregional.com.au/post/what-anyone-making-a-submission-to-australia-s-latest-regional-banking-inquiry-should-know-first,,,,,Dale Webster,"Dale Webster is an experienced journalist who has carved a niche for herself telling stories that resonate with regional Australia.

India,"IndiaSpend, The Hindu, Dainik Bhaskar, Scroll.in",Small,Winner,"""In the second year of the coronavirus pandemic, several of the strongest entries to the Sigma awards were data journalists’ efforts to use the concept of “excess mortality” to demonstrate that official death tolls in many jurisdictions were likely undercounts. Whether due to officials downplaying the severity of the disease, flawed or variable definitions of what deaths to attribute to the pandemic, or simpy limited administrative capability,  this problem was found in many parts of the world.

The basic data needed to calculate all-cause mortality in excess of expectations based on previous years is not available in all — or even most — countries. And where it is available, it is often published with a lag too great to allow for reporting in a crisis. Journalists’ work identifying and obtaining faster means to access local mortality data has been vital to enabling this type of reporting in many countries where ready access to this data is limited.

Rukmini S, a freelance journalist, was foremost among a number of reporters who undertook this type of analysis in India, where she obtained the mortality data for four states and and the city of Chennai. In a series of articles and op-eds for IndiaSpend, Scroll.in, and Dainik Bhaskar she explained the data quality issue to readers, brought together the available data from various local, state and national sources, and persuasively documented the evidence that India’s official Covid death toll was likely understated.

This was dogged reporting work by an independent journalist using little more technology than a spreadsheet, an important reminder that data journalism does not necessarily require huge investment in technology or complex visualisation capabilities to have significant impact. 

Her work was published in English, Hindi, and Tamil and she made her data and methods available to other journalists and researchers, encouraging similar work in other Indian states and further afield. The work of India’s journalists reporting on this data — has been vital to our understanding of the true scale of the Covid-19 pandemic in the world’s second most-populous country, something now repeatedly acknowledged by academic researchers using the material they uncovered.""",Rukmini S - Indian excess mortality investigation,23/03/21,Investigation,"Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have been reporting that India's official death toll from covid is likely a severe underestimate, both on account of historical registration issues, and account of an overly strict definition of a covid death that kept number artifically low. By first building a case for and then accessing confidential all-cause mortality data in India, I was able to provide the first estimates of true covid mortality in India. I reported on excess mortality in the city of Chennai, and the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala and found that in","First, my reporting produced the first estimates of excess mortality in India, and by extension, the first estimates of missed covid mortality. The reporting was immediately picked up by others news organisation in India and abroad, and the impact was magnified by the fact that my articles appeared not only in English, but also in Hindi (Dainik Bhaskar) and Tamil (IndiaSpend Tamil). I have had the opportunity to speak about my reporting on excess mortality at multiple fora including the UN World Data Forum. Second - and this is something that I'm particularly proud of - by putting all of my methodology and data in the public domain, as well as throwing out an open invitation to journalists across India (no matter what language they worked in) to contact me if they had all-cause mortality data that I could guide them in fashioning into a story, I was able to set off a domino effect. Journalists across Indian newsrooms began reporting on excess mortality in their cities and states, and between us we have now produced data for 18 India states or over 700 million people. Lastly, since all of my data is on Github, researchers from across the world have had access to it to do scientific work on covid mortality in India. Multiple papers have been written using the dataset, and it forms part of global repositories. Where there would have been a large India-shaped hole in our understanding of global mortality from covid, reporting by me and then other Indian journalists was able to fill this gap. Additionally, I had dozens of bereaved people from across the country reach out to me to say that my work was helping honour the memory of the people they had lost, when official statistics were erasing them. I think that","I used Excel for data analysis and Google Sheets, Infogram and Datawrapper for charts. This was not a data journalism project that used much technology, and I had to rely chiefly on my investigative, journalistic, analytical and narrative skills. ","I am going to go out on a limb here and say that too much of data journalism now rewards visualisation rather than journalism; while visualisations are difficult to pull off for independent journalists and those in resource-constrained settings, this is also where some of the most vital jouralism is being done. This is not a project that used advanced tech or visualisation tools, but a project that required all of the best skills of investigative reporting to tell a data story. First identifying why this data was needed by specifically pointing out what India's official covid death toll was missing (instead of over-broad generalisations and suspicions about data suppression) through analytical articles like the ones I wrote for IndiaSpend was vital to create an understanding of what all-cause mortality data could do. Then accessing this data as I did for the pieces in The Hindu, Dainik Bhaskar, Scroll and IndiaSpend, required developing sources to access confidential data. After I wrote the articles, I wrote an op-ed for The Hindu explaining both the deficiencies and the advantages of using all-cause mortality data, and helping put what I had found in context. The hardest part of this work has been the consistent refusal of the Indian government to part with data. All of the all-cause mortality data had to be accessed using confidential sources which had to be developed at the level of each city and state government.

The incidence is rising, more deaths, hospitalisations are increasing, ... But with each new wave of the pandemic, these figures lost a little of their horror for me. Victims became emotionless numbers. With «A Song of Crowns and Tears» I wanted to change this. The pandemic, the suffering, the victims should become audible. In this project, numbers should be freed from their emotionlessness and show what it's really about: people.","The video on Twitter, Youtube and Reddit spread surprisingly within a very short time. Newspapers from abroad reported on it, radio stations in the USA played the piece, I was asked for interviews and an artist even produced a dance performance based on «Crowns and Tears». But what moved me the most was all the feedback. People who wrote to me that they were touched by this project.","«A Song of Crowns and Tears» is based on the official figures of the Swiss state. These figures are used to automatically generate punch cards. The song is imported from a MusicXML and placed on the graphics. The transformation is done with Python. The song itself was written manually using the available data in the music notation software MuseScore (more about how the music was written in the next question). The punched cards were printed on the home printer, glued together and punched in painstaking work.","What does a pandemic sound like? What does data sound like? My first attempt: Each note represents a certain number of deaths. After writing a few bars, I had to realise: That doesn't work. . Intensity and emotion in music is not about stacking more notes together. Sometimes nothing can hit you more than a quarter break. Dissonancec, tempo, chords, dynamics - so many things bring music to live. So I changed my approach and tried to write a corresponding soundtrack to the data. On the right side of my screen I had the data, day by day. Ond the left the music notation software. I went through every day in the data and looked for the corresponding sound, that respresents the data and still follows the rules of music. This was probably the hardest part. Writing the scripts that transfer music and data to punch cards was straightforward. Producing the actual punch card, on the other hand, was challenging and took dozens of attempts until the instrument was able to play the four-metre-long punch card correctly.","There are so many good Covid 19 visualisations, there is not much to learn from ""A Song of Crowns and Tears"".

Finland,Yle (Finnish Broadcasting Company),Big,Participant,,YouTube offered conspiracy theories and religious content to Finns searching for Covid vaccine info—Yle's study exposes the social media giant's blindspot,30/05/21,"Investigation, Infographics, Health","Personalisation, Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, Python","After Covid pandemia hit the world, YouTube had promised to strongly limit the spread of the vaccine disinformation and conspiracy theories on its platform. However, when people searched for vaccine information on YouTube in Finnish, the platform was not able to keep its promises, Yle’s investigation revealed. Instead of official and medical videos that YouTube had promised to raise, people were shown religious and covid conspiracy videos when they simply searched with the word “koronarokote” (covid vaccine in Finnish). In English, the results were opposite. YouTube corrected the problem after seeing the results of Yle's investigation.","YouTube's owner Google admitted that YouTube’s misinformation filter had not been active when users typed in the Finnish compound word for coronavirus vaccine into the search field. The platform corrected its filters after we contacted it with the outcome of our analysis in late May. That radically changed the search results millions of Finnish YouTube users got when they looked for videos with the word “covid vaccine”.  Instead of religious and anti-vaxx videos, they got medical, official and news videos among their top 10 results after Yle’s contact with Google. In Finland, under 35 year-olds started to get vaccinations in June-July, and under 25 year-olds in July-August. This means the age groups, who according to the specialist, use Youtube as their prior search engine, got more truthful and reliable information before they had to make a decision on covid vaccination.  According to Google’s own data, the word ‘covid vaccine’ was one of the most popular pandemia-related search terms in FInland in 2020 and 2021.  Without this story, the dis- and misinformation would have continued to spread freely in Finnish YouTube and Finnish users might still be affected by it. The story raised discussion on the big tech carelessness when it comes to small languages. We also received requests for help in repeating the investigation in other languages. In Finland, the story was picked up by several news media. Internationally, the translation got coverage by newsletters such as AlgorithmWatch and Coda. It was also  spread by the most prominent names of the big tech journalists. ","In February 2021, we created eleven different YouTube accounts, including two control ones. The accounts modelled YouTube’s most popular intended uses, which we gleaned from the platform’s own data, available research as well as the video giant’s most popular channels. We wanted to see if people watching different content got different search results on covid. The accounts were created on the same day using a location-masking VPN service. The VPN server was located in Finland. In terms of user information, we only provided YouTube with a birth year, a requirement for using the service. We identified Finland as our location. We created a 50-70 video playlist for every account. Each account watched its own playlist. For example, the account consuming news watched different news videos and American current affairs programmes. An account focused on entertainment viewed music videos and comedy content. All accounts saw content in both English and Finnish. After watching their playlists, each account searched YouTube using the most common covid related words defined by Google Trends. We saved the first 100 search results for each account in Goolge Sheets. Our searches resulted in 4,800 videos in Finnish and 3,598 in English from 477 channels. The working group then watched hundreds of YouTube videos to classify their content, and ended up defining 13 different categories such as mainstream media, government agencies, religious entities.The results were analysed with Python Pandas. YouTube search results did not appear linked to whether a user watched news or make-up tutorials. YouTube’s search algorithm simply did not block questionable content on covid from any account if a user did a keyword search. Yle asked YouTube why government messaging on coronavirus vaccines ranks below religious and suspicious vaccine content on the Finnish-language site. Just two days later, YouTube’s search results dramatically shifted.",- Creating a valid hypothesis followed by a solid investigation plan that was restricted enough. Without that everything else is useless.  ,"1) The results one gets when studying social media algorithms in action may vary profoundly depending the language used. The algorithm investigation is heavily dependent on English findings, but there is an urgent need for investigation on how the algorithms work and affect the societies in smaller languages. 2) Our study could be repeated in other languages.","English, Finnish",https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11951146,https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-11959362,,,,,,,"Satu Helin, Juha Rissanen, Päivi Koskinen",Satu Helin is a Data Journalist and foreign news reporter at Yle World news desk.

It has long been considered a truism in data circles that ‘if you can't measure it, you can't fix it'. Today, when the Indian government is relying more readily on data to design, implement and evaluate its policies and programmes, the use of incomplete or unrepresentative data can perpetuate, and even create newer forms of, inequity.     By shining the light on known or unknown gaps in public data, we sought to explain how this makes government policies less effective and inclusive while limiting transparency and independent critique. This ongoing series has sparked many a conversation about the need for better, open, and accessible data in India's public sphere, and many stories have been republished in several national and provincial publications, and cited in academic journals (examples below). In 2021, we've written about the lack of data related to Covid-19 in India and the resulting underestimation of deaths, on the lack of data on transgender persons, on Dalit Christians and Muslims, on migrant workers, and women's land ownership.

We perused reports going back to Indian Independence, and examined smaller surveys and reports commissioned by the government. We also filed several requests under India’s Right to Information Act, but many of these requests were met with a standard response: “No such data are maintained.” For instance, the story on Dalit Christians and Muslims had to depend on a report commissioned by the government in 2008, even as more recent data should have been available through the 2011 national census, but wasn’t. We relied on experts and members of the community to give us access to reports and insights on the data gaps.  We used OCR tools to glean information from some of the scanned documents, while many handwritten documents had to be studied manually. Further, to analyse what data were available, we used Google Sheets and Tableau.  ","Since many of the issues covered in the series are politically contentious–including caste, human rights, and welfare entitlements–there was a lack of open data, and a reluctance on the part of government departments to provide the information. We filed several RTI applications and appealed against the non-disclosure of information for several months.  We looked at decades-old data, spoke to several experts to understand the issues, and used their work to shine the light on inadequate information.  ","As countries around the world restrict access to good quality data at the right time, this series serves as a guide to journalists across the world to highlight the gaps and initiate conversations in the public discourse towards a truly open data culture.  We hope that such conversations in Indian journalism will urge governments to make more data freely available, which in turn will help an engaged electorate participate in evidence-based policymaking.  ",English,https://www.indiaspend.com/data-gaps,https://www.indiaspend.com/data-gaps/how-unreliable-data-on-dalit-christians-muslims-expose-them-to-discrimination-734972,https://www.indiaspend.com/data-gaps/20-months-in-gaps-persist-in-indias-official-covid-19-data-772670,https://www.indiaspend.com/data-gaps/access-to-toilets-sanitation-swachh-bharat-abhiyan-data-surveys-762488,https://www.indiaspend.com/land-rights/why-we-dont-know-how-much-land-women-own-734247,https://www.indiaspend.com/gendercheck/denied-visibility-in-official-data-millions-of-transgender-indians-cant-access-benefits-services-754436,https://www.indiaspend.com/health/why-india-needs-village-level-data-to-target-malnutrition-in-children-752252,,"Shreehari Paliath,  Prachi Salve, Shreya Khaitan, Karthik Madhavapeddi, Madhur Singh, Anoo Bhuyan, Shreya Raman, Pranab R Choudhury, Gokulananda Nandan, Archita Raghu, Snigdhendu Bhattacharya, Rukmini S","Shreehari Paliath,  Prachi Salve - Journalist, IndiaSpend Shreya Khaitan, Karthik Madhavapeddi - Senior Editors, IndiaSpend Vishal Bhargav - Producer, IndiaSpend Gulal Salil - Former Graphic Journalist, IndiaSpend Madhur Singh - Former Managing Editor, IndiaSpend Anoo Bhuyan - Former Health Reporter, IndiaSpend Shreya Raman - Former Data Reporter, IndiaSpend Gokulananda Nandan, Archita Raghu - Former Interns, IndiaSpend Pranab R Choudhury - Founder and coordinator of NRMC Centre for Land Governance, Bhubaneswar.

To show a scale of a problem and to prove most of them are artificial we have created a program that automatically finds and shows satellite photos of places on fire. The visualization currently covers the years 2018-2021 and contains around one thousand such photos. Over time, each week the program adds new photos with fires.","The fire kills animals, insects, and bacteria, it destroys fertile black soils. Millions of tons of carbon dioxide and other harmful gasses from fires worsen the air we breathe and makes global climate crysis even worth. Ukraine have the largest number of fires among all neighboring countries. Checking out our interactive visualization users can see what these fires look like. Satellite images in our project show that many such fires are created intentionally (fires appear simultaneously in many parts of the field). Farmers who burn stubble are involved in targeted arson. In fact, this method is guaranteed to quickly kill blacksoils. In addition, these fires can often spread to nearby forests or settlements. And they are a direct threat to human life. Our visualisation clearly shows the scale of the fires, partly created intentionally, and so points out the harmful effect from fires on arable land. Together with visualisation we add to the article comments about legal grounds of such activity and comparison to situation in other countries. Ukrainian society have to pay more attention to the problem in order to avoid harmful and moreover irreversible effect on arable land, which provide a huge part of national economy.","We obtain data for fires using the FIRMS service, which uses the results of monitoring the earth's surface by NASA / NOAA satellites. The satellites fly over every point on the Earth's surface twice a day, and their infrared sensors can detect heat sources in an area of about 400 by 400 meters. After receiving the data, we group the points with fire and select only clusters larger than a certain size to cut off minor / accidental heat sources and sensor errors. We also reject heat sources in industrial areas, which are present there almost constantly. We use the coordinates of each selected cluster as the coordinates of the fire, along with its date. All processing is done with a python script. After that, knowing the coordinates of the fires, our program tries to find and download a photo for this area, taken at the right time. To do this, we use Sentinel-2 satellite data from the European Space Agency. If a needed data for a place and time is available, we process it with a special algorithm to ""highlight"" the areas with flames in the pictures and to create  composite RGB images to show in our project. All data are obtained, processed and served with a custom-build python scripts. Sentinel-2 data obtained thru Google Earth Engine cloud service. Processed images and metadata are served trough API created in Django web framework. D3.js library is used to create interactive visualization.  ","The hardest part of a project was a method to find and process thousands of files with raw satellite data from which images created later. Although to obtain one such ""image"" is a relatively easy task, it's much more harder to do it for such a batch processing as in our case. After many attempts -- we tried at least five different services and libraries, at last we choosed  Google Earth Engine which in our opinion currently is the best platform for custom mass processing of satellite data, ready to use by teams with limited budgets. Second problem: in the original data there are no such zones of flame that you can see on visualization. We use special algorithm to highlight flames on images to quickly locate the fire. However, the zone of flame, which is completed by the algorithm, clearly corresponds to the places where the combustion takes place (this can be seen in the pictures). As far as we know this is a first such a project with constantly updating large collection of recent satellite images with fires.    ","Using open source data (in this case from European Space Agency) and different open source tools with a little bit of creativity allow journalists to visualize almost any story where remote sencing is involved,  even on very low budget.","English, Ukrainian",https://texty.org.ua/projects/105282/ukraine-there-are-about-20000-fires-arable-land-yearly/,https://texty.org.ua/projects/104757/v-ukrayini-shoroku-blyzko-30-tysyach-pozhezh-yak-vony-vyhlyadayut-iz-kosmosu/,,,,,,,"Yevheniia Drozdova, Andrii Harasym, Nadia Kelm, Illia Samoylich, Anatolii Bondarenko","TEXTY data-journalism team: data-analysts Yevheniia Drozdova, Illia Samoylich, Anatolii Bondarenko, designer Nadia Kelm, journalist Andrii Harasym.

According to the company, it was a one-time misbehavior, but was it telling the truth? Was it an occasional problem or is it a systemic issue? To discover the truth about recycling in Brasília, the capital of Brazil, this project tracked the recyclable waste. To do that, more than 60 GPS devices were thrown in the trash. We followed them for one month, and found out a panoply of problems.","The project uneathed serious problems in the recycling process in Brasília, the capital of Brasília. Following the investigation, several organizations contacted Metrópoles to understand how the investigations was done and how they could improve upon the findings. Among them were recycling companies and the Unops office in Brasília, which is in the process of adopting a zero waste policy. Furthermore, lawmakers in Brasília used the investigation to require explanations fro mthe recycling companiers. This is still ongoing. Tha investigation also gathered a lot of attention for the subject. Because of its repercussion, the author was invited to talk in the Zero Waste Internacional Conference. The event is a global event discussing good and bad experiences involving recyclable waste.","The investigation used a mix of techniques. The core of the project was using GPS trackers to find out where the recyclable waste ends up in Brasília, the capital of Brazil. To track it, we used a specilized software integrated with the devices and developded by Tkstar.  The device was the Tkstar 905, which has a battery that lasts more than one month and is waterproof. Each one of the devices requires a cellphone chip. We used M2M (Machine too machine) chips because they have a better coverage in Brazil and are less succeptible to be blocked due to spam messages. This is important because individual commands to the devices are send through standard text messages and they can be seen as spam by the network. Additionaly, we exported all the data in kml format so we could do our own analysis (using Python, specially geopandas, but also google maps) and also build our maps, using javascript.","The hardest part was to select which tracker to use. There are several models in the market, but only a few are in the market in Brazil. Some of them were too expensive. Others had battery problems. To find out which one would have the best cost/benefit relation to my project, I first talked with friends that had used trackers for various reasons. After that, I settled for 3 different possibilities and bought one of each to test it on the ground. I took it with me during my vacations and after it, threw them in the trash to track it. This allowed me to define the best tracker for the project. This was the fundamental pillar of the project. If I had made a bad decision, i would have thrown more than US$ 5000 lityerally in the trash with no usable result.","The project has a range of learning possibilities. The first one is to not accept that some investigations cannot be done because the data is not available somewhere. With technological advancements, it is more possible by the day for journalists to create their own datasets. As the project shows, it is true for any subject. Another outcome is that the project is replicable anywhere in the world. We did it with a lot of trackers (thanks to the Pulitzer Center, which provided a lot of the fundind) but this can be done also with a handful of trackers and a couple hundred dollars. Garbage collection is a major problem all around the world and what we did in Brasília can be done anywhere.

China,China Global Television Network,Big,Participant,,WHO's Covid-19 Origins Tracing,30/07/21,"Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Video","Animation, AR, Scraping, Python","The program analyzes what triggered the anti-China sentiments when the Covid-19 pandemic started. The conclusion is it was a mix of politics and media reports that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab. The data collected from media reports found the “lab leak” theory spiked due to two primary reasons: then US President Donald Trump promoting it despite no credible evidence, and an “exclusive” report by the Wall Street Journal, quoting a supposedly secret state intelligence source that was later found inconclusive. The program analyzes how the media set an agenda-driven narrative. ","The program was viewed 3.7 million times in five days on TV and social media platforms.   The data analysis provided an objective argument, showing another side of the Covid-19 story that the media has ignored to pursue a sensational conspiracy theory. One fallout of such reports was attacks on the Chinese and other Asian communities in the West. There were efforts at a smear campaign against China, with the Covid-19 virus dubbed the “China virus”.  Our program reminded people that despite Trump’s assertion that he had “credible evidence” the virus came from a lab in Wuhan city, there hasn't been a shred of evidence. His successor President Joe Biden ordered a 90-day investigation by intelligence agencies and that too drew a blank. The intelligence report supposedly quoted by the Wall Street Journal for its sensational article also admits there is no evidence to support the lab leak theory.  The comments on our program show viewers understood the manipulation by the media and realized the difference between evidence and speculation. It created a platform for rational thinking where people looked at other pandemics and possible sources that haven’t been investigated but ought to be. The biggest impact was it made people think for themselves. Interestingly, since then, the lab leak theory has not resurfaced. We feel our program, along with other responsible media, has a role in laying that fake theory to rest. Also, we are happy to note that when new variants of the Covid-19 virus resurfaced, no one called them after the countries where they were first reported. Again, along with other media, we think we have played a role, however small, in making people become aware of the importance of following science and rationality.","We chose five leading outlets dailies for a word frequency analysis. We determined three keywords: Wuhan, China and lab, and checked how many major articles these five had carried, using those words, between December 2019, when the first Covid-19 cases were reported, and August 2020, when our program was livestreamed. The search shortlisted 238 articles; there were more but we kept Opinion articles outside the ambit. Our data analyst used different codes to scan the five websites. We then used our exclusive Natural Language Toolkit developed for Headline Buster to draw up a list of high-frequency words. To better understand the connection between the contents of the reports, the pandemic, and public opinion, we also added the dimension of time to the analysis, meaning the dates when the articles were published. In addition, we calculated the degrees of similarity between words based on their vectors. For this we used the Word2vec model, an algorithm using a neural network model to assess word associations from a large corpus of text. We used a graph based on the frequency of two words, “lab” and “Trump”. Interestingly, it shows both peaked about the same time, which is a pointer that both were used in conjunction. The most possible scenario was that Trump floated the lab leak theory and the media reported it, attributing it to him.","The most challenging part was convincing our audience that the anti-China accusations were started by people who were not scientists, there was no proof to support what they said, and yet people tended to believe in such damaging conspiracy theories at a time when judgment was easily swayed by fear, vulnerability and loss of security. Since CGTN is a state-funded Chinese medium, it is often regarded as a tool for propaganda. But numbers and well-established data have a greater acceptability. In recent times, we have often seen how the Western media created false narratives, wittingly or due to vested interests. While Western readers are growing more critical of the media when it comes to domestic news, when it comes to China, they still tend to be swayed, especially when the media narrative is sensational. We have tried to show how bias can produce an entirely false perspective, which is then regarded as the truth, a trend that history has shown is exceedingly dangerous.","The key takeaway for journalists is to explore how to formulate counter-arguments when only one-sided or even distorted narratives dominate, and do it rationally and persuasively against great odds.",English,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrvsYXkZMvA,,,,,,,,"Yan MEI, Yan REN, Xin LIU, Xiaodi SHEN, Jing GAO, Nan ZHANG, Shiqu XIANG, Sudeshna SARKAR, Ruixin ZHANG, Yu DAI, Anqi ZHANG, Xingran XIONG","Headline Buster is a convergence media program that analyzes media headlines on China-related issues and tries to set the record straight in case of misrepresentation of facts.

India,Factchecker.in,Small,Participant,,SOSIndia4U,01/04/21,"Database, Open data, Fact-checking","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","SOSIndia4U verified helplines and information on oxygen, medicines and bed availability put out on social media during the second wave of COVID-19 in India. These were made easily accessible to anyone looking for help during this devastating second wave through an online app and through our social media networks. The project had an incredible all-women team of 8 researchers and journalists working nine hours a day, everyday, for 4 months.  ","The second wave in India led to a public health emergency and a shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and drugs. Several social media users as well as forwards via Whatsapp would put out information on the availability of these, but patients and their families were often wasting time on leads that were either false or old. To cut through the barrage of information, and help those in need, we verified helplines for hospitals, government control rooms, medicine, telemedicine, ambulance, blood plasma (until the government recommended stopping its use), food services for COVID-19 patients, diagnostic centres and oxygen suppliers. We also hosted information on vaccination centres and available slots on the app.  We found that contrary to popular belief, government helplines were more accessible and better placed than private contacts to provide emergency relief. In some cases, although the numbers provided to reach out to for help were accurate, they didn’t have stock or beds available at that time. We would keep in touch and update our database as beds would become available.  Between April 15, 2021  and July 15, 2021, we verified helplines for 135 cities, three union territories and both urban and rural areas in 1 state, Goa. We also verified 34 NGOs seeking COVID-19-related donations. We partnered with Truecaller that hosted our reliable COVID-19 relief information. Thanks to this partnership, over 3 million people benefited from verified information and leads at a time when they were desperate for it. We are also a part of the Covid Relief India Alliance (CRIA) for COVID helplines, and our database is available on their website  as well. This project was an amalgamation of our efforts at fact checking as well as of public service.   ","We used a hand-on approach–on average, each fact-checker made 40-50 calls per day for verification, resulting in a total of nearly 300 calls a day. We entered the information we gathered on two google sheets, one which had information gathered from social media posts. Then our team would call up these leads and verify the information, which was then entered into a second sheet, which was the database that was showcased on the website. In our efforts to find and verify leads, we looked at not just social media posts but also checked out other volunteer run helplines and other google docs and sheets that were being circulated as having verified information. By the end of the project, we had information on 11 categories of assistance that those with COVID-19 might require.  Unlike the other databases, many of which were volunteer-run, we chose to hire 6 full-time fact-checkers and 2 supervisors, who verified not only new information but also updated previously verified information. Most of our verifications had time-stamps so patients and families would know if it had been recently verified.  We had set up 2 helplines on social media platforms–a Telegram channel with 120 members and a WhatsApp helpline–which received 360 messages for help.   ","During India’s second wave of COVID-19, social media was flooded with both people asking for help as well as people posting unverified information on aid for Covid-19 patients. Some of these were fake, some were scammers, cheating people at their most vulnerable. SOSINDIA4U ensured people got the right information at the time of crisis, when every minute meant a life could be saved.  This was despite several members of our team facing tough personal times with 2 team members contracting COVID-19 in the midst of what had been, until now, the worst that India had seen in the Covid-19 pandemic. Across the country, there were at least 31.4 million confirmed cases and 421,382 deaths from the virus between April  and July 2021, when our project was operational.  Moreover, since the team was all women, there were instances of harassment when they would call to verify leads, especially when the leads were not genuine. In addition, there were emotional moments as often we had people in need reaching out for help from cities or areas for which we had no information.  Another discovery was that there was no information available regarding rural areas; even though we often followed up leads, most of these turned out to be dead ends, a frustrating experience for the volunteers. What we began to do was provide the information for the nearest urban area to those who reached out from rural areas.   ","In the chaos of the second COVID-19 wave, people came together to help others, but there were also many who tried to profit from people's misery. For instance, people would pay up and then realise that they had been scammed for even life-saving things such as oxygen. As journalists and fact-checkers, we felt that the least we could do was provide reliable information.  This project is an example of how a journalist, a fact checker's role, in such times, is not limited to news or telling stories but in providing the public with accurate and timely information that can save lives.   ",English,https://sosindia4u.com/#&ui-state=dialog,,,,,,,,"Prachi Salve, Isha Bajpai, Pragati Ravi, Flavia Agnes, Dania Ismat, Chelsea Arya, Amisha Yadav and Anwesha Ganguly","Prachi Salve is the project lead.

United Kingdom,Airwars,Small,Shortlist,,Mapping and documentation of all civilian harm during May 2021 Israeli-Palestinian conflict,09/12/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Human rights","360, 3D modelling, Scraping, QGIS, JQuery, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, PostGIS, OpenStreetMap","This entry is built around an interactive online map and report at Airwars.org comprehensively documenting for the first time all civilians killed and injured in conflict during the May 2021 conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants. Published on December 9, the map and report were the result of six months of research, geolocation and mapping. The work represents the most extensive available public record of the 11-day conflict, telling the stories of human suffering in the voices of those affected, including granular details of incidents, images of the victims, and video footage of the strikes.","Labelled by a New York Times visual investigator as “one of the most detailed and complete databases of civilian harm I’ve ever seen,” the map and report were shared thousands of times on social media, while Airwars' social media accounts had hundreds of thousands of impressions. The work has also been shared by multiple stakeholders with large audiences, such as prominent journalists and commentators on foreign policy in the UK and elsewhere. The interactive map, and accompanying report and database - available permanently and for free in Arabic, Hebrew and English - received positive coverage in more than 25 major news outlets, including The Times (UK), The New Arab, The Jerusalem Post, a New Lines investigation by Airwars staff, and The Intercept. As such it is expected to have a lasting impact both in the Middle East and globally.  On a policy level, the resource represents a key advocacy tool during negotiations at the United Nations in February 2022 on limiting the use of wide-area effect explosive weapons in urban areas. The findings were for example discussed by civil society organisations and British and European parliamentarians in a recent panel discussion, highlighting civilian harm concerns. Previously, Airwars' extensive archive of civilian harm data has been used for public engagement; as a critical element of major investigations by others (for example the recent high impact New York Times series on civilian harm); as the basis of United Nations and international agency probes; and as part of wider efforts to seek justice and compensation for victims’ families. We expect that this will be the case for this project in 2022. Airwars will also seek to further engage with Israel Defense Forces, and with Palestinian factions, to better identify civilian harm events and trends, and seek future casualty reductions.","We used a variety of open-source techniques to build comprehensive datasets of civilian harm from Israeli strikes in Gaza and Syria, as well as from civilian harm in Israel from Palestinian rocket fire. This began with in-depth primary language research by our specialists in Arabic, English and Hebrew to create nearly 200 individual assessments, featuring 5,288 unique sources. This involves a complete review of all hyperlocal sources, including social media posts from affected communities, local journalism, and deeper research and academic reports. Each of these assessments were then reviewed multiple times, before the dedicated geolocation team mapped each individual incident often down to the exact location. After building the archive, Airwars conceived of and designed the neighbourhood map in conjunction with the team at Rectangle, our regular design partners. This was plotted on Mapbox with shapefiles designed via QGIS, in consultation with Palestinians from Gaza to ensure local knowledge was properly reflected. The map included 3D protrusions based on neighbourhood to immediately identify which areas had seen the most bloodshed. Each area was linked to a database of images and individual assessments, so viewers would be able to scroll through images and stories of each civilian casualty. We produced similar maps for victims of Palestinian rocket fire inside Israel, as well as of civilians killed by Israeli strikes in Syria since 2017. Additionally, for Gaza we also mapped every single Israeli strike and every civilian harm incident onto a map of population density in the Gaza Strip, overlapping different datasets to illustrate a clear story. This is proving to be a vital resource for those seeking to explain the high risks associated with wide area effect explosive weapons use in urban areas.","The most difficult part of this project was the challenge of ensuring accuracy of information on the civilian status of individuals, while also remaining consistent with our approach used in all conflict monitoring to archive all locally reported allegations of civilian harm. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a particularly sensitive and contested one and the lines between civilian and militant are often deliberately blurred, both by the belligerents and by observers. As such, wrongly identifying a militant as a civilian, or vice versa, could have significantly negatively impacted the credibility of the entire research and data set. In order to solve this problem, we carried out a series of measures, including: - Scraping all the ‘martyrdom’ statements from the Telegram channels of the military wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and cross referencing these with every civilian reported to be killed during May 2021. - Reviewing all official Israeli military and government claims regarding the status of those killed, as well as other Israeli research organisations that made claims about them. - Regular contact with Israeli, Palestinian and international NGOs to check facts. - Multiple reviews of all assessments and comprehensive data quality checks to be certain all information was correct. - Ensuring that all information available was clearly archived to ensure transparency and encourage feedback. - Remaining consistent with our methodology used across all conflicts - whereby civilian casualty estimates are provided in ranges (lowest estimates, highest estimates) to take into account conflicting assessments of civilian status.  Although Airwars has a global reputation for the high quality of its conflict casualty reporting, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is both a mature and highly polarised arena. It was therefore critical that our engagment bring both unique insights into the conflict; with the highest quality work. We believe we have succeeded in this.","The May 2021 conflict between Israel and Palestinian factions receieved high and welcome media coverage at the time - though this was necessarily episodic and limited, particularly when understanding casualty and violence trends. Checking with local and international NGOs, it became clear that no one organisation was planning to build a comprehensive model of the violence, and that this was an expertise we could bring on this occasion. The project yet again shows the potential power of online and remote research in cases where political powers seek to use border crossings or battlefield restrictions to limit transparency and accountability. Gaza has been all but closed to the world since Israel imposed a blockade more than a decade ago. Due to Israeli restrictions, it is near impossible to get foreign human rights researchers into the Strip. This is a trend across the globe, with governments and militaries increasingly closing off access to seek to suppress coverage and dissent. Yet the victims of the recent conflict deserved their individual stories telling in a comprehensive fashion. Our own researchers based in the United Kingdom, Turkey, Germany, the United States, Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere worked together to overcome the physical distance challenges, and to document the stories of each victim. This again highlights the potential positive power of online research. Another key aim of our project was to examine the May 2021 conflict in the context of broader military trends - in particular the high risk to civilians posed by urban fighting. With its own extensive modeling of recent urban violence at Mosul and Raqqa, Aleppo and Tripoli, Airwars was, we believe, well placed to bring this additional key global perspective to the Israel-Palestine conflict.","English, Arabic, Hebrew",https://airwars.org/conflict-data/civilian-casualties-gaza-may-2021-map/?lang=en,https://airwars.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Why-did-they-bomb-us-ENG.pdf,https://airwars.org/news-and-investigations/gaza-israel-syria-ewipa-report/,https://airwars.org/conflict/israeli-military-in-syria-the-gaza-strip/,https://airwars.org/conflict/palestinian-militants-in-israel/,https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/gaza-and-syria-a-tale-of-two-israeli-air-wars/,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2021/jul/28/countdown-to-demolition-the-story-of-al-jalaa-tower-gaza-israel-palestine,,"Emily Tripp, Joe Dyke, Shihab Halep","Founded in 2014, Airwars is a London based international not for profit watchdog NGO, which specialises in tracking and understanding conflict civilian casualties at scale.

The recent extraordinary series of New York Times investigations into civilian casualties from US actions drew heavily on Airwars research on Coalition actions in Iraq and Syria - including the building of an app by the Times that used Airwars assessments and locational analysis, to help their own field investigators to triangulate incidents of concern in Mosul.  The Israel-Palestine project submitted here represents many thousands of team hours. Our comprehensive monitoring of secretive Israeli actions in Syria - the most extensive public record available - builds on almost four years of ongoing monitoring.

Sweden,Sveriges Radio,Big,Participant,,Uncovering personal data breaches in Swedish banks,20/05/21,"Investigation, Open data, Economy","Scraping, Python","Investigating Swedish bank websites, we exposed personal data breaches and security vulnerabilities. Avanza, with over 1 million customers, had designed their website in a way that made it possible for anyone to identify its customers. For over a year, Avanza also sent customers’ personal data to Facebook. Länsförsäkringar, with over 350,000 bank customers, tracked users without their consent and sent personal data belonging to customers to Facebook, and others. As we reported the story, Collector, a niche bank, discovered a breach of customer data to Facebook - but chose not to inform the public or report it to the authorities.","The banks that were leaking customer data almost immediately changed their websites when we started asking questions. Avanza made a complete overhaul of parts of its website, following our first report on how we managed to identify several senior government officials as customers in the bank using the bank's own web applications. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FI) initiated an investigation, which it later closed. Following the first story, we reported that Avanza had, for over a year, sent customers' social security numbers, telephone numbers and information from loan applications, to Facebook. Avanza initially denied this, but confirmed after we gave them a step-by-step guide on how to recreate our findings. FI opened a new investigation into Avanza after our reports on the breach of personal data to Facebook. Avanza and Länsförsäkringar, who according to our research leaked personal data from customer registration forms, also reported themselves to the Swedish Data Inspection Authority (IMY), which initiated formal investigations that are still ongoing. Both banks are risking fines related to GDPR breaches as a result of our investigation. In an interview, the Swedish Minister for Financial Markets, said that our investigation shows the need for new legislation. Many Swedish media outlets picked up our story. Our work was one of three projects shortlisted for The Swedish Grand Journalism Prize, Stora Journalistpriset, 2021 in the category Innovator of the Year. We continue to use the tools we developed for this project to uncover other personal data breaches. In September 2021 we revealed that the Swedish Equality Ombudsman (DO) leaked personal data of people who used their website to report discrimination to an external company. The data leaked included sensitive data relating to health and more. DO estimates that information was leaked about hundreds of individuals, and is now being investigated by IMY","We started by setting up our own website and activated various trackers. We added different HTML elements and used the information we gathered, by interacting with the website while changing settings on the trackers, to build Python scripts that extract posts of personal data being sent to a third party, from a browser HAR log. We built a Python script that we used as a “first detection” tool, to filter out websites that were using trackers with specific settings that we had previously identified as particularly sensitive. After that, we collected data from banking websites, including data while we were logged in as customers. This process, of collecting browser network logs, was done manually. In total, we collected around 200 HAR logs for about 10 websites. We used the Python scripts we built to extract relevant information from the logs. Because we collected the data manually, we got a first look at all data that was being sent to and from the websites. On Avanza’s website, we noticed that they had an open endpoint that allowed for anyone to check if a user was registered or not. Since we were investigating how banks manage customer data, we started to look for ways to identify actual customers - and we found one. In essence, Avanza had two functions that - when used together - could be used not only for “user enumeration” but also to connect each user to a specific social security number. Using another Python script, we managed to connect several senior government officials to accounts in the bank. One of the people we identified was the previous chief legal officer at the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, whom we also interviewed for our story.","We encountered many challenges in this project, the list below shows some of them.   Could our results be impacted by A/B testing? To be certain that developers running experiments weren’t impacting our results, we always collected logs across different browsers and versions of browsers.   What is being collected by a tracker? We built our own website and interacted with it to fully understand what various trackers collect.   How and where do we draw the line between personal data and no personal data? Every time a website forces a user’s browser to communicate with a third party, personal data in the form of browser user-agent and ip-address will be received by the third party. In our reporting, we only highlighted websites that were sharing personal data generated by the user when, for example, submitting forms, logging in et.c.   What if the cookie policy allows for the sharing of the data? We read all privacy/cookie policies of the websites we investigated. In one case we had to call in legal experts to help us decode what these policies actually said.","We’ve seen a lot of journalism investigating tracking online. Some of it has focused on the mere existence of trackers on certain sensitive websites. This makes sense because that data collection can be fully automated. By adding manual elements to a data journalism project, in this case parts of the data collection, we can sometimes learn new things. If you’re interested in uncovering the kind of breaches we did, start interacting with websites and save your browser’s HAR log while you do it. Submitting web forms is a good place to start. When you build scripts, strive to make them reusable to help you answer similar questions in the future.",Swedish,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/natbankens-sakerhetsmiss-gick-att-identifiera-kunder?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/avanza-lackte-kunduppgifter-till-facebook-i-over-ett-ar?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/lansforsakringar-sparade-webb-besok-utan-godkannande?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/bank-lackte-personuppgifter-till-facebook?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/expert-pa-banksekretess-om-avanza-lackan-ett-overtramp?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/ministern-valdigt-oroande-uppgifter?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/efter-ekots-avslojanden-natbankernas-lackor-granskas,,"Sven Carlsson, Sascha Granberg",Sascha Granberg is a reporter and data journalist at Sveriges Radio.

More importantly, data show that the Italian band managed to place itself at the intersection between Anglo-Saxon and Italian rock, leading to a mix of the two traditions. Maneskin also has a peculiar relationship with keys. Their most used key is b minor, which shouldn't be. Yet, if you listen to their songs, they have a melancholic aftertaste thanks to their liberal approach to","The project contributed to explaining the success of Maneskin but, also, it has shown that you can do a different kind of musical journalism. Musical critique, usually, is a speculative subject: it rarely takes musicological tools to understand, in particular, pop phenomena. Here, thanks to the data provided by Spotify, I was able to broaden the perspective and get to see a bit more of the secret sauce Maneskint put in their music. I have not the ambition to change musical journalism with this single story but, at least, this kind of data allows readers to get a better understanding of rock music beyond personal tastes and with as less bias as possible. ","I randomly selected rock bands from Italy and from the Anglo-Saxon world and downloaded their discography from the Spotify API. Then I performed a factorial analysis. The factorial analysis allowed me to associate energy and acousticness (as provided by Spotify's proprietary algorithm) into a parameter I called strength. Danceability, valence (aka positive sentiment), and liveness went into what I called cheerfulness. Then I produced (on Tableau public) a scatterplot with cheerfulness and strength divided into four squares. From the top-right in an anti-clockwise sense: - King of the Party - Party but not too much  - Malincholyc rock  - Solemn Rock  This allowed me to better describe what Maneskin does differently from other bands. Here, I provided two views: band-level (average song) and song-level. At the bottom of the chart, it is possible to select one band and compare it to Mansekin.  In addition, I performed a quantitative analysis of keys (major/minor plus details) and an analysis of rock trends over the last 50 years. ","The hardest part of the project was to find a not-too-technical narrative. How do you explain factorial analysis to the layman? Secondly, the hardest part of the project was the first chart. There, you can select and compare band by band to see how similar or different they are to one another. I had to write some code in Tableau to program it and to use parameters to define the song/artist visualization. ","Other journalists can learn that data is not limited to politics, economy, crime, or the environment. Rather than a subject, data is a method of doing journalism based upon a multidisciplinary array of skills and tools and, more importantly, replicability.

We found that the investments into rental flats increased with more than 700% between 2009 and 2020. We have visualised these trends and found that reports of negligence and abusive tactics by corporate landlords are consistent in the cities researched. We also found that often local governments don’t know much about the precise situation in their cities and the investment going into their housing markets.","Politicians, researchers, NGO’s, advocacy groups, and even real estate agents, architects and other housing professionals approached us forour methodology and data. Most notably, the Greens/EFA group at the European Parliament in preparation for a study about the financialisation of housing in Europe, demanding the introduction of transparency registries about corporate landlords. A Member of the Flemish Parliament currently working on this topic contacted our media partner Apache. Politicians also took our research into parliament. In Norway, there were reactions from politicians at the local and national levels, and the Finance Minister had to answer a question about the topic in Parliament. In Spain,an MP mentioned one of the articles in Parliament. Other colleagues were inspired by our research. The head of investigations at Al-Araby, a Qatar-based media outlet, contacted us when planning a similar research in Arab countries. A freelancer journalist in Atlanta, US, contacted us to tell us they are using our methodology as inspiration for research there. Dutch De Correspondent would like to follow up on our investigation and methodology to cover the situation in the Netherlands. Our work was cited in news reports and academic papers. In Norway, several media outlets published editorials about our project (Morgenbladet , Avisa Nordland, Kapital). The project was mentioned in the academic paper, “The value of the city. Rent extraction, right to housing and conflicts for the use of urban space”. The team members were invitedto talk about the research at (online) conferences and debates, among others Dataharvest - European Investigative Journalism Conference, VVOJ (Dutch-Flemish investigative journalism conference), or the Barcelona Housing and Renovation Forum. Our team members were interviewed for radio and podcast, notablyPUSHBACK talks with Fredrik Gertten and Leilani Farha, the former UN Special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing.","To collect the data we used multiple methods. Where scraping was needed, it was done with Python (requests & beautiful soup or selenium). Much information on the corporate landlords was sourced from yearly reports by a collaborative data collection in spreadsheet templates. Data analysis and cleaning was done mostly in Python (pandas) and excel. Using open source software focused on the privacy of our data is important to us. The actual collections, as well as the collaborative spreadsheets were therefore hosted in a Next Cloud environment on a server administered by an Arena team member. Our regular meetings were done via open source video meeting software BigBlueButton. For the publication of more than 30 interactive customizable graphics, we built a framework using d3, mapbox.js and reusable vanilla JS UI components.We had to accommodate a wide range of use cases from single iframes to pages with many graphics embedded directly in the article. We used code-splitting and on-demand loading of libraries to make sure to load as little code as possible while reusing code across graphics. All graphics were translatable and customizable (colors, highlighting data points, headings and texts) in a purpose-build backend built with Django REST-API with a frontend built using Vue and a UI framework (Vuetify) was used for the backend. Despite this backend, we made sure that the graphics could be hosted statically to ensure reliable hosting for all participating organizations. We chose to stay with commonly used types of dataviz, to focus on details (such as adaptive legends for maps that take into account the data visible in the current view of the map) and a good localization (CMS embed, number formatting, idiosyncrasies such as ""mil milliones"" in Spanish, translatability even of the data, e.g. the transliteration of company names into the greek alphabet).","Finding all the relevant data was a big challenge, as the sector lacks transparency in ownership and consolidated data sets on the city level. Therefore, to build our datasets we had to use a wide range of techniques. Some corporate landlords publish the listings on their website – we have scraped those. Some publish amounts of apartments they own in their yearly reports – we have extracted this data manually. However, some hardly publish anything at all. We have collected dozens of reports on real estate and rental markets from various sources (consultancy companies, banks), but most of these did not cover the cities we needed. In the end, most of our data on the actual names and investments of corporate landlords on the city level from a lengthy negotiations with a private business that collects data on real estate markets (Real Capital Analytics). The context data proved to be equally tricky. Eurostat collects a lot of data that is comparable across countries, but little on the city level. As living conditions and demographics in cities differs from the average country data, we could not use country data. We have dug into all the local statistical offices for context data but not every data point was comparable across the different sources. Methodologies for even seemingly simple measures as average household income proved to be very tricky (median disposable, net disposable, gross disposable, per adult, ...). It was even difficult to compare average rental prices. For example in Berlin, rent prices are including water. In the end we managed to make some of these data comparable. We found a dataset on cross-border comparable rental prices for our cities literally the day before the publication. Translatability and context-specific adaptability of the shared visualisations was also a big challenge (see section above).","Two elements of this collaboration stand out. By making this reporting cross-border, we could capture an European trend on the local level. Tenants learn that they are not alone: they read about the abusive practices and other troubles they face in their own city, but they can compare to other tenants across Europe. This is crucial, since politicians on European level can step in with regulation measures. This contextualisation was highlighted by the shared visual language of all publications. The shared data visualizations made possible by the custom back-end built by the Innovation Lab at Tagesspiegel allowed for each graphic to be translated and adapted to match the language and the look and feel of the publication medium. As the back-end used the same data for all the graphics, even last minute changes in the source data were not a problem, as they would be if every newsroom would create their own graphics. We have also commissioned an illustrator to create a series of illustrations for all the articles. The colour scheme of the illustrations was also adaptable. – in harmony with the visualisations. The second element was the post-publication knowledge directory (see at the “main link to your project”) we have created. Here we collected all the articles that were published within the project (68 up to date), and we also share our methodology, limitations of the available information, and a data catalogue. Here we describe for example the data availability and comparability, what to pay attention to, what are the problems we encountered, but also share links to resources elsewhere. As we were getting many questions about our methodology, this directory makes it easier for any journalist,s or researcher or student of journalism to pick up the topic and further develop the reporting and research themselves.","English, German, Norwegian, Italian, Spanish, Czech, Greek, Dutch, French, Portuguese",https://cities4rent.journalismarena.media/,https://dublininquirer.com/2021/04/28/company-landlords-are-promoted-as-more-professional-but-what-are-tenants-finding,https://medium.com/athenslivegr/cities-for-rent-b9d1bb2bba02,https://collaboration.journalismarena.eu/s/pBgcR6kmMD575GB,https://collaboration.journalismarena.eu/s/GGzY5Ppfk6iNc93,https://collaboration.journalismarena.eu/s/ZdZrC6pWAW56tCd,https://cities4rent.tagesspiegel.innovationlab.berlin/,,"Jose Miguel Calatayud, Adriana Homolova, Hendrik Lehmann, Alexandra Siebenhofer, Steven Vanden Bussche, Gaby Khazalová, Alexander Abdelilah, Sotiris Sideris, Lois Kapila, Alice Facchini, Steinar Rostad Breivik, Micael Pereira, Manuel Gabarre, Christian Zeier, Catherine McShane, Peter Hendriks, Peter Sabo, Brigitte Alfter, David Meidinger, Benedikt Brandhofer, Nikolas Zöller, Nikolas Leontopoulos, Alexia Barakou, Moritz Wienert, Jakub Nakládal, Mathieu Périsse, Anna Thewalt, Helena Wittlich, Sinan Reçber, Lorenzo Bagnoli, Sara Pinho.","Editorial and overall coordination: Jose Miguel Calatayud, Spanish freelance journalist and project director with Arena for Journalism in Europe, based in Berlin in Germany Data coordination: Adriana Homolova, Slovak-Dutch freelance data journalist and data coordinator at Arena for Journalism in Europe, based in Utrecht in the Netherlands Data visualisation coordination: Hendrik Lehmann, German journalist, head of the Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab, based in Berlin in Germany Data visualisation programming lead: David Meidinger, German journalist and web developer, lead developer at the Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab, based in Berlin in Germany Team members by country: - Alexandra Siebenhofer, Austrian journalist and editor at ORF, based in Vienna in Austria – Steven Vanden Bussche, Belgian journalist and editor at Apache, based between Merelbeke and Antwerp in Belgium – Gaby Khazalová, Czech journalist and editor at Deník Referendum, based in Brno in the Czech Republic – Bo Elkjær, Danish investigative journalist at Information, based in Copenhagen (contributed, but did not publish) – Alexander Abdelilah, French-German freelance data and investigative journalist, member of the WeReport collective and publishing with Mediapart, based in Metz in France – Sotiris Sideris, freelance data and investigative journalist, co-founder of AthensLive and data coordinator at Reporters United and publishing with both those media outlets, based in Athens in Greece – Lois Kapila, British journalist, co-founder, journalist and editor at the Dublin Inquirer, based in Dublin in Ireland – Alice Facchini, Italian freelance journalist publishing with IrpiMedia, based in Bologna in Italy – Peter Hendriks, Dutch journalist at Follow the Money (FTM), based between Utrecht and Amsterdam in the Netherlands (contributed, but did not publish under Cities for Rent name) – Steinar Rostad Breivik, Norwegian journalist and editor at E24, based in Oslo in Norway – Micael Pereira, investigative journalits at Expresso, based in Lisbon in Portugal – Peter Sabo, Slovak investigative journalist at Aktuality, based in Bratislava (contributed, but did not publish) – Manuel Gabarre, Spanish freelance lawyer, researcher and journalist publishing with elDiario.es and Ctxt.es, based between Jaca and Madrid in Spain – Christian Zeier, Swiss investigative journalist and co-fouder and editor at Reflekt, and also publishing with Republik, based in Zurich in Switzerland – Catherine McShane, British freelance investigative journalist based in London in the UK (contributed, but did not publish)",

By doing so we helped the health industry to understand this trend better and know better how to cope with it. It also allowed us to :    move away from the mere PR advertising - which are far too common in the field of innovation - to report on the real transformation of the pharmaceutical industry based on tangible data   establish a solid database on the use of digital technology in clinical trials in order to design indicators that can be updated and compared over the coming years   This 3-articles story, illustrated with a dozen charts, was mind Health's most read in 2021.

This represents approximately 370,000 studies, the oldest of which date back to 1931. For each study, there is a wealth of information: the subject, the sponsors, the countries where the study was conducted, the therapeutic areas concerned, etc. The information is provided and updated throughout the study by its sponsor or principal investigator.   ClinicalTrials allows anyone to download this gold mine in the form of thousands of XML (Extensible Markup Language) files. We started by selecting only interventional clinical trials (observational trials are not included in the study) and then searched all the information associated with each trial (title of the study, abstract, etc.) for defined keywords. For example, for trial management technologies: CTMS (clinical trial management system), e-CRF, eCOA and econsent. For telemedicine technologies: telehealth, teleconsultation, telecare, homecare and remote site monitoring. These keywords may not always be as comprehensive as we would like, and some terms may be common to clinical trials that do not include digital.  We used Python to analyse the data, Datawrapper and Flourish to make them visual. ","When we decided to launch the project, the first step was to select a list of keywords that would indicate the presence of digital technologies in each of the 360,000 clinical trials we uploaded.   Afterwards, the challenge was to find a solution that would allow us to transform thousands of XML files into a single database. In Python, we created a function that transforms the XML files into Pandas rows that are then assembled into a single dataframe. After this, it was easier for us to select the clinical trials that match our criteria and the fields that we wanted to analyze. The clinical trial data is filled in by the sponsor, therefore the data was sometimes incomplete or filled in in different ways. We had to select, clean and standardize it in order to get the best insights during the analysis.   Finally, we had to find out which clinical trials were interesting to highlight for each digital technology.

Conservatives, including the current President, Jair Bolsonaro, argue that the exam fails to measure a candidate’s ability because of items that they perceive to be biased. The criticized questions are often those regarding the country's military dictatorship, women's rights and LGBTQI+ themes.We analyzed billions of responses from millions of students over the past 11 years to verify if these test items effectively assess their abilities and we found that Bolsonaro criticism is unjustifiable. ","Jair Bolsonaro, current Brazilian President, has been trying to change questions present in the Enem test since taking over the government. This effort has a technical argument as its formal justification: that certain items would not measure the students' proficiency and would only be on the test to promote ideological indoctrination. To our knowledge, this is the first time a group – journalistic or academic – has put these claims to test. Thus, the findings presented here, that the justifications presented by the president are false, are unprecedented. Furthermore,  we have shown that other items, which were not targets of Bolsonaro's criticism, are inefficient in the assessment of a students' knowledge. This conclusion was corroborated when we found that correct answers on these items were not considered for the final grade of the students. In other words, the model used by the institute responsible for the test (Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira - INEP) identified that these items were unfit to the point that getting them right did not give any information of how good the student was, leading to no increase in the final grade. None of the millions of test participants were aware of this at the time, since the parameters for calculating the grade are not disclosed by the government.  This article was the headline of the Folha de São Paulo newspaper, one of the largest and most traditional newspapers in the country."," Techniques:  Item response theory (IRT): To make the theorical model of expected answer from the students according to their abilities.

We have based our analysis on the Item Response Theory (IRT), a complex statistical model used to estimate the ability of students in different areas. This model is the same used by Enem to calculate students' grades.  Hence, our analysis is based on the same assumptions that the test uses.  Moreover, one of  our journalists  took a college course on the subject, with one of the greatest specialists in the field in Brazil, in order to obtain the necessary knowledge for the analyses Structuring the PostgreSQL databases was a complex operation, as it was necessary to store 12 billion responses from 70 million students who took the tests between 2009 and 2019. This structure was further hampered by the lack of standardization of the files from different years provided by the government. This work took 3 months. After this step, it was necessary to create codes in R to assess whether the items were able to discriminate students according to knowledge, that is, whether, for each item, the chance of getting it right was related to the student's ability in the area of ​​knowledge. Finally, there was extensive effort on coming up with a visual solution to best demonstrate the complexity of the theory in an understandable way for the reader.

The data is drawn from a poll of 1,000 health care workers conducted in September 2021.","We heard from numerous health care professionals, including an NIH scientist who worked on a COVID-19 vaccine, that our reporting on these issues, particularly mental health and burnout, was meaningful to them during a time when health care workers did not feel their voices were prioritized in the national dialogue on COVID-19. The issues we highlighted have remained in the national spotlight since we published the series, helping policymakers and other public leaders draw distinctions between anecdotes and widespread perceptions of vaccine skepticism, mental health challenges and more among both frontline health care workers and support staff.","Morning Consult’s internal survey research team developed the polls, with input on the questions from reporter Gaby Galvin and editors Matt Bracken and Brian Yermal Jr. The survey interviews were conducted online and the data were weighted to approximate a target sample of health care workers based on age, gender and race. These weights were based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for health care practitioners and technical occupations and health care support occupations. Results from the full survey have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Morning Consult conducts interviews using a diverse global network of trusted survey panel providers that reach tens of millions of adults. In selecting panels, Morning Consult first examines European Society for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR) documents that contain a uniform set of 26-28 questions for survey panels on topics such as sample sources and recruitment, profiling data, respondent privacy and data security, data quality and validation and incentives. Respondents complete the surveys online via Qualtrics using desktop computers, laptops or mobile phones. Where applicable, we rotate or randomize matrix or grid-based questions to reduce potential primacy and recency effects; there are also rigorous quality assurance checks in place, including speed (respondents are removed if they complete the survey in less than 4-5 minutes), randomly generated addition/subtraction and pattern problems, satisfaction measures and more. Respondents may complete a survey at most once every 3 days. Each panel uses their own unique procedures for recruiting participants. We were able to get results very quickly after the survey was fielded, meaning our reporting was highly timely and newsworthy. The results of the survey informed which stories we would pursue and the sources we ultimately contacted for the stories.","To our knowledge, we are the only U.S. newsroom with fully in-house survey research capabilities, making this a collaborative, time-intensive project. We also sifted through thousands of open-ended responses (particularly for our story on the future of the health care workforce), a gargantuan effort over several weeks. We did the poll and series as a follow-up to a January 2021 project exploring similar challenges for health care workers, with the goal of assessing whether the situation had worsened, gotten better or stayed the same. We identified that the pandemic's toll on health care workers hasn't abated since January 2021, helping to inform public discourse and policy and business decision-making.",Other journalists can use -- and have used -- our series as a springboard to explore the environment for health care workers in their own communities.

The aim of the project was to create an ""online issue"" mapping the web of cultural places located in Budapest. The data collection was made by the team of Budapest Brand: a survey of several aspects (size of venue, location, distance from transport hubs, collaborating people and places, etc) was sent to 10 chosen cultural places deemed to be important hubs in Budapest. From their responses the ATLO team created the two main elements of the project – the interactive map and the network graph – and added a reader platform for the",The three-day event where the interactive website was showcased was visited by hundreds of people amid the coronavirus pandemic. It was reviewed by several major online news site during the publication period. The project also attracted the attention of Nightingale editor-in-chief Jason Forrest.,"The project started with data collection. Budapest Brand – a subdivision of the Budapest Metropolitan Municipality Mayor's Office – created a survey in Google Sheets, that was sent to the 10 major hubs of the city. Data collection resulted in hundreds of cultural locations that are in the city and are in some way connected to these hubs – let it be collaborative work, partnership, etc. For the project, PhD student Zsolt K. Horváth wrote a study about the history of the cultural life of Budapest, that resulted in several new locations. Previous collections of historical locations were also used. The map was made in Mapbox GL JS, and the network graph was made in Flourish. The site was written in HTML code, and several extra elements – such as the article reader, the menu – are custom-made.","The hardest part was creating the parallax effect while keeping the loading time of each element failry short. Since a lot of elements are stored in the final .html file, optimisation of the site was crucial and thus the most difficult to achieve. The site works best on newer computers, on any browser, or on iOS Safari on the iPhone. It also had to be created in a short time, since data collection and data cleaning took a long time with many revisions. A big portion of site was made in the final week before launch. Because of the parallax effect, more than one Mapbox element had to be inserted to the project. Krisztián Szabó, who coded the entire visualisation site, had a prior experience of 1,5 years of coding data visualisations and interactive maps, though many methods were first used in this project. Data collection was also a difficult task. Since there were no such projects created in Hungary before, no datasets were available that included cultural locations of the past and the present. Few online static maps were made, but most of the data was gathered now for the first time. The site is not complete regarding locations, and there is a questionnaire that anyone can fill out, adding data about past or present locations that were not included in the initial data collection and on the visualisations.  ","The project shines light on the interconnectedness of a city's cultural life. Many of the locations that the main hubs added to the dataset were not only connected to them, but to many other hubs and other smaller locations as well. It also shows that, historically speaking, most of the locations centered around the inner and older parts of the city, which might be true to any other capital cities of the world. A good lesson of this project that even though there might not be any data available about a certain topic, community data collection can go to great lenghts – it can bring to light aspects of life that otherwise might be forgotten or looked over. From this project, data journalists can learn the power of interactivity. The site has some explainer texts, but it is mostly explorative. The split screen method (showing an interactive map or network graph while one can read an article) is an unusual approach to telling a story, but with this, we wanted to give more control to the user: they can decide wether to read a story or to explore the dataset, all simultaneously. The lesson here is that giving control, allowing users to explore a story to their liking can result in a great user experience – not every story can or has to be ""force-fed"" to the readers.",Hungarian,https://terkep.alternativbudapest.hu/index.html,https://szabokrisztian.me/portfolio/altbp/,https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9up3gtph55eia08/AABvcmbiKC_MI3DHvfFLcvMla?dl=0,https://twitter.com/Jasonforrestftw/status/1462442306926268424?s=20&fbclid=IwAR3sA4p53LDO8_0B-tkXK_DUyyChxt_KDwDTpdsgWpvsQpdCcKUaz256ouE,https://jelen.media/5_perc_szunet/schonberger-adammal-2540,,,,"Ádám Schönberger (project leader), Emma Heinzelmann (project manager), Zsolt K.

Netherlands,Pointer (KRO-NCRV),Small,Winner,"Pointer, based in the Netherlands, infiltrated Telegram groups to uncover a troll army that was spreading misinformation about COVID vaccinations.  The reporters went undercover for three months to identify themes and analysis on the Telegram messages, then used OSINT techniques to find the organizers of the group called The Troll Army.",The Digital Army,20/05/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Illustration, Video","Animation, Personalisation, Scraping, Json, R","Pointer infiltrated a Dutch troll army of over 750 members. In a Telegram group disinformation about the corona vaccine and anti-corona demonstrations is shared. Thanks to social media analysis, Pointer finds out which accounts are involved in this troll army. On a daily basis, they share the links that are shared through this group. Pointer went undercover in this group, discovered the accounts behind it and found out who is driving this troll army. Publications include an online scrolly production, a news article, a making-of and a TV broadcast.","With this project, we were the first to encounter a Dutch-speaking troll army and analyze it from within. We presented our research in a number of different forms to reach different audiences including an online scrolly, news article, making-of and a TV broadcast. The latter had the most impact because we showed on TV how these groups were organized. It did very well for Dutch Television, attracting 370,000 viewers with competition from the Eurovision Song Contest. The three largest Dutch news media took over our news including public broadcaster NOS, RTL and the nieuws site nu.nl.","For our investigations into misinformation, I keep an eye on several Telegram groups. Through some searches on the open web, I end up with a spider web of strange Telegram groups: pedo hunters, dark markets, expo's groups, and the group called The Digital Army.  We wanted to follow this troll army for three months to see how they were organized. During this period, we scanned all the posts in the group several times to accurately analyze the conversations. This gave us a good idea of who the main characters are in this group. Through the data analysis in R we also got an idea which topics were often discussed, and which urls were shared.  Often these were links to websites that had not been distributed before. We also scrapped Twitter to see which accounts were spreading this misinformation right after it was shared in the troll army. Again, you can compare the language used by the group and social media accounts side by side. Over time, you can link a number of accounts together, and estimate the size of the troll army. In addition to this data analysis, we conducted an extensive OSINT investigation of the three protagonists. This constantly revolves around linking information and data we find online. For each of the three protagonists, we created an extensive research document, in which we place each clue. Through OSINT investigation, we were able to link the founder, leader and most loyal follower of this troll army to individuals with 100% certainty.  Via the open web you can search for invite links on Telegram. Then it also becomes clear how Telegram groups are structured: you can find all kinds of dubious groups via a kind of Starter-page like channels with countless links. The Digital Army is one of them.","The OSINT investigation provided the most headaches. These individuals want to keep themselves anonymous, but unwittingly give away some information. For three weeks, I churned out countless leads. Sometimes it was about a specific photo: if I could find out where it was taken, you get closer to where that person lives. Or I could say with certainty what someone's social media profile is: then you can use that to find information about someone's email address or phone number. Each clue leads to the next (half) clue. And the ultimate goal is to find out someone's name, hometown and contact information. With a lot of sleuthing, dead ends and luck, we were able to unmask the three main characters. We spent about three weeks on this OSINT investigation. For The Digital Army, we went undercover in a Dutch troll army for three months. Some people will know troll armies as the Russian factories where dozens of people behind countless screens and social media accounts bombard the world with misinformation. However, this is a completely digitally organized troll army. The participants barely know each other beforehand, and try to feed each other new tactics and messages via the social media app Telegram. This is the period just after Twitter and Facebook started banning all kinds of conspiracy theorists from their platform. Not much had been written about Telegram and misinformation, and certainly not from within. Through an innovative way of storytelling we take the viewer into the chat group of The Digital Army. To experience how it's like to be a part of these kinds of Telegram groups. Especially now, during the pandemic we find it important to show which persons are behind the spreading of disinformation and misinformation.","In 2015, an office building in St. Petersburg was still the image we had of a troll factory: a physical office building where dozens of people with hundreds of fake accounts try to steer public opinion. But in 2021 that image is outdated. Coordinated troll armies are now much easier to organize digitally. And that includes The Digital Army. Pointer discovered this troll army in early 2021, and spent some time investigating how they spread disinformation about the corona vaccine. In addition to online campaigns, they also created and distributed actions to physically intimidate mental health professionals, politicians and scientists. With every big investigation Pointer publishes a making-of article. Other journalists will thus get an inside look at how we work at Pointer. Often with the described methodology and challenges we face during the research process. This time we exposed the tactics of these misinformation spreading groups. This may also give other journalists ideas for their own investigations.

My main goal was to investigate the hidden connections between MPs and determine the most influential MPs amongst the MPs of monocoaltion. ,"The investigation was useful for different stakeholders who works closely with the current MPs. The list includes the advocation centres, journalists, diplomats etc. It gives the understanding with whom it's best to consult or cooperate when you want to be heard, who is the best partner in spreading important information, which figures amongst his MPs are important for the President.  After our publication where we revealed the main figures, one of them was appointed as First Deputy Chairman of the Parliament. Besides, one of the MP from top-10 was appointed as the chairman of the 'Servant of the People' party. ","The data preparation was made in RStudio using the open data of the Parliament regarding the initiators of the bills. In R I created the nodes and links data tables which were then used in the network instrument called Gephi (not in the list).  In Gephi I calculated the main measures for the network analysis and created the network graphs with nodes according to the faction and size of influence. After graphs were improved in Photoshop, where I combined the network graphs and bar plots.  Talking about the interactive network of MPs connections, it was made in the library called shiny with help from the d3 library from RStudio.","1) Data preparation took time because I needed to create the nodes and links table.  2) The building of the online network application in R which has several containers according to factions\groups, committees and hidden groups.  3) Network Analysis in Gephi - it took time to delve into the measures and create the appropriate graphs.  4) Storytelling - for a while, I couldn't have decided on the focus I want from the investigation of hidden connections, but then I decided to concentrate on the main political figures and let users investigate the interactive network for themselves. ",The network analysis can be easily applied to the Parliament of every country where data regarding bills activity is available for everyone.

And as part of that journey, we learn about their daily lives training in Kenya, the East Africa cuisine and culture and their calories' tally. All based on solid data and academic research on nutrition, presented in a seamless, engaging narrative with cool retro-8-bit illustrations to appeal to non-sporty-geek people, particularly young and female. Sit at the table with Eliud and Brigid, and even try cooking some of their recipes!","The project, published in 28 languages, achieved its main objective: connecting an audience not keen in following sport or the Olympic Games in particular, with Olympic marathon runners, their lives, their work, their culture, their food. And it was a good opportunity to focus on Africa, which is very much line with the BBC World Service's mission of ""bringing the UK to the world, and the world to the UK"". The average engagement time has been above 70 seconds, with the majority of the audience accessing the content on mobile. Aside from the positive impact on our audiences, it was a great opportunity for colleagues from different teams to work together for the first time, having started with a pre-2020 Covid lockdown Olympics brainstorming session. After a one-year hiatus, the research resumed supported by sports nutritionist, Dr Justin Roberts from Anglia Ruskin University. It was the close collaboration with the Africa and Near East teams that lifted the project off the ground, and secured the interviews with both Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei . This was achieved despite the general apathy surrounding the Tokyo Olympic Games, not knowing up to the last minute whether they would actually go ahead or not. It was certainly the team's perseverance, resilience and enthusiasm that brought it successfully to the finish line. ","The design of the scrolly was inspired by 8-bit videogames from the 90s and features gamified athletes’ avatars. The development was based on our standard scrolly code base, incorporating new elements of interaction within a scrolly, like and expand / contract box option, which are now part of our modules library. There was also work synchronising the narrative with the different illustration elements - even if you scroll back up. For the data processing, we used Google spreadsheets.","The most challenging part was finding a robust, reliable, consistent data for a particular sets of sports that clearly showed the amount of energy required by different sport disciplines, and the kind of diets related to them. And then, build an interesting, engaging narrative around them, bearing in mind the key objective of attracting non-sporty-geeky audiences. Also, the idea of doing our original field research was completely out of the window due to the pandemic restrictions, so we had to rely on already existing data. With the clock ticking, an applying strict project planning, we defined a ""minimal viable product"", focusing on Olympic running, and only after securing the basics there, we made a bid to get Eliud and Brigid in their training camp in North Kenya, and when getting a green light on that, everything else fell into place.","Don't be afraid of thinking big. Get the right sources, get the right specialists to help you understand the information, what is relevant. Check, check, check, and check again. Do not make generalisations.

The findings of the project are rather negative since only a quarter of the perpetrators are punished, while the rest manage to escape the punishment by different means. Moreovee, the project also discusses the processes in which parents/legal guardians of children take part in perpetrators's escape to get punishment. ","Due to langauge barriers, since the project was published in English and english speaking medium, it did not bring much reaction by the members of Kyrgyz community. Thus, it did not bring any community discussions as expected too except for the social media discussions. ","In the process of data collection, I used several online and application scrapers as Tabula and Webscraper tools because most of the needed data were in PDF formats or on websites. I also learned how to use google extensions such as Table Capture to get data from web pages. All the data was collected and analyzed in Google Spreadsheets and Excel, data visualizations were done on DataWrapper online service, and the illustrations were drawn on Adone Illustrator. Some data on the published news in Kyrgyz media on child sexual abuse should have been looked through by me personally. ","The hardest part, most probably, was the interview parts with the experts and human rights advocates since the topic holds very sensitive character, therefore some details discussed with them also gave psychological pressure to me as to a person who was not trained psychologically. Moreover, since the project is connected to children, and especially touches upon such topic, ethical moments should be discussed with the editors/supervisors in every thesis that was made. I could not include human stories and collect them by myself to support the data and the hypothesis, thus I needed to use the stories that are already were published by news agencies. The access to information part was also challenging -- the data from the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Internal Affairs had different numbers in one question, and it required quite long time to get the response from these two Ministries. The last, since the project was done during the first period of the world pandemic, it was quite problematic to get in touch with crisis centers, experts, ministries, statistical offices etc. ","This project does not focus only one question such ""How bad is the situation with child sexual abuse in Kyrgyzstan"" but takes furyher steps to discover ""What is being done to  fight with this"" and then shows the whole picture with the court and crime statistics which gives the rather sad conslusion that this case is vicious circle. As for the formattng, there are some ideas that good data projects better to focus to one hypothisis, however, as a data journalist, I prefer to show the whole picture of the situation -- and I belive that this project of mine proves that this approach can also be successful. ",English,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/why-child-sexual-abuse-kyrgyzstan-remains-unpunished/,https://rus.azattyk.org/a/31331609.html,,,,,,,"Tom Rowley, Paolo Sorbello","I am a freelance data journalist (previously based in Bishkek, currently in Vienna) covering different topics as human rights, economics, healthcare, ecology etc. Currently pursuing a Master degree in Nationalism Studies at the Central European University.  I started practicing data journalism as a journalist through Data Journalism Fellowship by Internews Kyrgyzstan where I was accepted while being a student of a journalism major at the American University of Central Asia.

Canada,Le Devoir,Big,Participant,,Ghost children of residential schools,18/06/21,"Explainer, Documentary, Chart, Map","D3.js, Google Sheets, CSV","On May 29, the discovery of the remains of 215 children buried at the site of a former Indigenous residential school in Kamloops, British Columbia, created a shock wave across Canada. However, the phenomenon had previously been thoroughly documented : the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada issued a report in 2015 revealing that at least 3000 children that attended residential schools had died - and the cause of death of half of them remains unknown, due to lack of documentation. Our project shed light on what we know - and still don't know - about those children.","While the information in this project wasn't new, it was largely unknown, and that is why we felt it was important to bring it to light. After the Kamloops discovery, many people were starting to realize this facet of Canada’s past. Six days after this project was published (June 18th), another discovery of anonymous graves occurred in Saskatchewan, once again bringing the matter up to date. Radio-Canada Toronto (CBC French Services) contacted us to discuss the project on their radio show (see project link 4, 8:50). It was the first time that a radio station invited us to speak about a data visualization project on air. Since we are located in Montreal and the radio show was in Toronto, it made us realise our project had an impact in other provinces.  Since we are located in the province of Quebec, our project shed light on former residential schools that were located in our province, making Quebeckers aware that these institutions also existed near them, and that it is not only something that happened in Western Canada, where almost all the anonymous graves have been discovered to this day. We described how many schools were located in Quebec, where they were located and for how many years they were in function. The project was also the main subject (front page) of our newspaper's Saturday's special paper edition « Perspectives » (see project link 3, page 13-14-15 of PDF). ","Olivia, the data visualization developer, mostly used D3 to create the project’s visual. For my part, the majority of the data was extracted by hand. I first tested some charts in Google Sheets ahead of time, to test their potential and test which representations read best for our readers. Once the plan is established, it reproduces the selected graphics with D3. We also pulled a map and a graphic from a geojson file from the Canadian Encyclopedia.","The hardest part of this project was certainly the access to the data and the manual labor that it involved. All the data can be found in the TRC report, entitled “Missing Children and Unmarked Burials” (see project link 5). It is a PDF document filled with tables and charts. Most of the data has been taken from the chapter on statistical analyzes. Several data were drawn by hand from the tables, and sometimes from the text. A lot of the raw data displayed in graphs were missing from the document - not even as an appendix to the document. Some charts like histograms and bar charts happened to be very relevant, but it was impossible to reproduce them or deduce the data since the axis was not always the most precise. After much research, we thought about using the very same graphics from the PDF document (screenshots with permission of the authors), but we concluded that it would affect the visual aspect of the project too much. I finally took steps to get in touch with the author of the statistical chapter to request the exhaustive data for the report. The process was tedious, as the commission's authorization was required as well. I finally got all the data for the report after a few weeks.","I get the impression that when people think of data journalism, they immediately think of big databases, open data, or huge files that need to be cleaned up. I think data journalism is also about going into reports and paper documents to look for a little gold mine. Especially to cover old historical events, many archives contain a wealth of relevant data to put into context. I believe it is important to consider it, even if it implies the data would be in textual form or in PDF formats, and that it takes more manual work and time to convert. I also think that journalists can learn that it is relevant to illustrate data that is missing: our reflex is often to cover and illustrate tangible data, but less often to visualize unknown or missing information.

The resulting Minnesota's Diverse Communities survey reached more than 1,500 residents with oversamples of Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Hmong, and other Asian (non-Hmong) populations to gain valuable perspectives from racial and ethnic groups across the state. The survey data is available to the public with the goal of increasing awareness of perspectives across Minnesota's communities. The project first published on 11/20 and is ongoing with 10 installments","This project in ongoing. Thus far, through this collaborative project, APM Research Lab survey and reporting has resulted in:  Three virtual events/community conversations plus one more in spring 2022 Six survey reports on the following topics: COVID impacts and vaccine acceptance, policing and criminal justice, discrimination, inclusion, news consumption and trust in the media, and trust in public schools. One more on arts and culture is coming soon. Three corresponding blog posts: good news and good ideas, statewide responses to discrimination compared to a national study, and hopefulness now compared to four years ago. One response panel featuring seven thought leaders and researchers Seven stories published by MPR News and/or Sahan Journal and shared through more than a dozen media outlets across the state One podcast feature -- Counter Stories Several internal presentations and collaborations to apply learnings in meaningful ways for MPR programming. Interest by other organizations to learn and use methodologies established by this survey","Minnesota’s Diverse Communities is a public opinion survey that provides a representative picture of the opinions and experiences of several racial and ethnic groups in Minnesota. To do this survey effectively, we partnered with a valued partner SSRS, a charter member of the American Association for Public Opinion Research Transparency Initiative. We oversampled populations that are typically underrepresented in most surveys. Prior to the survey, APM Research Lab partnered with MPR Community Engagement team to conduct listening sessions across the state with participants identifying as Black, Indigenous, or people of color. The listening sessions informed the survey and listening session participants helped test the survey prior to implementation. The survey invitation was sent by mail and follow up was done by phone. Surveys were also translated in Spanish and Hmong languages. Transparency disclosures and methodologies are published on the Minnesota Diverse Communities web page and data files are available upon request. In the reports, APM Research Lab used a variety of techniques to detail the survey’s findings including charts, maps, video, photography, etc. ","This is a groundbreaking survey since most surveys in Minnesota have not focused on as many distinct racial and ethnic groups as we sought to reach with the Minnesota’s Diverse Community Survey. This is largely due to the fact that the more narrowly you define your target populations, the harder it is to attain a statistically significant sample size. It took us several years of effort to build partnerships and raise the funds needed for such an undertaking. Even so, we had to make tough decisions with the resources we had. For example, Minnesota has a large Somali population, and we had originally hoped to include a representative sample of Somali adults in addition to the other groups represented in the survey. While we reached more than 40 Somali respondents we unfortunately ran out of time and money to gain a representative sample.","Two of the virtual events invited Minnesota journalists and community leaders to learn about the project and asked questions.  Participants were interested in the project for reporting and some were interested in replicating for their geographic area or using some of the methodologies for a survey that was already planned.  In addition, journalists were introduced to perspectives and stories that they may not normally seek out.  Minnesota’s Diverse Communities tells a broader picture of where we are doing well as a state and where we are struggling to support BIPOC communities.",English,https://www.apmresearchlab.org/mdc-survey,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/11/survey-black-minnesotans-have-far-less-trust-in-police-than-do-white-residents,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/08/20/new-survey-finds-white-unvaccinated-minnesotans-strongly-against-covid19-shots,https://share.transistor.fm/s/19cba0a4,https://sahanjournal.com/culture-community/minnesota-discrimination-survey-people-of-color/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikExTk9rYK4,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/10/08/survey-many-minnesotans-distrust-media,,"Craig Helmstetter, Kristine Liao, Benjamin Clary, Alexandrea Kouame","Craig Helmstetter, Managing Partner Craig Helmstetter leads the Research Lab, directing the overall agenda and developing new projects, as well as providing hands-on analysis and reporting.

The project to develop the largest palm grove in Central Africa, spread over 60,000 hectares in southern Cameroon, has aroused the wrath of environmental NGOs and indigenous populations.  Despite the social guarantees promised by those in charge of the project, notably the construction of schools and health centres, as well as the creation of 8,000 direct jobs and nearly 10,000 indirect jobs, Camvert remains in the eyes of NGOs and indigenous populations as the myth of sustainable forest conversion.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)","The Camvert project is an emblematic case of those projects tainted by illegalities and abuses of indigenous rights that exacerbate deforestation and even the climate crisis. The reportage we intend to produce aims to raise national and international awareness of the ecological and climatic damage caused by non-compliance with legal procedures for forest exploitation and management in Cameroon and the Congo Basin, the planet's second green lung. This should contribute to the adoption of better forestry practices by both local populations and industrialists.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)","As part of our survey, we used a map to locate our collection area.

Georgia,Indigo,Small,Participant,,Territoriality of the Georgian Orthodox Church,21/12/21,"Database, Open data, Map","Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Territoriality of the Georgian Orthodox Church is Indigo’s project led by Dr. Tornike Metreveli (PhD in Sociology). The project was created in 2021 with financial support from the University of St. Gallen. This database describes churches and monasteries in the country’s territory, lists the immovable property owned by the Orthodox Christian Church of Georgia, and thematically categorizes the epistles of the Catholicos-Patriarch of Georgia. Given the limited access to information, the data do not cover the occupied territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. ","The project was published in December, only a month before, therefore it’s complicated to speak about the impact and its measurable indicators. Despite such a short period, the project has already contributed to public discussion, as it was widely shared via social networks. up to 10K users have already visited the map. Some media outlets have been interested in the project and asked to explain how to use it. They plan to prepare long reads based on it. While head of programs at high educational institutions also invited us to present the project to students. In spring we plan to arrange a conference and discuss project results with journalists, scholars, and representatives of religious institutions.   ","To collect the data we use open sources, personal communication, field work. A total of 1,335 individuals provided us with information on churches in 3,633 villages. Information about 88 churches was collected on the ground. some Information about the churches and monasteries was provided to us by the local diocese, while data on the buildings in 4 Municipalities was offered by local city halls. As for the immovable property relies on official data retrieved from the Public Registry.  We analyzed applications filed by the Patriarchate with the Public Registry, unisng cadaster codes of relevant territories we requested documentation from the Public Registry to confirm property rights. demographic data were retrieved from the website of the National Statistics Office of Georgia which covers the results of the latest census of 2014. In addition, epistles published on the website of the Patriarchate of Georgia and the Orthodox Christian website www.orthodoxy.ge were analyzed. 10 topics most frequently addressed by the Patriarch were identified. Based on inductive and deductive approaches, thematic categories were defined and added to predefined themes. Next, the content analysis came into play to identify both latent and manifested meanings. To visualize collected data we have created an interactive map. chart.js, jquery, leaflet, mapbox were used for development. The first part is a map related to churches and property of it, while the second part is the categorization of epistles. The map includes 33 filters, which can be used for data analysis. As for the narrative part, 13 filters are enabled. Visitors can zoom in and click on each icon for further information. All data is available to download as an excel file. ","This project is the first in Georgia to have inventoried the churches and monasteries in the territory of the country. The data encompass 3,407 structures built from the 5th century to 2021, both operating and functionless churches or sites of cultural heritage. Buildings, where no divine services are held or held only on great feasts, are listed as functionless in the database. The data regarding the immovable property of the orthodox church is also unique. None of this information is centralized even in Orthodox Church itself. We collected information and proved that this institution owns more than 60 000 000 m2  of land which is equivalent to an area of 3 big cities in Georgia. The most of lands (62%) are transferred from the government for free, which means that public property now is under the Orthodox Church ownership. The map enables visitors to track the building process of churches and registration of property. On the other hand, the narrative section thematically categorizes the epistles of Catholicos-Patriarch Ilia II which gives data to understand the correlation between key messages of epistles and getting property from the government. In Georgia where the Orthodox Church is one of the most privileged and at the same time closed institutions, collecting and publicizing such data is more important as information on public property owned by Orthodox Church now is disclosed and publicly available. It promotes debates on the relationship between government and the Church, its privileges, state benefits and etc.  ","The database is open-source, which can be used in various directions. It will give the scholarly community and interested bodies to extract, examine and communicate data from the fifth century to today. Journalists are able to prepare in-depth materials on the tendency of transferring public property to the Georgian Orthodox Church. When and where starts massively building of churches, which territory is the most covered by monasteries, which eparchy is richer and analyses roots such redistribution.  Apart from this, the huge amount of data is a significant base to be used as a secondary source for journalists. They can refer to it while working on religious issues as well as benefits to the Orthodox Church, compare their property to another religious institution and visualize tendencies.  Until now there was no such database and all decree on transferring public property to the Church was followed by discussion based on only impression and attitudes as there were only pieces of news materials, fragmentized stories that did not enable the audience to see the bigger picture. ","English, Georgian",https://toc.ge/map/en,https://toc.ge/narrative/en,,,,,,,"Tornike Metreveli, Nino Bakradze, Ia Asatiani, Manana Ghoghoberidze, Aydan Yusubova, Nana Bregadze, Ekaterine Basilaia","Tornike Metreveli - Postdoctoral Researcher in Christianity, Nationalism, and Populism at Lund University.

United States,Crunchbase News,Small,Participant,,Something Ventured,12/05/21,"Database, Open data, Business, Women, Economy","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Venture capital has increasingly become the lifeblood of American entrepreneurship. And yet, of the record $316 billion in venture capital invested in the U.S. in 2021, low single-digit percentages went to Black, Latinx or female entrepreneurs. In Crunchbase News’ ongoing Something Ventured series, we’ve taken a data-driven reporting approach to explain how and to whom capital is distributed in the United States, how the industry can provide better access to opportunity to all entrepreneurs, and why diversity in the startup ecosystem matters to the nation's economic well-being.","Something Ventured exposed not only the current state of inequity in the world of venture capital—admittedly bleak for underrepresented startup founders—but also showcased potential solutions by highlighting the efforts that are reducing this funding gap. For instance, in a July report, we found that Black startup founders received just 1.2% of total venture investment in the U.S. through the first half of 2021. As staggeringly low as that sounds, it represented a marked increase in funding to Black startup founders in the U.S., both in terms of overall dollars invested and as a percentage of the overall venture capital spent nationally.  Investors and founders we spoke with said George Floyd’s horrific murder was a catalyst, inspiring programs aimed at helping Black startup entrepreneurs access capital, connect with investors and get support as they grow their companies. We also found that as the investors themselves become more diverse, there was a follow-on positive impact on who receives funding. For example, there have been small but notable increases in the number of partner-level venture capitalists in the U.S. who are Black. The sources we spoke with for Something Ventured say that in turn has helped more Black and Brown founders receive funding. The news is not all good. Joanna Glasner reported that the percentage of VC funding to U.S. female startup founders actually fell in 2021 from an already low figure. While actual dollars increased—alongside an overall boom in VC funding to U.S. startups generally—women-led startups received a smaller share of that funding.  By quantifying these inequities, Something Ventured played an important role inspiring change in the powerful world of venture capital in 2021. By highlighting the steps helping to close these gaps, we demonstrated that this problem is in fact solvable. ","Crunchbase News is a newsroom that operates independently within business intelligence software company Crunchbase and utilizes the company’s unparalleled private company information in its reporting. This database includes traditional firmographic information like company size and location, but also hard-to-find data such as funding rounds and investors. We’re able to track companies as soon as they first raise funding, at which point they start showing up on our reports. Crucially, Crunchbase is an open platform that startup founders can access to add themselves and their early funding rounds and become a visible part of the ecosystem. This is especially key for Crunchbase’s Diversity Spotlight feature, which launched in 2020 and offers the most comprehensive source available of ethnicity, race and gender data about private company founders and investors.","Launching the Diversity Spotlight feature was a significant challenge. Race and ethnicity data is sensitive, and the meaning of race varies in different parts of the world. In addition, people need to self-report at scale for the data to be meaningful. Before June 2020, we thought this would be too challenging. Everything changed after the murder of George Floyd. Crunchbase knew that adding race and ethnicity to its database could both clarify the state of inequities in funding and help VCs connect with diverse startup founders. We started with the U.S. market, and for feedback and access to existing data partnered with organizations active in the Black and Latinx community including the Black Founder List, Black VC, Stanford Latino Entrepreneurship Initiative and the women’s entrepreneurship group All Raise, as well as investors. Once the feature launched, our findings confirmed the inequities that many suspected. We npw have a perpetually growing database that offers an increasingly comprehensive view of improvement or regression on these stark statistics. In the first year after Diversity Spotlight launched, close to 1,400 contributors added diversity data to Crunchbase. Our efforts to spotlight inequities in the business world via our Something Ventured project were not always welcomed. Many founders and investors were reluctant to offer criticism of the industry. They may believe, understandably, that speaking up will hurt their chances of receiving future funding or conducting deals in an industry that revolves around networking and relationships. Venture capital is also inherently optimistic —investors and startup founders tend to put a positive spin on things, even when the data shows slow progress. By speaking with enough people, including successful Black and female entrepreneurs who felt comfortable offering critiques of the industry, we were able to provide a realistic perspective on what's happening.","Journalists around the world rely on Crunchbase’s Diversity Spotlight data and the reporting in Something Ventured for their own stories.  Data from these efforts was picked up and amplified by dozens of other news outlets in 2021. The majority of these publications cite the shockingly low percentages of venture funding going to underrepresented groups, as originally reported in Something Ventured. For instance, in July, Crunchbase News reported that only 1.2% of all venture funding went to Black startup entrepreneurs. This data point was then referenced and credited in articles that appeared in The Wall Street Journal, ZDNet, Inc., Insider, Ebony and many others, and helped spark further discussion and calls for change.  In September 2021, we found that companies with solely female founders raised just 2.2% of all venture funding through the first 8 months of 2021. This data point was referenced and credited in articles that appeared in Fast Company, Forbes, Harvard Business Review, CBS News and others and continues to serve as a reference point in the industry. ",English,https://news.crunchbase.com/something-ventured/,https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/,https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-black-women-founders/,https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-blockbuster-venture-investment-female-founders-funding-falls/,https://news.crunchbase.com/news/fastest-growing-states-venture-capital-investment/,https://news.crunchbase.com/news/states-low-vc-investment-something-ventured/,https://news.crunchbase.com/news/josh-fabian-metafy-something-ventured/,,"Gené Teare, Marlize van Romburgh, Chris Metinko, Sophia Kunthara, Joanna Glasner","Gené Teare leads Crunchbase News’ data reporting efforts as our Senior Data Editor.

The digital interactive, “This is Myanmar's State of Fear”, produced by Al Jazeera’s 101 East team is a forensic investigation into the military machine behind the violence and fear sweeping the authoritarian Southeast Asian nation. The multimedia piece puts disturbing cases of alleged torture, mysterious deaths, disappearances and detention without charge under the spotlight.  State of Fear” features rare interviews with army defectors, people who lost loved ones in post-coup violence and politicians from the deposed government now in hiding.","Using rare detainee testimonies, field reporting and satellite technology,  the team uncovered a secret facility allegedly used for interrogation and abuse located in a military compound on the outskirts of Myanmar’s largest city Yangon.  Al Jazeera worked with investigative agency Forensic Architecture to locate and digitally recreate the centre. They showed how the facility was rebuilt weeks prior to the coup.    Before publication,there was scant knowledge of the exact location of the facility and its existence was little more than a rumour. This digital reconstruction informed society of what was going on inside this facility, where hundreds of people allege they have been detained and abused Some dissidents have been killed in mysterious circumstances after being detained by the authorities. The reporting team gained access to unseen footage of a politician who died in custody which revealed severe injuries to his body which was drenched in blood, undermining the military’s official account that he died of a heart attack in custody. Although rumors about his death were widely shared online, this investigation shed new light on the event with hard evidence. With the foreign media’s access to Myanmar severely limited, most media organizations have struggled to cover this challenging news story and been forced to rely on foreign academics or diaspora voices as commentators. The unique strength of this reporting prompted the UN agency responsible for examining atrocities in Myanmar, the IIMM, to ask the 101 East team to share their evidence and witness testimonies to help with their investigation.  Sky News UK, TRT World and other media outlets have also reported on the key findings of 101 East’s investigation.  The combination of compelling first-hand accounts and forensic investigation makes the team’s unique coverage of the Myanmar coup and its aftermath worthy of a Sigma Award.  ","This digital interactive piece featured audio interviews and eyewitness accounts captured by a reporting team based in Myanmar.  The project also features timelines, data visualizations and other multimedia which have been curated in a scrapbook style to mimic the nature of the investigation. This content and its presentation helps the user to understand the context of what is currently happening in Myanmar and the process of information gathering. The team chose to publish the names of  6,994 detainees and their occupations - a digital memorial of those arrested during the first six months of the coup. This choice of presentation urges readers to understand the scale of the issue, whilst also dignifying the individuals who have been detained.   Photos and videos sourced directly from families of victims and from across social media were used to create a digital memorial of people allegedly killed by torture. The team handled this graphic content with sensitivity, highlighting the impacts of the coup on individuals without gratuitous violence. This piece was coded in AMP, a lightweight language to ensure quick load times regardless of hardware, to ensure this project reaches Global South digital audiences with limited internet bandwidth. The interactive ‘This is Myanmar's State Of Fear’ has been widely shared on Myanmar social media platforms.   ","The 101 East team gathered the core evidence for this online investigation in an incredibly difficult and repressive reporting environment.  In the aftermath of the coup, the junta has sought to prevent media coverage of events in Myanmar. It has closed independent television stations, online news outlets and newspapers, and arrested scores of journalists. The authoritarian regime has already convicted at least six journalists for violating a new provision of the penal code that makes it a crime to publish or circulate comments that they claim spread “false news” or “cause fear”.  Producing this digital project was an ambitious, risky endeavour yet vital to informing the world about what is happening under military rule in Myanmar. This reporting was spearheaded by Ali Fowle, a correspondent who spent nine years in Myanmar and was on the ground in the country's biggest city, Yangon when the army takeover occured.  Using her extensive contacts, Ali interviewed deposed politicians in hiding, former detainees and their families as well as demonstrators who feared imminent arrest.  She documented army brutality as the death toll rose, faced the constant risk of arrest and navigated internet shutdowns to produce this unvarnished, yet nuanced coverage from the frontlines. The 101 East team won the trust of sensitive interviewees who feared jail or death for speaking out against the military. The production team found secure locations to ensure that these interviews could be conducted safely. Ali’s long-term connections with activists and intimate knowledge of the country allowed her to navigate this sensitivity and obtain access other foreign media were unable to manage.  ","This quick turnaround digital piece was created in less than two months and capitalized on reporting materials gathered by an investigative unit of television reporters who made two longform documentaries after the coup in Myanmar.  Journalists can use ""This is Myanmar's State of Fear"" as a blueprint to reimagine television content for a digital audience.  It should be noted that Myanmar is one of a number of repressive reporting environment in the world right now.  Other news organizations could use this digital interactive as a model to report in authoritarian nations where press freedom is non existent and media access is difficult.  ""This is Myanmar's State of Fear"" is also a model of important international reporting and clearly puts the current issues into context for an audience unfamiliar with the politics of the country using timelines and clear explainers.    With human rights abuses occurring daily across Myanmar, investigations such as those done by Al Jazeera's 101 East team are vital examples of public interest journalism, providing a voice to the voiceless and holding the military junta to account. Combining corporate and forensic inquiry with field reporting, this interactive is an agenda-setting piece of digital journalism which serves as a key investigation into human rights abuses following Myanmar’s coup.  With the crackdown showing no signs of abating, this piece of online journalism is a powerful examination of how civilians have vowed to keep fighting for democracy, whatever the cost.","English, Burmese",aje.io/myanmarcrackdown,https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2021/myanmar-state-of-fear/index.html,,,,,,,"Rhiona-Jade Armont, Ali Fowle, Drew Ambrose, Nick Olle, Aun Qi Koh, Liz Gooch, AJLabs, Forensic Architecture, David Boyle, Jenni Henderson, Forensic Architecture","101 East is Al Jazeera English’s weekly current affairs programme about issues in the Asia-Pacific.  The documentary program launched in 2006 and operates out of Al Jazeera's Asia bureau in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. They have produced an impressive range of documentaries about Myanmar since 2011, when the Southeast Asian nation transitioned from army rule to a civilian government.   Aside from television programs, 101 East produce in-depth multimedia pieces, virtual reality videos, gamification, comic book storytelling and data visualizations to engage web audiences.  101 East’s digital journalism have won the SOPA award (Hong Kong), a Venice TV Award (Italy), two Overseas Press Club of America citations, a Society of Digital News Design Award of Excellence (USA) and was highly commended twice at the Drum UK Online Media Awards.    ",

Venezuela,Prodavinci.com,Small,Participant,,La promesa rota: el colapso de la seguridad social en Venezuela (The broken promise: the collapse of social security in Venezuela),23/02/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Open data, Infographics, Economy, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel","Prodavinci evidenced how the Venezuelan State confiscated the savings of workers. We collected 20 years of data on salaries of teachers, university professors, and employees who earn minimum wage to calculate how much has fallen the value of the pension and savings available to Venezuelans during their retirement. Five million people depend on this income to survive, and the analyzed data allows us to show the vulnerability of older persons in Venezuela. The value of the pension in 2000 was the equivalent of $ 311.06. Twenty years later, it’s the equivalent of $ 0.94 (a drop of 99.70%).","Prodavinci is the only Venezuelan media that has demonstrated the loss of the value of retirement in the last twenty years. In our research, we found that the value of the pension in 2000 was 330 times higher than in September 2020. Venezuelan workers who retired in 2020 contributed up to 57 times more to Social Security than they will receive in pensions throughout their old age. A Venezuelan university professor contributed $16,426 to Social Security in 20 years of work, but the system will pay him back just $ 281 over the next 25 years. He would need to live 1,459 years to get his savings back. Older persons are pushed into poverty by not having enough resources to pay for food and medicine. The pension used to be enough to cover an average of 92% of the food basket. In the last 20 years, the average coverage dropped to 76%. For the pension to cover the value of the food basket, the State must have to transfer to all beneficiaries at least an additional 8,396 million dollars during the last 20 years. If the pension had maintained the value of the food basket, 55.40% of the people of retirement age (more than one million) would have come out of poverty. The project won a Special Mention in the National Journalism Contest of IPYS Venezuela (2021), and the authors were invited to the Latin American Conference on Investigative Journalism. The Permanent Forum of Social Security of the postgraduate course in Social Security of the Central University of Venezuela invited Prodavinci to present the research findings in a forum broadcasted on YouTube. Due to the content of social interest, HumVenezuela -an information platform created by civil society- and Mediosur -an independent media initiative- shared the project.","We gathered salary tabulators for public education teachers, full-time university professors, and public employees' salaries to compare the value of retirement between 2000 and 2020. We took data from the Ministry of Education, notes from the Ministry of Communication and Information, and documents provided by the Venezuelan Federation of Teachers. We found data from different years in individual studies of university professors, reports from the Human Resources Directorate of the Central University of Venezuela, and the Association of Professors of the University of Zulia. We consulted Official Gazettes for each month between 2000 and 2020 to carry out the time series on the minimum wage. The information was organized in a database in Excel for later analysis. For this project, the concept of retirement value is the addition of pensions and social benefits. However, the most relevant indicator is the value of the pensions because they depend entirely on the state system. We also used macroeconomic indicators for calculations, for example, inflation and food basket. To facilitate the comparison of the data, especially in a country where the value of the currency and other economic indicators changes continuously, Prodavinci calculated the value of pensions in United States dollars from the minimum wage and its conversion with the exchange rate between bolivars and dollars.  To fully catch the collapse of the Venezuelan social security system, it was necessary to establish projections to understand the value of retirement for those who today are beginning to be retired workers. We applied financial mathematical calculations under the parameters indicated by Venezuelan social security laws. As part of our strategy, we asked experts to accompany us in the data processing and analysis. Our methods and strengths as a team are based on alliances with members of the academy and with specialists in specific areas.","Due to official opacity, there is no public information available in Venezuela about social security or poverty in old age. The data we needed to start was scattered in individual studies or reports from universities' human resources departments, and not all used the same method. So first, Prodavinci had to gather the data in one place. The team invested at least 6 months to assemble 20 years of salaries from each case study (teachers, university professors, and public employees). It was also necessary to confirm all the data, comparing it with different resources. Having overcome the challenge of building a strong database, we are faced two challenges. The first was applied financial methods to project the retirement value for the workers who ceased their activities in 2020. For this reason, we sought advice from economists and financial experts. Their help was vital before, during, and after the investigation, through constant communication and review of the calculations. The second challenge was to deal with the polarization of the information about inflation in Venezuela: the National Assembly has different information from that handled by the Central Bank. At that time, they're politically confronted. Due to the enormous difference between the results, we decided to show the data from both institutions. That allows perceiving the complexity of this problem in the context of the Venezuelan crisis.","Other journalists can use this data explainer as an example to conduct investigations into the mismanagement of public funds, especially in cases not necessarily linked to corruption or not aimed at pointing out individual culprits. This project is an example of how the journalist takes advantage of the data to show that a particularly vulnerable group is affected by the misuse of the funds that the State should allocate to guarantee them a better life. This journalistic work also provides possibilities to explore the application of mathematical methods to make projections that are useful for approaching a story. This project is helpful to demonstrate the results of alliances between experts and journalists. It shows that constant advice and communication with sources enhances the possibility of obtaining data with a rigorous and verified methodology. As journalists, we can rely on science and economic principles, but it is gainful to incorporate the advice of experts into the research, writing, and editing process.",Spanish,https://lapromesarota.prodavinci.com/?home,,,,,,,,"Valentina Oropeza, Indira Rojas, Salvador Benasayag, John Fuentes, Franklin Durán, Ángel Alayón, Oscar Marcano, Helena Carpio, Luisa Salomón, Ricardo Barbar, Víctor Salmerón, Roberto Mata, Yadira Pérez, Alfredo Lasry.","Nineteen people participated in the project: journalists, economists, infographers, and web designers.

Venezuela,Prodavinci.com,Small,Participant,,Naturaleza en llamas: 20 años de incendios en Áreas Protegidas de Venezuela (Nature in flames: 20 years of fires in Protected Areas of Venezuela),11/05/21,"Investigation, Infographics, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment","Sensor, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel","This project is a multimedia investigation that analyzes the last two decades of forest fires in all protected natural areas of Venezuela. We found that in 2020, Venezuela was the country in the Amazon region with the highest density of fires or more fires per area. It was almost double that of Brazil. We processed 3.7 million data detected by NASA remote sensors, multispectral satellite images, vector geospatial databases, and geographic information systems.","The investigation proved that the protected areas of Venezuela are, actually, unprotected. These areas represent 24% of the national territory, and they're under the responsibility of the National Parks Institute and the Ministry of the Environment. We determined that fires increased in 63 of the 80 areas of the country in the last 20 years. The increase points to systemic failures: these areas don't have functional water systems, adequate equipment, or sufficient personnel to fight and control the fire. The institutional deficiencies, added to the effects of climate change, put the most important natural areas of the country at risk. We used digital tools to locate fires and thus detect illegal mining within the Venezuelan Amazon. Miners burn arbitrarily to deforest and open spaces to mine, build houses and grow food. We detected 13 illegal mines that had not been previously identified by the Amazon Network for Georeferenced Socio-environmental Information. We found that fires in Ciénagas de Juan Manuel increased 411% in 2020, compared to their average for the past nine years. This national park protects grasslands, swamp forests, and gallery forests. In the Aguaro-Guariquito National Park, which protects a microcosm of the Llanos region, the highest concentration of fires between 2012 and 2020 occurred over riparian forests.  ""Nature in flames"" won the award for best data visualization in a small-medium at the 2021 Digital Media Awards LATAM. The project was a finalist for the 2021 Premio Gabo, and the Thomson Foundation selected it as one of the 15 most outstanding stories about environmental topics for the Young Journalist Award. Thomson Foundation invited Helena Carpio to webinars about climate change. The Global Investigative Journalism Network published a review of the investigation, and international media interviewed Helena to explain the use of satellite imagery for journalistic purposes.","The project used statistical and geographic data analysis, investigative journalism, and scientific methodologies to produce rigorous and relevant data. We incorporated different spatial databases into our work, including one with all the vegetation units of the country. The information allowed us to know which ecosystem was burned in each protected area. Understanding that fires in the tropics are almost always started by humans, we used fire to detect human activities within strictly protected areas. This means that we opened the heat spots detected between 2001 and 2020 in a geographic information system from NASA to detect places with high concentrations of fire. Then we looked for satellite images of these places with frequent fires, and we tracked down clues of human activities that could be potential causes. The images allowed us to find agricultural farms, livestock, invasions, and illegal mining within national parks, natural monuments, wildlife refuges, and other protected areas. The project was carried out through close collaboration with specialists linked to academic and research communities in Venezuela and the region, including biologists, geographers, ecologists, firefighters, and park rangers. The Amazon Rainforest Journalism Fund of the Pulitzer Center supported the investigation.","Official institutions in Venezuela don't have updated data on protected areas. It is unknown the conditions of their fauna and vegetation. There is also no information on the fires or data to suggest what the fires are set by men. For this reason, we decided to create our database. The investigation lasted six months, as it was necessary to locate international sources that could provide verified information. In the capital, Caracas, you could see smoke from fires that seemed to come from natural places, and we wondered what was happening to protected areas. We called scientists to advise us on the matter, and so we learned that NASA captures information all the time about what happens on the surface of the Earth. We wanted to know if NASA detected areas that were burning. We processed 3.7 million heat sources, which represented information from 2001 to 2020. This allowed us to review the evolution of the fires, in which periods they occurred most frequently, and which areas were the most affected each year. The environmental crisis goes under the table especially in a country in a complex humanitarian emergency. It was necessary to highlight the causes and consequences of fires in natural areas. Hence the importance of using satellite images and learning to read them: we find clues about what was happening in the affected areas and what human actions caused these fires.  It was also a challenge to combine scientific information with a journalistic proposal. We rely on storytelling to give the reader not only crucial data on the lack of protection of the country's natural areas, but also to show that they are not oblivious to the consequences of environmental devastation.","“Nature in flames” allows us to appreciate the great potential that satellite data and geographic information systems have to carry out journalistic environmental investigations. All the fire data we use is open and public, and the GIS software and javascript programming software are free and open source. It is an easily replicable methodology. We believe that when it comes to the impacts of climate change, multidisciplinary teams that include experts and scientific researchers are indispensable to cover complex and multifactorial issues in a responsible and rigorous way, and thus build trust with audiences. It also represents a great opportunity to generate new methodologies, data, narratives, user experiences, and products.

Venezuela,Prodavinci.com,Small,Participant,,Los datos de la crisis de los periódicos en Venezuela (The data of the crisis of the newspapers in Venezuela),30/06/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Infographics, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel","The project is an investigation of data that shows the decline of the written press in Venezuela. It is based on the perspective of freedom of expression and aims to analyze the newspaper ecosystem in the country and its evolution. After collecting, processing, and analyzing data, we found that at least 100 newspapers have disappeared in the last eight years in the country. In 2013, there were 121. Today only 22 circulate.","Prodavinci found that in Venezuela the number of newspapers in 2021 was the same as the country had at the end of the 1940s. By June 2021, only six newspapers had national reach and 16 were local. A total of 12 states of Venezuela were left without newspapers, and these are areas where the majority of the population has poor internet access. The crisis runs deep in the daily newspapers. In 2013, the daily paper exceeded one hundred. In 2021, only two were circulating. We also found that 41 print media companies were permanently closed, and 59 migrated to digital platforms. These findings were shown in interactive infographics.  The formats in which the information is presented impact how Venezuelans consume it. A March 2020 survey, with 2000 interviews, showed that 46% got the news from friends, 37% used the radio, and half learned from cable television, with programming limited by the measures of censorship. Only 6% consulted newspapers. This coverage included a content distribution alliance with six local media. We also shared the findings in a digital meeting with students and professors of the Andrés Bello Catholic University in Guayana, Bolívar state. We are conceptualizing educational documents for our Academia Prodavinci free teaching materials program. The explainer had international attention. We discussed the findings in a diplomatic meeting with the mission of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Venezuela. Latam Journalism Review and the Luca de Tena Foundation Journalism Laboratory reviewed the project. The data explainer is a reference for NGOs interested in freedom of expression, international human rights organizations, and researchers.","The project lasted for a year. It involved the construction of databases, conducting interviews and consulting experts, reporting and research, conceptualization, writing, editing, visualization, and web assembly. Prodavinci built its database with the collaborative effort of 41 journalists from all over the country. We directly consulted media representatives, reviewed historical documents, and interviewed communication specialists about the makeup of the newspaper's ecosystem. The information collected allowed us to reveal data on the changes in the print media map: the country had 23 newspapers in 1946; in 1986 there were 71; in 2008 there were 117; in 2013 there were 121, and in June 2021 there were only 22. A second stage of the research included a review of historical documents on the founding of newspapers and the shaping of the country's print media map between 1800 and 2021. The investigation managed to systematize, at least, 474 newspapers that have been founded in Venezuela and that have had sustained efforts over time. Seven members of the Prodavinci editorial team participated in the production of this work. A multidisciplinary team was formed with editorial, narrative, and storytelling skills, reporting and research, data analysis, visualization, web architecture. The team made their knowledge of freedom of expression, quantitative analysis, narrative, design, and infographics available to the project.","Prodavinci focused on a premise to pose the research questions: Venezuelan citizens face a massive wave of disappearance and survival of the newspapers during the last decade. However, there was no official registry of active and closed newspapers. In some cases, the available information collected by NGOs or civil society was not consistent or out of date. Without precise information, it was not possible to know the situation of the newspapers, which ones successfully migrated to the web format, which ones stopped circulating permanently. So it was not possible to compare the current data with the little that existed from previous years. We identified the opportunity to run an investigation to generate a historical memory of the Venezuelan media map. When we confirmed that 121 newspapers circulated in the country in 2013, we took this year as a starting point to analyze how the supply of the newspapers evolved. It would be necessary to create a database from scratch, collecting information from direct sources. This research included a collaborative consultation process, between June 2020 and June 2021, in which 41 journalists and newspaper workers across the country participated. That involved calls to the newspaper headquarters, especially those that were in areas far from the capital, to obtain direct information. It was necessary to corroborate the status of each medium for 2013 and in the following years, until 2021. We were interested to know if the newspaper was operational. Also, we saw the opportunity to obtain detailed information about the frequency of its publication, the experience in digital journalism, and its activity in social networks.","The project shows how to implement strategies in a hybrid newsroom, which gain the ability to address issues with different approaches with the hyperspecialization of knowledge and the combination of journalistic, narrative, quantitative perspectives, and data-driven analysis. The project is also a sample of how to involve in journalistic processes to economists and specialists in freedom of expression, human rights, and public policies.  The data collection methodology allows us to learn about the success of collaborative work. The network of journalists has value as a research method when we are collecting and verifying data. Also, we can nourish the link with other colleagues for future projects.  This research also summarizes the presence of newspapers in the country since the 19th century.

It won one of the Gold Medals in Best Data Video in 2021 China Data Content Competition, in regard as “this video selected an ingenious angle and offered various comparisons in data to make itself persuasive”.","This work uses night light remote sensing, thermal infrared remote sensing, visible light remote sensing and other technologies to obtain image data, carries out accurate image processing, image interpretation and information extraction, and monitored plant growth through satellite images. The output above turns out as the heat maps, spring plowing maps, night light maps and satellite imageries showed in the work. As for the design, the gray tone and color system of reddish orange are used in the design to create a sense of sadness under the perspective of technology, and make full use of the space movement of the lens to show details of satellite imageries.  ","The hardest part is to acquire various data including satellite photos throughout one year and the figures from Eleme app and then analyze them, especially when all of them are exclusive. We set up frames to assess the situation in Wuhan and persuaded a satellite company to support this project, then cooperated with scientists in it. After we got these satellite photos, we had to category, see carefully and analyze them, and to find news angles and decide how to depict the whole situation and picture. Take the heat map for example, we compared the whole city’s heat map in and after the lockdown and found that two industrial districts are the key parts and the “warmest” area was just the famous Wuhan Iron and Steel Group. This findings came from these maps and help with the logic in narratives. Moreover, we thought the online orders in Wuhan should have boomed after the lockdown, but it didn’t happen. Surprisingly, we found its wave was very similar to the city’s economic changes of industrial figures, which pieced together the general trend of this city. The collection of data and images is highly-cost in this work, and their analysis is also tough and requiring carefulness and comprehensive judgment.","This work can strongly extend the boundaries what satellite imageries can help with reporting in other journalists’ minds. In the past, satellite imageries were rarely used to assess but to present, and the number and variety of those imageries were limited in one piece of reporting.

India,"ThePrint, New Delhi",Big,Participant,,"In this rural Karnataka belt, Covid cases are rising but tests have dipped to just 10 a day",23/05/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Politics, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","As the second wave of Covid-19 hit India, ThePrint decided to take stock of the healthcare situation in the southern parts of India while focusing on data. The Karnataka government’s handling of the Covid-19 spread at Hallegere village in Mandya was an unflattering microcosm of its efforts in tackling the pandemic in rural areas where cases were surging. The government had simply reduced testing. The health centre we visited used to conduct 200-300 tests every week in April but was reduced to 50-60 in a week in May.   ",As part of the story ThePrint raised these questions of reduced testign with the government and soon after the publication of the story testing was carried out in a more systematic manner. ThePrint also reached out to the health minister as part of the story who assured that testing would be carried out in a systematic manner and vaccination too would be carried out smoothly. ,"As a part of the story, apart from data crunching, we relied on getting first-hand information from the hospitals, healthcare centres, doctors and even the villagers. We had to make rounds of the healthcare centres and hospitals to collect data manually. However, to ensure the data was analysed properly it used to be fed into our excel sheets. At the same time, mobile phones were used to shoot videos to show the current situation. This was important as it also served as evidence of our ground work in case of any dispute. Byte collection at the healthcare centre was also done using hand-held devices and for conducting voxpop.","This project was carried out at a time when India was battling the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic which was much more devastating than the first wave. The country was facing an immense shortage of hospital beds, medicines and even oxygen. This was a time when non-essential traveling had almost come to a halt. While vaccination had started, journalists were not included under the essential workers and hence I was not vaccinated when I was asked to undertake this project. As I chalked out the plan to cover the rural areas in Karnataka which was witnessing a huge spike in cases I managed to get the first dose. A number of doctors had then advised not to travel immediately after getting the first dose of the vaccine. But I did. As a lockdown had been imposed in the state, right from finding hotels and cabs was a difficult task. As a journalist I wanted to focus on the rural areas armed with data, something which was being ignored by the mainstream. Wearing double masks and shields, it was quite a task to travel in the interiors and get information as many restrictions on travel were imposed by the government too. From visiting villages, crematoriums, hospitals, primary healthcare centres, the project involved focusing on numbers so that we could let data speak for itself. Language barrier was also a major issue, as in the rural parts of Karnataka, Kannada is spoken. The hardest part of the project was to witness death, devastation and grimness all around and still focus on collecting data. Equally difficult was to visit the hospitals at a time where the risk of contracting Covid-19 was the highest. However, despite all these constraints I managed to complete the deep-dive.   ","  There’s a lot that I learnt from this project and I hope others will also benefit from it. So far the stories were focusing on the human aspect (equally significant). However, I realised that with data you can question the authorities to take stock of the situation and demand changes. The fact that I visited the villages, healthcare centres and hospitals myself rather than relying on data provided by the government helped in questioning the authorities and ensuring that testing was increased. Despite the fact that the state was under a lockdown, the fact that I was able to travel and bring out stories from far-flung areas is proof that if one plans systematically such stories can be covered too.    ",English,https://theprint.in/health/in-this-rural-karnataka-belt-covid-cases-are-rising-but-tests-have-dipped-to-just-10-a-day/663687/,https://theprint.in/india/bengaluru-residents-go-80-km-for-covid-shot-as-medical-hub-just-doesnt-have-enough-vaccines/656996/,,,,,,,"Neelam Pandey, Praveen Jain","Neelam Pandey, a Senior Associate Editor from ThePrint.  She is a Delhi based reporter with over 15 years of experience, currently working with a digital platform, in New Delhi.  Before joining ThPrint, she worked as a Senior Assistant Editor with Hindustan Times for ten years. In her 15 years in journalism, she has covered politics, and policy apart from writing on various other social issues concentrating on women and children. She was recently awarded a PhD from Jamia Millia Islamia on Feminist and Dalit Publishing Houses.

Like earlier iterations of #WildEye, the Southern Africa mapping tool, allows users to track seizures, arrests, court cases and convictions. What sets this version apart is how we did it. It was built from the ground up, with the help of data wranglers from Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Through intensive training and mentorship, our wranglers collected exclusive data on wildlife crimes in Southern Africa. This data was then published on #WildEye, making it the first-of-its-kind on the continent.","We have seen significant success in making wildlife trafficking data publicly accessible. By shining a light on the scale of illegal wildlife trade taking place, we have sparked the interest of other journalists, government, law enforcement, and organisations monitoring and investigating wildlife crime. We have mapped over 400 incidents of wildlife crime on the #WildEye Southern Africa map. These span six different countries and record information on dozens of endangered species. This is also the first time that some of this information has ever been made publicly accessible. Most notable is data shared by the Attorney General of Mozambique. This information has not, to our knowledge, been shared with journalists prior to this.  We have contributed to the narrative around environmental reporting and its potential impact in the region. Following on from our previous focus on Covid-19 and its links to illegal wildlife trade, we have seen a continued need to monitor and report on these types of crimes. #WildEye Southern Africa has highlighted the need for urgent action when it comes to conservation in this part of the world.  We have also trained five investigative reporters in data journalism, and offered them mentorship and skill-building opportunities. Beyond this core group, we have expanded the #WildEye community to include 170+ more journalists, law enforcement agents, scientists, government officials, wildlife activists and conservationists. In 2021, we formalised our relationship with the global wildlife trade monitoring organisation Traffic, signing a long-term data-sharing agreement with them. This collaboration will continue to boost information on seizures, poaching and any enforcement actions in Southern Africa. Journalists have reported using the tool for data sourcing, learning and professional growth, updates, trade route and trend analysis, data visualisation, academic and scientific research, teaching and training, monitoring illegal wildlife trade,  story research and documentary development, and investigative reporting","#WildEye Southern Africa was built by our team of developers using an open-source platform, Mapbox. It was then customised to suit our needs as data journalists.  This iteration of the tool included significant updates to the #WildEye platform. Users are now able to access all versions of the tool via a single page, and can toggle between the different maps available.  #WildEye's main feature is a map of the globe showing where law enforcement agencies and legal systems have been involved in action against wildlife trafficking. Each case is identified by an icon that signifies either a seizure, an arrest, a court case or a conviction.  For the first time since creating the tool, we worked closely with a group of locally-based data wranglers, offering them monthly training sessions and continued professional support throughout the project. This ensured that the data collected was good quality and could easily be integrated into the mapping tool.  Our alert system has shown immense success, allowing users to subscribe and receive regular updates on court cases. We have received positive feedback from a diverse #WildEye community, who use this function to follow specific cases, and track trends and routes that interest them.  Data is uploaded on Mapbox via a Google spreadsheet that is updated on a weekly basis, sometimes more frequently. Methods of data collection range from scraping social media and news sites to working with reports and datasets provided by monitoring organisations. We convert bulky reports and complex datasets into spreadsheets that can be analysed and added to #WildEye. By engaging with organisations such as Traffic, the Wildlife Justice Commission, the Environmental Investigation Agency, the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, the Environmental Reporting Collective and the Indonesian Data Journalism Network, we have been able to access some of this data more easily","Our main challenge continued to be access to good quality data. However, we saw improved success by working closely with local journalists and data wranglers. By employing people on-the-ground and individuals who understand the context in which wildlife trafficking occurs, we have been able to access more data from government and law enforcement agencies.  We spent over a year creating a training and professional support programme that allowed us to offer environmental journalists in Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe one-on-one experience. We were continuously assessing and re-adjusting the programme to suit their needs, and to meet our project goals. Although challenging, we feel that the #WildEye Southern Africa tool and its achievements speak to the success of the programme, and we will continue to implement this model.  Travel restrictions made access to information difficult for our data wranglers, and although we scheduled monthly meetings/training sessions/public events, internet access and finances were an added challenge throughout. Despite this, they were able to participate fully in the programme and will be awarded with certificates of completion at the end of January 2022.  One thing that became clear during the project was a lack of understanding of legal processes around wildlife and other environmental crimes. This extended beyond our data wranglers, and we attempted to address this by enlisting the help of the Legal Resources Centre South Africa, who trained participants in a public webinar (bit.ly/3A4BN1z). Through this, we aimed to help journalists understand their rights and provide practical tips on how to navigate the legislative environments in various countries, in support of better reporting. However, we see the need for continued intensive training to ensure that the #WildEye community has a better understanding of court processes. We will implement this in future projects","#WildEye Southern Africa combines open-source technology with on-the-ground investigative reporting. Above all else, it is about making information easily and freely available to all. By doing so, we aim to make it easier—through data journalism— to hold government and law enforcement agencies accountable for cracking down on illicit wildlife trade in the region.  Our data wranglers persisted and persevered, and were able to get access to good quality data. Throughout this process, they learned about their rights as reporters (and as citizens) and received in-depth training on the legal systems in various southern African countries. This meant that they knew how to ask for information and what data we had a right to publish.  At the same time, the data only matters if users are able to access it in a way that feels intuitive, simple and personal.  #WildEye Southern Africa is an ongoing project, and we will continue to map illegal wildlife trade in the region through future grant opportunities, as well as use the collaborative model developed as a blueprint for future data journalism projects",English,https://wildeye-southern-africa.oxpeckers.org,https://oxpeckers.org/2021/07/enhancing-wildlife-crime-journalism,https://oxpeckers.org/2021/08/using-the-law,https://oxpeckers.org/2021/11/wildeye-southern-africa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTl4NOVl6wI,https://youtu.be/p0MFqDlJ1Z4?t=4030,https://www.farmersweekly.co.za/agri-news/africa/new-data-tool-aims-to-fight-southern-africas-wildlife-crime,,"Fiona Macleod, Derick Du Toit, Roxanne Joseph, Andiswa Matikinca, Mark Hartman, Tristan Mathiesen, Calistus Bosaletswe, Mbauwo Chavula, Daiana Nhatave, Nompumelelo Mtsweni and Sean Ndlovu","#WildEye Southern Africa is a project by Oxpeckers Investigative Environmental Journalism, supported by USAID's VukaNow Activity.

Our investigation monitored the illegal tiger trade between Italy, France and Southeast Asia. We collated data on arrests, court cases and convictions, and monitored several high-profile cases to better understand why and how illegal trade takes place. We found that a significant lack of data in Europe is stimulating trafficking of tigers, and uncovered and published new information about the number of tigers in each country and how many seizures took place in recent years.","Our investigation shone a light on two major issues when it comes to illegal tiger trade in Europe. The first was the lack of data concerning the number of wild tigers in captivity. When trying to ascertain how many tigers were being held in captivity in Italy, we received different and incongruous numbers from the Ministry of Ecological Transition and CITES.  The second was about the poor conditions in which wild animals are kept at parks, zoos, circuses or private homes. By way of example, we focused on a case that involved the gross ill-treatment of 10 tigers who were transported from Italy to Dagestan, Russia. The starving, thirsty and filthy tigers had been transported for six days across some 2,000km, and one had died by the time they were stopped by border guards at the crossing between Poland and Belarus in October 2019.  The direct links between these two issues were shown when our investigation was highlighted in the Italian Parliament in April 2021. LAV (the Anti-Vivisection Association) engaged with our investigation throughout, and in the month following its publication asked Parliament to ""indicate the official numbers concerning the captivity of wild tigers in Italy, and what initiatives, in the face of the data possessed, they deem necessary to ensure the public safety and ascertain the actual conditions in which these animals are kept"".  Beyond this, we received multiple follow-ups requesting further information from the investigations including law enforcement personnel, international watchdog agencies, and other media outlets wanting to build on our work. This project also served as a template to investigate transnational illicit timber trade between Europe and Asia. We were awarded this grant in 2021 and, working with the same team (with a new addition), will publish in the first quarter of 2022.","All of the data we collected was published on our #WildEye Europe mapping tool. This is an open-source tool built using Mapbox. Both reporters—based in Italy and France— as well as a data wrangler worked with Four Paws (an animal welfare NGO) to collect data. This information was then aggregated, analysed and included on our mapping platform. We also engaged with law enforcement agencies and the Italian and French governments to collect related data, focusing on recent cases. We analysed and visualised the data using Google Sheets, Tableau Public, Terminal (iTerm2) and Flourish. These were used to extract information about trade routes, methods of transport, related entities (individuals, companies and organisations), and court case outcomes. Our analysis and visualisations formed the backbone of each investigation.","Our biggest challenge was obtaining official data. We overcame this by working with NGOs, law enforcement and government agencies to access the data we needed. This data, including the number of tigers registered in Italy and France, highlighted a lack of transparency and how difficult it is to get this kind of information. When we collated the data and analysed it, we discovered huge discrepancies in the official figures – our investigations helped provide clarity and transparency. We had some pressure from tiger breeders, even though they were interviewed, once the investigation had been published. In Italy, we were contacted by the president of the Trainers and Breeders Union after publication to discuss the “Polish case”. In his opinion we didn't write the correct version of events, although the facts included in our investigation are well documented by official sources and testimonies. Travel restrictions also made conducting interviews and meeting with law enforcement agencies challenging. Our reporters were able to do this once some restrictions were lifted, but had to rely mostly on phone calls, emails and online-based resources.","All of the NGOs we interviewed and used as resources gave positive input with regards to our published investigation. The French Environmental Journalists Association shared the France investigation and Swim (a group of science writers in Italy) shared the Italy investigation. We will continue to monitor their responses and track further impact. We (and some of the NGOs and officials we interviewed) view our investigation as an important addition to the debate around the need for stronger laws, legislation and regulations around illegal wildlife trade, and we hope to see these changes come into effect going forward.  We also hope to see continued use of #WildEye Europe, and for other journalists to keep investigating the illegal tiger trade, which continues to threaten this endangered species. Like with previous iterations of this mapping tool, we hope to encourage others to test similar methods of creating, collating and visualising large datasets of their own.  We have also shown how to turn data into a compelling and important environmental story. By training journalists how to work the tool, we have published numerous investigations that use #WildEye data to tell their stories, lending our voice to issues around the law, health, safety, corruption and illicit financial flow.

According to our analysis, prior to 2018, most related topics were closely related to gender and women's issues. But after the year, as feminism became more visible, newly added topics began to expand to notable events and controversial public figures, which were constantly added and deleted by netizens on either side of increasingly polarized debates.","Many see 2021 as the year when feminism finally joined the mainstream and won greater attention from the public. But for some people, the war to fight for women's rights and reputation has started years ago. How long have they tried to advocate for the issue? And what obstacles did they meet? What kind of message were they trying to convey? It is a pity that we don't own a domestic Wikipedia to memorize the history of all these. Fortunately, the editing records of Zhihu can shed a light on how the long-lived war unfolded. The story has effectively helped the public understand the long history of China's online fight over feminism and broken down key items for readers who are interested in further researching the field.

An in-depth investigation into the causes of waterlogging in the North Jingguang Road Tunnel,22/11/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Satellite images, Audio","Animation, 3D modelling, Adobe Creative Suite","On July 20, 2021, Zhengzhou (the capital city of Henan Province, China), was hit by a once-in-a-millennium rainstorm. The Jingguang North Road Tunnel, the city's main road, was severely affected: 300,000 cubic meters of floodwater poured in, killing 6 people and drowning 247 vehicles. Was it natural or man-made? This video is the result of our two-month investigation. We collected as much information as possible, including videos taken by car DVR, academic papers, field interviews, satellite maps, car speed measurements..., and finally figured out the hidden dangers and negligence of the flood control and drainage facilities of the tunnel.","After the video was released, it attracted widespread attention on major Chinese Internet platforms, and the video reached 300,000 views.","In the video production, we used a lot of Adobe's creative tools: Illustrator and Photoshop for the graphic design, After Effects for the animation part, and Premiere Pro for the video editing. We also used many other tools to collect information. We got the satellite map and the 3D elevation simulation which showed the topography of Zhengzhou from Mapbox. We requested the data of real-time road conditions from Tencent Map and attached them to the map on Tencent Map's open platform so that the information could be transformed in Adobe After Effects. In addition, we also used C4D to display the 3D structure of the tunnel.","When the floodwaters subsided, Zhengzhou was filled with sorrow. The 300,000 cubic meters of floodwater that poured into the Jingguang North Road Tunnel was not unexpected. As early as 10 years ago, the Zhengzhou Municipal Engineering Survey and Design Institute had already pointed out the hidden dangers of the tunnel in a published paper. But preventing potential disasters has never been on the agenda. We overcame a lot of resistance before launching the investigation. We reviewed papers published in recent years, made field visits to the tunnel, and launched an in-depth investigation into what had happened on the day of the disaster. We eventually gathered a great deal of useful information. But it was a challenge to present the scattered information effectively. We finally decided to combine satellite maps with photos and videos of the disaster site posted on social media to present the dense information to the audience visually. We think it is the charm of investigative reporting in the age of social media.","When covering complex topics, a combination of graphics, video, audio, maps, and design may offer great help.

A woman surnamed Mao, who traveled from Nanjing to Yangzhou, became a super-spreader: she played poker in a chess room in Yangzhou for several days, thus triggering a wave of an outbreak. This is the information we obtained from the epidemiological survey released by the government. We conducted a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the government survey of 448 newly infected cases in Yangzhou, and found out the reasons for the high number of its newly confirmed cases.  ","Immediately after the video was released, it was reposted by major media outlets, with up to 700,000 hits across the web.

We mobilized a lot of manpower within the team to input the data and coordinated team members with different skills to complete the production of maps and charts, graphic design, and animation. All of this required a clear division of labor and careful time management skills.","We think it's quite crucial for journalists to acquire the ability to mine data from public sources and use the data to explain why certain events might happen.

In this way, the whole story becomes more solid and convincing. In addition, we think the role of reporters is not limited to delivering information to the public, but can also be extended to assist the government with decision-making.

We have then used infographics to show the most important data of the project. Lots of these reports were incomplete, and thus data on the fishing campaigns isn't fully reliable.

We have managed to obtain, through FOIA, only the data about the call for tenders where we could figure there were big chunk of money missing from the financial reports.","This investigation was started after receiving a leak. The hardest part has been finding real evidence that could support the hypothesis, given the lack of transparency that characterises the bluefin tuna industry and context. Initially, ICCAT would not release the data when we asked but we then managed to download the obersevers' reports from their website. However, these reports are blackend in some sections: while the name of the observer is left visible, all the names of vessels are blackened and thus it's really heard to understand what happened in the joint fishing campaigns, how many tons of fish were caught from which vessel and whether this was all regular. Moreover, as soon as we sent FOIAs to the Ministry of the Environment on about the call for tenders as always being won by Oceanis Srl company, we were contacted by Oceanis CEO on our mobile phone.

In the graphs there are small news events to show what has caused the cases to increase and what has happened because of that.,"The main graph shows daily infection data from each healthcare district in Finland. Making of the graph started as a desperate attempt to show familiar data in a new way. Inspiration was drawn from a bee swarm chart in order to not focus on the actual number of infection cases, but to visually represent the “epidemic bursts” in different areas at different times in a more qualitative way. The graph was done with NodeJS-script using a D3.js force-simulation in order to show each infection case as a separate circle and at the same time trying to position the circle on the appropriate day in the timeline. The result was automatically exported as a static svg and, once happy with the simulation parameters and output, edited by hand in Illustrator and split to parts for the web (in print version the graph is several pages long).

In order to calculate costs we relied on budget estimates for various states, public information shared on social media by state goverments, and government approved retail costs for vaccines and central government's vaccination portal .

We visualized the trend of PM2.5 concentration in some essential areas. Then, we explained the root causes of the PM2.5 problem and investigated the progress of problem-solving in two leading causes: road transportation (with urban planning) in Bangkok and agricultural burning nationwide. We gathered data from academic researches and open data from public sectors. We also interviewed stakeholders: authorities, farmers, scholars, etc. Unfortunately, we can translate only one of three features in this project due to the deadline.","The readers might know more about the root causes of the PM2.5 problem, which they may participate in prevention. They would also know about the PM2.5 situation near their living areas and hotspot situation in some Southeast Asia countries in these recent years. Moreover, they would learn the insights in problem-solving by government sectors, including the reasons, differences of opinions, and obstacles behind the scene, which made problem-solving in some areas have only a little progress.   This information would make the related public and private sectors know that there were journalists who keep an eye on this topic and help Thai people and environmental activists ask for more satisfactory progress from the government in the future. Some famous scholars and a voluntary media team who communicated this problem also shared our articles on their social media, which could widen the impact.","We collected open data from many public sector sources, such as PM2.5 concentration (historical data), the number of passengers who used mass transportation systems, or the number of newly registered vehicles in Bangkok and surrounding provinces. We also gathered additional information about the topic from several academic research reports, official reports, or official documents. Some of these reports and documents were sent to us after we filed formal or informal requests to some government organizations, including the Pollution Control Department and Department of Land Transport. We also tried to analyze traffic index data we collected from a private companies' website using Python. Still, we found incompleteness in some parts of the dataset, and then we also found the better dataset about driving speed during rush hours in Bangkok. So we decided not to use that traffic index data. In other datasets, we cleaned and manipulated them using MS Excel. We visualized the data in 2 ways: creating some static visualizations using Adobe Creative Suite and other static and dynamic visualizations using Flourish. The visualizations created using Flourish were embedded in our website. We also cross-checked the same data between a few sources, such as open data on the web page and the summary in an official report. We also clarified the meaning and definition of data with original data sources.","The hardest part of the project is investigating the progress of PM2.5 problem-solving. There are several sources of PM2.5 in Thailand, such as biomass burning, road transportation, and the industrial sector, which means there are a lot of government agencies involved in the same problem-solving process together. We have to talk with at least 11 government agencies to request the data, recheck the data correctness, or request interviews. We also interviewed several farmers and scholars who study economics and environmental sciences to find their stories and opinions. It is challenging to gather everything and write all these features with only one journalist.   Furthermore, PM2.5 has been a severe pollution problem in Thailand for a long time. Still, not many news reports tell us about the actual progress of problem-solving, especially when the problem solving was so complex. Moreover, it was still controversial about ""who should be responsible as the root cause of the PM2.5 problem?"". So, it is vital to clarify the complexity of the problem and the obstacles behind the scene when we want to solve this problem.

We also included a map our readers can explore and a searchable table as well as a map of where they were laid to rest for any of our readers who wished to pay their respects. There were a number of side stories going into more depth on the tragic stories we uncovered in the dataset.,"It is now three months since this piece was published and we still regularly receive emails from family members thanking us and sharing the stories of their family members with us. We've gone on to publish follow up articles based on these including one where a family member provided us with copies of letters their fallen family member had sent during the war. We've also had correspondence with people in the education sector - inlcuding one teacher who works on a Ministry of Defense campus and sought our permission to use the piece as part of her curriculum. We are a very new data team (only formed in March 2021) and we have also found that this piece has had a significant impact internally in being more creative with use of data. Poppy Scotland, the official Scottish Remembrance charity had the following: “This map is a powerful reminder of how every single community has been impacted by the cost of conflict over the past 100 years. Each poppy symbolises the bravery and sacrifice of those who fought and died in defence of our nation.","The original data was sent to us in excel format but as it was hand transcribed data based on records that were a hundred years old it required a lot of cleaning. For this stage we utilised Open Refine to cluster and clean the most common misspellings. To geolocate the data we used a Google Apps Script pinging off the google map API. As a relatively small newsroom we generally try to do as much for free as possible so this was geocoded ion batches of 1,500 per day (the free limit). Due to the age of the address data we then had to sift through the data for streets that no longer exist. The original design idea behind the project was based on an offhanded comment that from afar it would look like 'a field of poppies'. The poppy icon was designed in figma and it was designed to have similarities between the Scottish and Canadian official poppy icons to honour the many Scottish men that served in the Canadian military. The stalk of the poppy was a deliberate choice to add on to the 'field of poppies' aesthetic. The maps and scrollytelling were done using flourish and javascript. The poppy SVGs for the pictogram were also designed using figma.","We have a motto in our data team - ""NYT dreams on a DCT budget"" and this project is the epitome of that. Between our titles we had more than 11,000 records to clean and geolocate and as stated previously we tend to try to avoid having to pay for resources where possible so the addresses were located in chunks of 500 per day (per data team member - so 1,500 per day). As a small data team that also provides a service to the rest of the newsroom to create charts for their stories, it was often difficult to allocate the time required for manual scrutiny of the data, but when we did we found ourselves sharing fascinating story after fascinating story. As a group of millennials we had never felt andy particular connection to the tragedy of WW1 but trawling through this data and ouring our hearts and souls into creating something that would truly honour them has brought that connection to us - and we hope that connection is felt in our readers in our presentation of the data.",Data journalism is not just about news.

For the first time in the country, journalists have collected, combined and cleaned all the data available on the topic. The result is shocking: between a quarter and a third of schools in the country are in deplorable condition. At least 300,000 children study in these schools every day. The project is a longread data story, an open database, series of reports and a data-driven game. These were cross-published by 9 media outlets in 3 languages. ","To maximize the impact, the story was cross-published in the first week of September by 8 biggest news outlets in the country both in Russian and Kyrgyz languages. It was named among the investigations of the month in Russian language by the Global Investigations Journalism Network. Later in December, it was published by OpenDemocracy.net in English.  Four media, Kloop.kg, Kaktus.media, 24.kg and Govori.tv, have also published a series of reports from various schools of Kyrgyzstan that were linking to the main story. By the end of the year, a data game based on real events was published by Kloop.kg. In the game, one had to play for a principal trying to save the school from collapsing.  Altogether, this series of reports cross-published by several media across the country have pushed the topic into a public discussion.  Officials (President's office) reacted to the story by reaching out to journalists and asking about the methods of data collection and the structure of the database.  Authors of the story presented their data findings at several professional gatherings of researchers and analysts (Social Innovation Lab Kyrgyzstan and KG Analytics) which followed with their own research of the topic.  The local chapter of OCDS has reached out to the authors of the story and together they have organized a webinar on the topic of investigation school procurement, attended by the local journalists.  Relevant NGOs (‘Foundation for Education Initiatives Support’ and ‘Child rights defenders' league public foundation) supported the story and are now preparing a roundtable with the government to discuss the topic and find solutions.","To manage the team work, we used Google Suite (shared folders and collaborative documents) and Zoom.  We performed data cleaning and data analysis mostly in Google Sheets. Additionally, we used Python to scrape some data that was used for performing regression analysis but it was not included in the final version.  We traveled to each of the regions of the country for reporting purposes using classic journalist tools: phone, dictophone and a camera.  For data visualization we used Flourish, d3 (scrollama library).  For the layout, we used Tilda and Github. For the data game, we used Google Sheets, Figma and Javascript. ","There were several challenges for the team.  Conceptually, it was a project implemented by students during the course, so they had to perform a story of publishable quality as they learn. For the professor, the challenge was to manage the whole process and fit the timing to the semester length, as well as to check all the bits of data cleaning and data analysis delivered by the students. Most of the work, including data collection, data analysis and reporting was ready by the end of semester. Final text and graphics was in development during summer months, with the publicaiton date due early September, as the school year begins. The text and graphics was done by the professor of the course. Additional work, such as translation, illustrations and the layout was delivered by paid professionals.  In terms of data, it was the bad quality of open data that was the biggest challenge. But at the same time, it turned into the biggest contribution of the project to the topic. So far, it is the most up-to-date and clean database on the topic of school infrastructure available in Kyrgyzstan. It is published as open data along with the story, and the other researchers, journalists and government can make use of it.  In terms of publication, it was a challenge to communicate with all the different newsrooms and to make the project fit for different CMS systems. Luckily, the media have been supportive as the topic is crucial to children's rights. ","Other journalists can use the database published along with the story for their own further research, looking into the procurement of school infrastructure, influence of infrastructure and other factors on school performance, exploring  other related topics such as school security, nutrition, quality of education etc.  Overall, this is a unique example of Data Series being published for the first time in Kyrgyzstan. It is combining traditional reporting with innovative tools such as interactive graphics and games for the single purpose of bringing attention to the topic. This can serve as an inspiration for others to use data storytelling for social good; combine research and multimedia production; be more proactive regarding the publication strategy. ","English, Russian, Kyrgyz",https://rus.azattyk.org/a/schools/31439009.html,https://www.azattyk.org/a/31446227.html,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/the-crack-why-children-in-kyrgyzstan-study-in-extreme-conditions/,https://kloop.kg/t/school-game/,https://kloop.kg/blog/tag/avarijnaya-shkola/,https://24.kg/spetsproekty/205978_treschina_pochemu_deti_vkyirgyizstane_uchatsya_vekstremalnyih_usloviyah/,https://kyrgyzmedia.kg/2021/09/22/zharaka-emne-ch-n-kyrgyzstanda-baldar-ekstremaldyk-sharttarda-bilim-alyshat/,,"Anastasia Valeeva, Valentina Galich, Diana Svetlichnaya, Taalaibek Talantbek uulu, Yekaterina Afanasieva, Sezim Digerbaeva, Zhuzumkan Askhatbekova, Aleksandr Bogachev, Dmitry Motinov, Gulshat Yuldasheva, Tom Rowley, Mihail Shestakov, Aleksandra Titova","This is a project initiated at the 'Data Storytelling' course at the Master Program in Journalism at the American University of Central Asia and performed by the students of the course together with the course professor, Anastasia Valeeva.

France,"Disclose,Interprt,Princeton",Small,Winner,,Mururoa Files,09/03/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, OSINT, Satellite images, Environment, Health","Animation, 3D modelling, AI/Machine learning, Python","Disclose and Interprt, in collaboration with the Science & Global Security program at Princeton University (USA), investigated the consequences of atmospheric testing in French Polynesia for two years. With the help of thousands of declassified military documents, hundreds of hours of calculations and dozens of unpublished testimonies, this investigation demonstrates for the first time the extent of the radioactive fallout that struck the inhabitants of this vast territory as the 'Europe.","After the publication of our investigation, demonstrations took place in French Polynesia to demand an apology from the French state. A summit was organized in Paris to bring together representatives of the French state and Polynesia to improve compensation for victims and to facilitate access to military archives during this period. The President of the French Republic visited Polynesia in July and acknowledged that France had ""a debt"".  The State has announced the opening of the military archives on nuclear testing. A commission has been set up to provide assistance with the preparation of compensation files for victims of nuclear testing, the clean-up and deconstruction of former nuclear sites  ","According to our calculations, based on a scientific reassessment of the doses received, approximately 110,000 people were infected, almost the entire Polynesian population at the time. Modelling toxic clouds to support, we also unveil how the French authorities have concealed the true impact of nuclear testing on the health of Polynesians for more than fifty years. The scientific visualizations presented on this platform were produced through the extensive data mining and analysis of declassified French documents and open access government sources.The reconstruction of fallout patterns and cloud trajectories from French nuclear tests was done using the US NOAA Hybrid Single-Particle Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) particle transport and dispersion model and meteorological data from the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis (1948 - present) project. Initial stabilized radioactive clouds were represented as vertical linear sources with activity adequately distributed among the cap, skirt and stem of the cloud. The cloud particle sizes were assumed to be log-normally distributed. Calculations were run on a 12-core linux machine and involved the release of 3,000,000 3D particles each.  The hypothesis and input data of these studies were crossed checked with information available from the declassified historical documents as well as information available from the scientific literature.","For two years, nuclear physics researchers, designers, architects and journalists worked together on this investigation.  This international project was carried out between Princeton University in the United States, the architects' collective ""Interprt"" working on ecocides in England and Norway, and the French investigative media Disclose. This collaboration was made extremely difficult because this team of about ten people could never meet in real life, due to the covid-19 crisis. The other main challenge was to develop a technological model to virtually recreate the French nuclear tests in the laboratory using the powerful computers at Princeton.  Once these scientific calculations were made, the designers and architects modelled in 3D the trajectory of the radioactive clouds and their fallout on the islands of French Polynesia. They also modelled the precise level of fallout on a village and the contamination of food and inhabitants.  On the other hand, the journalists investigated French state military documents, met with sources involved in the nuclear tests and went to the field to meet victims, find documents hidden by the state about the health impact. This project deserves to be selected because it is unprecedented in its method. It brings together the methods of scientific investigation, 3D modelisation, forensic architecture and journalism to strengthen the evidence. Science supports journalistic work to produce rigorous investigations. ","This investigative story shows how international collaboration on sensitive issues can be done completely remotely, using tools such as Slack to coordinate the progress of projects, organize videoconferences on Meetjitsi (encrypted video) and groups on Signal.  Above all, it teaches how different methods of investigation can complement each other: the search for evidence in science is stricter than in journalism. It also enhances the accuracy of an investigation, as journalists find themselves integrating the precise methodology of scientists. It is not easy to get scientists, architects, designers and journalists to work together. The working methods are not the same, so we have to agree on a common method.   The investigative hypotheses put forward by the journalists are in fact confirmed or not by the scientific experiment, then by the 3D modelling. On the one hand, journalists have access to sources to which scientists would not have had access. And the scientists have access to documents that are not accessible to journalists. This project will hopefully lead to more such collaborations in the years to come.","English, French",https://moruroa-files.org,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esN7mvqBP1Y,,,,,,,"Sébastien Philippe,Tomas Statius, Mathieu Asselin, Nabil Ahmed,Olga Lucko, Svitlana Lavrenchuk","Sébastien Philippe is an Associate Research Scholar at the School of Public and International Affairs with the Program on Science and Global Security.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Shortlist,,"Green, Yellow, Corona",10/12/21,"Illustration, Infographics, Politics, Health","R, RStudio","In the second pandemic winter, schools in Germany remain open, despite high infection figures. Students are crowded into classrooms, protected only by FFP2 masks and regular testing, because the vaccination rate among children is still low. How high is the risk of infection in classrooms, and how well can simple ventilation help reduce it? Journalists from the Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) measured the infection risk in classrooms, daycare centers and at family gatherings using CO₂ measuring devices. In charts and graphics, they illustrate how quickly the aerosol concentration rises and how only consistently opened windows can reduce the risk of infection.","The project is a visually narrated paid article and was very well received by SZ subscribers. Many non-subscribers also clicked on the article, which is why it also led to new conversions. ","The analysis of the CO₂ values of the different scenarios is based on measurements that the Süddeutsche Zeitung carried out with two different CO₂ traffic light models. They differ in design, but both have the same sensor installed. The SZ was provided with one model free of charge by the company ISIS IC. Measurements were also taken with a self-built CO₂ traffic light following instructions from the Umwelt Campus Birkenfeld. In addition, we received data donations from the Michaeli-Gymnasium in Munich. Students Simon, Felix and Samuel from the high school measured carbon dioxide concentrations in various classrooms as part of a ""Jugend forscht"" project and won the special ""Thinking Safety"" prize.   The CO₂ limit at 1000 parts per million (ppm) is based on assessments by the German Federal Environment Agency. Here, 1000 ppm of carbon dioxide in the room air is considered harmless and a room air with 1000 ppm to 2000 ppm of carbon dioxide is considered alarming.   To calculate the probability of having an infected child in a class, we assume that twice as many children are infected as officially known. Although regular rapid tests can detect some infected children, they cannot detect all, especially since children more often show few symptoms of illness and rapid tests have limited accuracy. The probability of infecting more children is based on an interactive calculator from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry. In the scenarios presented, we assumed a classroom with one teacher and 25 students, 50 percent of whom are vaccinated or recovered, and who spend 25 hours together in a room over the course of a week.  ","To obtain the data, the journalists performed several measurements themselves over a period of one year and evaluated them together with data donations from schools and interpreted them with the support of experts. The Data team worked together with colleagues from the visual desk and science editorial team, which required cross-departmental planning, to present readers with a cleanly researched and well-visualized story. The evaluation underpins the current debate on mandatory vaccinations, student vaccinations and school closures with easy-to-understand scientific insights and offers guidance on safer indoor meetings through proper ventilation. ","This project shows how sensors can be used in a meaningful way to add scientific insight and data to a debate currently taking place in society. The story takes the reader through an everyday problem - worrying about children at school during a pandemic - but also shows why the risk of infection in a room rises quickly, even in small groups, and how this can be reduced quite significantly by proper ventilation. It also shows the great potential of collaborations between multiple departments and teams even within the same media house, because projects like these are made possible through working together.",German,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/wissen/mit-co2-ampeln-gegen-corona-e452127/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ez3PG5rTa5qx4w5amlUZz2Yf3FZrcpsm/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,,"Sabrina Ebitsch, Maria-Mercedes Hering, Berit Kruse, Sophie Menner, Sören Müller-Hansen and Julia Schubert, also involved were Felix Hütten, Florian Peljack, Florian Kaindl, Christian Helten, Niklas Keller, Julian Hosse, Simon Groß and Jakob Wetzel","Süddeutsche Zeitung's award-winning Data Team was established in 2018 to focus on data-driven reporting across all topics, with close links to the Investigations team (known for the Panama Papers, among other stories).

The newspaper (print and digital) includes a series of articles that study and analyse the current state of affairs – all pressing and gravitating problems. The three topics on focus are: investigative journalism, media law, and recent graduates working in the field.","The purpose behind my project was simple: shed light on an aspect of the media in Bulgaria that is covered in darkness. I'd like to believe that the impact of this research, the conversations with experienced Bulgarian journalists and international experts created an opportunity for my fellow students and young people in the country. An opportunity to feel free to pursue their journalistic careers without fear that someone might use their influence to impede them or prevent them from reporting the truth objectively.","In terms of content, I did a series of interviews with Bulgarian journalists who have worked in the field for many yers, with international experts (professors, media directors, media law professionals, and others). I did a research on the media business model in Bulgaria and the media laws in the country. I have also talked to recent graduates who had just started working in the field of journalism in Bulgaria. I used Adobe InDesign as a software to create the newspaper. The main illustration was created on Adobe Illustrator with the help of a fellow student. The rest of the illustrations are from a Fine Acts exhibition on Freedom of Speech. I also used Adobe Lightroom for the photographs I've used. I applied for a grant from my alma mater - the American University in Bulgaria and received enough funds to find a local printing house and print the newspaper (250 copies). I have also created a digital version of the newspaper on a dedicated website - https://www.mediaundersiege.com - building the website using the Webflow platform.","The hardest part of this project was connecting all the dots from every single interview, every single conversation, and every single material that I read doing my research. All of these sources gave me their own stories (in the forms of conversations or written content) but somehow they were all related. While I was assembling the project, I realized that my mind was submerged. I felt inexplicably overwhelmed and in that moment, when I was starting to lose grip of reality, something in my mind clicked. All the pieces of the puzzle started making sense and the stories connected. I understood how valuable such projects are because the state of media in Bulgaria has been dire for many years now. The reason is that exploring a corrupted field will inevitably try to corrupt the explorer. The process made me think there are too many problems for people to care or try to resolve. Persistence, however, showed me there is a way. In that very moment when the information I had acquired clicked, I understood that once you move beyond the moment of confusion and deliberate complication of circumstances by media moguls and enemies of free speech, the idea of free media is no longer helpless. The siege on media suddenly confronted a resistance.","I believe that not only journalists but all people out there can learn that society needs to care. Society needs to care when kids die on the streets, society needs to care when journalists get fired, society needs to care when people get silenced because today this might not be your child who died, or your friend who got fired, or a family member who was beaten up on the street because of the nature of his or her work, but tomorrow it might be. Society needs to understand that these are our kids, our journalists, our fellow citizens. In situations like these, society needs media that can be trusted. We need journalists who are not afraid to investigate, to ask questions and hold the right people accountable.",English,https://www.mediaundersiege.com,,,,,,,,"I, Georgi Staykov, am the author.

If the southern regions of Ukraine literally shone, the occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions are doing much worse. Though Ukraine still less lightened than other European countries, decentralization reform which brought more money to municialities showed its effectiveness.","We got three main findings, when have imposed light pollution maps of Ukraine from 2012 (before Ukrainian revolution of dignity and further Russian aggression) and 2019 (5 years after revolution and Russian occupation of parts of Ukraine). 1. Parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, occupied by Russia and warline alongside doing bad, as light level decreased a lot, some villages literally in the dark; the region is destroyed for years. 2. The decentralisation reform, which follows the Revolution of dignity in 2013-2014, affected positively as regions got more money and started to make its living areas more and more brightened; more light makes neighborhoods safe  3. Southern coastline areas became the most influenced (with the most added light from 2012 to 2019) from the reform results as a new local tourism destination, follows the Russian annexation of Crimea with its recreation infrastructure and nature resources.","Data was taken from https://www.lightpollutionmap.info/. This is information about the level of light pollution in the world. Only artificial light is displayed on the map. Data is collected using the Visible Infrared Imaging Suite radiometer, a sensor that detects radiation sources and is extremely sensitive even in low light conditions. It was developed and manufactured by Raytheon and is one of five instruments aboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbital Partnership (NPP) satellite platform, which was launched on October 28, 2011. We accumulated data for Ukraine for two periods: 2012 year (before Ukrainian revolution of dignity and further Russian aggression) and 2019 (5 years after revolution and Russian occupation of parts of Ukraine). We imposed the obtained maps from different years on each other and thus singled out the areas with the most noticeable difference.","From the beginning, our idea was to check how light pollution changed during the last years in Ukraine. We had an assumption that it would be more light in regions far away from bigger cities following the decentralisation reforms in Ukraine, which brought more money to municipalities. But when we took a look to the differencies between 2012 and 2019, we noticed that some regions became even less lightened. Accordingly we got a proof of degradation of occupied parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Also we saw that southern regions, along Black sea coastline, have the biggest differences in lightening change.","To confirm the assumptions about the main reasons for the changes in lightening, our journalists took comments from municipalities in several towns, as well as residents of the occupied areas in eastern Ukraine. Some municipalities stated that they systematically renewing street light equipment with LED-lamps, which affected the lighting level of their municipalities. Local resident from occupied territories have us details on when and how the street light being disappeared.

In this projet, we delve into three of these stories, portraying the long roads they faced, travelling from their remote communities to hospitals, only to receive discriminatory care.","This visualization project, which is part of a larger investigation into racism against indigineous people in Quebec health care, allows readers to understand the difficulties of access to large hospitals for indigineous people who live in the communities. The publication of this series of articles caused quite a stir at the Salon Bleu, where Quebec's elected representatives sit. Questioned from all sides by the opposition, the Minister of Indigenous Affairs, Ian Lafrenière, maintained that he was going to tackle these “cases of racism”, which he described as “unacceptable”, “shocking” and “ disturbing"". Opposition parties also proposed the adoption of a motion to ""take note of the disturbing testimonies of Indigenous people who have experienced racism in the Quebec health system"" and to document the complaints of Indigenous people in the  Quebec public health network in order to have a better idea of ​​the extent of the phenomenon. This motion was initially refused by the government of François Legault, but he finally opened the door to this idea a few weeks later. This project pressured the Legault government to recognize ""systemic racism"" and made healthcare safer for indigineous people.","First, we conducted interviews with indigneous people who reported being discriminated against while seeking healthcare. Through these twenty plus interviews, we showed that each story is not an isolated incident, but is rather an instance of a larger, systemic issue within the healthcare system. Throughout these stories, some patterns emerged that we wanted to represent in a visual article to bring them to life. We noticed that in many of these cases, patients had to travel long distances to get to the hospital where they would then receive inadequate care. We wanted to highlight these multiple dimensions we found that restricted indigneous people's access to healthcare - they received discrimination from hospital staff, as well as having to travel long distances to the hospital. For our visual article, we selected three stories in particular where the distance traveled by the patient was especially large. We decided to illustrate these stories in a scrollytelling format, where with each scroll, the cost in distance and time to the patient is accumulated at the bottom of the screen, while a map illustrates the large distance from the patient's community to their hospital.  To illustrate this distance, we created a geojson file containing the shortest route the patient could have taken on their journey to the hospital. Using Mapquest, we reverse geocoded the geographic position of each patient's stops (sometimes there were multiple) on their journey to healthcare. We then used Mapbox's API to get the fastest path they could have taken, which sometimes accumulated to hundreds of kilometers and hours.  We then saved these paths to a geojson file, which we visualized in the article with Mapbox. We incremented the counter gradually at the bottom of the page using D3.js. We think these techniques makes the reader feel the length of the journey.","This project was especially challenging because of the lack of data on this issue. At the time of this report, despite efforts by the Public Inquiry Commission on relations between Indigenous Peoples and by certain public services (ex : Viens Commission), Quebec hospitals did not count complaints filed by Indigenous people. Hospitals portrayed such stories as isolated incidents, and attempting to find their documentation on these cases was impossible. The burden of documentation was on the people who have been discriminated against, who may have incentives to avoid going public with their story. Journalists Jessica Nadeau and Marie-Michèle Sioui persuaded over twenty indigneous patients all across the province to come forward with their stories. Only thanks to their expert understanding of these communities was this issue able to come to light.  On the visual side, it is excessively difficult to create a visualization article without data to represent. These stories, and their similarities, allowed us to quantify come of the costs tied to this form of discrimination, in terms of kilometers and hours lost by the patients. We were then able to visualize these costs on our interactive map, to shed light on the importance of this problem.","Our lesson is that, even if a problem is poorly documented, using data journalism may be a good road to approach it. Only by looking at these issues from a data-driven lens can we realize that there may be a lack of good data on a topic. This data is important because it helps support recurring or systemic issues with facts, which legitimizes them. It is important to not abandon a data journalism project for lack of data, because it may often be possible to construct our own datasets, through web scraping, research, fieldwork (in our case), etc. It also teaches us that data is not only numbers, but that there are also humans behind it. In our efforts behind the project, speaking to over twenty indigenous people made us understand their perspectives better than any dataset ever could. Whenever data represents people, we should make a point to speak to them directly. It helps us understand as more than just a data point, but as a human. Only by doing so can we come to a better understanding of the issue and better present it to the world.",French,https://www.ledevoir.com/documents/special/05-21-autochtones-hopitaux/index.html,https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/600493/l-affaire-joyce-echaquan-loin-d-etre-un-cas-isole,https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/586849/deces-d-une-femme-autochtone-a-l-hopital-de-joliette-le-coroner-va-investiguer,https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/sante/600557/un-phenomene-que-quebec-ne-documente-toujours-pas?utm_source=recirculation&utm_medium=hyperlien&utm_campaign=corps_texte,,,,,"Jessica Nadeau, Marie-Michèle Sioui, Olivia Gélinas, Cédric Gagnon","Marie-Michèle Sioui has been parliamentary correspondent for Le Devoir in Quebec since March 2017. Jessica Nadeau has been a journalist at Le Devoir since 2012.

Brazil,"Ambiental Media, National Geographic",Big,Participant,,"Igapó, the forest made of water",03/09/21,"Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Infographics, Environment","Google Sheets, CSV","The infographic provides a sample of the rich biodiversity of the igapó, one of the most representative wetlands in the Amazon. The igapó forests remain flooded for most of the year, up to ten months in certain areas, which differentiates it from the other two main types of forest in the region: the floodplain and the terra firme. The infographic presents a broad image typical of the igapó, with species of fauna and flora that are highlighted or appear as an element of surprise as the person scrolls down the page. Each highlight is accompanied by an explanatory text.","The infographic is part of Especial Amazônia, a journalistic project developed by National Geographic Brazil and its collaborators to provide the public with information about the largest tropical forest in the world and help in its conservation. In addition to the infographic, the Ambiental Media team also wrote an article that reveals how natural causes, climate change and human activities (mining, deforestation, hydroelectric dams) combine in a scenario of threat to floodable areas in the Amazon (""Climate change and human activities already threaten flooding areas of the Amazon"", listed as a link further down in this application). Rich in biodiversity and riverine culture, floodplains and igapós fill and dry up every year according to the rainforest cycle, but the pulse of river flooding is no longer predictable. We spoke to scientists who are trying to better understand the impacts, which include the mortality of flora species and a reduction in the period of cultivation of agricultural crops, resulting in economic loss and food insecurity for riverine families. According to Angélica Resende, one of the interviewed researchers, ""the more we advance towards water, in the Amazon, the less knowledge there is"". Likewise, the attention that the mainstream media gives to aquatic ecosystems is less or non-existent. The infographic and the report therefore aim to draw attention to these areas and how they are suffering in large part due to human impacts. The infographic had 197,077 page views in Portuguese, and 452,446 in Spanish.","The illustrations were created by Luiz Iria, one of the best infographic designers in Brazil, in Photoshop program mixing features of digital brushes with photomontages to give more realism and visual impact. The design office Grande Circular was responsible for the web development and user experience, taking care of prototyping, usability and also implementing the infographics. It was a multidisciplinary team work, relying on tests and suggestions about formats and sequences, which the team validated as the process progressed, while at the same time exchanging information and references about content and texts. The team had the idea of ​​using the tree as a central element within the Igapó and, based on it, made the interactions showing information about animals that inhabit the forest. The elements and texts in the landscape are animated as the page scrolls, navigating in a carefully thought-out sequence. The project presents a lightweight scrollytelling site, which mainly uses CSS transforms (CSS transforms) for the animations and visual effects and a few lines of pure JS (vanilla JS) for the detection of scrolling and hover text (viewport). ","This project combines state-of-the-art science, data journalism, interactivity and art, to show one of the realities of the largest tropical forest in the world, extol its biodiversity and alert to the risks that threaten fauna, flora and the riverine communities in the amazonian floodplains. The most difficult and challenging part is precisely to create the entire environment of the theme presented, making it very close to reality using the digital resources that the program offers. Another challenge is to explain and illustrate a specific and lesser-known landscape of the Amazon Forest – which is more complex in its ecosystems than many people usually imagine. ","The infographic is an example of how to illustrate scientific data in an innovative, accessible and attractive way. It goes out of the ordinary by using an illustration with elements of an area of ​​the Amazon that is little known and studied, putting people in loco in one of the most biodiverse forest scenarios in the world. The central tree presented in the infographic is an iconic species of igapó forest, called macacarecuia, and 800-year-old individuals have been identified. The infographic is an example of scientific information that is not in the public domain nor is accessible to most journalists.

From historical medal comparisons to a zoom on volleyball, athletics and swimming events over the years, we sought to tell complex stories through the crossing of databases. Most data came from Olympedia, a website created by a group of Olympics historians and statisticians. It contains precious details about every Summer and Winter editions. On-the-fly Tokyo 2020 data was collected from the IOC website and was later paired with our historical database to enable a set of stories that otherwise would not exist if all data was not gathered. We",The project represents one of the Olympics largests Brazilian data journalism coverages. The decision of setting up a data-driven coverage reflected in a new Olympics coverage branch that could operate from distance and still bring interesting insights from live events. The project produced 13 articles and numerous insights for in-loco reporters on how athletes were doing in Tokyo 2020 compared to past Games.,The project used Python programming language for scraping and cleaning data from the website Olympedia. Analyses were made in R and visualizations were firstly made on R and then exported to Adobe Illustrator for further editing.,"Structuring and pairing historical with live data was the hardest part of the project. The efforts to scrape the historical data from Olympedia and other websites started a few months before the games and consisted on retrieving editions, venues, sports, events and events results data. All 32 past summer editions were scraped together with information about the sports they held and the venues in which they were held. For each sport there were numerous events and for each event there was a result. The project parsed almost 4000 of Olympedia’s pages and half of them were event results. In the Olympics first week the challenge was to retrieve data in the same format as the historical data. We ended up pairing all Tokyo’s sports and events information and some results that matched our interests. Again, hundreds of files were consumed and structured into our database throughout the Olympics.","The data collecting process was one of the most important parts of this project, as well as the analysis.

United Kingdom,NationalWorld.com,Small,Participant,,How fuel shortages were secretly building at petrol pumps before crisis,07/10/21,"Breaking news, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Business, Economy","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","The fuel crisis that engulfed Britain in September and October was one of the biggest stories of 2021 in the UK. A shortage of petrol (gas) and diesel deliveries had sparked panic-buying and caused mass closures of forecourts around the country.  This article used new data and an interactive map to reveal how the crisis developed, showing how supplies at forecourts had been dwindling in secret for three weeks before becoming public. It provided an important counter to the narrative being used by Government ministers that the crisis was a “manufactured situation” caused by panic-buying rather than any underlying shortages. ","At the time of my report, a Government narrative was emerging that the fuel crisis was caused by panic-buying - stoked by media reporting - rather than because of underlying shortages.  In an interview with Sky News, transport minister Grant Shapps called the crisis a “manufactured situation” caused by a leak to the media by a road haulage association. A YouGov poll in September revealed that 47% of people believed the fuel shortages had been caused by the media. Indeed, a cursory look at experimental data released for the first time by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy initially seemed to back up this theory, and this is how the story was reported by other outlets at the time.  But a more in-depth look at the data revealed a different story and provided an important fact-check to this narrative, instead finding that shortages had indeed been building for some weeks at forecourts. Stocks had fallen to abnormally low levels - one-third of capacity - before panic-buying took off. My article - published on the day the dataset was released - was the top story on the NationalWorld.com website, the flagship national title of the JPIMedia news group. The same day, I also shared my analysis, copy and visualisations with the wider JPIMedia group, which consists of about 150 local and regional news brands including The Scotsman, The Yorkshire Post and the Lancashire Evening Post. This allowed local titles big and small to report my findings, giving their readers regionalised insights into how the crisis developed in their area. Titles in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Milton Keynes and Buckinghamshire were among those to run localised versions of the story.  For example, here is coverage of the story on the website ManchesterWorld, serving the whole of the Manchester city region: https://www.manchesterworld.uk/news/fuel-shortages-were-secretly-building-at-filling-stations-for-weeks-before-public-found-out-3411452","The Government dataset was released as an MS Excel file. I used Excel to conduct my analysis before turning it onto a Google Sheets file to enable me to share my analysis with colleagues at other JPIMedia titles. My key question was whether an underlying supply problem had existed before the crisis, or whether it was indeed caused by consumer panic-buying.  A cursory look at the dataset’s information page seemed to suggest the latter. It said that sales had rocketed by 80% from Friday, September 24 onwards (the date shortages were first reported in the media), adding: “As a result of this increased demand, stock levels in the sampled filling stations dropped significantly”. The volume of deliveries, it said, had been “relatively constant” before being “ramped up considerably in response to increased demand”. The dataset included a line chart of deliveries over time, which appeared to show they had indeed fallen only slightly before the crisis - the line reported by other news organisations. However, there was other data showing the stocks of fuel being stored at forecourts.  This is where I found my story: analysis showed that average stocks at British forecourts had been below pre-pandemic levels since May and had then dwindled steadily from August 30, hitting just a third of capacity before the crisis began. I also analysed this data at a regional level, finding that London and the South East had seen stocks fall first.  I created an interactive map showing how the secret crisis had built up, using the data visualisation tool Flourish. I made a series of choropleth maps showing the change over time, then layered them as a ‘story’ that readers could click through. I also created a line chart showing how average supplies at forecourts had fallen.","The biggest challenge with this project was the speed at which it had to be turned around. I had to avoid the Government spin to find and present a strong and novel news story. This had to be done within a few hours from a complex dataset I was unfamiliar with. There was intense media interest in the fuel crisis so I knew other news organisations would be publishing stories based on the dataset and I had to move fast.  The Government dataset was released as an Excel file, with 16 tabs, some of which ran to more than 20,000 rows.  It was experimental data and the first weekly release of its kind, so there was no way I could familiarise myself with the format beforehand by looking at previous releases. Instead, I had to spend considerable time familiarising myself with the dataset once it had been released. Please note: This article was published on Thursday 7 October, 2021, the same day that the Government dataset was released. The date which appears on the main article, Friday 8 October, is incorrect and was caused by the later addition of a hyperlink to the story.","There is a good lesson here: journalists should take the Governmental ‘introduction’ to a dataset with a healthy dose of scepticism. Often it contains useful guidance and information, but sometimes it is steering you away from the real story. Also, it pays to really dig around a Governmental dataset when it is published. Your story may not be the first to report on its contents but it may well be the most insightful.",English,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/uk/fuel-shortages-were-secretly-building-at-petrol-stations-three-weeks-before-crisis-figures-show-3411412,,,,,,,,Claire Wilde,"Claire Wilde is data and investigations editor for JPIMedia.

Those varieties face overfishing and the effects of the climate crisis, such as higher water temperatures and scarcity of food. The investigation shows the research on sharks, the lack of protection, how the Mexican government allows the fishing of endangered sharks and their fin exports to China and Hong Kong, and the contradiction between the fishing and the environmental sectors around protection priorities.","The investigation has shown the problems around the protection of sharks under threat in Mexico, including legal, statistical and research issues. It has demonstrated the difficulties to study the biology of sharks, in order to obtain hard data to sustain decisions. It has revealed how fishing authorities allow overfishing of the endangered species, contrary to the international commitments adopted by Mexico. The research has shown how Mexican authorities have ignored scientific knowledge delivered by scientists and NGOs to get sharks protected. The investigation has exposed how Mexican authorities have authorized shark fin exports under CITIES based on dubious data. Mexico analyzes again the protection of four shark species, which would be announced in the first quarter of 2022. CITES has yet to study the level of protection of sharks in Mexico, given that the pandemic has restricted physical meetings.","Based on what sources tipped me, I relied on FOIA requests to obtain scientific studies and databases on fishing permits, fishing catches and shark fin exports. That bulk of information gave me the insights to interview sources on the most important aspects regarding the situation of endangered sharks in Mexico. I analyzed, compared, cribbed and mapped the databases to learn where sharks were caught, who catched them, when, who exported shark fins, to whom and on what basis were the permits issued. I visualized the data to see how shark fishing moves and where are the hotspots of shark fishing and of their trade. That bulk led me to draw some important conclusions that confirm my hypothesis and allows me to keep researching the issue.","The merits of the investigation rest on its exclusivity, its originality, its innovative approach –based on till then unknown scientific studies and the bulk of statistics–, and the variety of sources. The FOIA requests take one month to get answers and, if those answers are not satisfying, it takes two more months for the appeal process. Once answers were delivered, the databases were huge. I spent weeks studying the data, including classifying them by year, place, species, type of boat, capacity of the boat, and so on. Then, I assessed the results to see if they were in the margins of the expectations, if they were logical, according with the causes of the issues sorrounding the situation of sharks. I revised the results to verify their accuracy and to evaluate if they support the hypothesis.","Journalists can learn from this investigation the usefulness of FOIA requests, the reliance on databases and the development of data journalism. First, to draw original ideas based on information obtained from sources. Second, designing a roadmap to develop those ideas on the field. Third, drawing the questions for the FOIA requests.

Brazil,AzMina Magazine,Small,Participant,,Elas no Congresso 2021: Proposals unfavorable to women may gain support from new congressional leaders,29/03/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Politics, Women, Human rights","Scraping, Google Sheets, Python",Elas no Congresso is a legislative monitoring project by Revista AzMina that uses public data from the Brazilian legislature to monitor women's rights in the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. We analyzed with 17 organizations that work with women's rights 649 bills on gender that were created in 2019 and 2020 in the Brazilian legislature. We found that 1 in 4 bills are unfavorable to women's rights and that they are the most active in for women's rights.,"Our survey was republished by national vehicles such as UOL and MyNews. Our analysis also guided debates on how women's rights are treated in Congress, with AzMina as a source. Our analysis of the growth and ineffectiveness of punitiveness as a way to combat gender violence was the subject of reports and debates on YouTube in the Chamber of Deputies itself. Elas no Congresso is the first legislative, public and free monitoring project, specializing in women's rights in the country. AzMina joined the project with its expertise in technology, journalism, and advocacy and mobilization, an unprecedented initiative in the country at a time when women's rights have been victims of daily attacks by the federal government and Congress. Today, Elas no Congresso have articulation with feminist organizations, which help in the evaluation of bills and also receive and use our monitoring to organize their advocacy strategies, with parliamentarians who are evaluated, interviewed and share their agendas and proposals with us, with the the press that uses this data to cover gender, and with civil society that mobilizes to draw the attention of parliamentarians responsible for the progress and setbacks monitored by the project.","For the published survey, we first selected a broad list of keywords often related to women's rights. These are terms that range from domestic violence, maternity leave and abortion to adjacent themes such as childbirth, childcare and breastfeeding. We then searched the House and Senate APIs, with Python, to find projects of interest. Each proposal receives a score, ranging from -2 to 2, according to its relevance and position in relation to women's rights. This score is based on the evaluation of each project by 17 civil society organizations working on women's rights. With this we were able to carry out qualitatve and quantitative analyzes on topics covered, performance of parliamentarians and parties, etc. So we also do our ranking. For each parliamentarian, we consider the sum of the scores of the projects of his/her authorship. It is from this that we calculate the final score: a proportion of the maximum value (in the case of positive scores) or the minimum value (in the case of negative scores) between the scores of all parliamentarians, in addition to a variable weight according to acting of the party to which he belongs. Thus, the final score of parliamentarians ranges from -100 to +100, with -100 being the worst score among the analyzed parliamentarians, and +100 being the best score. The calculations were created by a statistician and are checked by a development and programming professional. All data on the analyzed projects and the notes of each parliamentarian and party are available for download.","We had the mission of bringing together more than a dozen organizations that work with women's rights in different themes to qualitatively analyze each project. We look for organizations that work with domestic violence, sexual and reproductive rights, sports, labor rights, among others. In 2021, during the pandemic, bringing this network together and creating methodological agreements to classify these projects into two binary classifications was certainly the most challenging part. This year we also made changes to the calculation of our ranking to make it even more assertive, including a weight for the party's average grade to also include it as part of each parliamentarian's personal grade. We continue to seek to avoid distortions in the role of parliamentarians on gender in Congress.","For the media ecosystem, the project reduces the difficulty for reporters and editors to keep track of complicated and, in most cases, not as transparent processes as the bills move forward in regional legislative bodies. Our project facilitates coverage of women's rights in local and national vehicles. But for sure the entire ecosystem can be inspired by our methodology. When we won the Claudio Weber Abramo Award for Data Journalism, in 2020, the award jury highlighted the “original, complete, relevant approach, and a rare degree of complexity in journalistic work guided by data”.

The move to restrict ballot access — which voting rights advocates experts argued was motivated by false allegations perpetuated by former President Trump about voter fraud in the 2020 election — disproportionately impacted people of color. Ensuring that every American can vote is an important issue — and one that has the ability to control the election outcome.

These restrictive laws disproportionately impact Black and Latino people, who overwhelmingly used mail-in voting and drop boxes.","Other journalists can learn from this project that there is not always a “both sides” argument, especially for topics that concern the health of our democracy.

United States,Capital News Service - University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism,Small,Participant,,A timeline of COVID-19 cases during phased reopening in Maryland,10/05/21,"Explainer, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Health","Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","In this project, we analyzed the COVID-19 cases and deaths data in the state of Maryland, as it related to announcements made by Gov. Larry Hogan on mask mandates, indoor/outdoor dining, and travel and gathering restrictions.","We feel that the impact of this project was that it provided background to these public health and policy decisions, that for most of the reopening in 2020-2021, people felt was made with considerations for safety. Analyzing this data demonstrated that reopening was decided on in spite of, rather than because of, the state of COVID at the time. Now, as we go into 2022 amid a huge surge in COVID cases from the Omicron variant, this project helps add some context to compare guidance to outbreak numbers at the time.","All of the data we collected was from The New York Times’ Covid-19 national data on GitHub. After downloading it, we isolated the Maryland data and focused solely on that section. To construct the timeline of mandates and announcements, we worked backwards and looked at news from various outlets, often The Baltimore Sun, so we could organize which announcements happened when. The website page was built using HTML and CSS, and the charts were made with Flourish. Before coding the final product, we mocked up the design and tested out multiple different options using pen and paper sketches, as well as Adobe XD wireframing and Google Slides.","The hardest part of this project was matching the data between the time of restrictions and number of cases in a given timeframe. And finding an appropriate way to visualize the data. We chose to put the 7-day average and the daily cases on the same charts, even though this decision required slightly different y-axes. The small difference in axes didn’t impact the visualization of the data very much, and in our opinion, didn’t mislead from our point. We also chose to omit hospitalizations, but kept deaths in the chart despite it being small. Since our main focus was to contextualize the public policy decision making with the impact it had on cases, we focused most on daily cases and the 7-day average. The average was often referenced as justification for the public health and policy decision making, so it was important to bring that data to the forefront.","Other journalists can learn to question the effectiveness of public policy and restrictions and to approach the COVID pandemic from a data-based perspective.  With something that can change so rapidly, like COVID cases and 7-day averages, even when a decision may be justified by a dip in the data, it can immediately be unjustified as cases rise, as a result of a new guidance. All COVID-related decision making seemed to be made on various different justifications, like how long the average was below X number, and when that was reported on without visualization, people may not really realize where we are at. These two sentences really demonstrate how we used the data to show what went into the reopening decisions: “On May 8, four days after Maryland broke an average of 1,000 cases per day, Gov. Hogan was ready to begin Phase 1 of Maryland’s reopening plan. There was an average of 958 cases per day between May 8 and June 4, 2020, an increase of 409% from the seven-day average on March 30.” When we realized this, we knew the project had achieved our goal of pointing out that, despite reopening, things weren’t getting safer for the public.",English,https://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/spring-2021/covid-timeline/index.html,,,,,,,,"Emma Grazado, Rachel Hunt","Emma Grazado is a graduate of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism from Marblehead, Massachusetts.

United States,"Better Government Association, the Chicago Sun-Times, The Circuit, University of Southern California's Annenberg Center for Health Journalism",Big,Participant,,The Costly Toll of Dead-End Drug Arrests,03/12/21,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Infographics, Crime","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Python","In Chicago, thousands of low-amount drug cases are tossed out of court every year because of an unwritten rule in which prosecutors and judges don’t think such cases are worth the hassle. So why are the arrests happening in the first place? That’s the question the Better Government Association and the Chicago Sun-Times tackled in this multi-part investigation. The BGA and Sun-Times found the dead-end drug arrests cost taxpayers millions and those arrested their jobs, housing and freedom. Reporters also explored alternatives, including what is being attempted in Oregon where such arrests are handled with tickets rather than arrests.","The BGA and Sun-Times had several avenues of impact for this work, which was part of The Circuit, an ongoing collaboration between the BGA and another nonprofit newsroom in Chicago, Injustice Watch that has accessed, organized and analyzed massive amounts of criminal court data from the Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court’s office.  The “Dead-End Drug Arrests” project took a slice of that data and then went deep into it in order to get our findings. But we’ve also, for the first time, made access to the systemic data in the Cook County court system available to the public. Our project standardized a massive amount of information so that it could be used and analyzed by researchers and reporters. We also visualized trends in criminal cases over nearly two decades and presented it in a way that made it useful for those inside and outside the legal profession. It made information that was hidden from the public available for all to see. Other reporters and researchers used our data to augment their work.Interest in the data we analyzed is only growing because while other agencies in Illinois have reports and data sets that showcase the events in the judicial system, the data from the clerk’s office provides the most complete picture of what goes on throughout every level of the court.  The stories also have begun to have a direct impact with lawmakers and those most directly affected. The project has reinvigorated talk of possible legislative reforms and reporters also engaged community members through public education events. These events, one streamed online and one in person, connected those affected by drug charges in the legal system to connect with the story and experts on the topic of addiction treatment.","The BGA and Sun-Times analyzed 280,000 drug possession arrests made in Cook County between 2000 and 2018. The data includes the name, age, race, arrest date, jurisdiction and information from the court docket. Analysis was tracked using R Markdown notebooks. Reporters collaborated using Git, and performed analysis using a combination of R Studio, Python and PostgreSQL.  The examination focused on only the cases in which the top charge filed against individuals was possession of less than 15 grams of a controlled substance — the lowest-felony drug charge in Illinois. Available court data does not provide the precise quantity of drugs, so reporters took a random sample from the most recent year — 2018 — so they could examine the available records at the courthouse. The clerk of the circuit court doesn’t make scanned files of all years available at court terminals, but files from recent years are available. This allowed reporters to collect records that provided deeper detail. Cases involving marijuana charges were not considered. Cases were classified as advancing to the criminal phase or dismissed. Of the 365 cases, there were 227 where the highest quantity was 1 gram or less. Our findings were applied to all narcotics possession cases in 2018, with a confidence interval of 95% and a standard error of plus or minus 1.4%. Based on this analysis, the estimated dismissal rate for all narcotics possession cases of 1 gram or less in 2018 increased to greater than 95%. The analysis determined the dismissal rate from all examined cases for 2018 — including cases where the weight was higher than 1 gram — was 71.8%, and 50% for 2000 to 2018. The rate of dismissal increased through the years.","Criminal charges and statutes in the database were entered manually by clerks. For example, there were hundreds of different ways a clerk could enter a crime such as aggravated assault or possession of a controlled substance. In order to analyze the records, they had to be counted consistently. It took reporters more than a year to get the data consistent for a systemic analysis. Beyond the hurdles required to analyze the data, the legal system also has factors that hinder reporting on issues. Cases cannot be filmed, and participants in the criminal justice system are often reluctant to speak about their experience for many reasons. Drug addiction and use are considered stigmatizing behavior, and it makes many reluctant to speak about their experiences.","Our launch of stories in December 2021 was a continuation of this unparalleled collaborative journalism investigation that explores and exposes decades of overlooked data and their connecting patterns buried in the files of the Cook County courts. Much of the data we extracted from the court system was complicated and disorganized, but we were able to arrange it in a usable way to answer long-standing questions about a court system that serves 5.2 million residents. At a time when the local media is shrinking across the nation, including in Chicago and Cook County, we hope our collaboration serves as a statement that despite our organizations’ varied missions, we share similar core values and goals to achieve a greater good: exposing institutional failures that obstruct justice, confronting racial and economic inequality, and providing greater transparency to make the court system more accountable. Reporters also shared a large number of documents organized by Google Drive, which allowed them to track records for the project.  Using other data sources to supplement the court data was also key to telling the complete story. Police arrest data allowed reporters to explore the geography of the cases, and the concentration of drug arrests near the drug markets on Chicago’s West Side. Custodial data from the sheriff allowed them to put a price on drug arrests.",English,https://www.bettergov.org/news/the-costly-toll-of-dead-end-drug-arrests/,https://www.bettergov.org/news/oregon-is-first-state-to-ticket-narcotics-users-but-new-reform-has-yet-to-live-up-to-promise/,https://www.bettergov.org/news/kim-foxx-s-ex-trainer-caught-up-in-unending-cycle-of-drug-arrests/,https://www.bettergov.org/news/dead-end-drug-arrests-how-we-reported-this-story/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiYD_LQ46Uk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVkWY_9krR4&feature=emb_title,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyG4ASGswxU,,"Casey Toner, Jared Rutecki, Frank Main, Forest Gregg, Hannah Cushman, David Kidwell, John Chase, Paul Saltzman, James Causey, Analisa Trofimuk, Pat Nabong, Ashley Rezin, Nina Fuentes, Olivia Obineme, Satchel Price, Cesar Calderon, Jesse Howe, Andy Boyle","Frank Main is a criminal-justice reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times.

United States,"Grist, The Texas Observer",Small,Shortlist,,Waves of Abandonment,05/04/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Chart, Map, Environment","Animation, AI/Machine learning, Drone, Scraping, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","Volatile oil prices are setting the stage for fossil fuel companies to abandon oil and gas wells en masse, particularly in the Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico. Those two states are already responsible for cleaning up about 7,000 such abandoned wells, a task that will cost at least $335 million. New statistical models developed by Grist and the Texas Observer predict the states could soon find themselves saddled with an additional 13,000 wells in need of cleanup — with a true cost that is closer to $1 billion. This project was supported by the Pulitzer Center.","The orphan well problem has received considerable attention at the local, state, and national level since the publication of our series. Regulators were receptive to our findings, and advocates and industry veterans alike sought to translate our methods to other geographic contexts. (Our open-source code makes this type of effort possible.) We saw our reporting cited in various public testimonies in state and federal hearings on well bonding. The recent infrastructure bill passed by Congress included almost $5 billion for old oil and gas infrastructure remediation — and while we wouldn’t claim to have unilaterally spurred that particular investment, we’re confident we contributed to the broader policy conversation in this space. Furthermore, in January 2022 (nine months after our reporting), the U.S. Interior Department drastically revised upwards their estimate of the number of orphan wells nationwide. The adjustment aligns with our predictions. With respect to the media ecosystem, our reporting was read by hundreds of thousands of people across a variety of platforms, and our feature was republished by The Guardian, among other outlets. Our Waves of Abandonment series received the Online News Association award in Investigative Data Journalism (Small/Medium Newsroom) earlier this year and contributed to Grist’s win in the General Excellence (Small Newsroom) category.","Grist partnered with The Texas Observer to harness their reporter Christopher Collins' expertise covering his native West Texas. Grist staff writer Naveena Sadasivam conducted archival research, interviewed policy experts, and filed dozens of public records requests to get the raw material for our data analysis. Grist data reporter Clayton Aldern then mined and combined these datasets and leveraged machine learning to create a statistical model of well abandonment. The model — which generates projections for every well in the Permian Basin — allowed us to predict which of the region's tens of thousands of oil wells are on the verge of orphanage. A separate survival analysis helped us understand producers' sensitivity to oil prices. Specifically, we created a series of cross-validated LASSO models to identify wells the states had not yet considered orphaned (but which were statistically indistinguishable from orphan wells). Because of our imbalanced classes (i.e. there were many more examples of merely ‘inactive' wells in the dataset than orphan wells), we also penalized models for incorrectly classifying orphan wells during training. This move prevented the models from simply learning to always guess 'inactive' — which would have led to high (but misleading) accuracy values for model performance. To forecast the public costs of these potential future abandonments, we used American Petroleum Institute identification numbers to perform lookups in state databases of plugging cost projections. We leveraged R/RStudio, Python, Tableau, Adobe Illustrator, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript. More information on our methodology is available in our methods write-up and on GitHub.  To help ensure the piece had the most impact, we added eye-catching imagery and drone videography and crafted interactive data visualizations (including, in our methods story, a web-app version of the model) that allow readers to see for themselves how the variables fit together to tell the larger story.","One challenge came from the disparate nature of the datasets in question. Some of our production data went back to the 1960s and had been saved in a variety of obscure formats, including those written for original IBM computers. Accordingly, sidestepping some particularly nasty data-ingestion tasks involved loading 62 million rows of well- and lease-level data into memory before cleaning. And not all datasets came to us easily. For example, we didn’t receive a complete dataset of New Mexico’s enforcement actions until we presented them with a BeautifulSoup-scraped version of their own public-facing database. A public records request sent to the agency was also rebuffed until we challenged their decision by submitting a complaint to the New Mexico attorney general’s office. Only after the attorney general’s review and decision to compel the agency to comply with our request did we receive the enforcement records. While other modeling efforts (at think tanks, for example) have sought to understand the orphan well problem at the national level, we believe they suffer from unrealistic assumptions about the abandonment rates of inactive wells in the country. Not all inactive wells will be orphaned. We believe our model is the first to operate at the level of the individual oil well (and produce realistic as opposed to sensationalist predictions). From inception to completion, our reporting process took approximately 11 months.","We believe this project is a good example of journalists leveraging statistical models to make predictions about the future (as opposed to exclusively describing the present or explaining the past). Certainly, talented data journalists at outlets like The Economist and Bloomberg engage in this kind of projection all the time. Our project offers a reminder that statistical models of public data can have lives outside the economic realm. Furthermore, we believe the models presented here represent a nice example of combining various subfields of statistical inquiry (in our case, statistical learning/machine learning, null-hypothesis falsification testing, and survival analysis) in order to paint a fuller, more reliable, portrait of real-world phenomena. Fundamentally, we think our project presents a case study in balancing advanced statistical models with archival research, public-records requests, interviews, and other tools of traditional reporting. When further combined with expressive visuals, interactive graphics, and drone videography, the package communicates important findings without deifying numbers over hard, qualitative reporting — despite being a piece of ""data journalism.""",English,https://grist.org/abandoned-oil-gas-wells-permian-texas-new-mexico/,https://grist.org/energy/scale-of-texas-new-mexico-abandoned-oil-wells/,https://grist.org/energy/fracking-oil-gas-well-inspection-in-permian-basin/,https://grist.org/energy/amy-townsend-small-study-methane-pecos-county-texas-abandoned-wells/,https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/looming-liabilities-abandoned-wells-permian,https://github.com/clayton-aldern/abandoned-wells,,,"Naveena Sadasivam, Christopher Collins, Clayton Aldern","Naveena Sadasivam is a senior staff writer at Grist.

United States,BuzzFeed News,Big,Shortlist,,"The graveyard doesn't lie: Undercounted deaths from extreme weather, climate change, and failing infrastructure",26/05/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Environment, Health","Animation, CSV, R, RStudio","These two stories used excess deaths analysis to show that the winter storm and power outages that hit Texas in February and the extreme heat wave that hit the Pacific Northwest in June caused hundreds more deaths than we counted for by the affected states. The second story broadened the narrative to show that the failure to accurately count deaths from extreme weather is a general problem that is leaving government officials ill-prepared to respond to climate change and reduce its toll. It also discussed reforms in data collection, analysis, and disaster planning that would improve resilience against the single","The first story story drew widespread coverage from local and national media outlets, and prompted state Democrats to demand an investigation. This was a largely avoidable disaster: After an earlier winter storm in 2011, federal regulators warned Texas that its electricity grid, which is run independently from the two large interconnections that serve most of the rest of the nation, was vulnerable to failure in extreme cold.  Bills to better prepare the Texas grid to handle extreme cold were already in process. They were passed by the Texas legislature shortly after our article appeared and were signed into law by  Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in June. However, critics argue that these measures fall short of what is required. The issue has moved to center stage in the 2022 Texas gubernatorial election, with the Democratic challenger, Beto O'Rourke, citing our reporting in his attacks on Abbott's record.    ","The CDC maintains counts of weekly deaths, for all and certain selected causes, at the national and state level, for 2014 to 2019, and for 2020 and 2021. To estimate expected deaths for each jurisdiction and week, not including deaths from COVID-19, we trained regression models on the 2015-2019 weekly deaths data, accounting for long-term demographic changes using a linear component and using a smoothing spline to account for seasonal variation. We then used these models to predict the expected number of weekly non-COVID deaths for each state, with 95% confidence intervals. For each jurisdiction and week, we calculated weekly death anomalies minus deaths for which COVID-19 was given as the underlying cause, again with confidence intervals. We found significant spikes in non-COVID deaths in Texas in the week ending Feb 20, immediately following the winter storm and when the power outages occurred, and in Washington and Oregon in the week ending Jul 3, at the peak of an unprecedented heat wave, that greatly exceeded the official tallies in the affected states. Three independent academic experts in excess deaths analysis reviewed the findings, methodology, and analysis code. We also looked in more detail and individual causes of death in the CDC data, finding notable spikes for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Texas for the week ending Feb 20, and for Washington in the week ending Jul 3. The analyses were performed using R and RStudio. Graphics for the stories were made with Datawrapper and ggplot2 R package, showing the time course of the power outages by county in Texas and neighboring states by animating frames using ImageMagick.","Finding family members of those who died in the Texas winter storm to reveal the harrowing human stories of these uncounted deaths. Aldhous looked for specific causes of death listed in the CDC data that were associated with the overall spikes, which flagged cardiovascular disease and diabetes as the causes listed on death certificates that were most likely to be associated with the extreme weather. He then filed public records requests to medical examiners in the largest Texas counties, asking for complete lists and cause of death for those who died after the winter storm and during the power failures. This allowed Lee and Hirji to triage their reporting by focusing on deaths that were attributed to these causes in the records obtained from medical examiners — turning what would otherwise have been a guessing game into a targeted search for medically vulnerable people whose deaths were triggered by the weather extremes. This allowed their individual stories to be told.","The GitHub repositories with our methodology, data, and analysis code provide a recipe for other data reporters wanting to apply excess deaths analysis to their own work. Our analysis of specific recorded causes of death, when combined with medical examiner’s records, also shows how data can be used not just to provide a top-line finding, but also to triage reporting by helping to identify individuals affected by the issues raised, emphasizing the human stories involved.",English,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/texas-winter-storm-power-outage-death-toll,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/peteraldhous/extreme-weather-climate-change-missing-deaths,https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2021-05-tx-winter-storm-deaths/,https://buzzfeednews.github.io/2021-12-extreme-weather-deaths/,,,,,"Peter Aldhous, Stephanie M.

United States,USA TODAY network,Big,Shortlist,,Uncounted: The hidden death toll of the COVID-19 pandemic,23/12/21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Infographics, Map, Health","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, R, Python","For our Uncounted investigation, journalists from five newsrooms worked together to analyze CDC mortality data and follow that data to where it originates at the local level, through death certificates. We compared official COVID death figures with models developed by the CDC, in coordination with a team of demographers at Boston University; we collected death certificates and other primary source documents and then had medical examiners and physicians review them for errors and omissions; and we interviewed more than 100 medical examiners, coroners, public health experts, families and policymakers","What we found: Short-staffed, undertrained and overworked coroners and medical examiners were all but unified in when and how to investigate a possible death from COVID-19. Some took the family’s word for what they believed was their loved one’s cause of death. Others didn’t review medical histories or order tests to look for COVID-19, but expected the state or family members to provide documentation. Death investigators and some physicians attributed deaths to inaccurate and nonspecific causes that are meaningless to pathologists, but closely resemble symptoms of COVID-19. Our investigation reveals the country’s central problem with tracking COVID-19 deaths: Where people live and die has a lot to do with the accuracy of their death certificate. Some deaths are investigated with state-of-the-art technology and expertise; others don’t go beyond a phone call with the family.  Much of the impact from this project, published in three parts in mid-to-late December, is still evolving. But the CDC said in a statement that our findings go beyond what they are able to provide, and said forthcoming working papers would seek to address some of the more common reporting errors. ""We’re trying to push out as much information as we can, but we don’t have the resources to go digging in all of these counties. So it’s great that you’re doing this,"" Bob Anderson, the CDC’s chief of mortality statistics, told us. ""The sort of information that you’re digging up can help us, potentially, to improve the quality of the data.""","The team at Boston University worked with the journalists on this project to provide them with models of expected deaths in every U.S. county, a level of granularity never before reported on a national scale. The team then identified states and counties that had highest rates of deaths that were both more than any normal, pre-pandemic year, but weren’t attributed to COVID.  This modeling data was created using 10 years worth of CDC mortality data and a regression analysis. We supplemented this data with our own point-in-time analysis of 2020 and 2021 CDC mortality data, from its newly-released WONDER API. In the areas flagged by models, reporters found an unusual increase in deaths from natural causes, especially at home, and spoke with local corners and medical examiners who would likely be investigating and certifying the death certificates in these cases.  We've made the data publicly available as a repo and embeddable Google Sheet, along with a searchable data viz by county:","Mortality data, at the local, state and federal levels, only tells part of the story. As our series found, many of the errors and omissions on death certificates reflect a long-simmering problem of conflicting or unclear CDC guidance, a lack of training and resources or general apathy or politicization of the pandemic. As a result, we struggled to reconcile these data discrepancies and had to rely on on-the-ground reporting to shore up the differences. Many of the answers we received about the number of unexplained excess deaths in a particular county, specifically from Louisiana, Missouri and Mississippi, were revealing and not surprising. But they had not been fully explained before and elected coroners have yet to be held accountable for these errors and the incompleteness of their data. We plan to continue this work throughout 2022, in an attempt to expand on these findings.","As part of the project, Documenting COVID-19 is sharing the data used for the larger investigation to help local newsrooms investigate how COVID deaths are certified and counted in their community. We'll be updating this spreadsheet with new data and tools for reporters in the coming months. We also held a webinar on our reporting process and shared our slides here.

Malaysia,Malaysiakini,Big,Participant,,"Over a hundred government websites are ‘not secure', will they harm us?",19/07/21,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Open data, OSINT","Scraping, Google Sheets","The purpose of this project is to examine the security status of Malaysian government websites. Of the nearly 700 websites examined, at least 255 were “not secure”, leaving open the possibility of personal data breaches and other cybersecurity risks. The article quoted several cybersecurity experts to explain, in layman’s terms, how the security weaknesses of the government websites could expose the Malaysian public to harm. It also put forward suggestions to the Malaysian government on how to enhance the security measures of its websites, as well as advised the public on how to protect themselves from potentially harmful sites.  ","Of the 255 ”not secure” websites highlighted, 91 government agencies and ministries have subsequently upgraded their websites to HTTPS from HTTP after we have contacted them for replies. This response was even before the publication of the project. Following the publication of the report, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) stated that a cybersecurity audit would be conducted on those websites. As of Dec 28, 2021, the government upgraded the security status of an additional 76 websites from HTTP to HTTPS, while removing spam and malicious elements from four websites. Nonetheless, at the same time, there were still at least 90 websites that have remained “not secure” five months after the audit announcement.","We gathered a list of Malaysian government websites from a Wikipedia page. From those websites, we obtained more links to other government websites. We mainly use Google Spreadsheets to store information of these websites, such as whether they have forms for user information, the date of access to check on whether they have been upgraded to HTTPS or not, and the comments and response of the government agencies that own the respective websites. A special website is created for the project. Its structure and layout were built with JavaScript, JavaScript library React and React framework Next.js. The key information of the websites is presented on a table built with react-table, which allows the user to search and filter for a particular website(s). To achieve a more engaging user experience, we have also created a small interactive component on the page where users can enter a usernames and passwords pair, and we will show the data sent from an HTTP and HTTPS website respectively. This is to show the difference between the encrypted data sent from an HTTPS website and the unencrypted data sent from an HTTP website. Screenshots of each website were taken and they were processed with Adobe Photoshop by stating the access date. Old-school journalism methods were applied in this project too. We sourced the contact numbers and email addresses of each government agency we named in our project and tried to call or mail them for their right of reply.  ","The most challenging task of this project is to verify the security status of nearly 700 websites one by one. It is because there will be special cases, such as some of the websites actually having their HTTPS version, but one that was not redirected from their HTTP sites. The checking task had to be performed on a weekly basis as the status might change overnight. It was extremely crucial for us to go through the list again a day before publication. Another challenge is to produce a fair and balanced report by getting the replies and comments of all the 700 government agencies named in the report. It was a painstaking task. We have three dedicated journalists to ring and/or email those agencies for their reply. Around 130 agencies had gotten back to us, explaining the difficulties and challenges they were facing when upgrading their websites. 86 of the websites have been upgraded to HTTPS since receiving our phone call and/or emails. It shows that those agencies were taking this matter seriously. We have put all the replies we have got into the story.  ","Working with experts is crucial for our project. We have the help of several experts, including the software engineer from our own newsroom, who guided us through the end of the project to avoid misjudgements and reporting any misleading information. I think what we have also learned from this project is how to present the technical information about cybersecurity in layman’s terms, with the help of graphics and videos. It is hard for us to avoid using jargon in the story. To make sure our readers, mainly in their 40s to 60s, understand the technical terms and aspects of the project, we use plenty of accordions (collapsible content) throughout the article for those terms. The most important aspect is to think of the impact we would like to achieve before starting working on the project. It did help us set a clear goal and served as the most vital guidance for us from the beginning to the end.  ","English, Malay, Chinese",https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/gov-my/en,https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/gov-my/ms,https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/gov-my/zh,https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/584079,https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/604874,,,,"Lee Long Hui, Ooi Choon Nam, Hazman Hazwan Sulaiman, Syariman Badrulzaman, Nur‌ ‌Aziatul‌ ‌Khazizi‌, Raveena Nagotra, Alena Nadia, Alex Woon, Ng Xiang Yi, Wahyudi Yunus","The project is presented by Kini News Lab in Malaysiakini, one of the most-read news portals in Malaysia.

Malaysia,Malaysiakini,Big,Participant,,Death Behind Bars - The forgotten faces who succumbed to brutality,10/12/21,"Long-form, Illustration, Chart, Human rights","Personalisation, Json, Google Sheets",There have been many incidents of deaths in police custody stretching back at least two decades. The idea was to remind the public just how many Malaysians have died as a result of violence or neglicence and how nobody is held accountable for the vast majority of cases. It took the form of a virtual graveyard.,The virtual graveyard was published on International Human Rights Day to some significant acclaim. It comes at a critical time when the government is looking at resurrecting the bill to govern a body for independent complaints about police misconduct. The government also just announced that a special investigative unit would be formed to probe custodial deaths. Malaysiakini’s project had an impact with veteran activists who were both touched and angered by the sheer loss of life and promised to continue the struggle. It also touched a chord with younger Malaysians who were previously unaware of the extent of these human rights violations. They said that the interactive presentation of revealing the gruesome and sad details was very powerful.  ,"The list of the deceased was provided by human rights organisation Suaram. The list is the sole and most comprehensive tracker of publicised deaths in police custody in the country spanning over 20 years. We managed the data, including translation to different languages, on a Google Spreadsheet. A special website is created for the project. Its structure and layout were built with JavaScript, JavaScript library React and React framework Next.js. JavaScript library Scollama.js was used for the storytelling effect on the victims’ stories and the charts. The charts were built with Highcharts API. The tombstone and all the illustrations were illustrated with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.  ","Retrieving data was particularly difficult as a majority of cases had some important detail left out. We were often not able to secure photographs and very rarely got complete information as to the cause of death, time of death and nature of the original offence for which they were held. While human rights organisations and the media have access to some information it must be acknowledged that most of it is being held by the police themselves. They almost certainly have a conflict of interest in this particular topic and that is a factor addressed in the project itself. The numbers themselves were consistently inconsistent because there are a number of different ways in which custodial deaths can be recorded or ignored by the system. Some of the pictures available might also be deemed too graphic and yet the need to convey the horror of what was experienced by the victims was also there.","Other journalists might look to this project as a way to relate a serious issue to their readers.  There are a number of challenges, firstly being that there are many articles on individual news items but few that provide an overarching analysis and view of the bigger picture. We also attempted to repackage a long-standing and persistent issue in a creative and engaging way to reach readers who might otherwise be unaware of the magnitude of the issue.  ","English, Malay, Chinese",https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/custodial-death/en,https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/custodial-death/ms,https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/custodial-death/zh,https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/602480,https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/602801,,,,"Ooi Choon Nam, Lee Long Hui, Martin Vengadesan, Yan Jing Tian, Syariman Badrulzaman, Wong Weng Loon, Yasmin Ramlan","The project is presented by Kini News Lab in Malaysiakini, one of the most-read news portals in Malaysia.

It takes into account the onset of the southwest monsoon, trends in rainfall, rainfall during the peak season (June, July, August and September) and trends of southwest monsoon in India's meteorological subdivisions. The project tries to bring out how much the rainfall trend has changed in the past five years and how new global connections to circulatory systems are becoming apparent as a result of climate change.","The project was done to make the audience aware of the changing trend in the Indian monsoon which may be due to climate change. The story tries to educate the audience about the effect of el Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific Ocean which affects the Indian monsoon.  While some regions in India were  rain deficit, other areas received surplus rainfall. Distribution charts show that typically deficit rain regions such as West Madhya Pradesh, East Rajasthan, and Maharashtra’s Marathwada and Vidarbha have all seen surplus rains, while the rainiest pockets in Kerala, Odisha and the north-eastern states have recorded deficits. The story makes the audience aware of how erratic the monsoon has been in the past 5 years. The story was also published by The Wire Science.",The data for the 5 years was available on the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) website. For extracting the data I used Tabula and Scraper extension (on Google Chrome).  I cleaned the data on Google sheets and for analyzing I used pivot tables. Most of the visualizations used in the story were made from Google Sheet charts and Flourish.,There was an ample amount of data that was available with the IMD. Extracting the data was a bit tricky since the data was not easily downloadable from the website and the extraction process took a lot of time. Some of the data was extracted from other sources as it was missing on the IMD website.  Analyzing the data required a lot of cleaning so that it can be presented to the audience in a simple way.  One of the major challenge was to explain the science using numbers and visuals so that it is easily understood by the audience.,"Science and data journalism can be combined together to present scientific terminologies in a understandable way along with visualizations.

Netherlands,RTL Nieuws,Big,Participant,,Covering national elections on a local level using real time automatically generated articles,17/03/21,"Breaking news, News application, Chart, Elections, Politics","Personalisation, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python","We used our editorial 'robot' ADAM (Automatic Data Article Machine) for the most challenging project yet: covering the national parliamentary elections in real time, on a local level. We dynamically generated news stories about the election results for all 355 municipalities in the Netherlands. Every time the results for a municipality were announced, an article was published within minutes. Each article was unique and included charts and graphs. In every story, local results were analysed and compared to previous elections and national averages. Besides these local stories, we wrote deeper analyses about local differences in election results and voting behaviour.","The project had a lot of impact! Many people read the stories generated by ADAM. Together, the articles were viewed more than a million times, making it one of the most well-read stories of the year for our publication.  But although page views are nice, our project had a much more important impact by offering every reader anywhere in the country fast, relevant information tailored to the place where they live. In a normal news article or television programme, results are discussed only on a national level, and maybe a handful of municipalities are highlighted. But the local angle of elections is often much more interesting to our readers than a national story, especially in communities that deviate a lot from the national average.  This information is usually not available anywhere outside large cities, because small local newsrooms typically don't have the resources to provide this kind of coverage. Using ADAM, inhabitants of municipalities big and small could get the information they needed during the election night. This was proven by the fact that all 355 generated articles received views, ranging from tens for small municipalities to tens of thousands in large cities. Many people also shared their local results on social media.  Besides the local generated articles, we wrote data-driven stories about the differences in voting behaviour between areas of The Netherlands. These stories highlighted a widening gap between different groups within the population, which in turn makes it harder to form a government. The outcomes of these stories were also used in writing the generated article for each municipality.","The backbone of our project was our in-house editorial 'robot' ADAM, which stands for Automatic Data Article Machine. This tool was built using Python and runs in the cloud. We also developed a custom API to seamlessly integrate the articles generated by ADAM into our normal news website. The election results were provided in real time by the Dutch press agency ANP through an API, which announced results for each municipality as the votes were counted.  To ingest this data, we built a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab, where data was cleaned and analysed using the Pandas library, to generate the main data set that was inputted into ADAM and used to generate articles. In this process, a large amount of data we had prepared in advance was also added to the real time data.  We also extensively used Datawrapper and its API. For every municipality, as the results were processed, graphs and charts were generated in Datawrapper and embedded into the news stories. ","This was the first time we've used ADAM to process real time data. In previous projects, we had plenty of opportunity to test and make corrections before publications. In election night, there is no such luxury, and failure is not an option.  Technically, being dependent on an outside data stream at such a crucial moment was a challenge, because we had to prepare for any eventuality. Generating graphs and charts in real time using Datawrapper added another dependency to this process.  This required extensive testing in advance and scrupulous monitoring throughout the night. Any problems that did appear had to be solved in minutes.  There were also editorial challenges. To be relevant and provide value to our readers, these generated articles had to be more than just a fill-in-the-blank boilerplate story. In preparation, we identified many potential angles for local stories about the election results. These included noticing parties that did surprisingly well for that specific area, or local favourites that underperformed. Sometimes the story was about how much had changed since the previous elections, but in other areas the more important headline had to do with the turn-out.  In the end, every local story was completely unique, with different focal points and angles throughout. ","Our most essential lesson for other journalists is the importance of making stories relevant for your audience. This is true for any story, but in particular for data journalism, because many readers do not feel drawn to large amounts of numerical information. By translating a large national news event to local stories, we created coverage that is more relevant, more interesting and provides more value for our readers.  The project underscored our belief that the reader or viewer should be at the centre of our work. In this project, real time data was almost instantly transformed into useful stories: in our view, that is the mission of any data journalist. From a technical standpoint, a lesson for us was the use of Pandas and a Jupyter Notebook to create a data analysis process that could reliably be repeated many times to yield the results we needed.  The project also emphasised the need for rigorous testing, as well as asking colleagues from the rest of the newsroom for tips and feedback.

We wanted to indirectly show how solid the relationship between the parties can be by checking additional factors that can form personal relationships such as school ties, participation in the presidential camp, and affiliated organizations. Furthermore, we critically reviewed the roles and achievements of intellectuals in the progressive camp who entered public office after confirming the thoughts of key figures in their past writings.","The response was mainly from researchers, scholars, and professors who served in academia or public offices in the past. Disappointment with the current government's intellectuals was the main evaluation. Some people expressed their intention to reflect on themselves in the network. There were also many objections, saying, ""What's wrong with running state affairs between people who share their original intentions?"" Many people agreed that the current government, which was launched with high expectations after impeachment, needs a critical review of the role of intellectuals in it. I self-evaluate that I have raised a problem that requires consideration in an intellectual society that is contemplating participation in reality. In the future, intellectuals participating in the government will not stop making monitoring efforts by verifying and evaluating in the same way.",We used BeautifulSoup and selenium python library for scraping websites to get the list of academic journals of Moon Jae In goverment officials.

A lot of time was spent in the process of refining data by checking the writings that had to be filtered out, such as numerous people with the same name or writings written alone. There have been many reports that contain a sense of problem that solid connections of public officials lead to closed state administration, but they have not been dealt with in a way that can quantify them. It is also the first time that data has confirmed that figures in key positions in the author's network are also in key positions within the current government.","We would like to emphasize that we have confirmed the characteristics of the current government's intellectual network despite the complex net. Articles that analyze the common attributes of government officials based on regional bases such as Yeongnam and Honam(province in Korea) or based on high schools and universities have been steadily reported, but we don't think they have drawn a full picture of the network.

It mainly dealt with the current address of the collapsing local city and the harmful effects of population concentration in the metropolitan area.  During the five-month production period, reporters covered 17 cities at home and abroad, and analyzed vast amounts of demographics with experts. Related content was produced not only on web pages but also on documentaries.","The coverage period is 5 months, 17 coverage sites, and 1,000km travel distance. Long-term on-site coverage has pointed out the problem of population decline in local cities. This is the first press release to cover the circumstances of individual cities in detail and implement them in videos.  Data analysis was also conducted. Based on the population data for special purposes that allow advanced statistical analysis, we looked at the problem of population decline in local cities with experts. Based on the analysis results, we also created ""a map of vacant houses across the country,"" ""a map of Korea's Catogram,"" and ""a 3D map of youth population movement."" This is a case of high expertise in accessing statistical sources and finding social implications.  We also paid attention to the web page. We have built a three-dimensional digital storytelling that integrates text, photos, graphics, videos, and 3D data maps, not just one-dimensional digital storytelling that puts text and photos. Furthermore, the web page was designed to move in response to its own actions such as scrolling and clicking, increasing the reader's experience. Writing was also adjusted in consideration of user interface.","This project used Create-React-App (CRA).  ① A map of vacant houses across the country This is a 2D interactive map that shows the stages of vacant concentration as of 2019 by dividing them into 'eup', 'myeon', and 'dong' units. Users can enter or select an area they are curious about to obtain an empty concentration rate in that area.

Users can choose the area they are curious about and get the percentage of the youth population who moved from that area to the metropolitan area. It was created using kepler.gl and redox.","It was the hardest to get the data that was the core of the coverage. More sophisticated and detailed data were needed to show detailed population changes in Korea over the past half century. However, the population data released by the National Statistical Office to the public were not detailed. Accordingly, reporters secured the necessary data through a microdata integrated service channel (special purpose data capable of advanced statistical analysis) provided by the National Statistical Office to experts.  Recruitment of team members was also difficult. Data journalism cannot be carried out by reporters themeselves. We need the help of many people, including data analysts and web page developers. However, at the time of production, there were no analysts to handle the data, no developers to create web pages, or designers to decorate the pages. The production cost was not enough, so we couldn't entrust the project to an outsourcing company. In response, we mobilized connections from college juniors to co-workers to find team members to participate in the project.","This page is a report on the problem of population decline in local cities. It contains specific social phenomena, causes, problems, and alternatives that can be derived at this point. Therefore, other media reporters can use this page to find out the current address and cause of the population decline in local cities in Korea, and how it negatively affects the whole country. Furthermore, we can see alternatives that can be derived at this point.  It is also worth referring to data visualization techniques. The most effort I put into this time is the map. I tried to design it so that I could see the changes in the population over half a century at a glance, and I also increased the user experience so that I could experience the changes in the population of the region where I live. In particular, the catogram technique is an example of a problem in which the population is too concentrated in a specific area as a data visual.

More young people are pouring their emotion into AI chatbots. What do these pioneers have in common, and how do they understand this new kind of love? Based on these themes, we collected comments from Google Play store, the posts of douban's ""Man-machine Love"" group and data from Baidu index. Then, we did some statistical analysis to present an image of pioneers and narrated vivid stories of different groups.","This project provides the public with the brand story, development history, and algorithmic logic of the most popular AI software ""Replika"". Then, according to the search engine data, the basic information of pioneers is displayed, including geographical distribution, gender, interests and hobbies. According to the Google Play store, which showcases bifurcated reviews of Replika's AI software, it displays diverse views on trendy relationships, and finds many people struggling with conflict and hesitation. From the Douban group, we saw many rich individuals and their vivid stories. All of these can show the group images of these pioneers to the public, and can trigger thinking about the new love concept of young people.  ","The web crawling tool and technology we used was Python, and we used Python for autonomous programming to get the accurate web information. We also used the Baidu index to check the searcher profile of corresponding terms in the Baidu search engine, including their age, gender, region, preferences, etc. We solved the problem of structuring unstructured text data with manual coding. Most of our statistical visualization images are drawn using Dycharts, a professional online dynamic charting tool. The H5 building platform we used is Eqxiu, a digital marketing web building platform based on creative design content in China.","Looking back on the whole production process, I think the biggest difficulty we encountered was how we could structure the unstructured data. Since the selection of the work was specific, we used web crawling technology to crawl the entire usage comment data under the app Replika page in Google Play Store as user data for analysis. However, the problem is that all the data are unstructured textual data, which cannot be analyzed and counted by computer directly. And if machine learning method is used, its cost is too high for student works. Our solution was to manually code the text data. We had two professional coders go through two hundred randomly selected pieces of data out of the more than 10,000 pieces of data crawled, one by one, to artificially decode the top motivations for users to use Replika, and categorize the statistics. The whole coding process followed the process of trial coding, consistency checking, coding adjustment, and disagreement resolution. The two coders first coded 50 comments separately and independently at the same time to initially determine the coding categories, of which the number of consistent codes was 38. After that, the coding categories were adjusted according to the actual situation to ensure the accuracy of the coding.","On the one hand, one can learn how data journalism is produced. We use data mining and personal case studies in our reporting, which provide scientific arguments to support data journalism. We use big data to obtain a profile of replika's users and then analyse individual behaviour to get a more comprehensive picture of user characteristics and preferences. On the other hand, one can focus on the choice of topics for news coverage. The current rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has created a number of problems.

This project stepped outside of that framework and took the experiential journalism approach instead. Two team members volunteered to document their daily use of plastic products over 14 days. By analyzing and visualizing the personal ""small data,"" we brought the broad concept of plastic overuse into sharper focus, making it easier for the public to link their daily lives to this serious environmental issue.","The most immediate impact is that one of the project members, who is very addicted to coffee (and created a lot of plastic waste by using disposable coffee cups), bought himself a reusable coffee cup after the project. And this is indeed the original intent of our project! We sincerely hope that by presenting the personal data accumulated from individuals' daily use of plastic items, people would leave their numbness behind, raise their awareness of the impact of their lifestyles on the environment, and ultimately make behavioral changes in everyday life. Though we can't track the adjustments made by our readers, the progress of our teammate has already displayed the potential power of this project. In addition, this project has been recognized by China's data journalism industry, winning the Bronze Award of ""Best Mobile Interactive"" and the ""Public Regard Awards - Moving Towards Carbon Neutrality"" in China Data Content Competition 2021.","ScrollMagic.js: As a JavaScript scrolling plugin, it can easily respond to the user's current scroll position and set clever and sophisticated page motion effects. D3.js: to visualize the data of 14-day plastic usage. GSAP: to produce rich animation effects by simply configuring this tool, which simplifies the animation control and precise time management of the whole project, and optimizes the performance of large batches of complex animations.","The most tricky part is to get the audience to relate their daily lives to the problem of plastic abuse. When conducting the 14-day experiment, we kept two records, one with photos of all the plastic products used, and the other with data records of plastic usage recorded in an excel spreadsheet.  We could have used the excel data to generate charts to inform readers of our conclusions, but this approach was too rigid and didactic to be empathetic. Our final approach was to introduce the two participants of the experiment first, enabling the audience to see the ""humans"" in the project; then we showed the photos of all the plastic items so that people can see the ""physical look"" of the data; after that, we replaced the photos with charts to present our findings from the 14-day experiment, which balanced the fluidity of the user experience with the clarity of the conclusions. On the technical side, the biggest problem was the abnormal rendering of the browser page caused by thousands of dom nodes running animations simultaneously. So we used some ""smokescreen"" in switching between the photos and the graphs. We reduced the number of dom nodes without sacrificing the image effect and improved the rendering efficiency of web pages. We'd also like to mention the ""Easter eggs"" reserved at the end of the project: the two participants were invited to imagine the situation that if they'd be given a second chance to start the project all over again, which of the disposable plastic items they would consciously reduce using, and the specific dilemmas they might encounter during the process. Besides that, we also demonstrated their personal feelings before and after participating in the project in the form of a webcomic.","In an age flooded with data, how data is selected and presented can greatly influence the impact of reporting. For environmental issues, the ultimate goal of media coverage is usually to raise people's awareness and motivate them to take action. Therefore, it is worth considering how to establish a connection between individuals and environmental issues.

However, it is hard to find a detailed and vivid analysis of why they are so recognizable in China. Our highly interactive project fills the gap. We deciphered the shared rules applied to popular Chinese New Year songs by playing song clips, presenting professional musical analysis, and visualizing various elements of the songs. We even created a songwriting game based on our discoveries, demonstrating how the Spring Festival vibe was conveyed through those songs.","As mentioned above, this project fills the gap in media coverage. It provides an in-depth and lively explanation of the phenomenon of Chinese New Year songs, which seemed to be well known, but unexplained for a long time. The audience who participated in this interactive project may smile knowingly when they listen to these songs again, as the mystery that puzzled them in the previous Spring Festival has been revealed. And because of the fact that the Chines News Year is the most important traditional festival year-round for Chinese people, this project is infused with longevity: it may be re-shared with popular Chinese New Year songs in every following Spring Festival. This is also what makes this project unique. In addition, this project has been recognized by China's data journalism industry, winning the Silver Award of ""Best Mobile Interactive"" in the China Data Content Competition 2021.","p5.js: We used this creative programming library to deconstruct audio files, obtain their amplitude data, and present them with visual elements. And in developing the interactive songwriting game, the functions embedded in p5.js enabled us to flexibly set audio speeds, playback positions, etc. And this created a smooth user experience: when the audience clicked different play buttons in the game, audio clips can always be connected successfully. D3.js: Mainly used in the simulation of audio tracks, using different graphic elements to visualize the amplitude of different instruments.","There were tricky issues both in content presentation and UX design. Firstly, we needed to fully explain how the atmosphere of Chinese New Year was presented through music. We interviewed two musicians and their detailed analysis laid the groundwork for the project. But we still had to figure out an appropriate way to present professional insights to the general audience. We finally decided to integrate music clips, infographics, and interactive features. In the beginning, we took the most familiar Chinese New Year song ""Congratulations (Gong Xi Gong Xi)"" as an example: by breaking down and reconstructing the musical elements of the song, we showed the audience how the festive atmosphere was enhanced step by step. Then we provided the audience with 12 classic Spring Festival songs, visualized each of them in the shape of winter jasmine (which is the symbol of spring in Chinese culture), and displayed their common features through the visualization. In this way, we revealed the mysteries of why the Chinese New Year songs composed by different musicians would sound so similar. Also, to ensure a rich and smooth audiovisual experience, we needed to clear technical hurdles. One was audio visualization. We conducted quite a few research on audio visualization technology libraries, but they either had system compatibility issues or had audio parsing or articulation problems. We ended up choosing p5.js which was a good fit for our project. Another was synchronizing audio. Especially for the ""songwriting"" part, where the audience were offered several play buttons to change the melody, speed, rhythm, and instruments, there would be a lot of combinations and adjustments. We spent a lot of time debugging to make sure that all audio clips would play in sync in any combination.","It's not uncommon to come across similar situations as Chines New Year songs', especially in the realm of popular culture: the public may have realized the existence of a certain cultural phenomenon, but may not be clear about the reasons behind it. So one of the inspirations this project may provide to other journalists is, go and dig out story ideas from these phenomena. And once you find one and explain it fully and vividly, the life of the project is very like to last longer than a lot of news pieces. And in terms of content creation, we think it may not be a bad idea to use different audiovisual elements boldly, which would be quite useful to deliver information more flexibly and joyfully and enrich the audience experience.",Chinese,http://h5.thepaper.cn/html/zt/2021/02/xcgq/index.html,,,,,,,,"Xu Xueqing, Zou Manyun, Kong Jiaxing, Wang Yasai, Du Haiyan, Lu Yan, Gao Jianping",Xu Xueqing & Zou Manyun: pitching story; planning UX roadmap; interviewing; writing; project coordination Kong Jiaxing & Du Haiyan: project developers Wang Yasai: data visualization; UI Design Lyu Yan & Gao Jianping: project coordination,
China,The Paper (澎湃新闻),Big,Participant,,When Chatbots Fall in Love,14/08/21,"Explainer, Illustration, Infographics","AI/Machine learning, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Python","This project stems from our curiosity about Emotion AI. Based on OpenAI's GTP-3 training model, Emotion AI products have become more intelligent in recent years. We managed to make two Emotion AIs (registered from Replica) talk to each other and recreate the development of their romantic relationship in a digital comic. We also introduced a Chinese LM based on GTP-2 and set an interface to input flirting dialogue from social media to observe the computer's reaction as a comparison. We tried to popularize the chat mode of Emotion AI, and explain the influence of LM and algorithms on Emotion AI.","Thanks to the legibility and dissemination of the digital comic, the project has eliminated some misunderstandings of Emotion AI in many online forums and social platforms to a certain extent.  While observing the chat mode between Replicas, we found that though the GTP-3 LM had been trained based on a huge amount of data, the chatting process was still not as flexible as we expected. But the good news is, Emotion AI can quickly learn the chat mode and interests of the users during the conversation. These findings helped our readers to have an in-depth understanding of how Emotion AI operated. And the ""Emotion"" in its name, is actually the techniques and abilities given by the algorithms to comfort human beings. Currently, Emotion AI cannot empathize with people but has the ability to make users feel the ""emotions"" during the conversation, which is largely contributed by the organized texts and chatting strategy. And this might also be the reason why some people are so addicted to chatting with Emotion AI.","To make Replicas chat, we manually inputted sentences to keep the conversation going until the chatbots could continue the conversation on their own. Based on the LM of GTP-2, we set up a training environment to compare the influence of different Language Modes on the Emotion AI. We also used OCR to extract dialogues from screenshots on social media and created the original training materials out of it to test the response of chatbots. When producing digital comics, we mainly used the App ""procreate"" to sketch the comic on Ipad and improved the illustrations with the help of Adobe PS, Adobe Illustrator, and other software.","The most difficult part of the project was to find a proper way to popularize features of Emotion AI and LM in terms of understanding the mechanism and principle of algorithm and training model. The background understanding was crucial when we tried to set up the training environment and weighed the time consumption and training effects. On the other hand, we tried to accurately explain the features and replicate the ""love story"" of Replicas while using more understandable expressions to incorporate obscure concepts into interesting stories. Meanwhile, it's hard to find a proper form of visual expression to carry the story and reduce obstacles to the understanding of algorithms.","Algorithm reporting has become a cutting-edge beat nowadays. This project is our first attempt to combine data reporting with the application of LM and algorithms, rather than just consult the perspective of experts and researchers. The innovation of the project is to make algorithm reporting in practice——to set a training environment to understand the mechanism and principle of the training model and try to figure out a proper way to dig out the application, limitation of algorithms.",Chinese,https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_14026687,,,,,,,,Shu Yier; Wei Yao; Kong Jiaxing; ShenTu Ni,"Shu Yier: Responsible for setting training environment based on GTP-2 and optimizing LM.

We set the championship performance of each sport when it first entered the Olympics as a starting value, then plotted the performance curves of the champions in each sport over the years to see the limits of human beings. With the combination of videos, 3D animation, and data visualization, this project successfully simulated the scenes when Olympic champions competed against each other in the same field and presented the breakthroughs and limitations of human physical ability.","The Tokyo Olympics was held in the shadow of Covid-19. The virus isolated us physically but may never separate us emotionally. Over the past 120 years, human beings have been setting new records by pushing the limits constantly. We have never stopped striving to be faster, higher, and stronger. And this is the charm of sports: every breakthrough may update our definitions of limits and bring more expectations for the future. The project has also received high praise from peers, winning the Gold Award for ""Best Mobile Interaction Design"" in the 2021 China Data Content Competition.","C4D: Combing video of sports events with 3D scenes, to generate the effects of Olympic champions competing in the same field; building the transition between the 3D scenes and the curves of championship results. D3.js: Plotting curves to visualize the championship results of 104 sports over 120 years; adding effects of transition and graphic interactions. Python: Crawling, cleaning, and analyzing the championship results of 104 events in three major categories: track and field, swimming, and shooting at the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016; converting the original competition results of different sports to index data. Vue: Building web pages with reusable components.","The hardest part of the project was to integrate complicated data with visualization and interactive multimedia. We collected our data from Olympedia. But for different sports, the data format varied. So we had to use Python to crawl the data in each webpage of 104 sports and clean the data afterward. Then another obstacle popped out: how to compare the competition results of different sports, for some were competing for speed, others might for distances; there were too many standards. We eventually decided to convert all the results into index data that could be quantified together. To show a comprehensive picture of what has been achieved in the Olympics for 120 years, we came up with the idea of having the Olympic champions compete together. We started the project with a long shot to explain the background of the project. Then we combined videos of sports events, 3D scenes, and data visualization to present the championship results of 104 sports over the century.","The idea of having Olympic Champions over 120 years to compete together, actually evolved from our previous projects. Therefore, we reviewed our past work to identify weak points and find ways to improve. That's why we ended up refining the storyline by filling it with more vivid examples while keeping the original concept intact. And in the content creation process, we also utilized more cutting-edge web technologies to improve the user experience.

Based on posts and reposts of Weibo hashtags #Mutual support on Henan Floods#, we explored the role of reposting on sudden disasters. Firstly, the project showed how rescue messages were disseminated on social networks by visualizing the reposting chain of a rescue post We found people with a small number of followers may cause subsequent spreads. Secondly, we analyzed locations from rescue messages of the initial posts. It revealed an urban-rural disparity that urban citizens are easier to spread help-seeking messages.","The context of the project is that China's social media has played an increasingly essential and sophisticated role to disseminate rescue information not only on Zhengzhou floods as well as the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, thus we discussed a common phenomenon with a new perspective. We successfully illustrated that reposting by the average person is powerful through visualizing the reposting chain (26309 reposts) of a single Weibo. We believed that the conclusion of visualization could be a reference for our readers that the behavior of reposting could be powerful to spread essential information when faced with sudden-onset disasters instead of self-hesitation or lack of confidence.","Python: Crawl, clean, and analyze 26,309 reposts; parse the text of reposts. We set the rule that if ""A"" reposted a blog from ""B"", then the reposting text of ""A"" would be marked as ""a_sentence//@b_name: b_sentence"". Moreover, we generated a reposting chain for each user and found the source of messages, converting network data into a proper format for visualization. Gephi: Generate a visual sketch of the reposting chain for 26309 reposting data.","The hardest part of the project was to find a proper way to reveal the essence of unexpected disasters besides in retrospect on the scene as well as figure out the best approach to tell a story through data and visualization. The project captured the new phenomenon of online help-seeking, restored its entire process, and responded to the most concerns of readers ""Is my reposting helpful on unexpected disasters"". It was also formidable to scrape and process massive data while finding out the spread chain to answer the question. In addition, it was also a challenge to visualize the reposting network of 26309 nodes in a legible and captivating way.",We found a cozy story through massive data that suggested how a single rescue blog could lead to a large number of reposting and people who played the essential role.

Germany,"Funke Mediengruppe (Berliner Morgenpost, Hamburger Abendblatt, WAZ, Thüringer Allgemeine, Braunschweiger Zeitung and many more)",Big,Participant,,10 years of Fukushima: Nuclear power plants that are shut down - and where new ones are being built,11/03/21,"Explainer, Cross-border, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Environment, Economy","Scraping, D3.js, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js","Ten years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster - which fundamentally changed Germany’s energy policy - Germany will soon be out of nuclear power. But globally, more nuclear electricity is flowing again. Data on nuclear power production from the IAEA is - for the first time, as far as we know - rendered on an interactive map. The visualizations (including animations and additional graphs) make it possible to trace international developments over time. The main map features a time-lapse animation and a slider to look at specific years, and tooltips provide detailed information on the state and capacity of different sites.","On the 10th anniversary of this global event that made then-Chancellor Angela Merkel rethink and withdraw from nuclear power, this project was a key part of Funke Mediengruppe’s reporting. The interactive was linked to all 18 newspaper’s online front pages and an adjusted version appeared in print. Our project is the first to create an interactive, scrollable map with up-to-date as well as historical information about nuclear power plant locations worldwide, and to visualize changes over time.","Data from each of IAEA’s openly accessible nuclear power reactors’ information pages was scraped using Python and beautifulsoup. The scraped data was cleaned (including the reactors’ names), geocoded and translated into csv’s that could be used for the frontend with R and tidyverse.  We also did further analysis with the data like aggregating by states to visualize which countries were increasing and decreasing their nuclear power production, comparing total and per capita counts, etc. In the end, we chose to visualize the top 10 countries by production capacity as a bump chart in addition to the main interactive / animated map and smaller satellites of the main visualization to show developments in Japan and China over time as specific case studies. The frontend is based on a state-of-the-art frontend technology stack using React with next.js, Mapbox for maps, emotion for CSS-in-js, and d3 for data visualization. As most of our users visited the page on their smartphones, we paid extra attention to a good user experience on small devices with low bandwidth.","One of the hardest parts of the project was to obtain the data, as IAEA doesn’t make the database powering the plant’s individual information pages publicly accessible. When scraping, we needed to account for different cases of missing data fields in older entries and entries of planned projects, needed to make sure we found each existing url that links to any nuclear power plant and had to manually check geocoding, recognizable/translated names and whether a reactor was a research facility (which we didn’t include in our visualizations) or a commercial power production site. From a visual end, it was a challenge to incorporate different, equally important angles of the data-driven story into the key interactive: how nuclear power production is distributed globally today, different regional trends (following Fukushima) over the last years, but also the overall global development. In the end, we depicted each individual power plant on a map, and semi-transparent bubbles around each location show the amount of nuclear energy produced. This allows for some first insights when scrolling out on the world map - the amount and shade of the green color in a given area indicates the intensity of nuclear power use, while a small area graph above the slider summarizes the overall global trend. More specific analysis of different countries’ shares in global nuclear power production was moved to another graph (bump-chart) to avoid overloading the main interactive, and while both an auto-play animation as well as custom time-scrolling is possible on the world map (with any area of interest zoomed in), we highlight especially interesting areas in singled-out derivatives of the main graphic (smaller svg animations embedded in the text to explain developments in China and Japan).","While geographic visualizations like bubble maps are not a new thing for Funke Interaktiv since a while already, this project shows that standard visualizations can still be powerful when used effectively, which we achieved following these principles:  1. Exciting aesthetics The specifically designed dark theme fits the topic and increases attention by standing out from the company’s standard graphics. Animations that start automatically quickly illustrate key points and capture attention. 2. Use examples to illustrate developments The accompanying text provides historical context as well as guidance on how to read the interactive. For example, animations for China and Japan were extracted from the main map to illustrate specific trends highlighted in the text. Additional graphics (bump chart of 12 biggest producer countries over time) transport further analysis. 3. Allow for exploration Users get all basic relevant information without having to interact with the page. More engaged readers have the chance to answer more specific questions and create additional insights by exploring interactively, though.

Germany is a different country today compared to when Merkel became the political leader back in 2005. Using figures and statistics in an entertaining way, this project shows how Germany has changed and what Merkel was all about - personally and professionally, from CO₂ emissions to bubble tea.","This story was part of Funke Mediengruppe’s pre-election coverage, which we as the Interactives team contributed data-driven pieces to. It was published one week before the federal elections. The end of her term was widely covered at the time, but this project stood out as the most comprehensive data-based chronicle. The project was one of Funke Mediengruppe’s most popular pieces of content around the federal elections with several peaks in demand: first a week before the election, then the day after the election, as well as the day before the new chancellor’s inauguration. Our work was also adapted to a print version published by one of the newspapers (link 2). The high average amount of time users spent on the online page was a remarkable more than five minutes.  Through social media distribution, the project also reached readers from outside the Funke Mediengruppe’s readership. The project was featured by blogs (e.g. datawrapper) and other data visualization professionals.","Because a lot of different metrics were included, the data collection process involved all kinds of different sources (government-issued pdf’s, federal statistics, market research data, figures from different ministries, research groups, NGOs etc.) as well as methods (custom requests, OCR, scraping, manually created spreadsheets). For calculating the total number of hours Merkel spoke in parliament, we even manually opened each recorded speech of hers (available at the parliament’s media center) and recorded the lengths of the speeches. The csv’s used in the frontend were created in R by wrangling and cleaning raw data from various sources and in various formats.  The frontend was built using a state-of-the-art frontend technology stack based on React with next.js, emotion for CSS-in-js, and d3 for data visualization. As most of our users visited the page on their smartphones, we paid extra attention to a good user experience on small devices with low bandwidth.","As we were looking for consistent data across the time span of 16 years, many different problems arose: some official statistics changed their methodology in the middle of the time span (e.g. statistics on employees per profession, also numbers of fathers staying at home to look after children), some statistics were discontinued or only started later than 2005.  Especially for the less common and more niche-y topics, figures are often collected by hobbyists or enthusiasts, and these kinds of projects are often not kept alive for many years.  Still, it was important to us to include witty and surprising aspects as opposed to only rather dry official statistics. One solution to this was to think creatively about figures that could be obtained and offered some interesting insights - for example, the starkly declining number of members of a video rental association (which we could get from their books) became an impressive way to demonstrate the rise of streaming and online culture. With the very vast concept of tracing developments of a whole country over 16 years, appropriately selecting and representing changes was of course also a challenging task. One strategy was to think of the different areas of life / categories we thought important (e.g. environment, poverty/wealth, public services, …) and another important approach was to include different aspects of each topic to paint a more nuanced and not one-sided image - to include both positive and negative, or successful and less successful developments.","The project is an example of how one can present a variety of statistics on an overarching topic without overwhelming readers. In total, 39 sets of data are visualized in the article (1 counter, 1 timeline, 8 key figures, 30 barcharts). Still, with the clever use of visual stimuli and a clear structure, the piece does not feel dry or boring. The structure integrates data of different granularity (from weekly polls to figures summarizing 16 years in one) in its two main parts:   Dashboard The visual introduction features 16 (one for each year in office) photo tiles of the ex-Chancellor’s famous hand gesture, the ""Merkel Raute"", and a ranking of the Chancellors longest in office (where she places second, missing the first by 10 days). These playful elements create a light entry into a data-heavy project. A line chart showing Merkel's approval ratings since she took office follows. This sets the historical context by reminding of key events during the time span. The last element of the first half is made up of a dashboard with different numbers, some funny, others serious, which allowed to create some “summary” figures, while the following graphs rather focus on developments over time.   Small charts In this main part, selected statistics are grouped into 8 categories and describe how things developed during Merkel's era in areas of: climate/environment, wealth/poverty, public services, migration, rise of the far-right, society, foreign policy, everyday life. Short texts put the graphs into context and explain Merkel’s relationship to the various developments.

As a result, the team formed the universe of currently active local media outlets containing 3240 organizations from all cities of Turkey.         Subsequently, the acquired information from different sources has been integrated into a common data format called the “data card of local media outlets” that gathers all collected information about an organization under an institutional data profile. Followingly, these data cards have been compiled as city-based lists at the knowledge management system, JotForm.        In the second step, the quantitative field research has been designed for the verification of collected data and reaching more specific information (i.e., technical capacity, number of personnel, working conditions, censorship level) on local media organizations. During this step, the team conducted questionnaires with 1222 local media organizations. The online questionnaires have been conducted through Jotform and the acquired data from the field has been integrated with previously constructed local media data cards on the platform. Therefore, a verified and complementary set of data has been formed through the combination of acquired information via desk and field research.        As the final step, the collected data has been analyzed through various statistical tests at SPSS. Followingly, the interactive reporting and digital mapping of the data has been illustrated via Flourish","As it is well known, the local media organizations play a fundamental role as the main practitioners of freedom of communication, information, and expression in the regional areas farther from metropolitan centers. Considering their practices reflecting the problems and demands of local citizens and actors of civil society, local media outlets are also crucial for a well-functioning democracy and full enjoyment of fundamental rights & freedoms in the local context. However, the recent works show that local media is going through a survival crisis due to radically increasing political and financial pressures over the media sector in Turkey.   While these pressures drag many organizations into bankruptcy or closure, local media professionals are also impacted by the rising unemployment and worsening working conditions (i.e., insufficient wages, overworking, inadequate equipment,censorship, security threats) in the local media sector. Given these circumstances, local journalism is unable to perform its fundamental function as the guarantor of fundamental rights & freedoms ensuring democratization at the local level. Nevertheless, this problematic decline of the local media has not been adequately addressed in the national agenda and there is no current attempt to strengthen its critical role for the local democracy. As a remedy to this deficit, “ The Local Media Database Research Project” has provided a comprehensive situation analysis by identifying the demographic characteristics and mapping the institutional capacity of the local media outlets. In this project, the research team has been challenged by the exhaustive level of journalistic monitoring and analysis of extensive data in addition to many obstacles in data access and verification. Still, the team has managed to form the first digital journalistic database on local media that will serve as an open-source for the formation of a road map eliminating the obstacles against freedom of expression and democratization at the local level.","As an open-source digital database, ""The Local Media Database of Turkey"" functions as an information source for the usage of all leading actors (journalists, academic researchers, civil society experts & activists, public servants, etc.)  who conduct activities in the field of media & communication and freedom of expression. From this perspective, the project is a good example of how outcomes of data journalism can contribute to the attempts for strengthening freedom of expression and democracy, especially in countries under heavy censorship and authoritarianism. Moreover, in the project, a hybrid research model combining journalistic technics and academic (quantitative) methods has been applied. Thus, considering the exhaustiveness and complexity of the acquired data, the project constitutes an illuminating example for colleges who are eager to co-apply journalistic and academic research methods in their data journalism projects. ","English, Turkish",www.yerelmedyavt.com,https://medarder.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Medar_ENG_-Women-Journalists-in-Local-Media.pdf,https://medarder.org/yerel-medyada-kadin-gazeteci-olmak/,https://medarder.org/2681-2/,https://www.pscp.tv/w/1MnGnllVEgexO,,,,"Dilek İçten, Yunus Erduran","Dilek İçten is a journalist and field researcher who specialized in interdisciplinary and investigative research examining the relationship between media and socio-cultural dynamics.

Three female journalists looked for alternative sources to contrast the non-transparent information from the governments of their countries on deaths from COVID-19 or related to this disease. The investigation revealed that the pandemic, in addition to causing thousands of deaths, has exposed the bureaucracy that in Guatemala makes it difficult to register and disseminate the number of deaths promptly; the disorder that reigns in Honduras in this regard and the opacity in the official COVID-19 data in El Salvador.","The data collection demonstrated the precariousness of the health systems of the three countries, where the biosafety protocols for burials are not complied with, there are no government entities with agile and efficient procedures to identify those who have died from COVID-19, there is a shortage of supplies for hospital care and a health staff that works with very few resources. The reporting  ""Coronavirus deaths outside El Salvador hospitals"", with the results for this country,  was one of the most read in elsalvador.com last year with 23.574 viewed pages.","The team of journalists was in three different countries, so Google Meet was used to have regular meetings and a WhatsApp group was created to coordinate these meetings, agree on approaches and publication dates. The team used Google Drive to share the data of each country with the rest of the team, clean and organize them. We then used Excel and Tableau Public to analyze them and Flourish and Infogram to visualize them.","The hardest part of the job was getting the data, because in each country the official data management is different. In El Salvador, for example, it was possible to obtain us only by visiting 11 municipalities selected from among the 15 with the most diagnosed cases of covid-19. In Honduras, the data were provided by the funeral home association and in Guatemala by the National Registry of Persons (RENAP).  For this reason, it was not possible to do an analysis by region, but rather for each country.","What other journalists can learn from this project is, first of all, how to do collaborative journalism when countries have mobility restrictions due to a pandemic and not die trying.

Reading the entire text takes around three and a half hours. For this project, journalists read the entire document, highlighted important parts and added contextual comments. By choosing a category (e.g. ‘conflict points’) readers can quickly skim through the relevant parts of the original agreement and read the author’s comments. Nothing is lost - It is still possible to expand the collapsed parts of the agreement, but this interface makes it possible to get a first overview without having to invest 3,5 hours or scroll endlessly.","The project was successful in reaching people outside Funke Mediengruppe’s readership, mainly through social media. Judging by the time users spent on the page on average (9 minutes), this interactive interface created an engaging user experience and made a long and dry document accessible, which is especially important given the relevance of this text for all of German society. People both from the industry as well as readers complimented us for this innovative approach to not only reporting about and summarizing government plans, but illustrating it with the original document.","This interactive story is based on a state-of-the-art frontend technology stack using React with next.js and emotion for CSS-in-js. As most of our users visited the page on their smartphones, we paid extra attention to a good user experience on small devices with low bandwidth.","The timeline for turn-around was especially short on this project, as the interest in the coalition agreement’s contents is high directly after it is published for about a day. Therefore, the whole code was set up with placeholder text before. Another difficulty was to find an efficient work-flow through which journalists from different desks and different newspapers (from Funke Mediengruppe’s media group) could read parts of the document, add their comments, highlight the relevant text passages and indicate the category of relevance.  We decided to set up a Google Doc where the authors used the commenting function, which meant that comments needed to be transferred to the code manually, though, and multiple iteration rounds of both design specifications as well as text were needed to make all comments fit into the interface.","The approach we used in this project can be transferred to a multitude of areas, occasions, institutions and geographies. It creates opportunities to translate technical jargon, highlight subtle or hidden points of relevance, organize and structure content as well as provide context or opinion, all while keeping the original text accessible. It can be empowering for readers to not only read about something, but instead get some hints on how to decipher openly accessible yet complicated or long documents themselves. It also adds more transparency to reporting, as journalists are marking the original text next to each statement or claim they make, and therefore allow readers to critically check their interpretations.  This approach could be used not only for other government texts across the world, but even for any other dry but relevant texts such as terms of reference in regards to privacy issues; speeches that could be annotated and their rhetorics scrutinized, or any other document content that would profit from being organized into different categories with the option to include comments.",German,https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/koalitionsvertrag-ampel-bundesregierung-spd-gruene-fdp/,,,,,,,,"André Pätzold, Benja Zehr, Alexander Klay, Tobias Kisling, Beate Kranz, Theresa Martus, Alessandro Peduto, Julia Emmrich, Christian Unger, Christian Kerl, Michael Backfisch","Funke Mediengruppe's Interactive team develops interactive applications and data-driven stories for the Group's various news brands.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Participant,,Legislative Environmental Monitor,04/06/21,"Explainer, Database, News application, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Environment","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js","The Legislative Environmental Monitor is a value proposal to monitor the advance of environmental topics in Congress. Based on a huge database made from scratch from unstructured text, this tool is helpful to understand the law enactment process, monitor the advance of bills in an opaque context and provide a public service for the audience to demand specific measures against climate change crisis. This application was made by LA NACION Data together with four NGOs ‒one of them, a specialist in legislative matters‒ and the other three are local reference in environmental topics. Today it covers 16 topics.","After we published, we received lots of feedback from Congressmen and activists pushing for this kind of legislation. Also, the Auditoría General de la Nación (AGN), a public agency that gives the Congress technical support, offered us some help to empower our tool. The Legislative Environmental Monitor gives a clear “We-are-watching” message to politicians as regards those projects left for months or even years in some special Committees.  A non participant NGO, Aves Argentinas (Birdlife International) -one of the oldest non-profit local association‒ asked the alliance to include new topics (as the bill for a new protected area in Cordoba province) to show the importance to the National Congress. After we published this monitor, two environment-related bills were enacted at the Congress. Also, a congressman in Catamarca province presented a bill in his jurisdiction to create a local Environmental Legislative Monitor.  ","The backend development consisted of the creation of a relational model that represents the progress of a bill to be considered in the Congress.  Python was used for its implementation and PostgreSQL as a database engine. To make the system available, it was used Amazon Web Services, specifically AWS Lambda, AWS RDS, AWS Beanstalk and AWS S3. For the frontend development, we used HTML, Javascript, Vue.js 2x (Reactive), CSS, SASS and NodeJS. The framework used for the frontend development of the application was VUE Js. The backend connection to obtain information for its visualization is not synchronic and this improves the loading performance and the reception of bills for their subsequent visualization. SaSS was used for the style management. At LA NACION Data, we don’t think this project as a “one-shot-and-one-destination” issue. We believe in the power of reusing content. For this reason, we developed the way of embedding the each ""clock by environmental topic"" in different news articles regularly published and related to general or specifically environmental topics.","The first visual representation was the result of a succession of steps in a rather linear sense: from the introduction of the bill in Congress until its enactment. The problem was that only some intermediate steps were taken into account. In other words, many inconveniences may appear between the two extremes. For this reason, the current concept, represented through a circular spiral device (""Clocks""), gives better results as regards these variables. It brings the idea of a cyclical process of temporality and gives rise to a “second round” in the legislative process in case of consideration of a bill, or else, of the request for amendment by one of the Houses. Temporality is one of the strongest concepts on which this design is based. The cease of effect of each bill, located in the center of each cycle, shows the possibilities that each bill has of attaining or not the purpose before its ceasing to have effect. Certainly, time is not the only variable that sets the pace of a bill, but it is a very important one. Especially because many times the strategy of legislators is to delay the progress of a bill and wait until it ceases effect to show disinterest. One of the purposes of the Legislative Environmental Monitor is precisely to emphasize this aspect, since these subjects are highly important for any citizen.  ","There are many aspects to consider when designing and programming an information tool in projects like this one, with automatic updating and complex content. Technical and communication aspects must be taken into account, that is why it is necessary to plan and define the objectives very well in order to build a structure capable of considering all possible variables. Firstly, we had to know all the legislative twists and turns of a bill until its enactment. For several months, we met with internal production teams (LNData and digital development) and, also with external collaborators, NGOs members and legislative advisors. Even so, it was difficult to understand that bureaucratic and political issues within the legislative process often divert the expected path of a project. In this same sense, we understood that before translating such a complex process ‒the creation of legislative rules‒ into a visual language, we should first understand it in depth, and take into account all the elements and variables that may interfere in it. That is why, it is very important to carry out ‒at a previous step‒ detailed research of the content, which allows us to provide the basis for the development. Although the result was highly satisfactory, we comprehended that if we had prioritized the complex structure of the information, we could have avoided many difficulties that the design had at a later step. Journalists, designers and programmers had different tasks, but they all worked together towards the same goal: achieve clear and simple graphic representation that could communicate how the legislative process works. In conclusion, without the collaboration of the five organizations (LA NACION and four NGOs), this project would have been impossible.  ·            ",Spanish,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/comunidad/monitor-legislativo-ambiental-nid04062021/,https://blogs.lanacion.com.ar/projects/data/environmental-legislative-monitor-a-tool-to-monitor-environmental-subjects-in-congress/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/comunidad/una-nueva-herramienta-para-observar-el-dificil-camino-de-las-leyes-ambientales-nid04062021/ ·,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/comunidad/envases-son-el-60-de-la-basura-hogarena-y-no-hay-una-ley-que-los-regule-nid28072021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/comunidad/delitos-ambientales-por-que-deberian-incluirse-en-el-codigo-penal-nid10082021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/ley-de-humedales-381-organizaciones-ambientales-marcharon-al-congreso-para-exigir-su-sancion-nid19082021/,,,"Florencia Coelho, Natalia Louzau, Evangelina Bucari, Florencia Rodríguez Altube, Florencia Abd, Nicolás Rivera, Gabriel Alonso Quiroga, Martín Pascua, Carolina Nussbaum from LA NACION","The above mentioned are members of LA NACION's interactive design, data, The Nature Projects and Comunidad teams (including journalists, PM, developers, designers).

Germany,"Funke Mediengruppe (Berliner Morgenpost, Hamburger Abendblatt, WAZ, Thüringer Allgemeine, Braunschweiger Zeitung and many more)",Big,Shortlist,,2021 Bundestag Election in Germany - the Election Dashboards of Funke Mediengruppe,18/01/21,"Breaking news, Open data, News application, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics","D3.js, Json, CSV, R, RStudio, Node.js","2021 was a super-election year (bumper election year) in Germany, culminating in the Bundestag elections in September. Beginning in  January, Funke Mediegruppe’s 18 newspapers provided election-related figures and information in one online dashboard. While the dashboard remained, its content adjusted to three phases:   before the elections the dashboard showed current polls and historical election results   in the election night, maps and new-tickers publishing automated written updates were live   after the elections, the dashboard shared results and analyses using maps and various charts    Additionally, there were five regional variants of basically the same dashboard, but presenting results for smaller regions.","Our dashboards were the backbone of all election coverage of 18 different newspapers. With the national dashboard published in January 2021 already, we were the first data journalism team in Germany to prepare the elections and overall, had almost one million visits across the different regional dashboards before, during and after election night in 2021. On top of that, many more articles of the company’s different newspapers either based their reporting on our work or even embedded parts of the dashboards as modular iframes into online articles, increasing the reach of our work. Our graphics and data were also adapted to multiple print graphics, for example the maps we created from very granular and hard to convert historical election results (link 7). Visualizations from our dashboards were featured by multiple blogs (e.g. datawrapper) and data visualization professionals.","The project is based on a state-of-the-art frontend technology stack using React with next.js, Mapbox for maps, emotion for CSS-in-js, and d3 for data visualization. As most of our users visited the page on their smartphones, we paid extra attention to a good user experience on small devices with low bandwidth. Additionally, we split parts of the story into smaller pieces that could be embedded on other sites using iframes. We created a database with consistent structure that various scrapers (coded in node.js) fed data from different sources (json’s, csv’s, but also emails with spreadsheets that were parsed automatically) and formats into. This one database was then behind all the different localized dashboards. For the historical as well as analytical parts of the dashboards, large amounts of data needed to be wrangled. In order to be able to display historical election results in comparable geometries, historically different election district geometries had to be refactored. For analytical elements as for example the comparison of election results based on district’s populations (e.g. by age or income) or how rural/urban they were, a lot of additional data was gathered and matched to categorize election result districts in order to be able to make these comparisons automatically (to save time / manual capacities) once the results were complete.","The overall challenge of the election-coverage was the scope of work considering our small four-person team. The difficulty is exacerbated by both the chaos in available data caused by German federalism, as well as catering to 18 different local newspapers that belong to Funke Mediengruppe. As our product included national-level results, in an ideal world, we would have simply created smaller derivatives for more local regions but based on the same data and source. Unfortunately, the data the federal German election office published, were not granular enough for small-scale maps of e.g. Berlin, Hamburg, or the municipalities of other federal states. Therefore the more granular local data for the regions our newspapers are covering had to be collected from various local offices, each of whom had differing formats and different interruptions during the election night (e.g. data being formatted differently than previously communicated), which needed a lot of fixing and adjusting of numerous scrapers for different locations in real time during election night, while results were flooding in already. The regional variance in data availability also impacted our production flow, as one of our approaches to make the workload manageable was to basically clone the dashboard we had created for the national overview to create regional derivatives by altering some location parameters but otherwise keeping the (data) structure and functions the same. However, we had to make revisions and adjustments for each location as data was not available consistently across these places. Where in one federal state there were only the election districts available (299 across all of Germany), other federal states had data on the level of municipalities (a few hundred per state) or even over 1000 different neighborhoods, which allowed for a very detailed map in the case of Berlin.","The project shows that an efficient set-up and preparation make it possible to cover a lot in a short amount of time, even with a very small team. Strategies that helped us achieve these goals included:   using a template structure, which can be copied as a blueprint to various elections and/or geographies and allows for multiple localized editions of content in the same structure (and structuring the data consistently as well)   a modular set-up, that allowed for more flexibility when handling, updating, fixing or maintaining multiple pages at the same time. For example, erroneous modules could be commented out if not high-priority at that very moment of the election night, allowing to attend to more urgent issues without having to shut down a whole page or keep errors online   modules also made it possible to create stand-alone widgets from parts of our dashboards that could in turn be used in other articles and front-page teasers across the company. Without a modular set-up, with the small team we have, it would have been impossible to offer and create interactive visualizations for as many articles and pages as our widgets were used in / embedded into.   using a central data repository with a strict data structure (including polling results, election results, results of individual candidates as well as parties, for various geographies), into which scrapers fed data from various sources. This made it possible to keep the upper hand over complicated data situations where we had to switch between 7 different dashboards within minutes or work on them in parallel for months.   we created non-public, self-service web interfaces for colleagues from other desks to export custom charts with our election data, e.g. for specific municipalities or maps as printable svg’s",German,https://interaktiv.waz.de/bundestagswahl-2021-umfragen-ergebnisse-wahlkarte/,https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/bundestagswahl-berlin-2021-ergebnisse-wahlkarte/,https://interaktiv.thueringer-allgemeine.de/bundestagswahl-thueringen-2021-ergebnisse-wahlkarte/,https://interaktiv.waz.de/bundestagswahl-nordrhein-westfalen-2021-ergebnisse-wahlkarte/,https://interaktiv.abendblatt.de/bundestagswahl-hamburg-2021-ergebnisse-wahlkarte/,https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/abgeordnetenhauswahl-berlin-2021-umfragen-ergebnisse-wahlkarte/,https://www.morgenpost.de/infografik/#/grafik/6038f23e767e213d20deade1,,"Marie-Louise Timcke, André Pätzold, Angelo Zehr, Sebastian Vollnhals, Ida Flik, Moritz Klack, Christopher Möller","Funke Mediengruppe's Interactive team develops interactive applications and data-driven stories for the Group's various news brands.

Le Devoir has targeted six of the city's most dangerous intersections where these happen to try to find out how the planning could be at fault. We also created an interactive map where users can see and learn more about all of these collisions by filtering the year, the mode of transport (and whether a heavy truck was involved), and the gravity of the accident.","Although the City of Montreal has adopted the Vision Zero approach, which aims to eliminate all deaths and serious injuries on its roads by 2040, our analysis revealed that there are still on average twenty vulnerable users dying every year – a number that isn't declining. This series has empowered the readers to get a hold of what the city has been doing to increase the security of its streets and what blind spots still need to be addressed. Numerous open letters and op-eds have been written the following week with calls to action to legislate on limiting the number and the types of heavy vehicles rolling in the streets of Montreal and to deplore this ""unacceptable situation"". Le Devoir also revealed in a subsequent piece that a member of Parliament intends to introduce a bill during the upcoming session to impose lateral bars on heavy trucks. ","We have examined over 200 000 collisions involving at least one motor vehicle from 2012 to 2020 that occurred on the road network of the Montreal agglomeration (highways are not included) shared by the city's Open Data website.

United States,Streetsblog,Small,Shortlist,,"Ignored, Dismissed",21/10/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, CSV, PostgreSQL","I spent two months analyzing data on more than 26 million complaints received by New York City’s 311 system to reveal that the city police department chronically ignores reports of reckless driving, illegal parking, and abandoned vehicles. This analysis of more than a decade of data showed how the NYPD’s neglect of resident complaints has fostered a culture of lawlessness on city streets that has gotten worse as traffic deaths in the city climb to their highest point in years.","As a result of this story: - The city Department of Investigation has launched an investigation, which is ongoing, into one of the story’s findings: that city police officers may be harassing and intimidating frequent users of the 311 system.  - The city inquiry was demanded by then-Mayor Bill de Blasio, who expressed alarm about the story’s findings and vowed to improve the NYPD’s response to 311 complaints. - The NYPD has launched its own internal review. - The city Department of Information Technology released previously withheld data about city standards for 311 complaint response times. - The city Civilian Complaint Review Board said it would investigate allegations that the NYPD had falsified responses to 311 reports. - City council members criticized the NYPD’s handling of 311 in a hearing in which the story was frequently cited. - Other, larger news outlets--The Atlantic and The New York Post—wrote follow-up stories. - City lawmakers released statements condemning the NYPD’s handling of 311 complaints.","I used PostgreSQL to examine and manipulate the city 311 data. I used QGIS to join it with a police precinct boundary shapefile to determine which precincts were the most neglectful of 311 reports. This revealed one precinct was a major outlier in the city, closing unusually large numbers of complaints impossibly fast and with false justifications. And I used Tableau to map the complaints, which revealed further patterns and damning anecdotal findings in the data. For example, this revealed that a high-profile cyclist death in 2018 was preceded by more than a dozen complaints about unsafe conditions for cyclists on the street where she died, which the NYPD had ignored.   I combined these data techniques with more traditional reporting that drew on hundreds of pages of public records and interviews with dozens of city officials, former city police officers, safe-streets advocates, attorneys, and residents who have filed years of 311 reports.","The challenges of this project included working with such a large database, prying information from stonewalling city officials, and finding current or former NYPD officials to speak candidly about the department’s chronic mishandling of these complaints. Further, Streetsblog is a very small organization with few resources. This is the first project of this size that we have ever carried out.   The NYPD’s neglect of 311 has long been a source of ire for city residents, but reports on the problem had only been anecdotal. This story was the first to thoroughly document the NYPD’s sheer disregard for resident complaints and the failings of this crucial city service.","This project demonstrated the value of a largely overlooked public dataset in assessing the performance of city agencies. It points to many additional stories that journalists could pursue with the same data—like examining the 311 response of other city agencies or joining this data with other datasets to scrutinize other aspects of the NYPD’s 311 response.

The GoodRx research team ingested prices for commonly filled and affordable generic medications in order to 1) understand how much patients are paying in a hospital setting for routine medications and 2) observe adherence to the new CMS regulations.  In short, these chargemaster prices are riddled with data issues, are unapproachable for patients, and only really highlight the variable and seemingly random nature of hospital pricing.","Published chargemaster prices improve transparency, and ultimately help patients in the long run. It can equip them with the knowledge to shop around, advocate for themselves, and fully understand their hospital bill. Yet, according to GoodRx’s research, the new CMS regulation is not being fully adhered to, and many patients  Since publishing, this work has been featured in Bloomberg, STAT, and MarketWatch and has spurred conversations and deeper research into hospital price transparency and surprise medical bills. This research has an impact even beyond the journalism world, as policymakers can use this research to see how CMS regulations are falling short, and how hospitals are continuing to price gouge patients.","The project involved heavy data cleaning techniques in order to standardize really hospital chargemaster datasets from 16 hospitals nationwide. We leaned heavily on Python, specifically the Pandas package, toprocess the different file types to a standard format and to do some exploratory visualization. We additionally utilized SQL to process millions of claims data to obtain average cash prices of drugs. To translate our message effectively and interactively, we visualized our data in charts using Data Wrapper. Last, we used policy analysis to quantify how adherent hospitals were to newly enacted federal policy. Our team also had to dive into CMS policy to understand the ruling and see how chargemasters were falling short. On top of that, Each hospital listed a drug and its quantity and form in their own way. We had to manually standardize each drug at every hospital to match the GoodRx drug database. Lastly, we also utilized data from The FDA, DailyMed and MediSpan, all official sources on prescription drugs.","Even though chargemasters are given very stringent rules on how they should list their charges, few adhere to these regulations. As such, it was incredibly difficult to ingest and standardize the data. Doing this required hours of manual work investigating drug NDCs, their official codes. As one of our analysts stated, “it was like solving 16 different puzzles with no answer key” It’s also important to note that this is one of the first research reports on this topic. While many people understand that drug prices vary from pharmacy to pharmacy, few have been able to show just how variable drug prices can be in an inpatient setting, and just how fast these expenses can add up.  ","From this research, Journalists can:    Use our preliminary findings to expand on hospital price disparities and see how patients are exposed to these high prices across the country.

The choice to use canvas, which is trickier to work with, rather than easier tools like d3, was made to ensure that the visuals would run as smoothly as possible.  - Archival photos from the schools were selected and cut in Adobe Photoshop. - FInally, we used a in-house scrollytelling library to let readers scroll through the story and trigger the various steps of the visualisation.","The hardest part was to create empathy in the reader by keeping focus on the people who are the main subject of this story. It is easy to loose track of this aim on a data-led story such as this one. You want to keep the attention focues on humans when all you have is dots on a map and some numbers. We tried to achieve this empathy by choosing vibrant colours for the different cultural area shapes, by using archival photos portraying indigenous children, and by animating school-home distances to make them look more like journeys.  We also tapered the story so that the ""macro"" would show at the beginning (the map with all the findings) and then progressively shifting the focus towards the individual, with Jack Kruger's memories, the children's photos and the zoom on the St. Eugene school.

Germany,"Funke Mediengruppe (Berliner Morgenpost, Hamburger Abendblatt, WAZ, Thüringer Allgemeine, Braunschweiger Zeitung and many more)",Big,Shortlist,,Vaccination monitor,02/02/21,"Explainer, Open data, News application, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Json, CSV, Node.js","Since the early stages of Germany’s vaccination campaign, the vaccination monitor tracks the progress both nationally as well as in the different federal states, by age groups, vaccines and in international comparison. A modular concept allows us to react to new developments in the pandemic, newly available data or new questions by adjusting or adding visualizations. For example, in fall 2021, substantial parts of the page were revised to account for the new stage of booster vaccinations.","As our corona coverage is based on the concept of a web of applications, bundled in a compact form in the main coronavirus monitor dashboard and going into different applications and specific pages from there, it is hard to draw clear lines between individual projects. However, the vaccination monitor was and is a crucial element of the interactives team’s continuous effort and aim to provide all relevant information related to the pandemic and its developments. The vaccination monitor alone has been visited over 15 million times in 2021, and the coronavirus monitor, which includes a stand-alone embed widget of the vaccination monitor, continues to be the most successful article in the company’s history.","Data is regularly scraped from different sources with automated node.js scripts and written into csv files. The frontend uses these files and is based on a state-of-the-art frontend technology stack using React with next.js, Mapbox for maps, emotion for CSS-in-js, and d3 for data visualization. As most of our users visited the page on their smartphones, we paid extra attention to a good user experience on small devices with low bandwidth. Additionally, we split parts of the story into smaller pieces that could be embedded on other sites using iframes.","As a page designed with a monitoring function, the project poses a number of technical and conceptual challenges. On a technical end, displaying new up-to-date figures every day means that we automated data-collection processes with various scrapers, often with data sources not especially friendly to scraping (or barely machine-readable in general). On top of that, the issuing authorities frequently change formats, locations or content of the tables they publish without prior notice, so the vaccination monitor also requires continuous and often very quick maintenance or fixes. On a conceptual level, changes in policy, updated recommendations from health authorities as well as progress in what was originally meant to be a linear process of vaccinating most of the population meant constant reshuffling of priorities, old visualizations becoming obsolete and/or that the need for new visualizations arose, especially as more data was made public or more granular data became available. Major events that made us rethink and rework large parts of the monitor include the moment vaccinations were available to everyone rather than to those belonging to a priority group, changes in the communicated national goal (% of the population vaccinated) as more infectious variants arose, the moment booster vaccinations became necessary and kids could get vaccinated as well. The quality and validity of data was also a constant question accompanying us, as the methodology behind recording data was not always consistent across time and space (e.g. sometimes vaccinated people were assigned to multiple priority groups, other places just one) and in other cases, the was a discrepancy between reality and the official plans or recommendations that made interpreting data difficult (e.g. officially only people above 12 should be vaccinated, but there already were frequent reports about younger kids receiving shots as well).","As with all our Covid-19-coverage, this project taught us about creativity in data-driven journalism: even when the overall topic is the same for a long time, it is still both possible and crucial to develop innovative formats that are tailored to users’ specific needs at a specific moment in time - and these change constantly. Modular set-ups provide a lot of benefits with this: they allow creating go-to places for users which can be updated, adapted module by module, expanded and so on, and therefore stay an optimum source of information and stable source of information while adapting to dynamic developments in the pandemic. An important approach in constantly finding new interesting angles to public data was to match it with other information in order to generate new insights. For example, in the early phase of Covid vaccinations in Germany, the official data included indicators on the professions or age groups of those vaccinated. Rather than just visualizing the published data (how many percent of those vaccinated work in healthcare), we researched data on the different federal state’s approximate numbers of healthcare workers, pensioners, pensioners living in care facilities a.s.o. so we could give an idea about which percentage of these groups had received vaccinations. We also aim to continuously question standart visualizations and adapt or find new forms of depicting information. With the vaccination monitor, we for example created an abstract queuing line showing the different groups of prioritized people (when vaccinations weren’t available to everyone yet) and depict the numbers of vaccinations in a calendar-based tile plot and bar-chart, making it more accessible and relatable than abstract standard graphs.",German,https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-impfungen-deutschland-bundeslaender-weltweit/,https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-virus-karte-infektionen-deutschland-weltweit/,,,,,,,"Marie-Louise Timcke, André Pätzold, Angelo Zehr, Sebastian Vollnhals, Ida Flik","Funke Mediengruppe's Interactive team develops interactive applications and data-driven stories for the Group's various news brands.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Shortlist,,"Yeah, neighborhood, drugs and luxury. This is how trap music sounds on playlists and what centennials talk about",17/09/21,"Explainer, Database, News application, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Audio, Arts, Culture","AI/Machine learning, JQuery, Json, R, Python, Node.js","Trap is one of the most popular music genres among young people in Argentina: of the most listened artists last year, ten of them swung between Rap, Trap and Reggaeton. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to analyze their lyrics, demystify the concepts around the genre and understand what these artists, who bring about such a furor among the new generations, are talking about. The purpose of this project was focused on attracting and creating an experience for this type of audiences, unusual for LA NACION and also dealing with this topic in a different way for non-specialized audiences.","This special project was undoubtedly risky because we went completely out of our comfort zone. It was our first special using machine learning and dealing with a topic that is not typical in the newsroom. On the one hand, we set a precedent in using Machine Learning for content production in a large mass medium in Argentina; and on the other hand, we analyzed the lyrics of one of the most important music genres recently in a way never done before in the country. This was very well received by the community specialized in the subject, especially because we worked together with an independent medium specialized in freestyle and trap called El Estilo Libre and with journalists from the renowned music magazine Rolling Stone. We published this piece together and thanks to them we could have greater reach and dialogue with the community. The special was highlighted and valued by some freestyle personalities in rap battles. In addition to this news article, different pieces were made in social media: TikToks, Instagram Lives, Instagram TVs and different graphic pieces. These reached more than eighty thousand views in total and the piece was watched by an audience between 17 and 25 years old. The piece was also mentioned in LatAm Journalism Review, as one of the examples of an IA use applied to journalism in Latin America.","The whole information process was made in Python. Visualizations were made in Vue.JS. A total of 692 song lyrics were scrapped of the top 20 artists of the genre of Genius platform. After this step, tokenization and lemmatization techniques were applied to calculate the frequency of words used in the songs. Named Entity recognition was performed for brand recognition with the SpaCy library in Spanish and a manual check was performed. A sample of songs was taken with a 95% confidence interval and it was manually classified word by word under three labels: places, people and brands to compare the entities that were manually labeled against those recognized by the model. After several repetitions,EntityRuler, a library functionality for adding entities and improving entity recognition, was used. Different Wikipedia pages with lists of tags were also used as model training input. Thus, the model was run once again on the sample to perform a confusion matrix and determine the F1 score, which was 0.61 in its latest version. Finally, the universe of all song lyrics was processed and, after the output was achieved, a manual correction was performed on it to achieve an even higher level of accuracy. Moreover, a technique known as Topic Modelling was applied with the Top2Vec model to recognize the topics covered by the songs. The Spotify API was used to perform a rhythmic analysis of the genre. Variables such as danceability, tempo, energy and acoustic level were used as input. Based on these variables, the technique known as ‘clustering’ was applied to the KMeans model in 3 groups.  ","One of the great challenges of this project was the application of techniques from texts written in prose to texts written in verse, with phrases in different languages (English, Spanish, Italian, among others) and words and abbreviations specific to the genre or not found in dictionaries. In addition to this, we found that Natural Language Processing (NLP) models are not as powerful in languages other than English. This resulted in much more manual work and a team of more than 10 persons to be involved in the checking and supervision processes of the different techniques applied for more than 4 months. This project was one of the first projects of the team with these technologies, and therefore, it involved a process of learning and testing different models. As regards the editorial work, it was a twofold challenge: ensure that the piece is aimed at the specialized Trap community and understood by those who are not familiar with the subject. But installing such a disruptive and young issue in a traditional centenarian newsroom, where political or economic issues predominate and where the average age range of the audience is over 40 years old, was not an easy task. So, we worked with different teams and persons of different ages to find the best strategy for the project and achieve a vast reach on different platforms and audiences.","The main lessons learned are hidden behind the challenges mentioned above. One of the main lessons learned, that can be passed on to other journalism teams, was the work done with Natural Language Processing (NLP) models applied to texts in languages other than English. That was hard work, trial and error, several repetitions and the search for other solutions to help a better performance of these models. The key was not to discard the idea, but to look for other solutions and connect with other people who had had a similar problem.

Main goal of the project was to analyze the language used by Russian-speaking opponents of COVID-19 vaccination in Social Media in order to learn what differs their speech from the speech of neutral/pro-vaccination users, as well as to compare the popularity of anti and neutral/pro-vaccination posts in Russian Social Media. We have parsed more than 3 mln vaccination-related posts from the main Russian-language social network ""VKontakte"", then classified them into ""Antivax"" and ""Other"" categories using machine learning techniques and performed exploratory data analysis on the classified","Our story was published by ""Tinkoff Magazine"" , which is one of the main russian online media related to business/economics. Posts with the link to the article were also published in ""T-M"" social media (Instagram, VK, Facebook). To date, the article alone (not counting social media posts) has had 38k views, 115 likes and  530 comments which is one of the top results for 2021 articles published in the same ""Statistics"" column of ""T-M"". When we started this project, all of the team members  were driven by one single aspiration which was to understand better the nature of antivax movement in Russia and the scale of its spread. COVID vaccination is not an easy topic to discuss in our country which is currently divided in 2 almost equal parts in terms of attitude towards Сovid vaccination. It was expected that our article would cause a controversial reaction amongst readers, including some political bias accusations (completely unfounded, as none of the team members are involved in any political/state-related activity in any way, and moreover, 3 out of 4 team members don't even live in Russia anymore). We believe that studies like this one aren't meant to divide us, but to help us all better understand each other and this new era we have been living in for the past 2 years. ","First, we wrote a Python script using official VKontakte API to quickly parse vaccine-related posts published between Jan and Aug 2021. It took us 1 week to get more than 3 mln texts from VK. Then we performed some initial cleansing of the dataset, removing short (up to 40 characters) messages and ""service"" symbols, and randomly extracted a sample with 10000 texts. We manually marked up this relatively small sample (it took us 50 hours) and defined 4 categories of texts: pro-vaccination, anti-vaccination, neutral and irrelevant. We then used this mapped sample as an input for the supervised learning of the classification models. Already at this point we faced some difficulties in separating ""pro-vaccination"" texts from the neutral ones : there was only a small number of posts where the vaccine was directly praised. We realized that it would be an issue to analyze differences in the speech of supporters and  opponents of vaccination because of the small number of posts with a clear positive opinion on vaccination and of the fact that texts from vaccine supporters were poorly amenable to automatic classification (even manually these texts could be easily confused with neutral speech). We tested and compared some classification models (Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression and some other) with different mix of parameters, all using TfidfTransformer and Count Vectorizer. Although we tested all models for binary (Anti/Other) and non-binary (Anti/Pro/Neutral) classification, the Logistic Regression binary model on bigrams turned out to be the one that showed bext results, given the above limitations. ""How-to"" guide to our work was publlished here:","This project was part of a data journalism accelerator, so it had a very limited timeline (1 month for analysis and another 2 weeks for writing and editing texts and visuals). On the other hand, all members of the team worked on the project in addition to their primary occupations, meaning we only could dedicate a part of our time to this work (mainly evenings and week-ends). Not to mention that all of us are quite new to Data Journalism. Due to the lack of time and limited financing, we couldn't delegate any tasks to speed up the work. It was faster to do it ourselves than to find and manage contractors.  Consequently, the hardest part was to wisely manage our resources, and to make this project a reality. We didn't have enough time to do everything we'd like to do with the data we'd exracted. For instance, we had an idea to clusterize the ""other"" category to try to split it into few meaningful clusters which would allow us a more focused analysis and comparison. But after evaluating the time it would take us to do this work, we decided to skip it and to move on with what we had already (binary classification results), so that we can publish this article at all.","We believe that our work, even though it's far from being perfect, is giving any person interested in creating a data story based on text analysis with the use of machine learning, a clear path to follow, as well as it's highlighting potential difficulties and problems to anticipate/avoid.  After the article had been published, we received some gratifying feedback from other data journalists: both experienced and beginners.

Less than two months after it began, a corruption scandal known as the ""VIP vaccination centre"" came to light: government officials, family members and those closest to the government had received doses before the prioritised groups. We decided to follow the campaign and the vaccination system from two different sides. On the one hand, control the number of doses received, distributed and applied. On the other hand, monitor the implementation of public policies by combining public data and many requests for access to public information as main sources.","Even though the lack of transparency from the Ministry of Health, LA NACION published many different investigation pieces revealing several inconsistencies in the discourse of public officials and reality: we exposed the path of vaccines so that different officials and close relatives could receive a vaccine before it was due and the application of doses that had already expired or that corresponded to another laboratory different from the one informed to people. This investigation caused great commotion. In particular, the investigation that revealed the path of the VIP vaccine doses was used in the court case that began after this fact became known. Moreover, a government admitted having committed “involuntary errors” in the application of vaccines after publishing the news story that showed that more than eleven thousand doses had been administered from a laboratory different from the lab administering the initial dose and the one appearing on the vaccine card. In turn, we decided to investigate the background of the vaccination system in which the COVID immunization campaign was to be planned. We found that in Argentina, due to a lack of integration of the computer systems of the provinces, it is not possible to know how many people were administered a vaccine. This number is calculated from the number of doses distributed by the National Ministry of Health. Thanks to this news story, government agencies, researchers and civil society in general were able to have access for the first time to the records of the application of calendar vaccines since 2009. In addition, it was also important to add value by making unique projections and analysis such as an end on vaccination projection on each district, taking into account the rhythm of dose application on each jurisdiction as parametre –with public databases and data from FOIA requests.","Approximately twenty persons worked on this project among different productions selected for this category. The information process was made in Python and Amazon Web Services (AWS) were used for hosting and deployment of different processes and databases. Visualizations were performed in Vue.JS, Chart.JS and Canvas. The information process was made in Python and Amazon Web Services (AWS) were used for hosting and deployment of different processes and databases. Visualizations were performed in Vue.JS. The project is divided into two large data sets. One of them is designed for world data and the other one is for data from Argentina where there is more fine detail of each dose applied. For world processing, Our World in Data is taken as source, data are daily downloaded from the source, processed and persisted in a database in Postgres to later make them available and publish them in different infographics. As regards the Argentina dataset, a file provided by the National Ministry of Health is used as source and it contains data about each application, type of dose, laboratory, age range, among others. In order to process and persist the files, standardized data of each province, municipality and laboratory are taken into account, so that consistency among all the tables of the COVID project can be maintained. It was developed an algorithm that reads data from the database on a daily basis, reprocesses it and writes a JSON format file to make data available for the different FrontEnd/Infographics applications. Finally, there is a last process, which takes the data offered by another official source, the Public Immunization Monitor (Monitor Público de Vacunación) and keeps the application totals updated as this source has more frequent updating.","There were many challenges. First of all, how to obtain data. Basic information such as, for example, the exact number of vaccines received, which batches, their origin and to which provinces and agencies they were distributed, can only be accessed through requests for access to public information. On this regard, the only agency authorized to purchase vaccines in Argentina is the National Ministry of Health and it is very reluctant to share data. Second, although there is a public database, data cannot be cross-referenced because there are no case IDs and this makes analysis difficult. Data such as, for example, how many people combined vaccines (in Argentina, citizens cannot opt for the vaccine of the laboratory of their choice and many persons were administered their first dose of one brand and the second dose of another one). Although the State has data related to those persons infected by COVID, it is not either possible to cross-reference these data, since the State refuse to publish data in a way that can be related. Then, even though we decided to connect with the Communication Department of the Ministry of Health during the pandemic, there were many changes in personnel, and despite our repeated requests, we were never able to talk to someone with a technical profile. Finally, we also made best efforts to understand the national vaccine registry process, but information is not clear, is not very modern, it differs between provinces and due to bureaucracy, there is a long delay in data publication and this circumstance made us face the challenge, in many occasions, of working with outdated information.","But, despite being very hard to find and having structured, updated, accurate and reliable public records, we were able to find ways to obtain and work with them. This involved strong interdisciplinary work between programmers, specialised journalists, data analysts and data scientists and multimedia designers. We faced the challenge of working with databases without any case IDs and thus we learned to be creative and find ways to analyse data as well. Also, as the open data files increased with the vaccination record, more team members were needed to analyse it in order to respond to the multiple requests from LA NACION journalists, so they were trained to improve their technical and big data analysis skills to help the rest of the team. At the same time, it was very important to cross-check official data with requests for access to public information and find ways to improve all the information. This was key to firstly gain access to exclusive data and to be able to move forward with investigation pieces that were not possible due to the reluctance to open data. A fundamental aspect to take into consideration was not to take anything for granted and question the numbers in order to find more and better stories.",Spanish,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/verbitsky-nuevas-revelaciones-sobre-el-origen-de-las-dosis-del-vacunatorio-vip-nid26052021/,https://blogs.lanacion.com.ar/projects/sin-categoria/vacunas-sigma,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/la-vacunacion-en-la-argentina-en-tiempo-real-nid02022021/#/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/planillas-de-papel-un-metodo-caotico-impide-saber-cuantos-argentinos-se-vacunan-nid05032021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/se-registraron-al-menos-67700-errores-en-la-carga-de-datos-de-la-campana-de-vacunacion-contra-el-nid23072021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/sputnik-v-hay-84-dosis-de-los-lotes-devueltos-a-rusia-que-se-registraron-como-aplicadas-nid01102021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/moderna-los-datos-oficiales-revelan-discrepancias-entre-los-anuncios-y-la-aplicacion-de-casi-dos-nid03092021/,,"Pablo Loscri, Carlos Araujo, Gastón de la Llana, Martín Pascua, Pablo Arellano, Delfina Arambillet, Natalia Louzau, Mariana Trigo Viera, Lucas Morón Escalante, Melisa Vera Chavez, Fabiola Czubaj","Project members are journalist, interactive designers, developers from Health Department, Data and Interactive Graphics teams.    ",

In order to protect mental health because of the lockdown, the government allowed people to go out for a few minutes and do some exercise and catch fresh air. However, just a few had this privilege. Lima is a city with inequality, where many districts have small quantities of parks and green areas, or not at all. For this reason we wanted to show these problems that have been around for a long time but that the pandemic emphasized.","We simplified the technical language and maps produced by the government, in order to show it in a simple and intuitive way. This contribution allowed to reduce the gaps in access to technical and scientific knowledge, letting a lot of people be aware of the public places of recreation that they may or may not have access to. This kind of work was never done by a private or public organization, so many people asked us to provide the data so they can do their own research and enrich the analysis, sharing with their colleagues or students.  ","We used geographic information systems (Qgis) in order to analyze, validate and produce maps about the distribution of recreational areas in Lima, Perú. After this process, we could see the contrast in nearby districts determined by its socioeconomic level. First, we had to clean and join different databases using tools like R and Rstudio and satellite images to check if the geographical data and records provided by the government was actually correct. Collaboration was a key factor in this project so we also used google sheets to share some samples of the work in progress. Once the analysis was finished, we used tools like open street maps and mapbox in order to share our findings on the web. Moreover, we developed a custom page for the project with an interactive searcher where people can choose their neighborhood  they are living in and see how their district is doing regarding recreation areas.  ","When we looked at the geographical data that the government provided we realized that they had a different idea of “public spaces”. In a way, It was dirty data that we couldn’t work right away, so we used satellital images to validate and revise multiples categories like parks, squares, groves, sport slab, among others, and integrate them in the concept of “recreational area”, which means free and public spaces with the capacity of doing outdoor recreational activities. By doing this, the issue with the official data provided by the government was solved and was well received by public institutions and civil organizations (academy, neighbors) because of its contribution to the study of public spaces.  ","Interdisciplinary work is one the most rewarded kind of projects, in terms of production and learning for a journalist.

From the end of Reconstruction to 1940, newspapers were the most powerful news medium in America. Those run by white supremacist publishers and editors printed headlines and stories that fueled racial hate, inciting massacres and lynchings of Black citizens. As part of the project, The Howard Center produced more than 30 news stories, a special-project website, a data-driven news application and a mini-documentary.","The impact of the project was to expose the racist pasts of many American newspapers. In addition to the more than 30 stories contained in the project, The Howard Center also published a news application that identifies and classifies problematic historical coverage of racial terror lynchings by white-owned newspapers. The Howard Center also produced a mini-documentary for the project that uses animation, interviews and motion graphics to explore how white-owned newspapers fueled the 1919 massacre in Elaine Arkansas.    Reporting from the project also exposed that the Worcester Democrat, a weekly on Maryland's largely rural Eastern Shore, ran an unsigned, front-page commentary in 1940 calling for the lynchings of five Black suspects in the murder of a white farmer and the robbery and assault of his wife. As a result, Edward J. Clarke, the owner, publisher and editor of the Worcester Democrat at the time, was removed from the Maryland-Delaware-District of Columbia Press Association's Hall of Fame","For the website, we designed and built a custom website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript using WordPress as a content management system. This allowed us to design and build a product that was specifically designed for this content and topic while also allowing us to publish the more than 30 stories contained in the project in an efficient manner.   For the mini-documentary, we use AfterEffects to create a motion graphic that combines custom illustrations, interviews, audio and graphics into a cohesive and compelling piece of visual storytelling.   For the news application, the data team used computational historical research methods to identify and classify problematic historical coverage of racial terror lynchings by white-owned newspapers.

United States,THE CITY,Small,Participant,,Meet Your Mayor,21/03/21,"Quiz/game, Elections, Politics","Animation, Personalisation, D3.js, Canvas, Google Sheets","The 2021 citywide primary in New York arrived with a record number of candidates, a new ranked-choice voting system — and the biggest stakes of any local election in at least a generation. With more than a dozen hopefuls seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor, THE CITY was determined to cut through the noise of endless Zoom candidate forums and help voters in a city beset by dismally low voter turnout in recent years. So we created “Meet Your Mayor,” a quiz-driven interactive that helps voters find the candidates whose stances most closely match theirs’.","Based on answers to questions posed to both users and the candidates, users were instantly able to see how the candidates stacked up, issue by issue. The interactive also provides excerpts from candidates’ public comments on various issues, offering additional context. The project drew more than 500,000 views, with average use in the days before the June primary reaching about 13 minutes.  Nearly 1 million New Yorkers cast ballots in the primary, compared to about 700,000 in 2013, the last time the city had comparable turnover in municipal government. The project attracted coverage in other media, as well as via social media: Some voters tweeted that Meet Your Mayor helped them choose and rank candidates using the new, unfamiliar voting system. The project also attracted attention beyond New York: At the request of #VoteATL, a collective of community organizations in Atlanta, we shared our code to help create a version of Meet Your Mayor for The Big Peach’s general election (https://app.voteatl.org/meet-your-mayor/).","We built the project on top of NPR’s static site generator framework (https://github.com/nprapps/interactive-template). Questions, answers, quotes and candidate information were stored and edited in a Google sheet, which was used to generate the quiz pages and candidate pages. The core quiz interactivity was built with vanilla JavaScript. The interactive bubble graphics were built with D3. We used Google and Facebook’s authentication libraries to allow users to customize the page with their social media profile image. Answers were saved to localStorage to retain progress between visits and pre-populate the roundup quiz.","The interrelated tasks of coming up with clear, digestible and fair multiple choice questions on often complex issues — and getting candidates to answer them — proved challenging and labor intensive. After carefully crafting questions, we sent them to the candidates — and followed up and followed up until we got answers. In the few cases where candidates declined to answer some or all questions, we scoured the public record — everything from candidates’ websites to media appearances to comments made during dozens of Zoom forums — to best determine answers. The work that went into picking issues, writing and refining questions to make them both useful and reader friendly cannot be underestimated. We believe we met our goal in creating a civic-engagement tool that never felt like homework, and proved, to some, even fun.  ","Meet Your Mayor is an engagement tool built on personalization. We were careful to space out the rollout of quizzes over about 10 weeks to both keep users excited about the next installment without overloading them.

The site provided information about how to get vaccinated in Maryland and in the state’s five most populous localities. The site included who can get vaccinated, how to get vaccinated and where to get vaccinated in each area, all presented in an easy-to-use, accessible format.","CNS created this project to help Marylanders navigate the confusing process of getting vaccinated, including the difficulty that residents faced when trying to determine how and where to get vaccinated. There were various vaccination sites managed by the state, counties, hospitals and pharmacies. Each entity had different rules, with information spread across multiple websites. The aim of the project was to simplify access to this information and help people get vaccinated. CNS decided to create a one-stop source of information, tools and data; a place where all the disparate information was collected on one easy-to-navigate website. We felt that writing news stories wasn’t the best way to produce journalism about this topic but instead to use our access and skills for the public good.","The site is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery. The graphics were built using Flourish Studio. The design of the site was first constructed using pencil and paper and then mocked up using Adobe XD and then translated to the web using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The design of the site was particularly important – especially the information design. We wanted the site to be easily accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical capabilities. And we wanted to include a lot of information in a relatively short and easy-to-find manner. We used UX design principles to accomplish this. Data collection was a very important part of this project and we used Google Sheets to collect and organize the underlying data.","The hardest part of this project was collecting the information and keeping it updated. Because rules and sites varied between each county and the state as a whole, the initial data collection took about a week. We also updated the data each week, which took several hours of research and collection. While the site was designed and built by 2 journalists, collecting the data and keeping it updated took the combined efforts of over 10 journalists. This was an essential part of the project. To accomplish our goals, the data needed to be updated and correct at all times.","I think that other journalists can learn to think outside the box about the best way to cover important stories and provide information to the public. We saw most large, mainstream media outlets covering the issues with vaccinations in a traditional, story-based format. While these stories did a good job of enumerating the issues associated with COVID vaccinations in Maryland, they didn’t help provide people with the information they needed to get vaccinated. We decided to approach the story in a public-service, solutions-oriented manner.

After the last escalation, which took place in spring 2021, we came up with an idea to make an analysis of the conflict based on data of the number of ceasefire violations provided by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission. By matching the timeline of ceasefire violations with the social and political events and media propaganda we found out that the conflict has transformed from real military operations into infowar. We concluded that at the moment this so called hybrid war is endless because of the benefits it brings on for","We have created a unique tool that demonstrates the real dynamics of the conflict in Donbas over the past 5 years. Research was shared with many media, including Ukrainian.

We gathered more than 2000 daily reports in PDF format from the OSCE website using Python. These PDFs has different structure according to different publishing periods, so we created a programming tool to parse them and convert into large CSV files. This step also required some manual work to prove the recognition quality. Then we cleaned the data in Google Sheets, extracted number of ceasefire violations by day, grouped them by weeks and put them on the timeline. We also made massive research to establish events that could be causes or consequences of the escalations and truces. We decided that the best form to present the result of our work is scrollytelling format. It was very new for us. We built and embedded a new engine to run this visualization on our website by using JavaScript, React framework and D3 library.","Each step of the project was challenging, especially the work with parsed and recognized PDFs. It took many hours to prove them manually, fact-check, and ensure the high quality of the data we presented to our readers. The scale of the database was ambiguous in terms of manual prooving, but we double-checked the result of parsing because over the past years, the OSCE mission has changed the structure of reports several times. Also, we had very limited experience with such complicated front-end development and had no production team, so we learned on the go how to manage such a big project. Moreover, it took a while to develop the exclusive engine for our site to achieve the best performance of scrollytelling for better user experience neither using a desktop nor mobile devices.

United States,"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Toledo Blade",Big,Participant,,Dirty Dollars,16/04/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration, Infographics, Video, Corruption, Money-laundering, Business","Animation, Drone","Dirty Dollars details one of the most elaborate money laundering schemes ever orchestrated in the US -- hundreds of millions in money stolen from Ukraine and plowed into steel factories in the US heartland in what became a steel empire. Ultimately, the cost-cutting and dangers inside the facilities led to explosions, accidents, hazardous waste -- and workers left disabled -- as the owners simply used the facilities to launder millions. While national news organizations told important stories about offshore shells and trusts, we told readers about the human cost to everday Americans.","Our project was cited by the U.S. House financial services committee, whose investigators contacted the Post-Gazette reporters to inform them that the panel was using our findings to create a report that shows the breakdowns in anti-money laundering safeguards that took place that allowed a Ukraine oligarch to move hundreds of millions of suspicious dollars into the United States -- through Deutsche Bank -- to acquire a real estate fortune. The panel is also expected to chronicle the lack of screening by the US Treasury (which heads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) that allowed an oligarch with the checkered past to buy 13 steel facilities in the US -- an industry considered critical to the country's national security. National financial crimes experts in Washington DC cited the Post-Gazette's reporting in pushing two landmark proposals unveiled by the US Treasury in December that could force anonymous shell companies to disclose their owners and US real estate professioinals to report the buyers of commercial and residential properties -- both critical in the fight against money laundering.  The first package (two stories) ran on April 16, 2021 and the second package (two stories) was published on November 19, 2021. A third story (supplemental) ran on December 26, 2021.   ","Through intricate, interactive graphics, the Post-Gazette created two compelling online presentations that showed the movement of the money from Ukraine to the United States -- including the stops along the way to conceal the funds in offshore shell companies, and ultimately into the US properties.  One of the graphics showed a single deal: $20 million moving in various amounts through a maze of shell companies -- the names of each company and the amount of money carefully marked -- and ultimately used to buy a steel factory in Kentucky in 2013. It was a noteworthy effort to simply show to readers how money laundering works. Through our drone photography, the Post-Gazette captured powerful images of two of the dangerous steel factories owned by the olgarch who orchestrated the entire scheme: Ihor Kolomoisky. Since the companies would not allow us onto the grounds, we flew over the facilities, showing burned-out, empty buildings scattered across a desolate landscape -- places where steelworkers nearly died in explosions and other dangerous events.    ","For this project, it was the writing. Through long and painstaking drafts, our goal was to explain in minute detail the financial fraud -- how it played out without being detected for years -- and how it brought incredible harm to people. The idea was to make readers care about these kinds of crimes, which are often so opaque and remote that they seem inconsequential. Most of the stories published by news organzations last year about secret trusts and shells used by powerful foreign leaders were fascinating and critically important. They had great impact. But few came as close to bringing it home to US readers and capturing the human misery of shadowy money and financial schemes as Dirty Dollars. The organization, the writing, the reporting -- it was a long and humbling process, but we believe the it resonated with readers. In addition to the crafting of the stories, there were real challenges in getting confidential documents, since the Justice Department was already investigating. But we managed to get secret grand jury records, internal bank documents, a confidential audit of the money that was allegedly stolen from the Ukraine bank and moved into the United States to help us tell this dramatic story. During the pandemic, we were forced to drive hundreds of miles to peoples' homes to prod them to talk. This made all the difference in going above and beyond what had been filed in court by prosecutors in forfeiture actions. The audit alone was critical in being able to verify much of the information we were reading in court files. To complete our work, we tracked down and interviewed some of the most powerful law enforcement officials in Ukraine to verify our reporting.","Read the stories and then examine the level of reporting that went into this kind of project about financial crime. The Post-Gazette was able to show with clarity and powerful online graphics how to take complex subjects like layering and speed transfers and offshore shell companies and break them all down in strong storytelling. In most cases, money laundering makes peoples' eyes glaze and the way it is carried out can be just as boring. We didn't do that. Again, most Americans don't care about Eastern European oligarchs and corruption in Belize and other places -- unless you bring it home. This wasn't about laundering in Miami or Manhattan or LA. It was in the US heartland and an industry that helped build this country: steel. The Justice Department had already initiated forfeiture proceedings and launched a grand jury, but we went far beyond the government actions using hundreds of confidential documents to show just what the oligarch and his partners were doing and how it impacted real people.   ",English,https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/ukraine-money-laundering/,https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/dirty-dollars-2/,https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2021/12/26/ukraine-oligarch-ihor-kolomoisky-cleveland-property-optima-investigation/stories/202112220147,,,,,,"Andrew Rush, Ed Yozwick, James Hilston, Laura Schneiderman, Ashley Murray, Tanya Kozyreva and Emma Loop","Michael Sallah is a senior investigations editor who has spent the past year supervising the I-team at the Post-Gazette.

The work used a wide range of sources to tell the story of the economics, politics and diplomacy behind Beijing's push to become the world's biggest exporter of COVID-19 vaccines. It is the first in a data-driven series exploring China’s vaccine strategy, capabilities and role in the global medicines supply chain. But the effort has also attracted skepticism and questions, and observers wonder how China’s initiative fits into preparations for the next pandemic. ","We wanted to explore how and why Chinese vaccines have been exported all over the world despite most western countries eschewing their use. We tried to tell a nuanced story, highlighting how Chinese jabs have become a crucial tool in fighting the pandemic. But we also covered criticisms in areas including efficacy, transparency and the political demands made by Beijing of some recipient countries. Whatever the balance sheet of China's role, the pandemic shows Beijing has become an important presence in global public health in a way it was not before. We received comments, especially from people in the developing countries where the vaccines were in high demand. Readers from India, another big pharmaceutical country, were also interested in the follow-up piece.","We mainly used Python to scrape, refine and visualize the data used in this piece and a follow-up published in December on China's push to become the world's number one pharmaceuticals maker (https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/chinavaccine-2/). We visualized all of the charts with a package called Altair so that we could easily edit them in Adobe Illustrator. For the mapping, we geocoded and visualized with Google Data Studio and Geopandas. For some national data, such as that of China, Mexico, and Indonesia, we scraped press releases in local languages. We could easily find documents released by the Chinese government, as one of the team members could read Chinese. For Mexico and Indonesia, we mostly relied on translation and colleagues who speak the relevant languages. For the research process, we used Selenium to scrape several Chinese official web pages, including those of the national drug regulator. We had to use a Chinese VPN to see some websites.","One of the most challenging parts of the work was telling the story of the spread of China's vaccines from various angles. We collected data on every aspect of Chinese jabs, such as distributed doses, product pipelines, and manufacturing plans. The flow of vaccine delivery was complicated, so we had to spend time calculating how many vaccines each country received.  The other challenge was China's lack of information disclosure. It was very difficult to access people and data in the country - especially from our base in Japan. It was also difficult to achieve the global coverage we wanted. We had to gather data and observations across continents for the comprehensive sweep required by the project. ","The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a tidal wave of disinformation and propaganda. This is true of both China's self-promotion and some of the criticism levelled at its vaccines. The main lesson of the project is that it is important to dig into details to try to tell a sophisticated story. Chinese vaccines have been very helpful in combating the pandemic, particularly for poorer countries with little or no access to western-made vaccines. In this sense, Beijing and the Chinese pharmaceutical companies played a crucial role in saving lives. But at the same time, Chinese jabs are neither the best nor the cheapest available. Part of the reason they struggle to gain acceptance in some places is a lack of published trial data. And some of the vaccine shipments China has made around the world have come with a political price for recipient nations.","English, Japanese",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/chinavaccine-1/,https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/chinavaccine-2/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/chinavaccine-1/,,,,,,"Anna Nishino, Akira Shimizu, James Hand-Cukierman, Shohei Yasuda, Kentaro Watanabe, Michael Peel, MinJung Kim, Michael Tsang, Kazuhiro Kida, Tetsuya Abe","Nikkei is the largest economic and financial paper in Japan and it is now expanding its presence worldwide (its English-language media, Nikkei Asia and the Financial Times, are also part of the Nikkei group).

A map of the route in the Far North, which is difficult to visualize on a conventional map, is illustrated using a digital globe.","The project showed readers in an intuitive way that growing use of the Arctic Ocean will likely have a significant impact on global geopolitics. As use increases, more natural resources will be extracted and alternative shipping routes will become available. However, Mercator maps do not show the high-latitude Arctic, leading many to underestimate the importance of the Arctic Ocean. Through our project, readers learned about the transformations taking place in global energy security and supply chains.

The whole team worked together to solve the problem, including engineers who were not initially involved who lightened processing speeds, and designers who added the rotating globe effect to the loading screen so that readers would not think the site was frozen. However, the project had to be released in early August, when the Arctic Ocean Passage would start to be used in earnest. Therefore, the editorial team had to decide how much to speed up the loading process within a limited time.

This is due to the system in which anyone can easily establish a zoo without a license.    So, we started the Project to investigate animal welfare at the zoo. Experts created simple questions to gauge the welfare state of the zoo. Citizens surveyed the welfare of 10 common animals in their neighborhood zoos and posted their data on our website. The data was corrected analyzed by experts.","A large number of citizens took part in the project. As experts, two veterinarians specializing in animal welfare, and as citizens, 760 teams of families including children and 40 veterinary college students gathered.   We collected data for a large number of zoos. Through citizens’ reports, we knew that there are about 200 unregistered zoos in addition to about 100 government-registered zoos. Citizens visited 246 out of 345 zoos in Korea (71.3%), and the welfare score of 10 animals averaged 53 out of 100. This was far below the score (88 points) at which it is presumed that the animals would live their life expectancy. Among the habitats surveyed, only 7% were presumed for the animals to be able to live their life expectancy. There were no statistics that investigated zoos on a large scale like ours in Korea. The government and some civic groups have surveyed a sample of 10 to 20 zoos.   It had an educational effect on citizens. They learn what conditions the animals in the zoo need to be happy and healthy. The children who participated in our project said, ""In the past, when I went to the zoo, I was busy looking at animals, but now I first check to see if the animals are healthy.""   Finally, our educational materials will be helpful to small zoo operators and keepers. Previously, they had little opportunity to learn about the needs of each animal species.   We reported our results as three articles in our magazine. On November 15th, a summary was released in the form of interactive content on our website. Our project won a special award at the Korea Data Journalism Awards.","1. PHP, CSS, mySQL, Excel It was used to develop a website for collecting zoo welfare survey data. On the website, citizens can answer 17 welfare measurement questions prepared by experts and post evidence photos and videos. Journalists and experts could download them as a single excel file when they want. With this excel file, they corrected and analyzed the data.   2. GPS location information Citizens usually used mobile devices at zoos to upload their findings. At this time, GPS location information of citizens was recorded along with the survey results, allowing experts and data journalists to determine the location of the zoo.   3. Google Docs, Google Maps We uploaded the zoo list in Google Docs and shared it with the public. Citizens added their neighborhood zoos to the list if it is not on the list (a zoo not registered with the government). With this, we discovered new zoos to investigate. Also, if citizens checked out a zoo welfare, they could write their name in the box next to the zoo’s name in the document. With this, we filled in the blanks on our zoo list.

In addition, it was used for all services for citizens.","Our biggest challenge was filling the data gap. We wanted to know exactly the welfare status of Korean zoos. In Korea, cases of abuse at several zoos have been exposed, but we did not know how widespread this was in zoos across the country. (The roadside zoos in the Netflix documentary 'Tiger King' raise and harass tigers for commercial purposes. In Korea, this is happening with raccoons and meerkats.) The problem was that no one had zoo statistics. According to Korean law, if someone has less than 50 animals or less than 10 species, they are not required to register with the government as a zoo. Also, when registering as a zoo, there is no need to report whether it meets the environmental conditions related to welfare. Without basic data, it was impossible to analyze the overall well-being of the zoo.   We decided to solve the problem with 'children'; VIP customers of the zoo. After educating children on what kind of zoo is good for animals, if children can do research when visiting the zoo, it is possible to educate zoo visitors and collect data at the same time.   The problem that children may lack professionalism has been addressed with 'citizen science'. We cooperated with experts in the field of animal welfare to prepare a method so that even children can easily do welfare research. Any errors that may have occurred during the investigation were also considered by experts. Experts are writing their thesis based on the data collected by us.   In summary, our innovations are: First, the reliability of the results is high. Experts set the welfare survey method sophisticated enough to submit papers to academic journals and corrected any errors. Second, data that did not exist in the world was collected. Third, ethical zoo visitors are growing..","Other journalists can learn about the structures that engage citizens in data journalism through our project. Everyone who participates in our project realizes their own desires. Journalists can gather data that never existed and write articles. Experts can also collect data that never existed and write academic papers.   The same goes for citizens. Children can satisfy their curiosity about animals and visit the zoo. Parents can relieve the guilt of visiting a non-educational zoo. (Parents who participated in our project often professed, ""Our son/daughter loves animals so much, so we have no choice but to go to the zoo. But when I saw the poor environment of the zoo, I felt guilty. I am glad that our child can critically enjoy the zoo.”) Veterinary College students gain the experience they need to become zoo veterinarians and meet mentors (experts).    The Zoo Guards was born based on their needs. The Korea Data Journalism Awards presented us with a special award and evaluated that it showed the potential of citizen-participatory data journalism. Previously, data journalists had been collecting, processing, and analyzing scattered data. This has made excellent articles, but there is a limit for the areas of ‘no data’ to stay in the dark. I dare to say that our project showed that even areas without data can be targeted by data journalism with the help of citizens and scientists.",Korean,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GSdTc0akGuXy7ONly8U7ODZQXtwdJoOU/view?usp=sharing,https://zooreports.dongascience.com/raccoon,https://kids.dongascience.com/zooguard/main,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJuGUp9ckjF55lQIveuVmSAnfXVnjzCN8N05Oa4-AWs/edit,https://img.dongascience.com/kids2016/zooguard/article.pdf,https://img.dongascience.com/kids2016/zooguard/article_new.pdf,,,"Dasol Lee, MyeongJu Lee, Jeong Kim, Kee Kyeon Cho, Won Jae Song, Jaeyeon Lee, Eun Young Choi, Haein Jeong","Dasol Lee is working as a science reporter at Donga Science.

This extraordinary natural disaster was caused by volcanic pumice originating in the Japan’s Ogasawara Islands, and some feared that they could disrupt important supply chains. Nikkei was the first newsroom to visualize the threat of pumice through an interactive map and an extensive timeline. Our data journalists, together with science writers and photographers, used satellite imagery, analytics from research institutes and social media posts to create this content. Up-to-date information and the projected trajectories of the pumice were quickly used by local governments and fisheries.","Volcanic pumice has garnered public attention since the eruption of submarine volcano in August 2021. Many photos of pumice were posted on social media, and companies tried to measure the potential impact pumice could have on their businesses. However, there was no place for them to find up-to-date information on the locations of the drifting stones. Our project made this possible. Nikkei visualized locations of pumice on a single map, along with a timeline of important events and social media posts of important moments. Our project became one of the most read pieces of visual content of Nikkei.  ","Nikkei visualized the locations of pumice through Python and GIS, using data on recent drifts and trajectory projections made by research institutes. Our data journalist also used Sentinel imageries from the European Space Agency to locate pumice flows. Our team incorporated these data into Mapbox to make an interactive experience. For example, our readers can choose a date on the interactive map to see where pumice is expected to drift on that day. They can check the latest information, as well as the past and future trajectories of pumice flows all in our single project.","The trajectories of pumice are influenced by unpredictable factors, such as wind and currents. Only limited amounts of pumice approached Tokyo and other important areas, and our readers’ interest has gradually shifted to measures to address pumice drifts, not just tracking their trajectories. Nikkei interviewed government officials about measures taken and quickly added them to the timeline while upgrading the visual content.","Our project made it possible for readers to recognize the situation of volcanic pumice at a glance through the interactive map and the timeline-style articles. Moreover, these contents were published within two weeks of the initial reports of massive pumice drifts, meaning the project quickly met readers’ demands.

To prioritize groups particularly at risk from the virus, the government introduced vaccination prioritization, known as the vaccination queue. This order of population groups, available vaccine doses and capacity determined how quickly people could get their shot. With SZ's vaccination bot, readers could find out when it was their turn in just a few steps.","The project was very well received, both by loyal SZ readers and newcomers, as it was the first tool to provide personalized answers to the question ""When is my turn?"". The article was shared a lot on social media and also attracted attention within the industry. ","Two factors go into predicting a vaccination schedule: The sizes of the various prioritization groups and the vaccination rate. Both factors can only be approximated or estimated. For this purpose, SZ consulted all information and current data on vaccination progress, vaccination readiness, vaccination capacities, planned vaccination dose deliveries and the number of residents per prioritization group in the federal states and asked state and municipal offices for further information. Current data was automatically scraped from state and local government offices. The bot is based on draw.io and R.","As with many other Corona topics, vaccination and prioritization data and regulations were subject to many changes. Data sources and formats changed, measures and vaccines were added, and vaccination groups were adjusted. The team had to respond to these changes on short notice to continue to provide the service. The project gave everyone their own personal glimmer of hope: it showed current progress with vaccinations in Germany and when it would be your turn. It explained vaccination prioritization and helped readers find themselves in the vaccination queue. The personal vaccination date was a proxy for vaccination progress in general. As more vaccines were added and vaccination capacity increased, for example by supplying primary care practices, the date also moved closer. Supply shortages, in turn, pushed the date back again.The Vaccination Bot thus told readers how well the vaccination campaign was going, using the readers themselves as an example.","This project is a good example of how to communicate a topic by breaking it down for the reader to see how it affects them personally.

United Kingdom,Carbon Brief,Small,Participant,,Analysis: The lack of diversity in climate-science research,06/10/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Chart, Map, Environment","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV","Publishing research is a crucial way for academics to share their findings with the scientific community and beyond. However, this Carbon Brief analysis reveals that women and researchers from the global south are underrepresented in the authorship of highly cited climate science research. As well as the data analysis, Carbon Brief interviewed a diverse range of experts at length to explore the reasons for the biases, their personal experiences, and their thoughts on next steps. Quotes from the experts are featured throughout the piece.","The article was picked up by a range of media outlets. BBC News and Forbes wrote articles on the analysis quoting its lead author, Ayesha Tandon, who also appeared on the BBC Global News podcast, Lancet podcast and Ticker News show for segments dedicated to the piece. Interest in the piece has been prolonged, and Ayesha is due to present the findings at a colloquia for Utrecht University later this year. The main finding of the analysis – that men from the global north are over-represented in highly-cited climate science research – is unsurprising to many. However, by leading with eye-catching numbers, the article opens the door to a more in-depth discussion into the systemic issues in academia. Importantly, the analysis emphasises the implications of the lack of diversity in climate science research – that the existing bank of knowledge around climate change and its impacts is skewed towards the interests of male authors from the global north, creating blind spots around the needs of some of the most vulnerable people to climate change.  Many scientists engaging with the article on Twitter empathised with it on a personal level, having faced many of the barriers discussed, and praised the effort made to amplify voices from under-represented groups.","Ayesha identified the most highly cited academic papers published over 2016-20 using Google Scholar Metrics data, and selected the climate science papers manually. She then recorded the gender and country of each of the (1,300+) authors in Excel. Ayesha decided to present gender as a binary “male” or “female” for ease of analysis, but acknowledges in the methodology this characterisation of gender is simplistic. To assign a gender to each of the authors was a difficult process. Ayesha used the pronouns in the author’s official “about” webpages where possible. However, when this was not possible, she determined their gender from images, by emailing the authors to ask, and with the API genderize.io – although she recognises that this method does not guarantee accuracy. The Carbon Brief digital team translated the results of the analysis into both spatial and graphical visualisations for optimal effect. They used the Highcharts JS library to produce three interactive charts showing the national, continental and gender distribution of authors. To present the data spatially, they computed Natural Earth boundary data in QGIS to build a choropleth map of the physical distribution of authors by country. They then exported this as an SVG, cleared and annotated in Adobe Illustrator. The visual components of the story were used to promote the analysis on Carbon Brief’s social media channels, including its 100,000 followers on Twitter.","The piece is in-part a response to the “Reuters Hot list”, which highlights the 1,000 “most influential” climate scientists – largely based on their publication record and social media presence. Scientists from the global south and women are vastly under-represented in the list, but the piece does not discuss the reasons for the imbalance. The Carbon Brief piece is framed around unpacking the reasons for the trends. The piece does not aim to diminish the achievements of scientists highlighted in the Reuters Hot List, but rather to highlight the systemic biases in academia that make it easier for some academics to succeed than others. The hardest part of the project was choosing which papers to analyse. Ayesha initially planned to use Altmetric rankings, which rank a paper’s “influence” through mentions in media and social media engagement. However, she eventually decided that using solely citations is a cleaner metric, which would provide more of a focus for the piece. To identify climate science papers, she first considered a tool developed by a colleague, which filters papers using keywords. However, it quickly became apparent that too many climate science papers would be excluded from the final list using this method. She ultimately decided to go through the google scholar citation rankings of relevant journals and manually select the climate science papers because, although this method was time consuming, it had the lowest margin for error.","This piece highlights that even “obvious” findings can be used to build an interesting data journalism story. The finding that women and countries in the global south are under-represented in the authorship of highly cited research is unsurprising to many, but forms a solid backbone for a discussion around the systemic issues in academia. The interviews conducted for this piece demonstrate that even when the drivers behind your data seem obvious, it is important to talk to people with different backgrounds to capture a range of opinions and lived experiences. Contrary to our expectations before beginning this project, every individual interviewed for this piece emphasised different issues – often raising points that we had not considered before, and brushing aside points that other experts highlighted as crucial. Getting a well-rounded view of the issue was a significant time commitment, and publishing the data analysis alone would have taken a fraction of the time. However, the insights gained from these interviews were invaluable additions to the piece, providing crucial context behind the data.",English,https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-the-lack-of-diversity-in-climate-science-research,,,,,,,,"Ayesha Tandon, Joe Goodman","Ayesha Tandon has been Carbon Brief's science journalist since November 2020.

United Kingdom,The Third Pole,Small,Participant,,Interactive: Unravelling air pollution in Asia,28/07/21,"Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Infographics, Video, Map, Environment, Health","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, OpenStreetMap","The project looks at the sources and impact of air pollution across South Asia, with a particular focus on public health, a sensitive transboundary issue in an area of frequent border tensions. Monthly PM 2.5 data - from US Air Now platform and IQAir - is used to visualise the spread and seasonal fluctuation of air pollution in major cities in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region from 2018 to 2020. The data analysis acts as a springboard to investigate the health impacts on the region's population and its causes. It includes video testimonies from people in the highest polluted cities.","Our work with public but previously unexplored datasets helps break the longstanding blame game that year after year sees countries pointing at each other when the air gets toxic. Instead, we prove that regional air quality trends are often driven by local sources of pollution. The project also helped raise awareness of the fact that much of the air pollution in the region was from local sources.It also sparked debate (mainly on social media) and pointed out possible future solutions, and generally stimulated an open debate on the issue. The project was published a few months ahead of the COP26 summit in Glasgow where air pollution and its public health impacts were discussed. A conversation ahead of the pivotal event was the perfect segue to amplying local issues ahead of the global summit, giving space to the concerns of the developing world breathing in the heavily polluted air.  ","We collected open source PM2.5 hourly data of 21 cities over the past three years. We used Microsoft Excel to clean the datasets and Dynamic Tables to calculate monthly averages from the hourly data. We then used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build an interactive page on the web. The base map was styled using Mapbox studio, and Mapbox GL JS (JavaScript library) was used to render the Mapbox onto the webpage, as well as to add points to the map and add filtering functionalities. The overall line charts, as well as the city-specific line chart showing air quality over time were built with D3, another JavaScript library. On the writing side we made a conscious attempt to balance male and female voices as well as to include voices from multiple countries. Our sources were based across India, Pakistan, Nepal and the United States and this was a result of a deliberate attempt to highlight local voices as well as global research.","The most difficult part was finding accurate data sources for air pollution in the region. While the datasets are made available by some countries' governments, many data points were missing. The solution came from the US Air Now platform, which places air quality monitors at US embassies in different cities. Another challenge was to clean it and export the data in a format that could be easily visualised. For this, we used Microsoft Excel dynamic tables, which helped extract monthly averages for each city from 2018 to 2020. In terms of development and design, a main challenge was to find an alternative way to display the countries without showing the borders and avoid controversy over many disputed borders across the region. Originally, the average air quality index was displayed as a choropleth map in the background, with each country being coloured based on the index. The best alternative way we found to display these values was to display them as circles, centred on the latitude / longitude centroid of each country. While writing the story we reached out to a team who had done a global study on the sources of air pollution and asked them for insights specific to the region given the absence of the region-specific study. The absence of data or the below par quality of it when present is always a major challenge of reporting on any developing country. This region also doesn’t maintain good public health records on deaths and the causes of death. This means attributing any mortality to air pollution is tricky and while we did mention that in the story, communicating this complex science in a way that is both accessible and nuanced was tricky.","Other journalists can use this project as an example of how to visualise air pollution, which can be a very abstract concept. The project can also inspire them to work on data journalism projects and encourage them to be inquisitive when data trends show realities that differ from commonly held perceptions.  The intersection of air pollution and public health is very visible and underreported. This project can also act as a guide to how this intersection can be covered in an engaging way. And finally, given the story is rooted in a developing region, it raised the key issue of the lack of communication between countries. This story can act as an example to other journalists on an example of effective cross border storytelling that focuses on a common problem. ",English,https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/pollution/interactive-unravelling-air-pollution-in-asia/,,,,,,,,"Disha Shetty, Julia Janicki, Marta Portocarrero, Lou Del Bello","Disha Shetty is a science journalist currently based in Pune, India.

United States,The Markup,Small,Participant,,Amazon's Advantage,14/10/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Business, Economy","AI/Machine learning, Personalisation, Scraping, D3.js, Json, CSV, Python","An analysis by The Markup of popular product searches revealed that despite Amazon’s repeated insistence—including to Congress—that it is a neutral marketplace, the online giant was placing products from its own brands above more-highly-rated and better-selling competitors on its website. Often, Amazon’s connection to the brands was not disclosed. We interviewed sellers who said that Amazon’s actions harmed their businesses. We also built a tool to highlight Amazon brand items for online shoppers in multiple countries.","Days after we published our first story, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee demanded answers from Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and reminded him that lying to Congress is a crime. A representative of the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority emailed The Markup the week after publication saying they'd read the investigation “with great interest,” as the findings are directly in line with its areas of inquiry. Our browser extension is helping more than 5,000 shoppers spot Amazon brands and exclusive products in the United States, France, Canada, Spain, India, Germany, Japan, and Mexico.","We tackled this algorithmic audit in multiple creative ways. First, to create a viable, defensible sample, we focused on popular searches. After various iterations, we hit on a combination of Amazon’s lists for sellers and search suggestions from online marketplaces’ autocomplete functions. Next, to identify Amazon brands (there is no existing list), we started with Amazon’s “our brands” filter, using the company’s definition: Amazon brand items and products from other brands that are exclusive to the site. But the filter is only available on some searches, and its results aren’t complete. So we also looked for disclosures of Amazon’s affiliation in product listings, built a list of proprietary electronics, and scoured trademark databases.  Once we’d collected the data and categorized the products, we used machine learning to analyze the results by building a model that determined which of several factors—including ratings and a proxy for sales—was most important in Amazon's placement of a product on top or in the second spot. The model revealed that being an Amazon brand was by far the most important.  We also noticed that the company failed to disclose many items as being from an Amazon brand. So we commissioned a national survey of 1,000 U.S. adults to see if they could identify Amazon’s top-selling brands and to ask what attributes they presume Amazon uses to pick top search results. Only 7 percent of respondents recognized Amazon’s best-selling brands, apart from Whole Foods and Amazon Basics, and some even missed those. Finally, we built a browser extension that is both a public service and experiential journalism. Brand Detector highlights Amazon products for shoppers in several countries. Because Amazon regularly changes its site, breaking the extension, we monitor changes to the site and update the software continually.","Beyond the typical challenges of sample selection and categorization, the hardest part of investigating Amazon’s search results was deciding how to analyze the data. We could see that Amazon had given itself a disproportionate share of the top results, but what was the appropriate amount? After consulting with statisticians and machine learning experts, we decided to take a modeling approach to analyze the correlation between each of the factors to which we had access and the outcome.  Determining what outcome to model was not obvious. We tried to predict the rank of a single product based on the number of reviews and stars. However, this prediction task omits competition among multiple products on the same page, which is exactly what we wanted to investigate. We needed to find a way to model the outcome for several products from the same search, and figure out which one Amazon placed higher.  Ultimately, we overcome this obstacle by transforming the data to capture comparisons between two different products in each row of data.  Then we had to decide which type of supervised machine learning algorithm to use to predict outcomes. Our dataset contained mixed-data types, meaning each row of data contained both continuous integers and Boolean values. This ruled out many tried-and-true models like linear regression or lasso but made a strong case for decision trees. To avoid overfitting, we used a random forest model, which uses hundreds of decision trees trained on random subsets of the data. Finally, to test the accuracy of our model, we conducted an ablation study, which involved training and evaluating the model with every possible permutation of variables. This allowed us to conclude that just knowing which product was an Amazon brand or exclusive drove the accuracy of our model.","One of the largest challenges technology journalists face in watchdogging these major platforms is an uneven balance of information. Unlike police, schools, or government bodies, these private companies are under no obligation to share data with the public. One solution is to use technology to try to create transparency where none exists. And that’s what we did in this project. We used a creative mix of public-facing information from the Amazon site, its metadata, some information made available to sellers, patent records, and even a survey to investigate the questions, Does Amazon place its brands first? Are buyers aware that they are being driven toward an Amazon brand? Often, we investigate companies’ use of machine learning, typically finding harms. But in this case, we used machine learning ourselves as a journalistic tool, allowing us to draw conclusions that are vital for the public to understand how this massive company is using its power to its benefit.  Journalists can also learn to use technology like browser extensions as a form of storytelling and a public service. This allows people to experience reporting outside of a news article during their everyday lives browsing the web, which we believe extends the reporting and is a modern iteration of the journalistic axiom “show, don’t tell.”",English,https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products,https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results,https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/when-amazon-takes-the-buy-box-it-doesnt-give-it-up,​​https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/18/citing-markup-investigation-lawmakers-demand-answers-from-amazon,https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/11/29/introducing-amazon-brand-detector,,,,"Leon Yin, Adrianne Jeffries, Evelyn Larrubia, Ben Tanen, Joel Eastwood, Gabriel Hongsdusit, Micha Gorelick, Jeff Crouse, Ritu Ghiya","Before joining The Markup as an investigative data journalist, Leon Yin was a research scientist at NYU’s Social Media and Political Participation Lab (now the Center for Social Media and Politics), a research affiliate at Data & Society’s Media Manipulation team, and a NASA software engineer.  Adrianne Jeffries writes stories examining the power platforms exert and exploring the consequences of automation.

To accomplish this goal we obtained data from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice on every inmate in the state and joined it with Census and election data. We conducted a (to our knowledge) first-of-its-kind analysis, by seeing what would happen if prisoners were counted not in the county they were incarcerated in, but where they were charged (the best proxy we had for their home address) . We also assessed the impact on the","Our analysis shows that if Texas were to not count prisoners at all in the areas where they are incarcerated, this would throw nearly three dozen House districts out of population boundaries, making them subject to court challenge. We also found that nearly 1 in 5 counties would lose population to more urban, liberal areas if prisoners were counted in their county of charge. These findings may prove influential in several ongoing lawsuits against the state alleging that they illegally gerrymandered districts, including one from a state prisoner seeking to be counted where he is originally from. Our analysis was praised by Texas' state demographer and by independent researchers examining the same issue and was featured by the Washington Post and in the Local Matters newsletter.","To conduct this analysis, we began with three data files: one from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice with each incarcerated person’s name, county of charge and the facility where they were housed on March 31, 2020; another from TDCJ showing the location of each prison; and a third from the Census Bureau containing the population of every county in 2020. These three files were joined together for analysis. To conduct the reallocation analysis, we wrote a script in Python to loop through every row of the joined data, adding one person to the county where the prisoner was charged and subtracting one person from the county where they were incarcerated, to generate final adjusted populations for every county in Texas. We then joined a fourth data table in Python showing county election results for 2020, obtained from the Texas Secretary of State’s office, to the combined data. The preprocessing for this data was done using Pivot Tables in Excel. To create our visualizations for the story, we obtained a file containing the total incarcerated population for every Census Tract in Texas from the Census Bureau and joined it to a shapefile of Census Tracts in QGIS. After joining, we exported this file and put it into Tableau for styling. The other visualizations were created using our in-house charting tool Chartwerk.  To calculate what would happen to the electoral maps if prisoners were not counted at all, we subtracted the total number of inmates from the state's population and then divided that by 150 (the number of House districts in Texas), to obtain a new ""ideal"" district size. We then calculated in Excel which districts would be more than 5% greater or less than 5% smaller than the new ideal district size.","The hardest part of this project was working around the limitations of the data that was available. Unfortunately, we weren't able to get the home addresses for the inmates in our dataset, so we had to use the closest proxy — the county where they were charged. This also made it impossible to assess what would happen in the state and legislative districts if prisoners were moved back to their home addresses. Towards the end of the project, we received data on how many prisoners were from each ZIP Code, but this too had problems. The first issue was that we only had the aggregations not ZIP Code for each of our nearly 140,000 prisoners. The second problem was that these ZIP codes were self-reported by the inmates themselves, meaning that there were hundreds of values missing. Despite these limitations, the jury should select this project because it allows fellow journalists, advocates and policymakers at the state and federal level to make data-driven decisions about how to address the issue of prison gerrymandering in their state.","We hope that fellow journalists use this project as a playbook to examine prison gerrymandering in their state. More of this reporting may pressure lawmakers and government officials to release more of this data, allowing the public to have greater insight into the issue.

United States,Bloomberg,Big,Shortlist,,The Chinese Companies Polluting the World More Than Entire Nations,25/10/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Business, Economy","QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R","China is the biggest unknown element in the fight against climate change. The world’s top polluter has more sway than any other country over whether the world succeeds at slowing the rise in global temperatures. Yet few companies in China publish data on their emissions, and those that do don’t say how they arrived at those figures.    Karoline Kan and Jin Wu spent months poring over corporate financial statements and sustainability reports to produce the first-ever emissions estimates of some of China’s biggest corporate polluters. The results were remarkable: some state-run companies emit as much as entire developed nations. ","The story was the first attempt to estimate how China’s emissions breakdown at the company level. What stood out was the huge role that the construction sector, including steel and cement firms, have in driving China’s pollution. These industries will have to deliver the bulk of reductions needed to achieve China’s climate goals, requiring a drastic shift in the economy so it no longer relies on property development and heavy industry as major growth drivers.    After laying out the scope of the problem, we produced one of the most detailed sectoral breakdowns of China’s greenhouse gases to show how China can tame its biggest emitters. This calculation required a whole different collection of datasets including multiple government statistics yearbooks, academic papers and industry reports. Interviews with experts and additional visual elements helped illustrate specific solutions that can be deployed.    The project garnered positive feedback from climate experts and other journalists, who called the research “stunning,” a “fantastic investigation,” “beautiful visualization and “important work.” The data added to debate heading into COP26 climate talks in Glasgow about what countries should do to cut their emissions. ","We worked with researchers from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air to come up with our own methodology in order to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from major corporate polluters in China. With help from the researchers, we decided what were the best published data out there that can help us reach best estimation.   Data was collected into Google sheets for smooth collaboration with the researchers. We used R for formatting and analyzing data as well as generating drafts for some of the charts, then later polished them in Illustrator and exported them with ai2html for better accessibility on the web.   To make invisible emissions visible, we created moving particles with HTML5 Canvas to help our audience better connect to the topic. In addition to that, for the top as well as the grid graphic comparing company emissions, we used a multi-layer visual treatment to add motion to static photo/graphics with ai2html and photoshop, making the style consistent throughout the piece.    The scrolly top was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. GSAP, a Javascript animation library was used to create the smooth transitions, visually guiding our audience into the more data-heavy part of the story.   For the maps showing expanding construction in China’s cities, we used QGIS to map the built-up areas in different time periods, exported them as transparent png, then overlaid on top of satellite images. ","The biggest challenge of the project was compiling the datasets from scratch,and figuring out how to drive home the scope of China’s true emissions through the visual elements.    Our goal was to collect enough data to be able to make a best-possible estimation of greenhouse gas emissions. Sources of pollution vary from industry to industry, requiring us to mine different base data and make independent calculations. The researchers we worked with reviewed academic papers, industry reports and government statistics to determine the best way to translate the data we could find (such as tons of steel used or number of cars produced) into their equivalent carbon footprints.    Once we had those numbers, we had to find a way to get across to readers just what they meant. We experimented with various ideas, eventually settling on using different equivalences, such as the emissions for countries, or barrels of oil and numbers of trees that have to be planted to absorb that CO2. ","When there’s an important story we want to tell but there’s no published ready-to-use data on it, a close collaboration between journalists and domain experts (in our case, the researchers from CREA) to design a specific “study” could bring all sorts of possibilities.   Most of the time, we work with data that already exists, which is also true when it comes to research data. As journalists, we constantly have ideas that we hope there’s data for, but we lack the expertise to either collect that data, or do meaningful analysis and calculations by combining different datasets. So it’s becoming increasingly effective for a group of journalists to bring an idea to domain experts, brainstorming what could be done.   Be cautious with companies’ claims on “low carbon”, “carbon neutrality” and “sustainability” as ESG has become an area where a lot of greenwashing is happening. Many companies are not serious about their ESG reports, and often nobody will hold them accountable for whatever they reveal or not reveal in their ESG reports. Be careful with company emission data, and always try to be clear what scopes are included. ",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-china-climate-change-biggest-carbon-polluters/,,,,,,,,"Jin Wu, Karoline Kan, Sharon Chen, Dan Murtaugh, Jane Pong","The journalists responsible for this story are reporters, editors and data journalists at Bloomberg News.",

While this analysis was the bedrock of our article, it also allowed us to produce a clear and comprehensive methodology. We used Google Earth Studio, ffmpeg, and Svelte to produce an introductory video which gave readers a clear geographic overview of the story.   The interactive map of the city was made using Mapbox and Svelte. To emphasize the physical environment of New York City, we created a custom Mapbox buildings layer using a rendered 3D model from OpenStreetMap. The rendering was made with QGIS and Blender.   Throughout the article, charts and diagrams were made with Illustrator, ai2html, Svelte and D3.","This story was based on an in-depth analysis of millions of property tax records as well as mastery of a complex set of laws, regulations, and financial structures. The story was partly about how convoluted these regulations can be. We wanted to guide readers to an understanding of our findings without overwhelming them with details along the way.   One of our biggest challenges was in deciding how much complexity to expose to our readers. How much did we need to explain to the reader about concepts like net operating income, coefficient of dispersion, price-related differential, comparison properties, and capitalization rates? We worked on several iterations of ""explainers"" around these topics, some of which were moved to our methodology (which was detailed enough to deserve its own page), or scrapped entirely.   In the end we tried to deliver a story that described a complicated regulatory framework, walked readers through a rather sophisticated analysis, and told the human side of the story, without overwhelming them.","Compelling and important stories lay buried in seemingly mundane corners of government. Often, these stories go unnoticed because of complexities inherent in the subject matter and the inordinate amount of time it takes to master them. Yet, as we’ve shown with property taxes, the effort to ferret out stories can expose how government policies and practices tilt the playing field to favor some and burden others. Our story about New York City’s deeply unfair and inaccurate property tax system shows the significance of thorough reporting and comprehensive data analysis. But it also highlights the importance of connecting major findings to real people and visualizing them in clear, sophisticated ways.

United States,"The Markup, Süddeutsche Zeitung (for link 6)",Small,Shortlist,,Citizen Browser,19/01/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Elections, Politics, Business, Health","AI/Machine learning, Personalisation, Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js","The Citizen Browser project is a flashlight inside the black box of Facebook's algorithms, allowing The Markup to monitor what content Facebook decides to amplify in people’s news feeds. In a year when Facebook is under unyielding scrutiny as whistleblowers come forward to unmask the realities of Facebook's intentions, Citizen Browser is an essential tool that delivers the ground truth and enables empirical research on platform accountability. It is one of the only windows the public has into the impact of Facebook's algorithms on its users. Our reporting series highlights Facebook’s failures to live up to its own promises. ","Following the publication of “Facebook Said It Would Stop Pushing Users to Join Partisan Political Groups. It Didn’t,” Sen. Ed Markey cited The Markup's work in a Jan. 26 letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg questioning the company's broken promises regarding the promotion of political groups to its users. Leaked documents reveal that Facebook scrambled to address the issues raised by The Markup's article the day it ran. Internal teams investigated the “leakage” of political groups into recommendations, and the issue was escalated to Zuckerberg himself. Employees identified several technical issues that may have contributed to political groups being recommended to users, and an employee declared the problem had been ""mitigated"" by Jan. 25, six days after the story ran. As recently as June, our data suggests that Facebook's algorithms have continued to recommend political groups to its users. Our report “Credit Card Ads Were Targeted by Age, Violating Facebook’s Anti-Discrimination Policy” caught congressional attention as well. After Facebook pledged to purge its site of the discriminatory financial services ads that The Markup uncovered in its research, U.S. senator Mazie Hirono cited The Markup's reporting in her letter to Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content and policy, calling the company's response ""evasive and inadequate.""  One of the companies referenced in this story, Hometap, used our research to prompt an audit of its ads with its ad agency. According to a statement from Hometap's head of marketing, Rachel Keohan, ""Following your outreach, we worked with our third-party digital agency to audit our ad campaigns, and determined that many of our Facebook advertisements were, in fact, still utilizing age ranges for targeting purposes. We’re in the process of updating all of our Facebook advertisements to no longer target audiences based on age.”","The Citizen Browser project is a pioneering investigation combining the infrastructure of national polling with modern data collection techniques. Our panel of users automatically shares data with us from their Facebook feeds, allowing us rare visibility into what content is pushed by Facebook's algorithms.  Citizen Browser is a standalone desktop application based on the open source Electron JavaScript framework. It's designed to run 24/7, remaining open in the background of the user's computer. The app performs Facebook captures one to three times daily, using custom software to talk to a Chrome browser using the Dev Tools Protocol.  Our panelists include more than 3,500 paid participants in the U.S. and 600 in Germany. The resulting dataset contains more than 20 million posts, 57 million recommended groups, and three million targeted advertisements. To ensure panelists' privacy, we built a data pipeline that automatically removes personally identifiable information (PII) from panelists' feeds before making their data available for analysis. Maintaining data quality and panelist privacy requires constant upkeep: As Facebook updates its software, we must monitor and update code as well.  The application, data-processing pipeline, and underlying cloud infrastructure were audited by third-party security research firm Trail of Bits.  Analyzing this vast dataset required keyword analysis, linear regressions, correlation analysis, classification, and ranking comparisons. We joined panelists' data with information they provided about their demographic and political affiliations.  We also built interactive tools for the public. In Split Screen, readers can see differences in news sources, hashtags, and group recommendations between groups of Citizen Browser panelists. In our Trending on Facebook Twitter bot, we provide daily updates of the content that appeared most often in the past 24 hours in our panel. This bot accompanies our report on how sensationalist, partisan posts are more popular in feeds than Facebook claims.","Attempting to independently monitor Facebook is a massive challenge. Many research scientists have tried and failed to overcome the technical and legal hurdles to providing oversight of the world’s largest social network. Facebook has a history of shutting down or dismissing attempts to monitor its platform. In 2019, the company made changes to obfuscate its code in a way that blocked ad collection efforts by ProPublica, Mozilla, and ad transparency group WhoTargetsMe. This summer, Facebook shut down the accounts of researchers working with the NYU Ad Observatory and then implemented new code that foiled automated data collection of posts—a technique researchers and journalists use to audit what’s happening on the platform on a large scale. We tackled these challenges in two ways. First, we built our system in a privacy-preserving manner that we hoped would blunt any legal argument from Facebook about our compromising its users’ privacy. We used an isolated browser profile on the panelists’ computers to store sensitive Facebook session information, and we built a data pipeline for redacting PII. We built our cloud infrastructure so that no unredacted data could be seen by a person. We had all our software audited by a security research firm to verify these measures. Secondly, we spend a lot of time adapting our software to the many changes in the tech platform’s software. Sometimes those changes happen when Facebook introduces a new feature, like the “flags” related to COVID-19 released this summer. The messages in these flags addressed the panelist by name, so we needed to update our redactors to strip that out. Other times—as when the platform modified accessibility attributes in its HTML to make it harder to rely on them to parse data from the page—it seems as if Facebook is updating its software to intentionally hinder our work.","The most significant takeaway from this project is the importance of integrating engineering and editorial in the newsroom. Unlike in most newsrooms, our engineers and reporters work together on the same team and report to the same investigative editors. That allows them to work hand in hand to peek behind the curtain of Facebook's algorithms. No one was willing to accept that those algorithms could forever remain opaque. We couldn't have told these stories without the technology, and we couldn't have built the tech without that shared mission. Relatedly, holding tech platforms accountable requires speaking tech fluently yourself. Not every reporter needs to be able to tell their C++ from their C#, but being willing to question assumptions, shake off a fear of numbers, and dive headfirst into data can go a long way toward walking the walk. We also hope other journalists recognize and emulate our prioritization of privacy. We were able to glean a tremendous amount of information from our panelists’ Facebook feeds all while honoring our promise to respect their privacy and never compromise their personal information. Yes, this required a bit of legwork to make possible, but we were willing to pay the ""privacy tax"" for a principle we hold so sacred. Finally: show your work. We publish everything on GitHub for two reasons. It enables other newsrooms to repurpose our data, slicing and dicing it for their own investigations and takeaways, and we hope they do. And we also believe in transparency: We hope other newsrooms follow suit with publishing methodologies to show their work, helping fight the ""fake news"" narrative that journalists face.",English,https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/19/facebook-said-it-would-stop-pushing-users-to-join-partisan-political-groups-it-didnt,https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/02/16/trumps-false-posts-were-treated-with-kid-gloves-by-facebook,https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/03/04/official-information-about-covid-19-is-reaching-fewer-black-people-on-facebook,https://themarkup.org/splitscreen,https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/11/18/facebook-isnt-telling-you-how-popular-right-wing-content-is-on-the-platform,https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/09/22/germanys-far-right-political-party-the-afd-is-dominating-facebook-this-election,https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/05/20/facebook-said-it-would-stop-recommending-anti-vaccine-groups-it-didnt,,"Surya Mattu, Angie Waller, Corin Faife, Julia Angwin, Rina Palta, Jeff Crouse, Ian Ardouin-Fumat, Simon Fondrie-Teitler, Jill Jaroff, Mago Torres, Leon Yin, Micha Gorelick, Sam Morris, Alfred Ng, Thomas Pullin, Jon Keegan, Colin Lecher, Dara Kerr, Sébastien Thibault, María Hergueta, The Project Twins, Gabriel Hongsdusit, Bratislav Milenković, Netograph, Simply Secure.","Citizen Browser is a full-year (and still ongoing) project led by Markup senior data engineer Surya Mattu with assistance from project manager Angie Waller, data reporter Corin Faife, and two dozen other staffers and contractors who contributed to its upkeep, analysis, and corresponding reporting.

United States,Bloomberg,Big,Participant,,An Unemployment System Built to Discriminate,19/11/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Map, Economy, Employment","Animation, D3.js, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js",An analysis of more than 2 million unemployment claims obtained through an open-records request to Georgia’s labor department found Black workers in the state who lost jobs during the pandemic were more likely than White ones to be denied unemployment benefits and suffered disproportionately when the state withdrew early from a temporary federal program.,"Bloomberg’s findings prompted state legislators to call for an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice. Competitors at the New York Times and Washington Post called it “important work.” It was widely cited also by experts on the U.S. unemployment system, some of whom have asked for access to Bloomberg’s data. While many news organizations documented problems during the pandemic with overloaded state unemployment systems, the work by Bloomberg was the first to identify racial disparities in the distribution of benefits. What happened in Georgia was emblematic not just of that state’s polarized politics but of a system born in the New Deal that to this day often discriminates against low-income workers.   ","The project was the product of old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting, beat expertise, and sophisticated data analysis and visualization. It started as a nationwide effort, in which Bloomberg reporters reached out to all 50 states and D.C., filing open-records requests when initial queries were ignored or rejected. The data used in the story was obtained through a request that Georgia officials were initially inclined to reject, as other states had. But Bloomberg reporters convinced state officials to agree to share anonymized data not usually released publicly. After many updates to correct errors and inconsistencies, the team analyzed millions of rows of data using the Python programming language. Our analysis – which identified disparities in denial rates and denial reasons across ethnic groups – was performed on both regular unemployment insurance and pandemic unemployment assistance data. These denial rates were mapped at the ZIP code level alongside Census and Bureau of Labor Statistics data on population and workforce demographics to confirm findings and identify reporting targets. No unique identifiers were available to link applicants to regular state unemployment with their application to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. The team devised logic which was abstracted into a continuous flow which approximated the volume of applicants in GA who ultimately received no benefits from any program. The team created a custom scrolling graphic using code to visualize and explain that flow as well as static graphics made with R and Adobe Illustrator. Maps made with code and Mapbox of rejection rates and the Atlanta Black population show the association between race and unemployment rejection. ","The most challenging part of the project was obtaining data not usually shared publicly by state labor agencies on the demographics of people who are rejected for unemployment benefits. The Bloomberg team initially set out to collect that data from all 50 states. Almost all of them rejected that request outright. Some shared high-level aggregate data. Others, like New York, to this day say they are continuing to process the request. It was only through persistent efforts that Bloomberg was able to secure the data from the Georgia labor department. Even after that data was obtained, many rounds of quality checks required going back to the Georgia data team, which conceded there was an error in their original query and produced a corrected data set. ","Even in a world rich in data the best stories often lie in the data sets public agencies are not sharing with their citizens. As journalists we have a responsibility to push local, state and federal government agencies to release more data and to fight for greater transparency.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-georgia-unemployment-bias/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-25/u-s-unemployment-at-least-9-million-americans-didn-t-receive-any-benefits?sref=2XhWEs2V,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-05/jobless-americans-are-stuck-in-backlog-nightmare-as-pandemic-benefits-expire?sref=tk7LD4D2,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-19/u-s-states-balk-at-providing-data-on-jobless-benefits-denials?sref=Glaueo8x,https://twitter.com/bencasselman/status/1461715354682638347?s=20,https://twitter.com/byHeatherLong/status/1461720597248069636?s=20,https://twitter.com/pelhamprog/status/1461698046442541060?s=20,,"Authors: Shawn Donnan, Reade Pickert and Madeline Campbell Graphics: Rachael Dottle Editors: Robert Friedman, David Ingold, Ana Monteiro and Mira Rojanasakul","The journalists responsible for this story are reporters, editors and data journalists at Bloomberg News.

United States,The Markup,Small,Participant,,Denied,25/08/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Map, Business, Economy","AI/Machine learning, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js","Discriminatory lending practices have been well-documented for decades. The response from the lending industry has been that apparent racial disparities would disappear if researchers and journalists had enough relevant data—while at the same time resisting its release. The Markup’s investigation “Denied” debunks the lenders’ argument. Even after accounting for financial characteristics that the industry said were key and had not been publicly available until now, including debt-to-income and combined loan-to-value ratios, we found that prospective borrowers of color are still denied mortgages at higher rates than similarly qualified White borrowers.","The Department of Justice, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced a new initiative in October to combat redlining practices. As part of the announcement, CFPB director Rohit Chopra cited The Markup’s findings and criticized the mortgage lenders’ response to it. The new multi-agency effort will increase government analyses of lending patterns with an eye toward fair lending, task state attorneys general with enforcing fair lending practices more stringently, and strengthen reporting pipelines between the Department of Justice and “financial regulatory agencies” to identify fair lending violations. The Department of Justice described the Combating Redlining Initiative as its “most aggressive” attempt to curb the practice. Weeks after we began inquiring about Fannie Mae’s and Freddie Mac's mortgage-approval algorithms and their potential disparate effects on people of color, Fannie announced it would start incorporating on-time rent payments in its software starting in mid-September. Freddie Mac followed suit two months after the story's publication. The two companies buy about half of all mortgages in the country, de facto setting the rules for the industry. Various legislators and regulators also took notice. Minnesota’s attorney general, Keith Ellison, said it’s become clear that lenders’ criteria and policies ""result in serious disparities in lending patterns,"" and if lenders don’t review their algorithms, they ""should not be surprised if they are investigated for violating state and federal laws, like the Fair Housing Act."" ","To test whether debt-to-income and combined loan-to-value ratios would eliminate racial and ethnic lending disparities, we used a statistical technique called a binary logistic regression. This type of regression allows us to assess and quantify the relationship between multiple independent variables against a single binary outcome—in this case, whether a lender approved or denied a mortgage application. By using a binary logistic regression, we were able to control for multiple independent variables, ensuring we compared the application outcomes of similarly qualified applicants. We started with nearly 18 million mortgage applications from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act dataset, known as HMDA data. We filtered for conventional, first-lien home purchase loans for one-to-four-unit properties where the person plans to live in the home they’re looking to buy. We excluded those loans that are purchased by other financial institutions and government-insured loans, like those insured by the Federal Housing Administration, for example. We also included various Census datasets in our analysis: the racial and ethnic demographics of all neighborhoods, the median property value for all counties, and the population size for all metropolitan areas in the country. Using these datasets, we built a regression model that consisted of 17 different variables. We judged the strength of our model using McFadden’s pseudo r-squared, using a cutoff of  0.1 to find valid results. We determined if a variable was statistically significant by assessing the p-values and making sure they were below 0.05. Lastly, we ran a series of collinearity tests to ensure that we were not using two independent variables that correlated with each other.  We detailed our approach—how we filtered the data and the variables we used—in a nearly 10,000-word methodology. We used Python and Jupyter Notebook to run our analyses and made our code publicly available on GitHub.","Statistics is both an art and a science, and there’s no straightforward regression equation to assess lending disparities.  We ran more than 150 regression equations before publication, filtering the data in different ways and including different variables in different forms to see if the disparities persisted regardless of the equation we used—and they did. Simultaneously, we were in conversation with various experts in fair lending laws, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, and statistics for feedback on our analysis, approach, and findings. All this work culminated in our extensive methodology, describing in detail every step and decision along the way, which was in turn reviewed by a panel of experts and sent to various mortgage industry groups for their feedback before publication. Our analysis produced national and regional results.  Finding human examples for the story was an enormous undertaking. The data does not include names or addresses, so investigative reporter Lauren Kirchner spent months emailing and calling advocates, realtors, and experts to talk to people of color who may have been wrongfully denied mortgages. One of the biggest problems she faced: When you’re denied by a computer, you don’t think you’ve been discriminated against.  In addition, we partnered with The Associated Press to give newsrooms across the country access to our story, data, and analysis before publication so they too could report on the issues in their coverage areas. We hosted a webinar in advance of publication, detailing the relevance of the story, translating the complex analysis into an easily digestible format, and explaining how to use the localized version of the findings. As a result, more than 160 newsrooms co-published our story.","Because we detail all our decisions and steps in our methodology section and make our code publicly available, other journalists can reproduce our analysis or build on it. Our investigation relies on the latest and most expansive version of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act dataset to date, more than 18 million records and nearly 100 columns, some of which had never been publicly available before. Reporters and researchers can use our methodology and code and apply it to other types of mortgages—government-insured loans, for instance—their local metropolitan areas, or lenders they may be interested in. They can also take away general ideas about how to audit algorithms to determine whether they produce race-neutral decisions. The inclusion of certain variables that may not seem tied to race can affect people differently, depending on their race or ethnicity. For example, income and assets are used to gauge risk, but the average White family has eight times the wealth as the average Black family, so Black families are going to be disproportionately harmed by an algorithm that makes decisions based on that factor.",English,https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms,https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2021/08/25/how-we-investigated-racial-disparities-in-federal-mortgage-data,https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/dozens-of-mortgage-lenders-showed-significant-disparities-here-are-the-worst,https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/12/09/legislators-regulators-call-for-additional-scrutiny-of-mortgage-lending-industry-after-markup-investigation-finds-disparities,https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/10/22/markup-investigation-cited-by-officials-in-announcing-new-mortgage-discrimination-enforcement,,,,"Emmanuel Martinez, Lauren Kirchner, Malena Carollo, Evelyn Larrubia, Ben Tanen","Emmanuel Martinez is a data reporter who uses data, statistics, and programming to tell stories about the disparities marginalized communities face.  Lauren Kirchner is an investigative reporter who writes about the intersection between government and technology and how the use of data in decisions affects us all, particularly the most vulnerable.

United States,Bloomberg,Big,Participant,,Unvaccinated Covid Patients Push Hospital Systems Past the Brink,15/12/21,"Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Animation, D3.js, Json, CSV, R, Node.js","Vaccination in the U.S. is often framed as an individual choice. Bloomberg used a huge government hospital dataset to show how places with low vaccination rates affect their more-vaccinated neighbors.    The team used local-level vaccine and hospital data to identify regions whose health systems had been strained by Covid. An analysis of thousands of hospitals put the spotlight on Kentucky, which had just been through a tragic surge of infections, hospitalizations and deaths.    The story used data analysis to target on-the-ground reporting and showed how the U.S.’s patches of vaccine vulnerability can overwhelm state-wide health networks.","Bloomberg’s data journalism and health team’s have spent the last year tracking how vaccines are being administered, and assessing their impact on the Covid-19 pandemic. While government datasets can give snapshots of what’s happening around the country, we took the data a step further to explore more complex relationships between vaccination rates, hospital utilization, health-system collapse and medical-staff stress and burnout.    What resulted was a meld of data journalism and personal storytelling that was read by almost a million people. Online, health workers expressed gratitude that the horrors they’d seen inside hospitals for the last two years were finally getting shared more broadly. The story also served as a warning for what other hospitals around the country were about to go through as a fall wave of cases expanded. ","Bloomberg used two large and challenging datasets: Daily county-level vaccination rates published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and weekly hospital utilization reports published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.    The goal was to try and identify counties that met two criteria: high vaccination rates compared to their neighbors, and hospitals that hit capacity after facilities filled up in surrounding, less-vaccinated counties.     To accomplish this, data for all 3,000+ U.S. counties was brought into R. A series of scripts was run to identify places that met those specific rules, and the team identified 25 counties for follow-up. The team began calling hospitals and public-health officials to get a clearer picture of what had happened on the ground in those places.    The analysis and follow-up led the team to Lexington, Kentucky. Lexington contains several large health systems and is highly vaccinated, but is surrounded by rural counties with low vaccination rates and more limited health care resources. More than 30 in-person and phone interviews confirmed the pattern: A wave of infections that started in less-vaccinated Appalachia swamped hospitals there, then spilled over and filled ICUs in Lexington, and then gridlocked the state’s health-care system.   To tell the story to readers, Bloomberg returned to the same datasets and built a visualization showing the fall 2021 outbreak’s rapid progress. Additional hospital data fed graphics showing how the wave of Covid had filled their beds and stretched staff past capacity.   The article used Svelte and D3.js to present an animated map of Covid-19 cases in Kentucky, as well as several charts showing how hospital bed usage changed over the course of several months of the outbreak. Exploratory charts were made in R with ggplot2 and adapted for the web.","Often data is used as a supporting component to an idea that’s already in progress. A source provides a tip and a reporter hunts down the data to confirm it. For this story, we did the opposite: We asked what would happen if you wrote a script to identify places most impacted by low-vaccination neighbors. We used that idea to narrow thousands of leads down to a handful of places we thought might have the most compelling stories to tell.    Throughout the U.S. Covid outbreak, other news organizations have told compelling stories about individual hospitals or doctors. Bloomberg’s effort was unique in that it treated the broader system as a story, using data to illustrate the complex and hard-to-see relationships that keep regional health systems running – and that can fail in times of pressure.    That data helped us precisely target our reporting on the ground. It identified hospitals such as Saint Claire in Morehead, Kentucky, which had been so overwhelmed by patients that one nurse told us about putting somebody in a body bag every day for two months. It led us to the University of Kentucky, which typically accepts more inbound patient transfers than any other hospital in the U.S. – but had to strictly limit those handoffs as the viral surge overwhelmed the state. Our on-the-ground reporting was made much more efficient, and much richer, by arriving with a deep understanding of how the fall wave of Covid had crashed into the state’s hospitals. ","The U.S. has expanded the amount of Covid-19 data available to the public over the last year, which is a welcome development. But many of the tools necessary to analyze the pandemic’s impact and to tell stories about it still have to be built from scratch.    Bloomberg’s teams have worked with Covid-19 data for more than a year, in large part through our widely-read vaccine tracker. By making Covid-19 data a story in and of itself, we created deep expertise inside the newsroom that helped us identify new questions and stories that other outlets hadn’t attempted.   It also helped us identify pitfalls. Much of the U.S.’s Covid-19 data is reported from state and local health departments and compiled by the federal government. That’s created significant potential for data errors that can mislead journalists. Bloomberg’s team was able to spot several of those issues – such as an apparent change in the definition of how some Kentucky hospitals were reporting capacity – and to keep that problem from showing up in the story.    Any journalist working with similar datasets should view building relationships with primary and secondary sources of such data as a core part of the job. Those sources – in states, county health departments, hospitals and the U.S. government – have been an invaluable source of tips, fact-checking and idea-testing. ",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-covid-surge-shows-overwhelming-cost-of-being-unvaccinated-america,https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/anag-cw7u,https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh,,,,,,"Drew Armstrong, writer; David Ingold, data and graphics; Paul Murray, data and graphics","Drew Armstrong is the senior editor for health care at Bloomberg News, where he has helped lead global coverage of the pandemic over the last two years.

This is actually the first time anyone has done this, which is striking because people have been paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for this technology for a decade.” Immediately after publication, Sen. Ron Wyden’s office asked the reporting team for a private briefing on the findings, often a first step to legislation or other action.","This investigation began when Gizmodo investigative data journalist Dhruv Mehrotra searched websites of law enforcement agencies using a tool he built and typed in “PredPol.” A page on the LAPD’s website linked to an unsecured server containing the motherload: millions of crime predictions PredPol delivered to dozens of law enforcement agencies across the country over years.  Dhruv downloaded the data, then partnered with The Markup’s Surya Mattu to analyze it. They converted more than eight million predictions stored on 42,000 individual files—small, red boxes drawn on street maps—into geolocation coordinates, and then joined them to demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau and public housing locations from HUD. And then the really hard work began: What methods would we use? What thresholds? What about errors in Census data? Or the fact that we can’t get demographic information for areas as small as the prediction boxes? Getting the disparate impact analysis right and bulletproofing it took months. We used Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks to build the data sets for analysis. We used Kepler.GL and Observable Notebooks to build interactive maps that visualized the prediction data. We carried out our analysis using R, relying on the R Targets package to build a deterministic data pipeline that could be easily audited. And we used R Markdown to build data sheets that contained the findings for individual jurisdictions as well as maps showing where the predictions occurred. We also created choropleth and grid density maps using mapping software, showing predictions in their geographical contexts, which was invaluable for reporting The team filed more than 140 public records requests with 43 agencies, requesting data about stops, arrests, and use-of-force incidents. Surya and Dhruv wrote custom software to determine which incidents occurred in prediction locations.","One huge problem was confirming the legitimacy of the data, since it came from unsecured cloud storage rather than an official source. That involved dogging dozens of police and sheriff’s departments and local officials, searching public contracts, and scouring media reports.  Connecting the findings to real-world actions by police on the street was hampered by the agencies, who almost universally refused to share data on how officers responded to the crime predictions. So we filed more than 140 public record requests for data on arrests, stops, and uses of force. Most departments denied our requests, but we collected, standardized and examined more than 600,000 arrests, stops, and uses of force from those who fulfilled our requests.  The reporting was particularly challenging during COVID-19 travel restrictions. Reporters called hundreds of arrestees and spoke to defense attorneys and prosecutors, and none were aware crime software may have been related to their cases. In many cities, advocates weren’t even aware that crime prediction software was being used at all. The team also interviewed cops, academics, policing experts, and local officials. They were eventually able to visit some communities affected by police departments’ use of PredPol.   The data analysis required a lot of prototyping and iteration. We used regressions to look for correlation between different predictions and arrests, we carried out an exposure analysis to determine who was most likely to be exposed to policing due to predictions, and we calculated the demographic composition of the different neighborhoods based on how many predictions they received. Each approach resulted in similar conclusions. To ensure the report's findings were bulletproof, we reached out to subject-matter experts on predictive policing and researchers from Stanford, Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, Oxford, and Human Rights Watch to review our methodology before publication.","First and foremost: Persistence pays. This data came not from a public records request—it would have been denied—but rather from unsecured cloud storage that an industrious reporter found by digging around. Sometimes the back door is the only door. Second, it shows the importance of reporting out the “why” behind the data findings. The data analysis revealed that the software targeted neighborhoods that were disproportionately inhabited by people of color and poor people. That’s a strong finding, yet those who believe algorithms are the cure to bias would question how this is possible. So we looked into it for them, finding a bevy of academic and government reports that most crime is not reported and that people of color and those living below the poverty line are more likely to file police reports when they’ve been victimized than White people or middle-class and rich people, who are more likely to handle the situation another way.   Lastly, transparency: We published an in-depth methodology showing precisely how we conducted our analysis and posted all of our data on GitHub, which allows anyone to download it and conduct their own research or reporting. As we in the media continue to battle a confused public’s contention that mainstream news is “fake” or biased, it’s never been more important to show your work, even your limitations. We do it every time at The Markup, and it’s heartening to see other newsrooms beginning to publish more robust methodologies as well.",English,https://themarkup.org/prediction-bias/2021/12/02/crime-prediction-software-promised-to-be-free-of-biases-new-data-shows-it-perpetuates-them,https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2021/12/02/how-we-determined-crime-prediction-software-disproportionately-targeted-low-income-black-and-latino-neighborhoods,,,,,,,"Aaron Sankin, Surya Mattu, Annie Gilbertson, Dhruv Mehrotra, Dell Cameron, Daniel Lempres, Josh Lash, Evelyn Larrubia, Andrew Couts, Angie Waller, Joel Eastwood","Aaron Sankin reports on how technology can be used to harm marginalized people.

India,The Hindu,Big,Participant,,The Hindu's coverage of excess deaths during the COVID19 pandemic in India,28/05/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Infographics, Health","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","I anchored a series of data-driven stories on assessing the ""excess deaths"" during the COVID19 pandemic in India. Using the Right to Information Act, web scraping and reporting tools, I along with other colleagues across several bureaus in the newspaper I work in, The Hindu, managed to extract data on d from the Civil Registration System (CRS) for nine States (provinces) and five cities. We used three models to estimate the ""excess deaths"" during the pandemic and went on to assess that excess deaths were close to six times the official count of COVID19 deaths for those States in the","There was widespread anecdotal reporting on a sudden increase in deaths across States in India during the second COVID19 beginning March 2021 in particular. Our reporting on excess deaths using the CRS data was valuable in placing the true picture of the devastation wreaked by the pandemic. The figures released by The Hindu in its ""excess deaths"" coverage were used for peer reviewed research by demographers, epidemiologists and public health experts. This also resulted in a public debate over the actual COVID19 death toll, that culminated in greater allocation for compensation for deaths by some States.  Our work was also useful in bringing together a more thorough understanding of the impact of the COVID19 pandemic as several publications used our base data to assess excess deaths in India. See for e.g. - https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates. Or this - https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm5154. This also clearly established that India was no exception (as had been argued by some during the early impact of the pandemic) in terms of how the pandemic affected lives and the high multiple of excess deaths in a country with some States having poor primary health care and infrastructure revealed that the impact was not different from other countries with similar socio-economic profiles (such as Latin America).  Our work was also vital as India's civil registration system on deaths is not uniformly maintained or publishes data in real time unlike countries in the developed world. By gleaning information State-by-State and city-by-city, we managed to pierce together a truer extent of the mortality during the pandemic that brought the mortality data in line with experiences elsewhere. See this summed up story for e.g. - https://www.thehindu.com/data/excess-deaths-during-the-pandemic-in-india-was-58-times-the-official-covid-19-death-toll/article36405310.ece","Gleaning data from the Civil Registration System required us to utilise several tools - 1) The use of the Right to Information Act to procure data from civic authorities and public health officials in governments of several States and cities (Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi among States/ Union Territories and Thiruvananthapuram and Chandigarh among cities). Some State officials were prompt in responding to these queries, some took their time. We also pierced together data for the capital region (Delhi) by filing separate RTI requests for each of the five municipal corporations within the region. 2) For some States such as Rajasthan, Haryana, West Bengal, Maharashtra and cities such as Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chennai, data on deaths and certificates were available on the web. For data that was available on State websites, we used web scraping techniques to scour data from the app by aggregating them through requests using python scripts. Some data such as those for Hyderabad and Rajasthan were available in Android apps. We used screenshot text grabbing software to download data and manually aggregated and fed them into spreadsheets. For Rajasthan's data, we used Android app simulations on the computer and used them to scrape data and aggregate them. 3) Data aggregated into spreadsheets were then parsed month-wise for the period April 2020 to May 2021 (the beginning of deaths due to COVID19 till the peak of the second COVID19 wave driven largely by the Delta variant in India). Using three models to estimate base mortality (average of previous five years, for the same months, for States that had a steady number of deaths, average of previous two years, for the same months and extrapolating death estimates using a linear increase), we calculated the excess deaths during the pandemic period by comparing the estimates with actual death","The hardest part of the project was sourcing the data. Civil Registration Systems in India vary in implementation across States - data in some States are fully digitised, in some, they are partially digitised and in others, not at all. Then there are variances in registering/reporting deaths to civic authorities with some States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh having low registration numbers. The use of the Right to Information Act was useful in States which were pro-active in sharing information and where the data was maintained well in digital formats. Where this was not so, we had to rely on web scraping techniques to parse available digital data and come with estimations for the overall data by looking at prior Civil Registration System reports released by the Registrar General of India which analysed the registration levels, delays in registration etc in each State. Web scraping was relatively easy to utilise when structured data in queryable form was available in States/ municipal corporation websites. In cases where this was available in apps, it required a more concerted effort and involved coding to write scrapers and to parse queries to download structured data.  We seek a recognition of this effort because of the exclusivity of the work (while other journalists/outlets also worked on excess deaths projects in two or three States each, The Hindu managed to produce excess deaths information from the highest number of States and cities), and the utilisation of various tools at the disposal for journalists - the Right to Information Act, web scraping and sources. The jury could also look at several published and pre-print papers on excess deaths estimations across several countries that have further utilised our work - https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm5154 , https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.30.21264376v1 , https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.04.21261604v2 for e.g.","Good journalism is always an outcome of collaborative efforts. To produce the stories on excess deaths - most of which are archived here - https://www.thehindu.com/specials/coronavirus-spike-in-excess-deaths-during-pandemic/article34876318.ece, we had to consult demographers and epidemiologists to understand the methodology of utilising the Civil Registration System and to calculate excess deaths. To source data, I had to work with reporters from several bureaus who helped in filing Right to Information Act (RTI) requests at respective municipal corporations and State health departments. Wherever these RTI requests were sourced by help from reporting colleagues, they were given joint bylines in the analyses on excess deaths for those States/ cities in the published version of the article. Data journalism is also a subset of investigative and analytical journalism. The knowledge on how to go about using the ""excess deaths"" methodology was provided by oped writers (demographers and public health specialists) for The Hindu (I happen to manage the opinion section in the paper). Without their guidance and nudging, the project woud not have been possible. Once we understood what we required to do for each State/ city and what we needed to process as data, we went about utilising the tools of data journalism to proceed with the project. In sum, it takes a village to come up with effective investigative stories in a newspaper and data journalism, sitting on the shoulders of expertise from publicly minded intellectuals and citizens in civil society, is most effective done that way. This is the take-away of our work, in my opinion. Data provides us a vital instrument in documenting the effects of a pandemic and to construct public health responses to it.

How much money are we talking about? Above 500 billions USD, more than three times Bill Gates' fortune. The amount and nature of the data collected required a systematization and a coding made from scratch to achieve our App. It is an unprecedented exercise in the region. More than 30 reporters, economists, web developers and designers participated in this transnational work supported by Pulitzer Center and","We share a selection of three impact examples: • Colombia: The investigation was taken up by traditional media in the country and marked the public agenda for several weeks. The findings were cited in Congress for the proposal of a bill that would mark the path of pension reform in the country. This is the second most visited investigation in our media partner Cuestión Pública’s history, with more than 35,000 unique users. Citizens banded together on Facebook to share complaints about companies that had been funded by their retirement funds. Different reputable Colombian economists wrote columns in the mainstream media about our findings, which were also disseminated by presidency candidates and widely debated by citizens in social media. • Peru: In a final interview with us, the pension manager's union representative stated that they were willing to publish and make transparent the fees paid (charged to retirement funds) to third-party foreign fund managers. The representative also accepted the possibility of having caps on the collection of said fees. After the publication: 1) the investment manager of one of the private pension administrators confirmed the same openness in a newspaper column (with the largest circulation in the country), 2) the pension regulator finally assured its commitment to publish the fees paid to third-party foreign fund managers, in the first quarter of 2022. • Mexico: A few days after publication, the president of the Mexican pension regulatory body (Consar) explained via Twitter why the entity opposed the publication of the pension investment data, as we revealed. His publication showed the lack of technical arguments to keep secret information that other countries publish periodically. Finally, the Institute of Transparency has legally defended the opening of the data, despite the fact that all the private pension administrators insist on not releasing it.","About the technical procedure. A total of 7,352,029 records (investment transaction information rows) were processed, and a unique list of companies or entities financed by pension funds was extracted from the local data of each country and each company or entity was assigned an ID, a number.  Each country's list went through a first cleaning carried out by one of the team members, and a second one carried out by a different member. The objectives were to validate: 1) the correct spelling of the name, 2) avoid repetitions, 3) identify name changes. The names were validated online with the public company records of each country, the annual reports of the companies and specialized portals such as Morningstar and Bloomberg. MySql was used to generate and organize a new database with the verified names of the issuers and the other variables extracted from the local databases. A third and last revision was done to this new database. Internal visualizations. Our team created a microsite for the exclusive use of reporters who are members of the project. Between 3 to 5 different viz per country were generated from the data. The design of each visualization was widely discussed based on its usefulness in answering key questions and finding or feeding previously identified stories. MySQL, PHP and JavaScript were the programs used as part of these visualizations. Ajax was used to make the calls to the server. Public visualizations. For the App on our regional website, these latest tools were also used, and the navigation route was designed for the user, who is asked to select only two variables: country and pension administrator. The objective was to get directly to the route of the money handled by their administrator. For investigators, we published this version that includes advanced visualizations: www.inversiones.adondevamipension.org/en.","The most challenging parts were the data collection and cleaning. Through FOI requests, we turned to the relevant institutions in the nine countries at the end of 2019. Uniformly, we asked for the compositions of the investment portfolios detailed by the pension administrator, name of the financed company, financial instrument, type of fund risk, and investment amount at the end of each month. In Mexico and Uruguay, detailed information on investments is considered confidential and we continue in extensive legal processes for accessing the information. In the Colombian case, it was necessary to resort to a second legal instance, while the first official reply was that the data was in ""reserve"", under the category of ""private information"" owned by the pension administrators. El Salvador's regulator provided very uneven data, only those corresponding to two years had a level of detail close to that requested, despite our insistence. And we officially collected complete data from the local pension regulators of Chile, Peru, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic.  However, the data cleaning stage was the hardest without a doubt. Before extracting the chosen variables from local data, manual coding was necessary in some cases. For example, in the Peruvian case, two of the variables (company name and the type of financial instrument purchased) were listed in the same column in all the spreadsheets. We manually coded (with 0 for companies and 1 for financial instruments) each row of each monthly spreadsheet of the 10-year period analyzed. Around 60,000 rows were codified, with three rounds of verification by different team members. These members were first trained in the financial technical subject to correctly differentiate the two variables with ease.This manual coding was done before the company name verification process described in the previous question.","We believe this project can be inspiring for other colleagues in different senses. They can start to dimension the power of pension funds in their countries and how they generate agents of local power. Additionally, this transnational project is based on a pension model that emerged in Chile and was exported to 8 other Latin American countries, and we believe that it can serve as a starting point to identify what other apparatuses of economic power have been replicated regionally. Through 'Where is my pension?’ project, colleagues can also train their ability to generate investigative questions about pension systems. For example: Which companies with a history of corruption have been financed? Which labor or environmental offenders? And as a next step, you can see how you can achieve a systematization of technical economic data from journalism, bringing financial specialists to this field as part of the team, and with whom you can question methodological proposals until you find the best one. On a more detailed level, colleagues can learn the criterias to request, clean, verify and organize pension fund investment data, and produce intuitive Apps where any citizen can follow the route of their money.  We are confident that the 7 million records processed are definitely an unfinished source of stories. Therefore, in addition to the App standard version designed for a very intuitive user experience, we designed a second version for investigative journalists and finance experts. This version (www.inversiones.adondevamipension.org/en) allows you to view the data in at least six different comparative ways (year by year, throughout the ten-year period, by beneficiary company, by pension administrator, by type of fund risk, etc.) , and hopefully it marks the starting point for further stories published.","English, Spanish",www.adondevamipension.org,www.adondevamipension.org/#inversiones,www.adondevamipension.org/investigaciones/metodologia/,www.adondevamipension.org/#investigaciones,www.adondevamipension.org/investigaciones/pensiones-como-la-ciudadania-financia-a-las-grandes-empresas-que-violan-la-ley/,www.adondevamipension.org/investigaciones/sabemos-lo-que-hiciste-con-nuestro-ahorro-pensional-el-pecado-original-de-las-afp/,www.adondevamipension.org/investigaciones/afp-las-millonarias-comisiones-fantasma-que-pagan-los-trabajadores/,,"Luisa García Tellez, Lilia Saúl Rodríguez, Eduardo Mota, Omar Bobadilla, Aldo Fuertes, Óscar Salazar, Daniela Guazo, Lucero Ascarza, Leslie Moreno, Leslie Rosas and other 30 members.","Project's directors Lilia Saúl is a data journalist with an emphasis on transparency and access to information.

Argentina,Chequeado,Small,Participant,,Vacunas en la Argentina,01/02/21,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Health","Scraping, Json, Google Sheets","Having started the vaccination campaign, the disinformation that circulated about the pandemic and vaccines was growing. In order to counter it, we elaborated a feature opening data to communicate more effectively and clear all the information regarding the vaccines, how many would be delivered, number of doses, their origin and regulatory aspects. It consisted in showing the main aspects of each vaccine in an infographical and agile way, with the possibility that any data visualization could be shared in social media. This work, developed in house, was implemented by other fact checkers in Bolivia, Ecuador, México and Paraguay.","It's almost a year since we published the feature “Vacunas en la Argentina”, a few weeks after the first dose arrived in our country, and the positive impact that we had is clear in two dimensions besides the millions of views in our website and social networks. Firstly, several media outlets got interested in republishing this development and the format of our original idea. In this sense, that was how colleagues like El Surti (from Paraguay), Verificado (from Mexico), Ecuador Chequea and Bolivia Verifica used in their sites the layout, design, backend and some of the information of the feature that was published by Chequeado.   In second place, there were many specialized journalists and users in social media who took advantage of this concise and updated information about the vaccines in Argentina. They tended to use it as a reference to clarify doubts and debunk disinformation. In regard to that, we include some complementary links to let you see some of the tweets that represent the reach of our actions.","All data and the infographics about how many doses were received in our country in relation to the amount that the state had been committed to are daily updated still nowadays. We were looking for a simple and flexible development and also thinking that it would probably be used by foreign organizations from other countries. This process is implemented thanks to a tool that was built in React.js by the team of developers in Chequeado through Google Sheets.   When we built a monitoring and visualization infrastructure there wasn’t complete open data, so we obtained the information through requests for access to public information on vaccine expiration dates and available stock. But in mid 2021, the Ministry of Health started to publish the information about the vaccination campaign, so we adapted to it to continue updating the dashboards.   Further, the feature about the vaccines had various data visualizations that updates day to day through the automatized intake built in house of the databases in regard with the vaccination in a disaggregated format.   We decided to monitor the open data and create that data visualizations taking into account many indicators that were not available neither in the monitoring of the Ministry of Health nor other native digital media from Argentina.    The fulfillment of the monitoring and data visualizations were only possible thanks to the opening of the database published by the Ministry of Health that we did and its daily and trustworthy update, because of that we were able to automate the download, the information processing and the visualization of data.","While working with extremely large amounts of information, the most challenging tasks we had to do were to find a proper way to update all the data daily, to define the information architecture, what should be included and what excluded to give sense to a diversity of vaccines and in different countries. The key was to develop a tool specifically built to provide solutions for the necessities of this project.   As a result of our labour in organizing, updating and presenting the vaccines’ information in infographics, we succeeded in encouraging the state to open the data about vaccination, motivating other journalists and media to use the pieces we created and reaching more people with reliable information.","The solution may not be always running an article to tell the events and answer “the five W”. This is one of the most relevant learning experiences that this project has demonstrated. Frequently, it might be the same or even more convenient to present the information in an infographic way instead of a traditional publication. The reason why other journalists can learn from this development is connected to the main purpose of the content, this means to design contents prioritizing a useful format to increase the times it will be shared on social media, because it allows journalists and media outlets to reach more people and diverse audiences with information which is verified and based on data.    The second lesson is how we can take advantage of collaborative work. It shouldn’t be an option, it must always be part of our projects even more when it’s about joining allies to combat disinformation and the infodemic.

Ecuador,"Tc Television, Connectas",Small,Participant,,Alina Manrique,10/12/21,"Database, Chart, Video, Audio, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","The most important focus of this project is the impunity in the murders that occur in Ecuador. The increase in murders, the lack of resources and the criminal records of the victims are variables to consider, since the Police say that they are ""settling accounts"" in a gang war, while the Prosecutor's Office says that people do not report, that there is a deficit of prosecutors and a lack of of technology. The proven result is that a small part of the murders end up being solved.","After this report, the Prosecutor's Office admitted that there was a deficit of prosecutors and the Police Commander, Tannya Varela, announced in January 2022 that they would send 200 more police officers to Guayaquil exclusively to investigate the crimes and thus not go unpunished. Personally, I believe that people also began to demand results on social media, remembering murders that have gone months without any progress.","I used CSV files, Google Sheets, and Excel, as well as Flourish to visualize the data. For the video I used Adobe Premiere and Youtube and for the audio interview I used Soundcloud. I crossed the databases of the Police with those of the Prosecutor's Office and the Judicial Council.","The new Government of Ecuador declared a state of emergency after the murder of an 11-year-old boy in an ice cream parlor, and that caused, as always, more operations with police and military in the streets. However, the problem of violence in this country also increases with impunity and the slow pace of justice. It was relatively simple to know the death toll, but it took three weeks to obtain data on the resolution of the cases in the Police and the Prosecutor's Office.","To challenge the official narrative. Every day we hear the government say that those who are killed were criminals, and that what is happening is a gang war.

United States,Surgo Ventures,Small,Participant,,Vaccine personas explainer,06/05/21,"Explainer, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Health","Animation, D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, R","This is an data-driven visual explainer detailing what “psychobehavioral segmentation”is and how we can use this approach to drive vaccine uptake. Rather than just looking at demographics, the approach divides people into segments based on their behaviors, motivations, and beliefs, which allows us to understand individual’s unique barriers and develop targeted solutions.","The explainer was able to distill a complex technique,commonly used in marketing but not as well known in public health, to something easily digestable to the public and decision makers. It was also extremely timely given that we applied the approach and provided suggested solutions at a time when vaccine uptake in the U.S. was plateauing.   Using our rich nationally representative ​survey​ of 2,747 U.S. adults, accompanied by our full reports, developed framework, and press releases, we were able to provide a resourceful package for local decision makers to easily apply such approach to their communities to increase vaccine uptake. We also collaborated with several health orgs to develop piolit programs within their priority groups by explaining the approach with the explainer, as well as using the vaccine personas quiz developed by our data science team. Finally, we also collaborated with the New York Time on an opinion piece in order to reach a wider audience.","For the narrative and design, we started by identifying the main message, which is that targeting only “demographics” isn’t enough. Instead, we need to target people’s barriers and beliefs. We then developed storyboards and brainstormed how to best visualize the data. We decided that  D3 animated circles can show how each segment, when created based on people’s barriers and beliefs,  includes at least some of every demographic. For the development, the base technologies we used include HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to build an interactive page on the web. Then we used Scrollama, a JavaScript library for scrollytelling, to set up the scroll-triggered steps. D3, a JavaScript library, was used to draw the data visualization and animation as the user scrolls.","Due to a tight timeline and the timeliness to have a professional and functional product to make the most impact on driving vaccine update, the narrative and design were being developed in parallel to the interactive development and implementation, and new survey data was coming in at the same time, so we had to learn to be both efficient and flexible in our collaboration of design (Daisy) and code (Julia), and make many iterations as we update new data and narrow down our core message.     Moreover, it was not very straightforward to develop this story across screen sizes and devices, since the way the visualization is set up requires more vertical space, and that was true especially for PCs with certain aspect ratios, so there had to be various workarounds so that not too many crashes happen between the data visuals and the key when the circles animates.","When developing projects that is incredibly timely (such as for COVID), it is especially imporatant to balanace impact and design/project goals. Of course we strive always for quality product, but if we want the design and graphics to be absolute perfect and iterate for a long time, then the project will loose it’s impact if it doesn’t come out to the world! Rather, identify your priorities and what you are willing to compromise at the beginning. For us, it was important to not comprimise the quality of the data analysis , reporting and our core message, but we opt for a more simple graphic design aesthetics so that it won’t take as much time and can be more adjustable. Even though it was still quite a challenge , we were able to create the explainer, from idea to sketch to final, in 4 weeks, with mainly just two people working on the project. ",English,https://surgoventures.org/vaccine-persona-explainer,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/18/opinion/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy.html,https://vaccinequiz.precisionforcovid.org/,https://surgoventures.squarespace.com/resource-library/us-general-population-covid-19-vaccine-uptake-survey-a-psychobehavioral-approach-to-promoting-covid-19-vaccine-uptake,https://surgoventures.org/resource-library/the-challenge-of-our-time-achieving-high-vaccination-coverage-during-the-covid-19-pandemic,https://surgoventures.org/resource-library/increasing-covid-19vaccine-uptake-a-four-step-framework-to-promote-access-acceptance-and-equity,,,"Daisy Chung, Julia Janicki, Sofia Braunstein, Grace Charles, Bethany Hardy, and Sema K.

United States,Access Atlas,Small,Shortlist,,Access Atlas,15/01/21,"Breaking news, Database, Women, Health, Human rights","Animation, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","As the first wave of  the COVID-19 pandemic peaked in the United States, abortion bans were instituted in many states under the guise of safeguarding public health. In response, Access Atlas was founded to track abortion bans and restritions set in place throughout the pandemic complemented by local narratives from abortion providers that illustrate their iniquitous impact. Since its inception, Access Atlas continues to develop resources to equip people with necessary and accessible information regarding the practical implications of confusing state laws and policies on abortion care. ","Our project provided a vital source of information for everyone from journalists to people seeking abortions during a time when reproductive healthcare was under attack, but not regularly covered in the news. While media outlets covered some high profile battles over abortion access, the availability of abortion and other reproductive healthcare was unclear in many parts of the country in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the months of April and May 2020, our website and maps were the only consistently updated source of this aggregated data.  Our maps and information provided timely, accurate, and accessible information to the public on three key questions: (1) Are abortion services available in my state during the pandemic? (2) What policy restrictions, if any, exist to limit access? (3) How were abortion services defined in initial COVID-19 executive orders and statements in my state? We designed these resources to assist both individuals looking for information about their healthcare options and researchers looking for accurate data. Beyond abortion availability, these resources identify the gap between technical laws and actual abortion accessibility in each state and arm viewers with clear information about statewide abortion restrictions designed to limit access.  When states began to loosen COVID-19 restrictions, we continued to track abortion availability and accessibility, recognizing the public confusion and uncertainty in this time period. By conducting interviews with abortion providers in 2021, we were able to identify the ways in which providers were uniquely impacted by state policies during this time and shared our findings through a series of blog posts to complement our collected data.  ","Access Atlas presents a set off three maps that capture and track the availability of abortion services in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. An excel database was developed using information collected from news articles, policy and legal documents and resources as well as clinic interviews. Analysis of this database yielded three important quantitative measures displayed within our maps that together communicate a digestible snapshot of abortion access in America.  The first map displays the COVID-19 Abortion Restriction Score. This score is a composite measure calculated according to the number of medically unnecessary laws enacted in each state whose restrictive impact on access to abortion care was amplified in the context of the pandemic. The two subsequent maps display how abortion was initially classified in executive orders implemented in March 2020 and the current status of abortion availability in each state. The website and maps were developped using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. While this research exposed the uneven impacts of state-level responses to the COVID-19 crisis on abortion access, our analysis of their implications lacked local narrative. In January 2021, we called clinics in the 11 states that classified abortion as non-essential in initial government orders to understand the impacts of the pandemic on individual clinics. We collected both quantitative and qualitative data on over ten clinic level variables and published our findings in a series blog post that explored areas of commonality and difference in clinic experiences. The goal of this blog series was to highlight the unique experiences that clinics and their clients have had to navigate and overcome throughout the COVID-19 crisis and the need to support abortion providers now more than ever.","The challenge of developing Access Atlas fell into two main categories: the practical issues associated with culling data, and the theoretical uncertainties we had about presenting the results. As recent graduates working without funding or institutional support, we spent our limited time outside our newly-remote first day jobs brainstorming how best to determine and relay critical information regarding abortion availability and access across the US. Despite hours spent reading news articles, executive orders, and government press statements, it remained unclear where people were able to access abortion services, and how people were expected to monitor changes in their availability.  Given the highly nonbinary nature of the question we were trying to answer, we devised a digestible ""COVID-19 abortion restriction score"" to characterize the various ways in which abortion availability could be threatened, then went state-by-state gathering data from a diverse range of trusted sources. This kept results simple but robust in that they contained a great deal of information: for example, this allowed us to capture where abortion was available, where surgical abortions were banned but telemedicine was available, or where restrictions limited the ability of providers to delegate tasks. We continued to review and update this information once the website launched, especially where accessibility was uncertain; we also brought two undergraduate research assistants onto our team.  More broadly speaking, we struggled to identify our audience. We wanted this information to be available to people seeking services themselves, but recognized that, given our resources and limited background in app development, it was more feasible to focus on the academic and research community. Ultimately, all of these decisions paid off, and we were able to collaborate with current students from Wellesley College, Vanderbilt University, and Georgetown University (see their writeup at: https://www.hyasforchoice.com/single-post/2020/05/31/access-atlas-mapping-abortion-restrictions-in-the-time-of-covid).","The landscape of abortion availability and access in the United States is unstable and changes according to political will or global pandemics. In addition, the intricacies of access to abortion services vary from state to state and new legislation and restrictions are often difficult to predict and track. Our team was challenged by the fickle nature of abortion access across the country. Sudden changes in accessibility required rapid updates to our website and this conflicted with our mission to provide our audience with accurate and well researched information.  Our team dealt with this conflict via transparency. We informed our audience about the limitations of our data, measurements and analysis as well as provided them with our sources. As journalists covering abortion in the United States our responsibility was not only to provide our audience with data and information, but also the necessary resources for to think critically about and evaluate the evidence we are presenting. This responsibility is often forgotten or intentionally ignored within journalism, especially journalism covering politically frought topics such as abortion. We also believe that our project demonstrates the importance of engaging youth in data reporting and journalism. Our project engaged university students as research assistants and collaborated with reproductive justice university groups on social media campaigns. We hope to continue to provide an inclusive platform which nurtures the energetic and visionary voices of youth and provides them with leadership opportunities.",English,http://access-atlas.org/,http://access-atlas.org/blog.html,,,,,,,"Charlotte Evans, Io Jones, Tara Gallagher","Charlotte Evans is an Master's student in Population Health Sciences at the University of Cambridge.

United States,"The California Newsroom, a collaboration of California public radio stations, NPR and CalMatters.",Big,Participant,,Dangerous Air,28/09/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Podcast/radio, Infographics, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Audio, Environment, Agriculture, Health","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, PostgreSQL, OpenStreetMap, Python","The scourge of climate change devastates the American West. More than 7.3 million acres burned in California's wildfires alone in the last two years. Vast amounts of soot foul the air, entering hearts and lungs. Yet the phenomenon is so new that peer reviewed science hasn't caught up. Our collaborative investigation, Dangerous Air, turned satellite images into data, allowing us to map the menace of growing smoke exposure down to ZIP codes. We linked that growth with rising hospitalizations and asthma prescriptions, and showed how California wildfires impact cities like Philadelphia and Washington D.C., thousands of miles away.","The impact of our Dangerous Air investigation has been immediate, far-reaching and is ongoing. Lawmakers in both Sacramento and Washington have called for hearings. A raft of legislation has been promised for the new year covering everything from additional worksite protections for farmworkers to the construction of federally-funded air shelters for “smoke refugees” who need a safe place to breathe. A story included in the supporting materials provides further details on the actions lawmakers are taking in response to Dangerous Air.  This resounding impact was built both on the strength of the reporting and the power of a collaborative model that serves as a force multiplier for the entire media ecosystem. Customized stories produced as part of this series ran on NPR’s national shows and in hard-hit rural communities that are most impacted by the blazes. We showed clearly why these stories mattered to particular communities and to the nation as a whole and what leaders at each level could be held accountable for. Before the investigation publication, we also convened a national webinar for local journalists, showing them how to report on the impact of California wildfire smoke drift over their region. The reporting tools we developed led to localized accounts of wildfire smoke risk produced by newsrooms in places as different as Seattle, St. Louis, Denver, and Columbus, Ohio, where the local NBC affiliate leveraged our data analysis to show how smoke from California wildfires was lowering crop yields in the Midwest, by stifling sunlight and preventing photosynthesis. In sum, Dangerous Air has changed the national conversation, demonstrating that California’s climate-induced wildfires are a threat not only to people of the Golden State, but the health of the entire nation.","Dangerous Air revealed how climate-change fueled wildfires in California impact the air people breathe across the U.S.  A detailed account of how we took images from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hazard Mapping System into localized data can be found in a “how we did it blog” in the supporting materials section.  We used Big Query and Python to clean this data and ready it for analysis and visualization. We divided the dataset into two periods, defining 2009 to 2013 as the “base period” when extreme fire events weren’t as frequent and 2016 to 2020 as the “current period” and calculated the average smoke days per ZIP code. We then quantified the change in smoke exposure over time and placed the ZIP codes within their city, county and state limits. We merged the resulting dataset with geospatial data to build an interactive choropleth map in Mapbox. In Excel, we analyzed the EPA’s regional data on PM 2.5 pollution over 20 years to provide context. We used Datawrapper to visualize our findings.  To determine the impact on health outcomes in California specifically, we analyzed Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development’s (OSHPD) data on every hospital discharge for respiratory and cardiovascular conditions between 2016 and 2019. With each hospital’s unique OSHPD ID, we geocoded the dataset and merged our smoke days dataset at ZIP code level. We aggregated this to regions delineated by the California Hospital Association for the best estimate of how patients may move across county borders. We also dug into Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services’ open data (available for 2013 to 2018) to analyze the growth of federally funded prescriptions for albuterol, a common asthma medication. We filtered for California’s data and refrained from further analysis without more specific temporal data. ","Our initial instinct to quantify the impact of wildfire smoke on air quality and human health was to use EPA data on PM 2.5 fine particulate matter. PM2.5 is one of the primary (and most dangerous) pollutants in wildfire smoke. These tiny bits of airborne ash are 30 times smaller than the width of a strand of human hair and can be inhaled deep into the lungs, and even enter the bloodstream.  However, we quickly learned that the EPA’s measurement of the PM2.5 pollutant would not isolate wildfire smoke as the cause for pollution, rendering our investigation ineffective and prone to errors. Further, the EPA monitors do not run every day in every zip code in the U.S. In fact, there were many counties without a single EPA monitor. The data as it existed did not allow us to expand our investigation to every part of the country, nor did it allow us to meaningfully localize our findings. We spent months talking to scientists at Harvard, UC Berkeley and other major research universities. Eventually, a consensus developed around an innovative approach – using satellite images taken by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to calculate “smoke days.”  However, this still posed challenges. These satellite images needed to be placed on ZIP codes and extracted for further analysis. Researchers at Stanford University helped us with this aspect. Even after extraction, the raw data was difficult to analyze given the intermittent nature of fires and smoke year-over-year.  In further consultation with experts, we decided to average the exposure over five years to get a better estimate of how average smoke exposure had grown over the years. We picked our “before” and “after periods” for comparison based on analysis of CalFire data on the prevalence of destructive wildfires in California.","Climate change is a challenge so great that coverage of it can sometimes provoke a feeling of powerlessness and nihilism in its audience. It doesn’t need to be this way. There are steps officials at every level can take to mitigate the wildfire threat climate change poses — saving lives and property, and enabling society to adjust to a world where hotter, drier conditions are the new normal.  Dangerous Air offers journalists a lesson on how to radically harness open government data to report on climate change. Our partnership with academic institutions like Stanford University, expands the possibilities of what journalists can do to deeply report and investigate with data. Using methodologies rooted in sound science and research that are then distilled to the public through radio and interactive digital media, this work is an example of making research and reporting on climate change more accessible and engaging for the general public. In merging different open datasets to form connections that previously went unreported, we offer journalists an opportunity to creatively think about how they can use their experience and grassroots knowledge of issues to expand on the possibilities of data analysis in a way that resonates meaningfully for local audiences.

China,Communication University of China,Small,Participant,,HOUSEWORK IS VALUABLE,01/08/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Chart, Video, Audio, Culture, Women, Economy","R, RStudio, Python","With the introduction of the three-child policy and the development of summer care services in China, housework and parenting have once again become the top spotin China. The work starts with the original interpretation of the tension of people's call and legal judgments, and then understands the prudence of judicial practice and eventually, calls for the joint efforts of social actors to care for the family.","The work had a certain influence in the school and society and won the third prize in the China Data Journalism Competition.The work has called for more people to recognize the value of domestic work, in which the concept of compensation for domestic work was further explained and discussed, triggering subsequent attention and reports on the concept in many media, providing reference value for the improvement and soundness of the law.","First, we used PYTHON to count a total of 6303 comments on Sina Weibo from February 23 to May 10, breaking through the anti-crawler system, overcoming the unstructured language problem in Chinese, and processing and reviewing many emotions and attitudes that are extremely difficult to identify.We found that the public's attitude is divided into two main parts, those who think that domestic work should be compensated and those who think that the amount of compensation for domestic work is too small and should be different from that of the domestic industry. Second, we counted a total of 317 documents related to ""domestic work"" in the case file website and analyzed the text, and found that the jurisprudence related to ""domestic work"" before the entry into force of the Civil Code was conservative in terms of compensation for domestic work. This is reflected in two aspects: first, a total of 15 judgments on the amount of compensation for household chores were proposed, but only one case of compensation for household chores was adopted, and the amount was 40,000 yuan; second, regarding the criteria for the amount of compensation, 15 instruments mentioned ""taking into account the marital status and economic situation of both parties"", which indicates that the judicial decision was based on the possibility of implementation. Third, we designed a news game in which readers can choose their own characters and experience the daily routines of the main characters, and upon completion of the tasks, the screen will display a neat and tidy home environment and the time spent on each chore. When you have less than 2 hours of free time in a 24-hour day, the cost of housework is obvious.","The difficulty of the work is mainly in the estimation of the data of domestic compensation and the integrated media filming. In terms of data estimation, the specific compensation for domestic work is not specifically defined in judicial and policy circles, so we used statistical modeling methods to make a more accurate scientific estimation, which is the first attempt in the coverage of related topics. After data mining and correlation analysis of the public and judicial attitudes, we came to the core conclusion of the work: in terms of the amount of compensation for domestic labor, the public takes the domestic service industry as the criterion, while judicial practice takes the criterion that ""The law cannot be enforced when everyone is an offender""  to ensure the validity and enforceability, and it is because of the difference between these two criteria that It is the difference between these two standards that creates the tension.  In terms of documentary photography, the attempt to capture intimate relationships within families was hampered by the public's concern for personal privacy and the Chinese culture's tradition of not revealing family shame. On the one hand, it took nearly a month of communication before the central character, Shen Yanping, accepted the documentary. On the other hand, the other three core characters were photographed with documentary photos to show their family status more visually, especially the different states when doing household chores, and to ensure an objective and calm sense of journalism by the usual means of ""photo report"".","Our originality and inspiration for journalists are the following 3 points. First, the dichotomous perspective of private family and public society is broken. Existing reports rarely dig deeper into the value of domestic work, rarely explain the contradiction between public opinion and justice, and do not divest the private perspective of domestic work. By providing a peninsular way to explore constructive data journalism, this work enables the news to play the value of reconciling public opinion and legal tensions, and makes data journalism more than a mere demonstration of phenomena, giving it an activist relevance. Second, it uses nonfiction writing methods for data journalism, balancing the storytelling of characters with the data-driven objectivity of traversal, balancing the sense of immersive experience with the sense of objective and dispassionate journalism. Finally, we experimented with a multimedia fusion of reporting techniques. We used a combination of documentary video and original hand-drawn cartoons to highlight the audio-visual impact in contrast to the text part. On the one hand, we shot a total of 9,364 seconds of video footage, which was finally edited into a 65-second pilot film, and created a melody that was inserted at the end of the pilot film and the webpage according to the narrative style and rhythm of the overall work, so that the ""household work"" could be seen and heard. On the other hand, the hand-drawn cartoons are used as intermediaries to link the storytelling of the interview characters and the universality of the issue. Each cartoon depicts a specific life situation while blurring the characters of the cartoons, thus presenting ""domestic work"" as a universal issue related to millions of Chinese families.","English, Chinese",https://ease010.github.io/,http://jiawubuchangcuc.xyz/,,,,,,,"Zhao Yuke, Li Ruoxi, Tian Yuchen, Ding Shengyu, Wang Yumeng, Jiang Lifei, Shi Yuxuan","Zhao Yuke, Data Editor, Senior student at Communication University of China.

United States,"Columbia Journalism Investigations, Center for Public Integrity",Small,Participant,,"Dangerous Heat, Unequal Consequences: How neighborhoods in Arizona and Florida became hotspots for sickening heat",19/01/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration","QGIS, RStudio","Our eight-month investigation revealed how today’s heat illnesses connect to decades-old discrimination. We focused on heat-related illnesses in Arizona and Florida, two states that have seen sharp spikes in summertime temperatures over the last century. With difficult-to-access federal data on emergency room visits and hospitalizations, we identified ZIP codes with higher rates of heat-related illnesses. In both states, those areas are low-income neighborhoods with a long history of racial segregation. Our reporting found that residents are neglected by local governments failing to robustly prepare for and mitigate the increasing heat. ","Our story had practical impacts on the communities we reported on.  Until we reached out to local health officials in Fort Pierce, Florida, they were unaware that heat was a particular issue in their community — even though the state health department tracks heat-related illness rates by ZIP code. After we presented our results, county health officials told us that they would work with the community to address the issue. Health department officials also took the problem to the city manager, whose spokesperson said the city would work to collect more data and create a program focused on heat-related illnesses to better protect the well-being of its citizens. Local grassroots organizations and nonprofits in the area also got back to us, saying they would include the subject in their projects and discussions.  In Arizona, Vitalyst Health Foundation said our story prompted them to propose a new 2022 budget category dedicated to climate change and urban heat. The piece was distributed to Covering Climate Now and the Florida Climate Reporting Network, and picked up or cited by local, national and even international publications. We also directly partnered with two local newspapers, sharing our analysis of heat-hospitalization records that journalists can rarely access; the Arizona Republic and the Orlando Sentinel both published their own pieces (here and here) in addition to ours. PreventionWeb, managed by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, shared and highlighted our story on its website. And we discussed our findings on a radio program at WUSF, the NPR station in Tampa, Florida, and KCSB News in Santa Barbara also covered our story.  Our data findings will also be included in a book entitled Weather and Climate Extremes in a Warming World: Changes, Causes, Consequences and Countermeasures, published by Elsevier and the Royal Meteorological Society.","What’s unique about the main analysis underlying this story is that it uses real patient data. Many of the heat-related health analyses in both the media and scientific literature use vulnerability indices to estimate where people are most at risk for heat illness. For example, such studies would use a combination of temperature and demographic data to identify areas where people are more likely to be at risk. We believe we are the first to do statewide analyses using real patient data to identify the ZIP codes where the rates of heat illness are actually highest.  The data had to be applied for, with details about methods to be used and the steps we would take to protect privacy. Our first attempt was not approved because we didn’t spell out the privacy-related efforts enough, but we adjusted our application and then received approval. We have only seen data from this agency used in one other journalistic story, and it was a different dataset with less privacy restrictions. So we didn’t have much precedent in terms of journalistic usage to guide us through the process.  We used RStudio, QGIS and SPSS for various steps of the project. The next answer details how we used them.","The data was challenging. First: It was mailed on CD-ROMS in a legacy format used by the U.S. government. The only instructions for opening the data were for paid software that we didn’t have access to. Just unzipping the files took four different software attempts. Eventually we used a free trial version of SPSS to open the files and then export as .asc and .loc files that we could use with RStudio to then parse the data and finally convert to more accessible datasets. The trial and error involved in this portion also took a lot of time because the files were several GBs each, so processing time was significant.    During the analysis in QGIS, we hit difficulties such as ZIP codes not matching up between the health dataset and our census data. The health dataset uses ZIP codes as reported by patients, some of which are P.O. boxes not found in census data. So we had to investigate those ZIP codes individually and combine them with a ZIP code that existed in our census data. There was also a privacy restriction that required at least two reporting hospitals for any grouping of data that we were making public. So we had to first determine how many reporting hospitals were represented in each ZIP code. For the Arizona Republic reporting, this privacy restriction was problematic for wanting to report numbers for one high-rate ZIP code in particular that only had one reporting hospital, so we had to find a way to creatively combine that ZIP code with another for reporting purposes, without sacrificing information quality.","Look for data that isn’t getting the attention it should – and explain how decisions made decades ago continue to impact people today. It’s that melding of past and present, data and individual experiences, that gave the story its power.   Another lesson that’s especially relevant to climate reporting: Remember that the people who are being impacted aren’t necessarily making the connection. Many residents we interviewed didn't recognize the dangers of the rising temperatures. Both in Florida and Arizona, we encountered many people who grew up in an already hot environment, didn't realize temperatures were worsening and weren't thinking about the health impacts of heat. In Florida, it was also very hard to get a response from public authorities and agencies about the problem because they hadn’t identified it as one. It took a lot of persistence and trying alternative ways to gain access to sources willing to comment.",English,https://publicintegrity.org/environment/hidden-epidemics/dangerous-heat-illness-unequal-consequences/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/14W1rJkCeq0ciE_fNCOgTlOgkRgIgIebs15puyPG4f8U/edit,,,,,,,"Sofia Moutinho, Elisabeth Gawthrop, Kristen Lombardi, Jamie Smith Hopkins",Sofia Moutinho was a reporting fellow at Columbia Journalism Investigations while reporting this project and is a freelance correspondent for Science magazine in Brazil.

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,Participant,,Lawless' loggers,24/11/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Environment","Animation, 3D modelling, QGIS, Json","As part of this investigation, we obtained high-resolution LiDAR digital elevation data which allowed us to investigate claims the state-run timber company VicForests was conducting widespread and systemic illegal logging in vital water catchments. The logging company was prohibited from logging slopes steeper than 30 degrees and experts had long suspected they had been breaching this law. Using the data, the team was able to show large areas of forest had been logged in breach of the law. The data was also used to show how the regulator, tasked with overseeing the logging company, had failed to investigate these claims.","By creating a 3D model of the digital elevation data, we were able to break down and guide our audience through our complex investigation into allegations of illegal logging. We created a high-resolution model as well as interactive elements to highlight the most egregious examples of potential illegal logging. This investigation revealed hundreds of hectares of areas over the slope limit had been logged in water catchments which supply drinking water to Melbourne, a city of more than 4 million people. The trees on the steep slopes are crucial for the quality of Melbourne’s water supply, as they help in the filtration of the water. Water experts told us it would be disastrous for the city if this process of natural filtration was undermined by illegal logging As a result of our investigation into VicForests, the Victorian government announced it would be enforcing tougher regulation of the logging company and they would face greater oversight by the regulator. The accusations revealed in the story were also referred to the state’s corruption watchdog. ","The project merged geospatial data, 3D modelling software and javascript animation libraries to not only present the data but to investigate the story as well. The researchers, who we worked with, used the terrain data to calculate a slope for every pixel in the digital elevation model. Using the open-source software QGIS, we analysed, styled and prepared this slope data. We then exported all of our geospatial data, (slope rasters, digital elevation model, vector boundary data) to create a 3D model of one of the worst affected regions in our investigation. The model was created in Blender using an add-on called BlenderGIS which allowed us to work with georeferenced rasters and vectors in a 3D animation project. We used Blender to build a sequence that stepped our audience through the research and investigation.  This tricky process involved overlaying satellite and vector data onto a highly detailed mesh of the terrain. We created an animation that tied in with the text of the story. This was rendered out as an image sequence and our next challenge was to then present this data in a way that did not lose any of the resolution of the highly detailed animation. To do this we used AirBNB’s javascript-based animation library, Lottie, which in combination with our scrollyteller component, allowed our readers to scrub through the animation while reading the corresponding text. The result was an immersive, mobile-friendly story that helped break down a complex investigation.","The work firstly relied on comparing several data sets. Obtaining those data sets took more than a year, some of which were obtained through Freedom of Information Laws. From a technical perspective, the toughest part of the project was merging geospatial data with 3D animation software. This required an in-depth understanding of Blender and how the add-on BlenderGIS worked. Even simple tasks like displaying boundaries of shapefiles or introducing opacity, required a significant learning curve to achieve nice results. More complex tasks like draping shapefiles over an intricate 3D mesh required significant amounts of trial and error using processing tools in QGIS and Blender render settings.","I think there are three main takeaways for other journalists:   That you can take complex, geospatial data and turn it into compelling investigations. While in this particular story the data was only uncovered because we used Freedom of Information laws, often these types of geospatial datasets are made public by governments. We have shown that this data can help hold powerful organisations to account.   Visual journalistic investigations like ours show how powerful well-thought out graphics can be in conveying the substance of a story. For us, the core of this story was the data so we put lots of time and effort into how we could present our findings in a way that would have the most impact. In this case the visuals helped make a complex data story more palatable for readers.   All of the software we used to create this project are open source, meaning anyone with the know-how could reproduce something similar to this project with little to no budget.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-24/hi-res-elevation-data-pinpoints-outlaw-logging-in-forests/100626640,,,,,,,,"Mark Doman, Michael Slezak, Katia Shatoba, Alex Palmer, Nathanael Scott","Mark Doman is a journalist, specialising in mapping, with the ABC's Digital Story Innovations team.

India,none,Small,Participant,,Wikipedia Abuse Checker,21/12/21,"Investigation, News application, Chart, Politics, Culture","Scraping, Json, Python","This project tries to find out which Wikipedia pages on India are abused the most. Abuse of Wikipedia pages is a growing problem in the country, with trolls changing the content of pages around political parties, film actors and cricket players. Sometimes it's distortion of facts on a page to fit a preferred narrative, other times it's outright vandalism as whole sections get deleted. The level of abuse is determined by checking more than 150,000 Wikipedia pages on India over the weekend, going through their edit histories, and then tweeting charts about it Monday morning.","To be honest, not much of an impact, I did this more as a personal project. (I talk about it in  a write-up on my website.) The hope is that people with an interest in online culture, media researchers, casual Wikipedia contributors etc. eventually come across it and find it useful. Access to the project's tweets should save them the effort of building a similar tool of their own. The project could even be used as some kind of barometer for online discontent around certain topics. So if specific pages are attracting unusual levels of abuse during the week, we get to know there's some fervour being whipped up around them online, potentially by bad actors.","Everything is automated here. In terms of technology, it's a python script driving it all. It's hosted on an Oracle Cloud instance, triggered by the cron scheduler every Friday night. The Wikipedia API is first queried for the edit histories of over 150K pages, this querying can take from 36 to even 50 hours sometimes. After the edit histories for the last two weeks are downloaded, the script then runs the analysis, figures out what the most abused pages are for that week, and creates CSVs of the top five pages. It then makes graphics based on those CSVs using the Plotly library, and then the script interacts with the Twitter API to tweet out the graphics Monday morning.","The hardest part of the project was probably trying to determine what the criterion of abuse should be. Figuring out the criterion of abuse, some kind of quantifiable metric, meant having to manually sift through a year's worth of edit history for a seed set of 25 pages. I then settled on using tags associated with each edit to build my metric, and checked which tags would be relevant for my purpose. I realised the number of edits that are reverted on a page can be used as an indicator of abuse, and that all such edits are tagged 'reverted', so ended up using that tag in particular. But why this project should be selected has little to do with how hard it may have been to build. It's more to do with its potential as a kind of warning system for the Indian public. That these are the Wikipedia pages online users are abusing, and if it's something outside the newscycle, it's likely something strange is going on here. (And if you happen to be a researcher or a journalist, you should look into it.) The ability to highlight strange patterns is what makes this project valuable.","For journalists, I guess a learning could be to be more welcoming of open-ended projects like this. Because this isn't a project that delivers time-sensitive insights. It's not a story that loses value a year from now, because the information it's based on is outdated. As long as there's a Wikipedia around, this project can keep generating insights every week. Also the fact that distribution is being done on twitter itself means that there is no website that people have to visit. It reaches people where they are, and if they're interested, they can follow the @abuse_checker account and get the updates in their timeline. There is no appointment here that people have to make mentally to visit a certain URL every week. (This isn't part of the answer, but didn't know where else to put it, it's kind of a declaration of interests. I know the two Indian judges well.

United Kingdom,Personal website,Small,Participant,,Investigation into how the pandemic has impacted the lives of those with Multiple Sclerosis,23/05/21,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Audio, Health","Animation, Google Sheets","The project tackles how the pandemic has impacted the lives and treatment of those with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Combining a plethora of multi-media elements and data journalism, the piece highlights the individual challenges MS patients have faced. The overriding focus was to show how the pandemic has worsened the quality of life. Also to raise important questions concerning the future of treatment for neurological disease. ","The main impact of the project was showing the individual hardship of MS patients to a wider audience. Furthermore, to reveal the real-life consequences of a pandemic that has impacted treatment in so many ways. Neurology is an area that does not gain much media traction, but the severity of how people's lives have changed was an important story to tell. The project also made full use of social media to raise awareness and tell the story differently. The long-form investigation and Twitter threads allowed me to reach a variety of audiences and tap into MS communities.","The data for MRI scans and neurological appointments were acquired through Freedom of Information requests. Requests were sent to hospitals in the North West after speaking to case studies about what aspects of their treatment had been lost. Once I had the data, it was cleaned and then analysed. The bulk of the analysis used formulas in Google Sheets. Part of the process was preparing the data for visualisation. I achieved this and used story-telling techniques such as scrollytelling. Charts animated and emphasised the significant drop in face-to-face appointments and scans. Focusing on simplicity, the combination of line and bar charts conveyed the data in a meaningful way.   Another aspect of this project was the application of audio. It incorporates the words of two case studies. As well, an embed from an MS expert while the interactive line chart is animating. This added a human element and provided the viewpoint of the very people affected by Covid-19. Coding languages of HTML, CSS and Javascript made this possible.  Overall, the project brings together a range of coding languages and the power of words to create a data-driven investigation.","One of the biggest challenges was revealing the people behind the numbers. This should always be the aim of data journalism but it's not easy to achieve. Once I had the data, I had to find case studies. I knew that scans had dropped, but could I get the people behind those data points into the piece? This meant going through charities to find MS patients. I conducted several interviews and told the story of those who had not seen their MS nurse or had an MRI scan in years. My main target was to humanise the data. I wanted to take the attention away from the data itself. So, while the charts and interaction helped tell the story, it was the words of the people that was the driving force. It was a challenging experience as a young journalist approaching a delicate topic.","Journalists can use the project as an example of how to shine a line on a single data point among thousands. It is possible to find the humans behind the numbers and that produces the purest form of data journalism. Choosing to display the data is also something to consider. The project brings together many different media elements. This was purposefully done to aid accessibility and storytelling. This is something other journalists can learn too.

From the pure and simple numbers, it's just one click to read our in-depth articles that combine latest data and dataviz/storytelling techniques in order to explain the bigger picture. Since the initial release of the project (a first version has been published in 2020, the current, largely extended one in august 2021) at least four other major German news sites have released similar projects. Many schools, organizations, and companies have asked to reuse our live-updating dashboard and diagrams from our explainer on global warming are currently being used in lectures on arctic cruises. I have received more comments and letters from readers than ever before in my career. Some by fierce climate change deniers, but many more from interested readers.","In many ways, this project would not be possible without climate scientists and their generosity to share their data and insights with us. Data for the arctic sea ice extend and the level of drought in Germany for example is automatically retrieved several times a day from open data sets. The data is then processed by scripts written in R, running on an in-house Jenkins server. The results of the data processing pipeline are passed on to the google cloud, where our front-end visualization loads them. The visualization itself is written in Javascript / Svelte.js. Some of the in-depth articles use live data as well. There are for example charts that show the energy production in Germany during the last week in 15-minutes intervals and charts and maps that show where temperatures have been exceptionally high recently (comparison for the given month). Those charts are built in Datawrapper and are updated via R and the DatawRappr-library. Finally, we use QGIS for geospatial analysis and mapping and AI2HTML to produce static, yet responsive graphics.  ","Gaining editorial support for an unusual project. What kind of content do we produce as journalists? At DER SPIEGEL it's normally articles, videos or podcasts that are of high current relevance. After publication we move on to the next article. This project is different. Its aim was to create a platform that's here to stay for years. This meant a lot more preparation than usual and it takes a lot of sustained effort to keep everything running. In order to do this, we needed the support up to t editors and the commitment that we would be willing to permanently showcase the project on our landing page. This meant many talks, presentations, and feedback loops, but proved fruitful in the end. Regarding the content it's not trivial to find indicators that do both: inform about climate change in a concise manner and offer information that changes on a daily basis. A good example is our metric on exceptionally high temperatures in Germany. Using raw data by the national weather service we continuously calculate the share of weather stations that have reported exceptionally high temperatures (for the given month) within the last week. By doing so, we address a time period everyone can relate with (current weather), provide a comparison to a time before climate change took hold (the resulting numbers often are astonishingly high and raise awareness to climate change regardless of the current season) and offer the results on a local level (map provided in the according background article) Keep everything up and running. The project has dependencies to six different external data sources. There's around a dozen scripts running 24/7 and roughly as many charts that must be maintained. Lastly, we need to make changes every time there are major advances in climate change (mostly in the IPCC","When dealing with topics that are of high relevance for a long period of time, it is well worth it to take a step back and rethink on how we report on the subject. This might lead to formats that are unusual, challenge the way we work but also inform our readers in a different, surprising but still fitting way. For the project described here, a different approach also meant different skill requirements. Beyond “ordinary reporting” we also needed technical expertise in data gathering and processing, IT infrastructure and front-end design that might not be available everywhere. If we don’t invest in this kind of resources and interdisciplinary teams, we ultimately miss out on opportunities how to best inform our audience. Finally, when reporting on climate change you’ll most likely face strong opposition from climate change deniers. We didn’t want to give them any leverage to doubt our coverage or the indicators we’re working with. To prevent this, we’ve published an extensive and completely transparent methodology article alongside with the project. In our choice for indicators and data sets we rated broad scientific consensus above everything. Wherever possible, we’ve tried to work with well approved, long-scale data instead of individual studies (even if they were newer). In many cases we ended up with the newest IPCC report as our primary source.",German,https://www.spiegel.de/thema/daten-zum-klimawandel/,https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/uno-klimakonferenz-so-steht-es-um-die-globale-erwaermung-a-659a6694-9b46-4559-a08e-7aa0dd5cb658,https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/energiewende-in-grafiken-so-viel-oekostrom-wird-aktuell-in-deutschland-produziert-a-bffe0447-1a49-4a90-95b3-d9cc3dcae0b1,https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/natur/klimwandel-in-deutschland-aussergewoehnlich-warm-oder-schon-normal-a-ea8f6054-0d75-4dd6-ab7e-bbc0410ded27,https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/so-werden-die-werte-aus-dem-klimabericht-berechnet-a-5dcc3a12-9149-436e-9a73-40d41dfff113,,,,"Patrick Stotz, Kurt Stukenberg, Team Graphic/Interactive","Patrick Stotz works as a data journalist for Der Spiegel since 2015.

United States,"Center for Public Integrity, The Associated Press, Univision",Small,Participant,,Cheated at Work,04/05/21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Business, Immigration, Economy, Employment","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","Economists estimate wage theft costs workers more than $15 billion a year. Journalists at the Center for Public Integrity investigated how effectively the Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division (WHD) combats this systemic problem. Our analysis of 15 years of data received from a Freedom of Information Act request, combined with other data and documents, and supplemented by extensive interviews of human sources, found: * Companies that repeatedly steal from employees are rarely fined extra; * USPS is one of the worst offenders; * the higher an industry's share of immgrant workers, the greater the rate of wage theft.","After our main USPS investigation piece was published, Fernández Campbell and Public Integrity received emails from more than 100 current and former USPS mail carriers, who shared their experiences with wage theft at the agency. Many of them believed they were the only ones struggling to get paid for all their work. Our story allowed them to realize that they were not alone. In addition, Public Integrity hosted a virtual Q&A with legal experts to help USPS workers and provide advice about the proper steps to take when they suspect or believe that they have been cheated out of pay.","Our primary source of data for this series was an export of the Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division’s Wage and Hour Investigative Support and Reporting Database (WHISARD). We got this data through a FOIA request. The data came as a series of dozens of different tables exported as csv files. We essentially reconstructed the WHISARD database (or a portion of it) by importing those csv files into an R environment and linking the tables. We also brought additional data into that database, primarily American Community Survey microdata on employment by nativity status and industry downloaded from IPUMS USA. Data used and sources:   15 years worth of Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division cases via the DoL WHD through a FOIA request.   American Community Survey microdata on employment by nativity status and industry via download from IPUMS USA.   10 years of private arbitration data leaked by a member of the National Association of Letter Carriers, one of the unions representing USPS employees whose wages were stolen.   In terms of specific tools and technologies, we primarily used R and RStudio for the data analysis. We also used Google Sheets to share our data with partners. We used Datawrapper to produce visualizations for the stories.","Analyzing this data presented some challenges. For the story focused on companies we classified as ""repeat offenders"" because of repeat violations, we had to determine a way to group employers. We settled on grouping by their employer identification number (EIN), commonly used for tax purposes. However, EINs were either missing or withheld in about one third of cases involving minimum wage or overtime violations. We thus excluded those cases from portions of the analysis that required identifying specific companies. We used the entire universe of cases to calculate other figures (such as the total money improperly withheld per year). We faced another challenge as we began working on the focused on immigrant workers: How to quantify the number of immigrant workers and specifically the industries that tend to cheat immigrant workers and get in trouble for that? This became a problem particularly because WHD does not document immigration status when conducting investigations. The best we could do to overcome this challenge was to determine if a correlation existed between the proportion of a given industry’s workforce that was foreign-born and the rate of wage theft in that industry. To conduct an analysis, we combined the WHD wage theft data with U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey microdata downloaded from IPUMS USA, which allowed us to calculate the proportion of foreign-born workers in each industry. The industry codes in the census data differed from the industry codes attached to the employers in the wage theft data so we had to use a crosswalk table to convert them. Once we had successfully crosswalked the codes, we were able to join the two sets of data together and calculate the rate of wage theft cases per 100,000 workers for 95 industries along with the proportion of each industry’s workforce that was foreign-born.","First, don't be satisfied with the information government agencies put up on their websites. The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division puts statistics up on their website that can be downloaded as spreadsheets. But missing were crucial details of each case such as employer name. That's why reporter Alexia Fernández Campbell ended up filing a FOIA request for the database that agency personnel actually use to track cases. We could not have produced a story nearly as in-depth otherwise. Likewise, always be thinking about alternative sources to get the information you need. Center reporters filed many FOIA requests with the Department of Labor for specific wage theft case narratives, but the agency redacted workers’ names for privacy reasons. So reporters ended up identifing victims of wage theft through other means: reaching out to labor centers in several states and contacting employment attorneys who represent workers in wage and hour lawsuits discovered in court records. Another example of that comes from our USPS story. Fernández Campbell was unable to get help from the national postal worker unions. Union leaders did not want to give Fernández Campbell arbitration records related to wage theft or put her in touch with employees. A spokesperson for the National Association of Letter Carriers tried to persuade Fernández Campbell that wage theft at USPS was not a problem worth writing about. To reach postal employees, Fernández Campbell posted messages on six online postal employee forums and messaged USPS mail carriers on LinkedIn. USPS workers who saw her messages on the postal forums reached out to her via email to set up interviews. Two of those mail carriers, who are union members, sent Fernández Campbell copies of private arbitration records.","English, Spanish",https://publicintegrity.org/topics/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/,https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/ripping-off-workers-with-no-consequences/,https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/usps-cheated-mail-carriers/,https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/garment-immigrant-workers-wage-theft/,https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/usps-mail-slowdowns-executive-bonuses-dejoy/,https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/wage-theft-what-you-should-know-minimum-overtime-pay/,https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/workers-rights/cheated-at-work/his-paycheck-bounced-it-got-worse-from-there/,,"Alexia Fernández Campbell, Susan Ferriss, Joe Yerardi, Jamie Smith Hopkins, Mc Nelly Torres, Jennifer LaFleur","Alexia Fernández Campbell is a senior reporter at Public Integrity.

It also reveals that the cause of this spreading is not only industrial waste, but the industrial extraction of water, which accelerates the liberation of geological elements in unmonitored wells. The tool allows for the creation of a poster for the population to know and share which monitoring","The investigation prompted the national Congress, at the Comission of Hydraulic Resources, to contact us in order to have a meeting. The meeting is programmed with the president of this Comission is scheduled to happen on January 18th. Prior to that, the investigation reached nation-wide TV stations and dozens of local papers, which used the arsenic and fluoride map we built , and the poster maker tools in our investigation to make their own local news reporting in Querétaro, Mazatlán and Baja California Sur. Columnists in several newspapers took the investigation to demand the Congress to make the prevention of disease (due to the wide spread of arsenic and fluoride in the water, and the lack of monitoring of industrial extraction and an epidemiological program to prevent disease) to be a priority for the 2022 legislative agenda.","We used statistical analysis and R programming to extract, clean and analyze data and compare each of the samples to the international limits, which are more strict to México's, and also to the national limits, and to calculate ratios and main Mexican states affected. We also used geospatial tools such as Qgis to perform a spatial analysis which we showed specialistas, who confirmed that the most affected areas are above volcanic ground, and hence point to the disturbance of underground water flows as the main source of this arsenic and fluoride, in addition to inustrial mining waste, among other industrial practices. We also used React programming to make an interactive database where each reader can select a state and a municipality and automatically get a downloadable sign with the number of monitoring wells with high levels of either of the substances. In addition, we offer a map of each well visualized according to the level of arsenic and fluoride in different layers, and a table to look up specific years, states or municipalities. Finally, we delivered the tools with the story of a territory defender in one of the most affected areas in Baja California Sur, Mexico, and reported on the potential solutions to this crisis.","The major challenge of this investigation was to translate the massive database of 122000 records to something the people could action on, this was accomplished by the creation of a dynamic customizable poster, where the readers can select their state and municipality and know the wells that have risky contents of arsenic and or fluoride. There were several other challenges during this investigation. The first one was to understand the diversity of norms that rule water quality in Mexico and their relationship to international standards, but also under what circumstances there is impact on health. The result was to reveal that Mexico's quality underground water are twice as permisive as they are in the US and Europe and lead us to select the international health risk guidelines as the basis for the analysis of risk of each sample. The second challenge was the analysis itself, data cleansing in a database of thousands of municipalities in the 32 Mexican States is always cumbersome, as the names of the wells, towns and states was not uniform throughout the 8 years of data analyzed. Another hard part of this project was in the reporting aspects to track how the water with arsenic related to people actually drinking it, which we found is the case in the featured area, La Paz, Baja California Sur, where more than 300 hundred people were tested thanks to an academic study in the area. From theres, we linked the data to the human story of the defense of this area against big industry.    ","This story's coverage was national in Mexico, and we got deeper with on ground stories in the most affected place, Baja California Sur, but reporters from the states of Querétaro and Sinaloa have already contacted us with questions about the local affectations.

Using Chinese stock market data, primary market financing data and personal wealth data in the past 5 years, we attempted to capture the changes of innovation and investment in China. The project used industry as the main criteria, supplemented by relevant companies and entrepreneurs, trying to provide a perspective on the current macroeconomic situation.","Since its release on December 30, the work has effectively reached more than 50 million people on all mainstream platforms, and the relative topics have been read by more than 3 million people and widely exposed on the Chinese internet. On the first day of launch, the website was read by nearly 50,000 people, and the audience was enthusiastic to participate, with about 30,000 times sharing. The data is still growing. Readers praised the work as ""valuable"" and ""the best review of the year"", which has provided the audience with highly innovative insights and industry thinking. Many readers praised the release of ""Rebalance - China Innovation Yearbook 2021"" as a ""premium reading experience"".","When dealing with the capital market data, as it involves 5 years of changes, and the data covers all industries, we used Python as the main data cleaning and analysis tool. As for the personal wealth data, we used both Python and Microsoft Excel to see the data trends and changes. The graphics and chart design were finished using Adobe Illustration. In terms of the product, the design uses small balls with changing shapes to reflect the main concept of ""Rebalancing"". Considering the user experience, we used light and shadow to create a pseudo-3D effect for the small balls in case of slowing the loading speed. The whole mobile interactive website is written in JavaScript, mainly using zepto.js, scrollama.js, anime.js libraries. Technically, the animation effect of the balls on the cover encountered a big problem in adapting to different cell phone models, and finally switched to CSS to achieve better dynamic effects.","The main difficulty with this project was finding the focus and the balance between comprehensiveness and the focus. We wanted to find the direction of changes in Chinese innovation and investment through market data. Since capital markets change rapidly, to find out long-term trends by sector and reflect annual changes in 2021, we needed to find the right metrics and then make purposeful trade-offs. Ultimately, we identified the core indicator as the average monthly total market capitalization of each industry, which could be a way to reflect annual changes and hedge against the impact of mid-year variability at the same time. In terms of stock market data, we looked primarily at the market capitalization changes in the three years before and after the emergence of the COVID-19 epidemic; in terms of primary market financing, we looked at changes in financing volume by sector over the last five years; and in terms of individual wealth, we looked at where the leaders in 2021 were in the past and how they related to the industries they were in. These data relationships may be very redundant in textual terms, but data visualization provides readers with a clearer picture of how the landscape has changed.","We were trying to provide a formal exploration for presenting the capital market, the changing economic environment, and the direction of innovation. Through a dual line of narrative thread, we presented a more ambitious narration in a relatively short space. In terms of presenting annual changes, it is difficult for readers to figure out the trends by just looking at the data or even line charts because so many industries and companies were involved.

While the coalition talks were still ongoing and it was unclear which parties would form the government, we already published an interactive with all MPs and details about them. The added value of this interactive is created by comparing population statistics with the politicians: Does the number of women, academics, people from Eastern Germany, the countryside or with immigration history represent German society? How does the income of an MP compare with average citizens?","Our election coverage was the backbone of 18 different newspapers’ reporting (all part of Funke media group). This project presenting the new MPs and allowing to compare the parliament’s formation with Germany’s population was the only one to present it with comparison figures for different professions, academic degrees, income, gender, migration background and age while other outlets sticked to presenting the composition of the new parliament or comparing it only with previous MPs in Germany’s history. Users spent a remarkable more than 6 minutes on the page on average to explore the details in depth.","The project is based on a state-of-the-art frontend technology stack using React with next.js, emotion for CSS-in-js, and d3 for data visualization. Some graphics were created manually with Adobe Suite’s Illustrator and embedded as svg’s. As most of our users visited the page on their smartphones, we paid extra attention to a good user experience on small devices with low bandwidth. Additionally, we split parts of the story into smaller pieces that could be embedded on other sites using iframes. The dataset on MPs was created by a variety of sources using R: the official data published by the Federal Election office was matched with a larger database of all candidates that we had created prior to the elections, allowing us to research and categorize professions and additional data accordingly. Some data (e.g. on migration background) was collected from third parties and matched manually, as well.","One overall challenge with this project was the tight turnaround, as the interest in the new parliament peaks shortly after the results are published, but this coincides with the publication of all election results and with a team of merely 4 people responsible for more than 8 individual election dashboards with multiple modules each, capacities were limited and called for a smart preparation. The set-up of the project was therefore installed weeks before the elections already, and this is when we created a database of MP candidates and sorted them by likelihood of being elected in order to prioritize which details to manually research.  We created a script that took the free-text input from people’s candidacy files and grouped them into consistent professions. In the case of previous MPs we manually researched their professional background from before they entered parliamentary politics in order to represent different educational backgrounds and trends. We also created databases of census data, disaggregated by age, gender and federal state so users could compare the representation of a specific demographic among the MPs to the size of that same group in the general population.  A lot of work went into the behind-the-scenes of this application, which presents the parliament with a new twist - based on the democratic root concept of “representing the people”.","This project shows that it is worthwhile to supplement and expand official election data with your own research. We were able to add value and information by doing the cumbersome labor of manually collecting figures and data for comparison or processing the published data further.  The resulting visualizations were a very intuitive and easy-to-understand format. The combination of an interactive that allows for user exploration as well as a linear story picking out and presenting the most interesting findings caters to different kinds of users preferences at the same time. Most importantly, the project focussed on one of the main questions of electoral politics that - due to a lack of easily accessible data - is seldomly centered in post-election coverage: how the voting population is represented, not only in terms of political affiliation but also based on other demographics and collective experiences.",German,https://interaktiv.waz.de/neuer-bundestag-2021-bundestagswahl-abgeordnete-parlament/,,,,,,,,"Ida Flik, André Pätzold, Benja Zehr","Funke Mediengruppe's Interactive team develops interactive applications and data-driven stories for the Group's various news brands.

Mexico,Animal Politico,Small,Participant,,Missing women in Mexico,05/07/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Women, Crime, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Microsoft Power BI","The investigation discovered that there is a different pattern between de disappearance of women and men in Mexico: missing women are mainly teenagers between 12 and 17 years old. In addition, while men are more disappeared in states with drug trafficking problems, for women is worst in places with high rates of gender-based violence, so they have sometimes been victims of femicide but their body has not been found. Although most of the teenagers are found few days after they went missing, experts think that they fled a violent situation or were hooked by human traffickers.","More than 11,000 people read the story in the website, six radio newscasts in different states ask me for interviews to talk about the investigation, a few columnist tooked up the report in their articles. And in the same week of the publication, the National Search Commission give a press conference in which it recognized that the current government has not been able to stop the disappearance of women. On the other hand, when I made public the database that I built, other journalists contacted me to tell me that they were using it in their own investigations, including a website specialized in the subject.  ","The first step in this project was to use a gender perspective in the theme of missing people in Mexico; it’s been a big problem for 15 years but the approach was always in general terms. I took a data base with more than 100,000 registers of disappearance and I did a first revision in Excel, but the definitive tool was Power BI. With it, it was not only easy to filter information to find the patterns, but to graph it to make the problem evident. I created graphs in which any user can explore very detailed information on their own: the specific ages of the missing persons, the data by states, make comparisons between men and women, and if the persons were found alive, dead, or are still missing. After having the data, I went to a state where there is a government alert for the disappearance of women, I looked for stories of missing girls and with a vision of solutions journalism, I exposed how a cell to search people works.  ","The first database I worked with was out of date and in the analysis I discovered errors such as reports of people over 150 years old, states with information gaps in some year, many reports that did not have the age or gender of the person. The new government updated the database but did not make it public in open data format, but created a website for specific information inquiries. For more than six months I requested the database through the transparency mechanism that we have in Mexico, but the National Search Commission refused with different arguments that I always challenged (and I continue to fight to get it). So finally I had to do almost 1,000 downloads of separate data tables to build a new database; each time, I had to manually set the search parameters and enter a captcha, which did not allow to automate the process. After publishing the report, we made public the database that I built in open format.","That a huge pile of data can offer evidence of specific patterns of a problem in different populations such as men and women, adults or childs...

Peru,Salud Con Lupa,Small,Participant,,The Other Peru: the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the indigenous people,21/09/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, News application, Infographics, Chart, Map, Audio, Culture, Health, Human rights","Scraping, D3.js, Three.js, QGIS, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, PostgreSQL, OpenStreetMap, Python","Dozens of requests for access to public information made by Salud con lupa and the crossing of databases to get close to the situation of Amazonian indigenous peoples during the pandemic. The Other Peru shows the role that data analysis can play in detailed coverage. It demonstrates how transparency mechanisms can help close the information gaps that otherwise increase the isolation suffered by native populations. The project built and analyzed databases containing information from various reliable sources to prepare a detailed study of the situation facing native communities in five regions: Loreto, San Martín, Madre de Dios, Ucayali, and Amazonas.              ","Tracking the impact of COVID-19 in Peru's remote Amazonian jungle with spotty cell phone service is a daunting task. But this is precisely what Salud con lupa did for months to make happen. Through on-the-ground reporting, our team found that the number of fresh graves in just one community was three times higher than the number of deaths the government reported for the entire region. Little access to diagnostic tests, a spike in dengue fever, and a reliance on natural medicine were among the reasons why many COVID-19 deaths in the Peruvian Amazonia were left out of the official count. The most important reason, however, was ""a lack of care."" With maps, statistical graphics, and other visual representations, the platform provides information in various layers to help understand the conditions in which native communities are living as the pandemic unfolds. This is a topic mostly overlooked by mainstream media, whose coverage tends to have an urban bias. At the first layer, the user can find—by district—the location of population centers inhabited by various Amazon ethnic groups. This mapped data also shows the location of the several types of health facilities in each district and also demographic, economic, and social data, such as access to basic services. At the second layer, the platform enables the user to monitor the progress of the Covid-19 vaccination program in the native populations of each district. At the third level, the platform displays the incidence of endemic infectious diseases in the Peruvian Amazon: Zika, dengue, malaria, and chikungunya. Finally, it breaks down, by indigenous group and by district, the number of infections and deaths due to the pandemic.","Using OpenRefine software, we cleaned up and standardized the databases, a process that allowed us to save the information in CSV format files and facilitated its tabulation. We relied on the JupyterLab platform—which uses the Python programming language—to process, analyze, and cross check the databases, making it possible to create sequences to automate information processing. We also used the Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib libraries together with JupyterLab for data exploration and transformation. As is well known, a library is a set of scripts or lines of code that can be reused to perform specific tasks. This sequence of actions enabled us to develop the web platform described above, in which the user can navigate on a map and explore views of the different databases through filters by department, province, and district. We prepared these visualizations using JavaScript libraries, such as D3.js and Leaflet.js. The result is a powerful and user-friendly tool that contributes to understanding the challenges indigenous communities face today in the Peruvian Amazon. This tool—which we have made public together with various other pieces of journalism—is a contribution not only to the work of researchers interested in this often-forgotten sector of the country’s population but, above all, to decision-making. With more precise and complete information, better public policies are possible.              ","The principal challenge was the requests for information from authorities. We were constantly told that there is no data, or only partial data. Most of our attempts were successful if we contrasted the official numbers with the information that people gathered in the field. That information was collected by interviewing many indigenous leaders as a more reliable source.  Peru’s Minister of Health reported 148 indigenous deaths during the pandemic. This is false. We know that more than 400 died, just in one community. It shows you that they are not taking care of the data, and they are not documenting what happened. It was our goal to tell the real story. The work began with data collection, made difficult by a lack of information from official sources because health authorities failed to build ethnic identity into their approach. Although they later corrected this oversight, they did not then make the associated data freely available to the public. On vaccination, the ministry reported that it did not have a specific plan for indigenous communities. On other matters, it suggested consulting regional authorities or reviewing the so-called Indigenous Situation Room. The latter is a web platform created by the national government that presents snapshots of Covid-19 case and death numbers by community, ethnic group, and geographic district. However, the platform did not allow downloading of raw data, and, in some instances, gave incomplete information. We sent requests for access to information to the regional health directorates (DIRESA). We attempted to contact the directorates of the five priority regions, but once again encountered barriers. The government of Amazonas did take our request but then never responded. Only two regions provided information on the number of infections and deaths, having had the foresight to record ethnic groups in their Covid-19 statistics.","The project exemplifies a challenge in countries like Peru and other Latin American countries that don't have enough data. In this case, we focused on indigenous communities in the Amazon. Since the pandemic started in Peru, we didn't have data about this population because of a lack of access to health services. Nobody was registering COVID-19 deaths. That's why officials and the Minister of Health didn’t provide an official report about the impact of the disease in this part of the country.  We worked to gather data and to try to understand what happened. To do so, we had to make a lot of requests for information. We built a database on our landing page and featured stories to provide an explanation. It’s important to investigate because indigenous communities are at risk if we don't identify who died. It's very important to work with requests for public information or public data. But if that falls short, try to build the story with other sources. Many people may read the project because they find little substance [when they] search for information.  You know that there is a reality in front of you, but it is not revealed by official numbers. Some reporters will say that if we don't have official data, we don't have the story, but it's not true. There are alternative ways to approach the problem and paint an accurate picture of the situation.",Spanish,https://saludconlupa.com/series/el-otro-peru/,https://saludconlupa.com/series/el-otro-peru/datos/,https://saludconlupa.com/series/el-otro-peru/how-the-other-peru-was-built/,,,,,,"Fabiola Torres, Jason Martínez, Iván Herrera, Renzo Gómez, Lucero Ascarza, Rosa Laura, Melina Ccoillo, José Luis Huacles, Rocío Romero, Dora Liz León","Fabiola Torres is an investigative journalist from Perú.

Belgium,De Tijd,Small,Participant,,De Tijd,10/05/21,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Map, Business, Economy","Animation, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, Node.js","The Belgian part of the North Sea is an intensely used marine area. Although limited in size, it intersects with one of the most intensive merchant shipping routes in the world. Besides shipping, this zone is used for a wide and increasing variety of human activities such as offshore wind energy and aquaculture. The limited space and difficult topology creates a daunting environment that demands creativity and drives innovation through spatial planning. We created an interactive animation that explains how it all comes together.","The aim of the project was to support a series of articles highlighting different innovations that are currently happening on the Belgian North sea. First of all the article served as a visual visual entry point that pulled readers in by revealing the fascinating complexity of the North Sea. We offered readers a thorough explainer about the different activities, layers and stakeholders that re intertwined with each other. And additionally the article served as a central hub that linked back to all the individual articles that further discussed the individual projects.  The webpage was well received and became the spearhead of the whole series. More than 24.000 viewers read the article for an average time of almost 6 minutes, thus becoming one of our best and longest read articles of 2021. We received a lot of positive feedback within and - most importantly - outside the maritime world. The scientists we collaborated with were happy that their domain was well documented while common readers were fascinated by the wide span of topics the article highlighted.","The data was collected from different scientifical institutes and knowledge centers that focus on maritime research. Most of them offered data as shapefiles (.shp). In order to make all those coherent we wrote a R script that converted all files to the same projection and trimmed the bounding box. For this we made use of the SF and SP libraries in R. We then exported the shapefiles as transparent png’s that could be easily layered in a scrollytelling format.  For the animation of the ships we used the same workflow. Wrangling the data in R, exporting the individual timeframes as png’s and finetuning the animation in after effects. We chose this option over a direct output of the animation with gganimate because it gave us more control to finetune the animation.  For the interactive page we made use of a scrollytelling template we developed during the past couple of years. It allows us to put more focus on the graphics and animations while we know that the platform will be stable.","The two biggest challenges in this project were the search of an enthusing storyboard and a compelling openings visual.  During the proces we became sincerely interested in the vast amount of projects and innovations happening in our little part of the North Sea. We wanted to transmit our own excitement about these projects to our audience without making an shallow information brochure. Therefore, we worked hard on different versions of the storyboard in order the find the right combinations of visuals and story-elements before we set for the final structure. Simultaneously we made a lot of iterations of the openings visual because we really wanted to show how the North Sea is teeming with venturous projects and innovations.  I think this project should be selected because focusses on an original subject. Maritime land use is gaining economical, ecological and scientific importance and our project is one of the first - both national and international -  to reveal the underlying complexity of it.","- Although (data)journalism needs to be a critical filter to society, I've also found it interesting to highlight certain aspects of society in which people, companies and governments do excel. Positive journalism shouldn't be naïve but is a valid choice of subject.   - We invested a lot of time iterating on the storyboard. Basically using a two-column excel, for text and image. Making different versions of a story in different tabs is an interesting way to examine how a story works best.  - We wanted to focus on content and thourough research but meanwhile we always considered the openingsvisual key to make the project work.

Peru,Salud Con Lupa,Small,Participant,,Vaccinegate: The Power Connections,10/05/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Corruption, Health","Scraping, D3.js, JQuery, Json, Google Sheets, CSV","Salud Con Lupa uncovered the details of what we call ""vaccine diplomacy,"" in which Sinopharm sent 3,200 ""courtesy doses"" to Peru in parallel with the official doses for its phase-3 clinical trial there. Many of these extra doses were made available to people who would be involved with awarding contracts of any approved vaccine for the public. 487 influential people — including the President Martín Vizcarra, leaders in academia and business executives— were secretly vaccinated while clinical trials were still underway. We built a database and published an in-depth interactive platform that revealed the relationships between all the secret beneficiaries.","The distribution of secret doses was kept from the public until February 2021, when former president Martín Vizcarra — removed by Peru’s Congress in 2020 — acknowledged he had received the shot while still in office. The scandal spread far and wide, and more than 40 government officials resigned as a result. Through extensive data analysis and 23 published articles, the investigation showed the relationships among the power players involved, and how they benefited their own families and colleagues. Salud Con Lupa was able to identify the researchers in charge of the Sinopharm trial, whose relatives received early access to doses of the very vaccine they were evaluating. Some even received three doses. The team also tracked $800,000 in donations from Sinopharm to the Peruvian Health Ministry while the country was still negotiating the purchase of the vaccines. Peru’s Sinopharm vaccine trial, the largest in Latin America, is now surrounded by allegations of irregularities. The country’s anti-corruption office has launched an investigation that concluded in October 2021. While the probe moves ahead, the Peruvian Congress has already concluded that there was a “strategy” to benefit Sinopharm. It also banned former president Vizcarra from holding public office for 10 years.","When Peru’s Congress received access to the list of the group of people secretly vaccinated, Salud con Lupa delved deeper. Many names sounded familiar to our journalists. We recognized the names of “the Peruvian scientific elite,” in addition to politicians and academics from top universities in the country. The journalists set out to identify the ministers, government officials, researchers, diplomats, and businesspeople involved. Two months later, we published the results of their investigation, titled “Vaccinegate”, and mapped the whole network of those who received the secret shots. The team, focused on finding the connections between the 487 secret beneficiaries, built a database that tracked the connections between those people, and layered the results in a visualization that connected each of the institutions, timelines, and individuals in the scandal.  The original list of people secretly vaccinated showed information such as the name, vaccination site, number of doses and their relationship to the clinical trial. Several persons involved were registered as study personnel, but in fact they were some relatives or friends of those responsible for the clinical trial or of public officials who had no participation in the trial. The Salud Con Lupa team created a new public list with the real connections in a Spreadsheet and completed information on these people with various sources: LinkedIn, CV, interviews, request of public information, etc. With this dataset, it was possible to build a network of nodes (characters and institutions) and links (work relationships, friends, family, etc.) that is presented in an interactive visualization built with D3.js. This tool allows you to explore the cases of reported conflicts of interest and the characters involved in each of these.","As a public health platform, Salud Con Lupa held an advantage in covering the Vaccinegate scandal, as its reporters had an existing understanding of the trials and had loyal health sources to turn to. However, it also faced a unique dilemma: many of those trusted sources, including doctors and university professors, were on the list of 487 secret vaccine recipients, and party to the scandal. We decided to publish all the names and the connections that we found as a sign of transparency with our audience. Salud Con Lupa didn’t just report on Vaccinegate as the political scandal it was. The outlet also focused on the bioethical questions their investigation raised. This is a corruption case, and it’s also a scientific scandal that reveals the conflicts of interest that were normalized by many scientific community members in Peru. That also affected the public’s trust in how the vaccine was tested and researched. Months after the case broke out, Salud Con Lupa followed it closely, paying special attention to how the news has affected the vaccine trial’s volunteers. Some who were given a placebo during the testing phase have yet to receive the actual shot due to the disruption created by the scandal. There’s a crucial aspect to this: the human angle.              ","What could have a greater corrupting influence on leaders than money? The answer is vaccines that could save their lives. This was a new way of corruption, because the most value was not money. It was vaccines, and to be sure they will be safe, and companies offered courtesy vaccines to help negotiate with the Peruvian government. Our reporting suggests questions for newsrooms in other countries to ask: Did officials in their governments also accept secret inoculations before vaccination deals were struck? Did the fear of COVID-19 infections of their families cause normally ethical officials to expose themselves to a new form of corruption? Our investigation also suggests that reporters need to examine records of visits to heads of government and other executive decision makers, particularly by diplomats. For this work, it’s important to use public information requests.",Spanish,https://saludconlupa.com/series/vacunagate-las-conexiones-del-poder/,https://saludconlupa.com/noticias/vacunagate-los-487-que-se-beneficiaron-en-secreto-de-las-dosis-de-sinopharm/,https://saludconlupa.com/noticias/las-40-renuncias-tras-el-vacunagate/,,,,,,"Fabiola Torres, José Luis Huacles, Jason Martínez, Renzo Gómez, Lucero Ascarza",Fabiola Torres is an investigative journalist from Perú.

Peru,"Salud Con Lupa, Epistemonikos Foundation",Small,Shortlist,,Scientifically Proven: An analysis of the most talked-about covid-19 treatments,04/01/21,"Database, Open data, News application, Fact-checking, Chart, Health","D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Node.js","Several clinical trials have been carried out that offer scientific evidence to confirm the efficacy or harm of the use of a drug or therapy with various patients who have suffered mild, moderate and severe symptoms of coronavirus infection. Salud Con Lupa in collaboration with Epistemonikos analyzed the 45 most used COVID-19 treatments. We created seven classifications, ranging from ""standard treatment"" to ""unsupported by science"". We developed these categorization levels to assess the appropriateness of the covid-19 treatments up to this point in time. From September 2020 until now, we update this information weekly as new scientific evidence becomes available.","After two years since the COVID-19 pandemic started, there is already scientific consensus on which drugs under study work, and which do not, for the treatment of the disease. To follow the evolution of the evidence, in September 2020 Salud Con Lupa and Epistemonikos launched Scientifically Proven, a tool that announces the progress of the results of clinical trials of medicines against COVID-19 in the world. This effort, which is updated every week, presents 45 drugs, the most used, divided into seven categories (from ""Standard treatment"" to ""Science does not support it"") that are very easy to understand to bring science closer to more people. Our tool shows the medicines that can be trusted today for each stage of COVID-19 and those that lack scientific support, but are still recommended by some organizations or groups that validate conspiracy theories. While there are drugs that have shown some benefit (such as monoclonal antibodies), they are expensive, complex to administer, and, in poor nations, still very rare. Scientific consensus is always difficult to define because there are many entities and finally one looks at the main organizations. For example, when the first organization says that hydroxychloroquine should not be used until the last one stops using it, many months go by. We also have drugs that have been reaching a consensus that they work. Today we are very clear about the role of corticosteroids and monoclonal antibodies. The latter are antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2 and block it. The issue is its cost. Today there is a consensus that they are used as prevention in high-risk people who have had close contact with someone infected, but also to treat patients in early stages.","Build a database We built a database of 25 treatments that were evaluated. The project was launched in September 2020 and updated every week until the present, which allows to see a medical evolution of the treatments. Two years after, the list of medical evidence on the platform already gathers 45 treatments with the highest demand for use. The tool is presented in Spanish, English and Portuguese. Contrary to scientific research articles that have an academic or scientific structure, this tool was created with the aim of guaranteeing easy navigation access, with which visualizations and tabs were integrated with the details of the therapies. Multidisciplinary team The work team involved doctors, investigative journalists and scientific journalists, as well as computer specialists, responsible for the implementation on the website under a highly usable scheme that allows users to immediately know the classification , the evolution of the evidence and navigation by type of medication or therapy. Methodology and classification The scale we used was developed specifically for this project and seeks to answer two questions: How ready is an intervention for clinical use? What is the state of progress of scientific research on an intervention? In other words, the scale (seven categories) indicates what the available evidence tells us about the possible clinical use of a treatment and what is the nature, quality and possible evolution of this evidence. All the evidence used comes from the COVID-19 Living OVerview of Evidence (L·OVE) platform, an open access platform that is updated by searching 41 electronic databases, trial registers and other sources.","How to dive the sea of ​​evidence on COVID-19 to come up with the necessary answers before running out of air? This challenge that we face with our partner Epistemonikos. We created a solution that classifies interventions against COVID-19 according to their effectiveness, proven with the latest and best available evidence. This is how the “Scientifically Proven” repository was born. Our tool completed more than one year in operation, being updated every week to determine the effectiveness of the different interventions against COVID-19 and, in this way, contribute to safe and informed decision-making by social and political actors, health professionals, as well as the entire Latin American and world population. Currently, the repository continues to be updated without interruptions and, in addition, it is translated into the Portuguese and English languages, in order to reach even more people throughout the world. We have the purpose of bringing scientific evidence closer to where health decisions are made, which affect us all individually and collectively. The best way to prevent health and public health problems is by considering evidence in decisions, but for this, evidence must be properly organized and accessible. This is an example of what science and journalism can achieve together against  COVID-19.","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community had concerns about poor-quality science being preprinted and then widely disseminated. But now, everyday people are reading them too and the media is covering them at a rate that far outpaces pre-2020.  In Latin America, we faced a big problem: most of the journalists don’t know how to find strong scientific evidence and sources and translate it into Spanish. That is one of the most important reasons that we launched Scientifically Proven, a tool that is helpful for them and for the public. It provides a snapshot of the research on the coronavirus, but does not constitute medical endorsements. What kind of evidence do we use? The primary source of information for estimating the effect of each intervention is randomized trials. Other evidence is used as a complement, especially when there is no evidence from randomized trials. We also always recommend consulting your doctor about treatments for COVID-19.","Spanish, English​, Portuguese",https://saludconlupa.com/comprueba/cientificamente-comprobado-un-analisis-de-los-tratamientos-mas-usados-contra-el-covid-19/,https://saludconlupa.com/comprueba/scientifically-proven/,https://saludconlupa.com/comprueba/cientificamente-comprovado/,,,,,,"Fabiola Torres, Gabriel Rada, Jason Martínez","Fabiola Torres is an investigative journalist from Perú.

At LA NACION we developed more than ten pieces with great visual and interactive power to provide a public service and guarantee a differential consumption experience for the newspaper's audience. At the same time, we guarantee the detailed analysis of the large volume of data (more than 24.4 million votes distributed in 379 departments, 135 districts and 15 municipalities) and its comparison with previous elections, whose data are stored in a large historical database.","The election coverage of LA NACION, especially its interactive maps, is one of the most viewed news stories of the whole year in the newspaper, with peaks of millions of views. The biggest challenge was to meet the goal of being the first mass media to publish election data with integrity and accuracy. After its publication, these developments were internally reused in numerous journalistic productions. And in turn, due to their level of detail, visual excellence and user experience, they are used even by other media. We received many congratulatory messages from readers and even colleagues from other media who highlighted the multimedia coverage of LA NACION, which always publishes solid, attractive and innovative pieces.","More than seven months in advance, the step-by-step development process was carefully planned in order to give a quick and effective response to the audience, but also to all the sections of the newspaper that consume our content for their stories on the election day. An interdisciplinary work team was organized with programmers, designers, data journalists and political journalists to take into account all aspects of the coverage. To accomplish this purpose, a workflow was devised to connect the different parts of the team. The most suitable technologies were researched and used, and software development practices were applied to fit the needs of the project. For the frontend development, it was used: HTML5, Javascript, Vue.js 2x (Reactive), D3.js, CSS, SASS, NodeJS, Mapbox, Leafletjs. For the backend development and infrastructure, it was used: AWS Route53, AWS Elastic Load Balancing, AWS Backup, AWS CloudFront, AWS EC2, AWS S3, AWS Lambda, AWS Cloud Watch, AWS RDS (PostgreSQL), AWS SNS, Fastly, Akamai, Jenkins, API Integrations, Docker, Python 3x, Django, SQL. At the same time, a contingency plan was designed for any eventuality with the use of Linux Virtual Hosts, database servers and the system installed in the offices of La Nación (on-premise).","Electoral coverage poses several challenges. One of them is technical: between elections, the government does not usually maintain the same data structure and often modifies or even deletes some key fields such as IDs. This presents a challenge when it comes to match data and put together historical comparisons between elections.  At the same time, many times the disaggregation of the information is insufficient. However, at LA NACION we always seek to go one step further. For that reason, for example, we decided to map with several programming techniques and also manually more than 16,000 voting stations across the country to know the result school by school and voting table by table. We even added the original pdf file of the vote count so that the reader may compare the ""digital"" and the ""analog"" result.   Another challenge, as regards project management, was to join planning and electoral work, which involves many areas of the newspaper ‒including programmers, designers, data journalists and journalists specialized in politics‒, 100% remote.","The best learning from this project is the use of technology to innovate, to stand out with respect to competition in journalistic productions and to try to improve ourselves year after year. Also, the importance of interdisciplinary work between programmers, designers and data and political journalists to have all perspectives of the coverage and develop innovative ideas. Furthermore, we believe that in projects of this size it is fundamental to carefully make a plan in stages, to research and use the most convenient technologies and implement software development practices that fit the project needs. At the same time, the evaluation of alternatives to possible contingencies that may arise on the same day of the election when receiving the data. Finally, we believe that it is important to have a journalistic ambition and instinct to identify current trends that may become news articles and also not to be satisfied with the existing data and always try to find new alternatives to offer a different product to our audience.",Spanish,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/elecciones-2021-mapa-de-resultados-en-tiempo-real-nid15112021/#/diputados,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/nuevo-relevamiento-compara-los-resultados-entre-las-paso-y-las-generales-en-la-escuela-donde-votaste-nid30112021/,https://blogs.lanacion.com.ar/projects/data/legislative-elections-in-argentina/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/todos-los-nombres-quienes-entran-y-quienes-quedan-fuera-del-congreso-nid14112021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/calculadora-elecciones-en-buenos-aires-se-puede-dar-vuelta-el-resultado-nid03112021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/cierre-de-listas-nid24072021/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/elecciones-en-la-argentina-dime-tu-clase-social-y-te-dire-a-quien-votaste-nid11122021/,,"Flo F Blanco, Loscri, Gabi Alonso, Martín Pascua, Pablo Arellano, Gastón Llana, Carlos Araujo, Nico Rivera, Jua Copello, Flo Altube, Nati Louzau, Delfi Arambillet, Gise Ferro, María R Alcobendas, Mariana Trigo, Flo Abd, Lucas Vélez, Dan Cancela, Lau Royan","Infraestructure, Graphics and Data Team",
Argentina,LA NACION (Argentina),Big,Participant,,Computer Vision to monitor elections transparency,22/10/21,"Investigation, Database, Crowdsourcing, Chart, Elections, Politics, Corruption","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Microsoft Power BI","The purpose of the project was to monitor electoral documents with computer vision and then validate data using crowdsourcing. We tried to detect blank spaces in those forms filled out by the chief officers of each voting station ‒fundamental data to confirm the suitability of the electoral process and avoid possible fraudulent situations. In Argentina, there are numerous political party ballots and the counting of votes is manually performed. The project involved data collection and several analyses shed some light on facts of public interest that would otherwise not be previously known without the help of state-of-the-art technology.","We were able to bring together more than 300 volunteers in 13 teams. Volunteers were aware that they were validating previously collected information using an image recognition software. 4 transparency ONGs, 10 universities and Global Shapers Argentina participated in this project. Comparing to our telegram monitoring project in 2015, thanks to Computer Vision we could review 100,000 documents instead of 16,000 files. Regarding participation, in terms of empowering communities to discover important information for themselves, we increased the number from 7 organizations in 2015 to 13 in 2021. With the feedback received from volunteers, we found some issued that affected the algorithm performance in primary elections documents. Wwe could fine-tune some situations for general elections. A good example of human + technology collaboration. It was found that some telegrams were scanned upside down, and the algorithm couldn’t work properly to detect those selected areas with empty fields. We led it to look for the barcode on the top right angle and the bottom left angle, and in the case, placed the telegram on the right vertical position for image recognition. We published a news article with the findings in the primary elections. This was an alert notice to the supervisors of elections and to the chief officer of the voting station to focus on the aspects to be considered to improve the information output in the general election. We did not find any fraudulent situation during the election, but we did point out political parties and their electoral representatives that a group of journalists, students and non-government organizations were working with artificial intelligence technology and human validation. We were watching with ‘super-powers’.","The project had different components: Artificial Intelligence, automation (RPA: Robots Process Automation) , visualization. For data collection we used .Net with CSharp y Selenium (headless browser), the National Electoral Court API; for automation, UiPath, for algorithm design, Python + OpenCV. For the analysis of results and dashboards, we used PowerBI, Excel and Google Sheets. For data validation we used Vozdata, a collaborative online platform. How did we use them? The RPA automation worked with the following steps: 1) getting the telegrams, 2) algorithm execution, 3) results extraction, 4) sheet generation. And this started again  for each selected district. Some highlights of the algorithm design included rejecting the use of regular services that detect and digitize tables and use, instead, a solution that used the general rectangular view of the Telegram as reference. This was adapted to each one of the districts analyzed as each province has a different Telegram design. Each field revised was measured considering height and width in pixels, moving the coordinates closer to the top left angle. We also converted pixels from the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) model to a gray scale. As a result, we obtained a unique value that only varied its intensity from black to white. We also used an algorithm to soften the drawings of a signature to avoid false positives of possible missing signatures when the ink used was not dark enough for a definition. After getting the information from the algorithm we made queries in Google Sheets. A function that works with a formula that lets you filter predefined circumstances. Select columnas A B C D where J=1 o K=1 o Z=1 If one of the situations appeared, the query filtered it. With the selected telegrams we uploaded them to Vozdata in different folders as electoral districts for volunteers to check.   ","[DATA DOWNLOAD] The same Primaries election night, within 24 hours we tried to download the telegrams navigating the website with an application made in house. As this took 7 to 8 seconds per telegram we changed to use the Election National Chamber API which reduced the time to 2 seconds per telegram. It was found that, when the files were downloaded with the APIs, the telegram file was a jpg file that in the case of the Province of Buenos Aires included two telegram pages in a single file.  As regards the tests carried out in the Province of Buenos Aires, we could not see the second page of the jpg file. So, the jpg file had to be adapted and converted into a .tiff file by dividing the .tiff file into the existing number of pages and keeping each one of them as a jpg file. We downloaded data from the rest of the provinces with the second method (API). If there was more than one page, the application converted them into two or four separate pages. That was automatically done by the application. Thanks to said evaluation, they found what happened to the jpg files. [ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE] With the insights highlighted by the participants, we could adjust the algorithm for the General Election. The most important consisted in the detection that some telegrams were scanned upside down. So, the algorithm couldn't work properly to detect the selected areas with empty boxes. We fine tuned it to look for code bars in the top right and the bottom left, and if it was the case, put the Telegram in the right vertical position to let the image recognition do its process.  If the application did not find any of them, the telegram was incomplete. Some had not any barcode.","- AI experimentation takes time and resources. Collaboration is a great shortcut. - AI is stats on steroids. There is always a percentage of error and human validation is essential to make it work for reporting. - Crowdsourcing is easier when the common goal is vital to citizenship, like national elections with suspicion of fraud or very tight margins to change the results. - We could reuse Vozdata because we didn't need a specific annotation tool for validating the data brought by the algorithm for this project. - Vozdata code is open source! github.com/crowdata/crowdata - When sending signals to the official Government and other political parties, the message that “We are watching” is stronger when you can show an alliance with different transparency NGOs and a diverse group of universities participating on the project.  - Also, the message that your newsroom is using artificial intelligence to monitor processes is also powerful. -     ",Spanish,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/telegramas-electorales-bajo-la-lupa-nid22102021/,https://blogs.lanacion.com.ar/projects/data/elections-data/computer-vision-to-monitor-elections-transparency/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/las-cinco-falencias-mas-llamativas-en-la-confeccion-de-los-telegramas-en-las-paso-nid11112021/,,,,,,"Florencia Coelho, Florencia Rodríguez Altube, Natalia Louzau, Delfina Arambillet, Gabriela Bouret, Gabriela Miño, Ricardo Brom, Lucas Morón Escalante, Mariana Trigo Viera, Catalina Villazuela, Sofía Zenteno Frers, Melina Zuzel",Data and Graphics Team,
Brazil,UOL,Big,Participant,,Rachadinha Anatomy (Anatomia da Rachadinha),15/03/21,"Investigation, Breaking news, Video, Politics, Corruption, Money-laundering","Animation, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL","The investigative journalism project “Rachadinha Anatomy” showed, for the first time, strong evidence of corruption in the cabinet of the then federal deputy Jair Bolsonaro – who is currently the president of Brazil. ""Rachadinha"" is the name given in Brazil to the illegal share of the salaries of public servants with the politicians who employed them. Before this journalistic investigation, there was only evidence of “rachadinha” in the cabinet of one of the president’s sons, Flávio Bolsonaro, when he was a state deputy in Rio de Janeiro. The scoops arose from the analysis of more than 600,000 confidential banking transactions.","The work had great impact in Brazil for showing, for the first time, that the “rachadinha” illegal scheme did not only happen in the cabinet of one of the president’s sons, but also in Jair Bolsonaro’s own cabinet, when he was a federal deputy (1991-2018).   Our starting point was a state investigation about Flavio Bolsonaro, which ended up gathering more than 600,000 confidencial banking transactions, most of them from public servants who once worked at the cabinet of the president’s son. Once the Bolsonaro family used to exchange public employees among themselves, it was possible that the data could include banking transactions of Jair Bolsonaro’s employees in the Chamber of Deputies.   Despite having been gathered by a state investigation, the data could have been used by Brazilian authorities to investigate Jair Bolsonaro, once it was aimed at an investigation about someone else – one of Bolsonaro’s sons.   UOL then decided to conduct its own investigation based on these same data, considering its public relevance and the national interest on it. Therefore, the facts that implicate the president of Brazil in the “rachadinha” scheme were revealed exclusively by UOL.   If it were not for UOL’s investigation, strong evidence that implicates the president of Brazil in crimes of corruption would simply have been discarded by the authorities, and would not have been known by society.","In September 2020, UOL obtained from its sources the confidential banking transactions gathered by the state investigation into Flavio Bolsonaro. The data add up to 607,552 banking operations.    First, the data were organized in an SQL database, where operations were performed to verify the consistency of the data. During this step, we could, for example, identify duplicate records and eliminate them. So we started to meticulously analyse the data – in the SQL database and also in Google spreadsheets.    The UOL data team has created some methodologies to work with the data. For example, we wanted to know how much of the salaries paid by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies were withdrawn in cash by Jair Bolsonaro’s employees – the withdrawal of large percentages of salaries were previously proven to be a money laundering strategy. To do that, we developed a calculation to exclude withdrawals that may be related to other sources of income.    At the same time, the UOL investigative team also carried out an investigation outside the data. We looked for information that could add layers to the evidence we found in the data. In doing so, we could find out that some of Jair Bolsonaro’s employees were, in fact, ghost employees, having never actually worked for the Chamber of Deputies. One of them, for example, used to work within the Legislative Assembly of Rio, promoting the political work of the state deputy Flávio Bolsonaro, not Jair Bolsonaro.   After completing the data analysis and the field investigation, we then organized the scoops into an infographic video, to facilitate the understanding of the findings by the public and facilitate the dissemination of the content. So far, the video has had around 400,000 views.","The most challenging part of the project was ensuring there we did not commit any error in the interpretation of the banking information and that we were not leaving any loose ends behind. We were working with raw data of enormous national interest. There could be absolutely no mistake and no unfilled gap. For this, it was essential to conduct meticulous data analysis and combine it with traditional investigation. Indeed, the president nor the federal government could not contest any of the information we revealed, which proves the excellence and the depth of the investigative work that was done by UOL.","“Rachadinha Anatomy '' shows the importance of journalism investigations, even in the face of public investigations. The confidential banking transactions related to Jair Bolsonaro’s employees in the Chamber of Deputy were first obtained by a public investigation in Brazil, but the scoops that arose from the analysis of these same data could not be made by the official investigative bodies, as previously pointed out. They could only investigate facts that were related to one of Jair Bolsonaro’s sons, not to Jair Bolsonaro himself.   The project also demonstrates the importance of in-depth investigations. The work took six months of work – it started in September 2020 and was published in March 2021.   In addition, “Rachadinha Anatomy” is the result of a continuous investigative effort of UOL about “rachadinha”. Prior to this investigative series, the team published its first two reports on the case, in September 2020. And we also continued to investigate the topic after the publication, releasing more stories and a narrative podcast in July 2021.",Portuguese,https://noticias.uol.com.br/reportagens-especiais/anatomia-da-rachadinha-bolsonaro/,https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2021/03/15/rachadinha-jair-bolsonaro-assessores.htm,https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2021/03/15/anatomia-rachadinha-ana-cristina-valle-jair-bolsonaro.htm,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph6JgfORuYs&t=8s,https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2021/03/15/rachadinha-carlos-bolsonaro-assessores.htm,,,,"Amanda Rossi, Flávio Costa, Gabriela Sá Pessoa, Juliana Dal Piva, René Cardillo, Leonardo Rodrigues, Marcos de Lima, Marcos Sergio Silva, Gisele Pungan","Flávio Costa is the coordinator of the investigative journalism hub at UOL.

Weekly, youths are sentenced and cruelly killed by the rival faction. In the state of Bahia, death caused by those who should protect. Families marked by grief and the revolt of losing a relative during a police action. In the state of Sergipe, the increase in femicide and domestic violence during the pandemic.","After the documentary, all the cases presented were investigated by the Public Ministry of each State. And the perpetrators of the crimes identified","The states of Ceará, Bahia and Sergipe lead the category of Intentional Violent Deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in Brazil, recorded throughout 2020. According to the Public Security Yearbook, they recorded a rate of 45.2 and 44.9, 42, 6 respectively. The data are from the 15th yearbook of the FBSP (Brazilian Public Security Forum). The cases considered Intentional Violent Deaths (MVI) by the yearbook are: intentional homicide (when there is an intention to kill), femicide, bodily harm followed by death, robbery (theft with death) and murders resulting from police intervention. According to information from the survey, the MVI rate grew by 4% in the country. The average was 23.6 per 100,000 inhabitants. In Brazil, the profile of victims is black (76.2%), young (54.3%) and male (91.3%). With the data obtained from the yearbook, it was possible to make a ranking of the most violent Brazilian municipalities. Eight of the ten cities with the highest rates of intentional violent deaths in the country are located in metropolitan regions around four capital cities in the Northeast. The cities have in common, in addition to their proximity to the capital, that they are medium-sized municipalities with high population density (all of them have more than 100,000 inhabitants) and a precarious social and urban structure. At least 6,122 children and adolescents were intentionally and violently killed in Brazil in 2020, an increase of 3.6% compared to the 5,912 cases recorded in the previous year. There are 12,034 Brazilians who did not reach adulthood because of violence, which represents an average of 17 official cases per day over the years 2019 and 2020. Victims, in general, have a profile: they are boys and blacks. The crime that killed the most people under the age of 19 in 2020 was intentional homicide (82.4% of cases).",The hardest part of the documentary was convincing the victims or their families to record a statement.

In this collaborative investigation, 12 newsrooms across Europe manually collected data from 32 countries about COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccinations in prisons. The results show how overcrowding and overincarceration have exacerbated an already difficult situation, with human rights often taking a back seat in administrations’ efforts to contain the virus. The findings were published in a range of outlets in at least 13 languages, from Europe-wide overviews to national reports from countries such as France, Greece, Italy or Hungary.","Our goal was to allow each partner newsroom to find and tell their own stories using the data from this collaboration, which is why we shared not only the collected data among all partners, but also all interview materials and data for visualizations created by any participant. As a result, more than 10 outlets around Europe covered this story or some angle of it, with many translating into multiple languages. We also published across multiple platforms, including social media in the form of Instagram stories, or explainer threads. We also found that some prison administrations who were uncooperative before, when presented with the results of our investigation, were suddenly eager to provide more data shortly before publication. Our results and methodology have also been studied by international researchers and activists who report on Covid-19 behind bars in their contexts.","Our main challenge was to keep everyone on the same page across 12 newsrooms throughout Europe. We used Jitsi, Slack and good old-fashioned Email to stay in touch, meeting online in full strength roughly once a month to recap our progress and set milestones for the next stretch. Since much of the data had to be manually requested or collated from a variety of sources, the actual investigation was relatively low-tech: A Google sheets database with detailed documentation on how to enter data formed the basis of our collection. Later, we shared interview transcripts, story structures, data and graphics with partners via Google Drive. We used GitHub to publish our methodology, as well as our data and the code used to analyze and visualize it in R.","One core issue, and one of the main reason this investigation is necessary, is that prison administrations don't collect or report COVID data in any standardized way. For most countries, data had to be requested via phone or email. The granularity, completeness, level of detail and definitions used varied widely across countries. To create a coherent dataset from this information patchwork, we went to great lengths to establish detailed documentation all participants could follow during the data collection process. The collection process itself was painstaking and time-consuming, and only made possible through the hard work and combined language skills of the partners. Finally, we aimed for full transparency in methodology and data: In addition to the stories themselves, we published a full account of our methodology, the full content and sources of our database, and the programming code used to analyze the data, such that all readers and interested parties are able scrutinize and reuse our work.","We were very successful at organizing collaboration across a variety of newsrooms and countries. EDJNet's concept for organizing their data units can be a model for similar initiatives. We strive to make it easy for colleagues to learn from our experience by sharing our learnings, for example in online behind-the-scenes discussions, at conferences or through our public methodology accounts. We also set ourselves high standards for the documentation, transparency and reproducibility of our methodology – standards that could be employed for other investigations as well, especially where complex data is collated manually.","English, Albanian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Macedonian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian, Spanish",https://p.dw.com/p/43mMw,https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/eng/Investigations/Locked-up-Covid-19-and-prisons-in-Europe,https://github.com/dw-data/covid-prisons,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11tNCMg1vkXedOKbMcU30dtHNOsqQmtBx-ejMHd2sZ9M/,https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17879079629602499/,,,,[all team members listed below due to character limit],"List of team members for this project: Kira Schacht, Catherine André, Miguel Ángel Gavilanes, Darío Ojeda, László Arató, Luca Tremolada, Riccardo Saporiti, Kelly Kiki, Thanasis Troboukis, Janine Louloudi, Nikos Morfonios, Lorenzo Ferrari, Anita Ishaq, Vincenzo Smaldore, Martina Zaghi, Anže Boštic, Taja Topolovec, Gian-Paolo Accardo, Adrian Burtin   Biographies: The European Data Journalism Network (EDJNet) is a network of media organisations producing and promoting data-driven coverage of European topics since 2017.

Singapore,"Kontinentalist, Women Unbounded",Small,Participant,,Sexual violence in Singapore: a crisis,08/09/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Women, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","This was the country’s first-ever data-driven story about the sexual violence epidemic in our midst. We worked with Women Unbounded, a feminist grassroots collective, to do this project.  ","Singapore’s society and mainstream media has often perpetuated rape myths and unhelpful attitudes about sexuality and gender that fail to constructively discuss and resolve the problem of sexual assault and violence. The advent of the #MeToo movement brought survivors’ voices to the fore, but skeptics often saw a trickle of one-off cases—mistakenly thinking the blame lay with a ‘problematic woman’—rather than understanding that this was a systemic problem. This story hence fills a much needed gap in public discourse by confirming key insights to spur policy changes: (1) that victims are often very, very young; (2) that they’re often victimised by people they know and trust; (3) that victims’ vulnerability is key, and a web of complicity by institutions and bystanders enable sexual violence; (4) that internalised shame and misplaced blame means most cases are never reported, and those that do report often do so at others’ behest and long after the incidents occured.  ","For the web development and data visualisation work: We used a combination of front-end tech, the scrollama.js library, and Flourish stories to build the data viz scrolly feature. For general design: Our illustrator used a mix of Procreate and Adobe Illustrator for the cover image; the visualisations were done by drafting on Figma first before refining it with Adobe Illustrator. For data collection: We did it manually, delegating different time periods worth of data to different people to input into Google Sheets. We kept doing this for multiple rounds to ensure veracity.  ","The data cleaning and analysis was the hardest part of the project. Due to the lack of official data on this important issue, and the lack of mechanisms like Freedom of Information legislation, we had to gather data from publicly-available news reports. This involved a lot of manual searching of the articles and reading to isolate the right data. It was also difficult to decide the relevant parameters for binning data, e.g., what age ranges to set and highlight, as that would affect the story angle and the readers’ sense of what is important.  ","This project shows how important three things are: collaboration, method, and topic selection.    This piece may not have happened if we hadn’t attracted the right collaborators. This means it’s important to figure out your organisation’s long-term values and goals so that it sends signals to the right people over time, both would-be consumers and collaborators, and they come to you. For us, that meant strongly signalling our commitment to doing cause-driven data stories, which then built up visibility and credibility for work with activists much later.    Another learning point was how important early stage of the data pipeline is—the challenge of collecting, cleaning, and analysing data—so allocate time and energy for that early stage. The dataviz world often enthuses about the final presentation aesthetics but, at least for this story, that wasn’t the hardest part. Especially when working with many data collectors who have varying experience levels with data, it’s so important to clearly communicate and systematise data collection, ensuring everyone understands the methodology, to prevent redoing and overlaps. This includes creating a definitions list or glossary, collectively discussing categorising and labelling, and version control.    Finding a good topic and marrying it to your strengths is key. This means finding the neglected aspect of the conversation, the niche that you can fill. For example, there’s been countless reports about sexual violence in the country over the years, but there hasn’t been a single piece that looks at it systematically. I think that’s why our story found such resonance: it used the core power of data visualisation—the ability to communicate scale and show patterns—to fill that gap in societal understanding of this topic.

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Participant,,Wild Otters: Threatened and traded,02/06/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Chart, Map, Crime","D3.js, JQuery, Adobe Creative Suite","A data-driven story about the wild otter trade. For this piece, we worked with Wild Otters, a non-governmental organisation that is a member of the IUCN SSC Otter Specialist Group. We also worked with Julia Janicki, an experienced data-story developer and environmentalist.","In Singapore, our wild otters are popular for being charismatic and adorable, but many locals aren’t fully aware of the threats they face. Asia contains the biggest market for otters—they are killed and traded in large numbers across the region as pets and for their body parts. For decades, many conservation groups and wildlife protection organisations have been working to bring more awareness and halt the illegal animal trade, and since wild otters are one of the most traded animals, we thought a story that focuses on their plight would showcase the severity of the situation. We extracted the data for the species that are traded, the amount of otters traded each year, the main reasons they are traded for, as well as how the online obsession with cute animals have put these otters—and other charismatic animals—at risk. The data was then inserted and converted into this interactive data story to make the topic and information easily digestible for our readers, as well as to let them know how they can help.","The base technologies used include HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to build interactive visualizations on the web. We also used Bootstrap for responsive layouts, and jQuery and Lodash for easier DOM manipulation and utility purposes. For the two maps, we used Mapbox studio to style the base map, and Mapbox GL JS (JS library) to render the Mapbox map onto the web page, as well as add points to the map and add filtering functionalities. Arcs between points on the map were calculated using Turf (JS library). For the line and bubble charts, we used D3, another JavaScript library, to draw the svg elements dynamically based on the data.","The most difficult part about this data story was coordinating with all the partners involved. It was crucial that we communicated often because the representatives at Wild Otters are experts in the topic, and Julia Janicki is well-experienced in coding environment-related data stories.   As Kontinentalist has always been an advocate for conservation and wildlife protection, this was an important topic for us to write about. We also made sure to consult experts in the field to ensure that our story was accurate and insightful.","The use of interactive data visualisations help to communicate important data to our readers. We also used maps to showcase spatial data, since it was important to showcase the scale of trade across countries and regions. We also used eye-catching illustrations to ensure that our readers will stay involved in the piece throughout, as the goal was to ensure that the reader reads the last section, which contains the call-to-action. As much as possible, we make the effort to partner up with experts. Their insights often make for a much more insightful story, and sometimes they are able to provide datasets that we wouldn’t be able to easily find on our own.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/otters-are-cute-but-endangered-and-trafficked-as-pets-in-asia,,,,,,,,"Gwyneth Cheng, Julia Janicki, Wild Otters","Gwyneth is immensely curious about the way the Earth works.

Names reveal a lot about a society, especially Chinese names for which there are 220 million possible options. Through examining the seemingly mundane personal act of naming a child, we can see the bigger macro historical forces at work.","The innovative Chinese chess-board like visualisations of the name data gained a lot of praise, as it's a clever homage to Chinese aesthetics and motifs. It shows that Kontinentalist produces truly innovative data journalism, as both the topic and the forms we produce are situated in our Asian context and true to our mission. The cover illustration also very subtly encodes motifs of a changing China, from the modes of transport to the fashion and hair styles depicted. The story also embeds audio clips pronouncing the Chinese characters and walks the reader through the changing popularity of the names in response to wider external circumstances. The last interactive visualisation also engages the reader by helping them 'take part' in the story by identifying their name and how popular it is.  ","For the data analysis, R was used. For the illustrations and visuals, Figma, and Adobe illustrator. For the visualisation of the data: Flourish and d3.js","It was difficult trying to retrace historical happenings and identifying which specific ones were tied to name changes and hence conclusive findings. It was also a struggle explaining the significance of Chinese names, including the context about how Chinese characters work, what the side character means, how the combinations work for that individual and in relation to other members in the family. It was difficult to create data visualisation and design that were coherent, thematic and added something more to the story beyond being just ornamental.","Keep your eyes open for interesting datasets—browsing Github is a good way to get them.

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Participant,,What does global warming spell for you… and your loved ones?,19/05/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Environment","Adobe Creative Suite, R","This story tries to make the big abstract topic of climate change actually relatable and understandable for the average person. It's a fun and light approach that also touches on a deeper issue of intergenerational differences in perspectives, which might explain some of the societal conflicts that exist today, e.g., about the priority of climate change solutions.","The story uses a relatively simple idea—that different generations experience this global phenomenon—to great effect. By showing how the hottest years of an older generation are still cooler than the coolest years of a younger generation, it really puts into context why so much conflict and seeing past each others' perspective happens for a topic that's seemingly 'science-based' and that one could argue should be more easily agreed upon. Ultimately, humans experience things not just by research but through their entire lives and senses, and this story shows that. It also spotlights some key campaigners in the region, which is important because big news outlets disproportionately cover personalities and events in rich advanced countries. It's important to acknowledge the work being done all over the world, and to spotlight initiatives that are more suitable to certain contexts.","For the design and visuals, we used Figma and Adobe Illustrator. For the charts, we used Flourish.","It was such a challenging finding a new angle to bring to a topic that was so widely covered topic, often by outlets that are more experienced and better resourced than us. It's also known to be a very scientific and complex topic, and it was hard to creatively visualise it. Even after deciding we wanted the story to be more personal, figuring out to do so was difficult—how to communicate such a big and 'future' concept to show the more personal and immediate consequences to someone living in Southeast Asia, an under-covered region.  ","Don't afraid to be creative with your charts and how you visualise data!

Let's talk about sustainable fashion,03/11/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Illustration, Environment, Lifestyle",Python,A data-driven story about the impacts of fast fashion and why it’s important to practice sustainable methods of obtaining clothing.,"In the digital age, fast fashion has become very trendy. The fashion industry has always been extremely pollutive, but this trend has caused the growing middle classes of Southeast Asia to buy a lot more clothing and thus generate more waste and pollution in recent years. Thankfully, a portion of consumers in the region have already been using sustainable methods of obtaining new clothing, including upcycling, recycling, clothes swapping, and clothes renting. These methods are just not that popular yet. This story aims to bring attention to the issues that each country in Southeast Asia faces, as well as the methods in which we can become more sustainable with the way we consume clothing.","We used Python to plot the dot plots and bar plots as drafts and then moved them into Figma for further styling, as well as to add illustrations and annotations. Python is helpful for scaling, sorting, and analysing large numbers, and is often a good foundation for data visualisations. Figma is great for styling and adding small details manually.","One tough part was gathering data and information that would be “new” to the reader, as well as trying to write about a familiar topic from a different angle.   We also had to include an innovative way to call our readers into action, especially since the majority of our audience is from Singapore and sustainable methods of obtaining clothing are still not that familiar to this community.","The use of interactive data visualisations help to communicate important data in a manner that’s easy to observe.   For the last portion of the story, we added a map to showcase spatial data—specifically the nearest places where our readers can go to get clothing made of sustainable materials, secondhand shops, clothes-swapping places, and clothes rental areas.

Belgium,De Tijd,Big,Participant,,EURO 2020: Data Driven Sports Reporting,10/06/21,"Database, Sports","D3.js, Json, R, RStudio, Node.js","Football is becoming ever more reliant on data to drive transfer decisions, line-ups and tactics. That is why De Tijd chose to create our own model showing the strength of each player and team competing in the 2020 UEFA European Football Championship, presented as the “Star index” (“sterindex” in Dutch). Using this model and feeding it new data as matches were played, we were able to rank players and calculated the ‘Man of the Match’ and the ‘Most Valuable Player’ of the tournament. These findings were not only communicated in our dashboard but were also translated in individual articles.","As a newspaper focused on business and financial news, De Tijd will always look at sports reporting in a different way. With this project, we managed to bring the emerging world of data science, as it is applied professionally by football teams, to our readers in a very accessible way.   Although the newspaper doens't has a dedicated section to sports we were able to plant our foot next to broader newspapers with specialised sports team. We were able to position ourselves next to these major outlets by focussing on a data driven approach while shying away of tendentious reporting that fluctuates on the rythm of single wins or losses. The central dashboard was well-read and resulted in more than 20 derivate articles in the newspaper. ","The “Star index” is based on more than 20 criteria - all possible player actions and skills - from more than 20,000 national and club matches since the 2018 World Cup. Data used for the model ranges  from scored goals, shots on target and assists to tackles and ball possession, but also included power, stamina, reaction speed and vision. This information was provided by the specialised dataprovider iSports API. Statistician Maarten De Schryver (Ghent University) turned this data into a model that provided us with individual ratings for each player in the national selections.  This Star Index was then corrected for competitions - the five major competitions were given more weight - and minutes played. All data used was either stored in a compact database or calculated on the fly to provide for individual, dynamically generated url’s for each player and match. The frontend application was built using the Vue framework with  router and data store plugins.","This project managed to combine several disciplines. The help of Maarten De Schryver was absolutely essential  to make sure the data we showed to our readers was both relevant and clear. And although results and statistics from the iSports API were available relatively soon after each match, we quickly stumbled upon enough edge cases to realise it wouldn’t be possible to have this entire project run automatically. This meant downloading new data by hand and processing it in R with some manual checks before updating files on the server. Similarly, the sheer volume of parameters involved in this project as well as the lack of any real world data already available forced us to start start coding the application before we had fully settled on the presentation of the data or the exact composition of the statistical model. Once launched, we were more or less at the mercy of the match schedule to keep our readers interested. Although new data was available nearly every single day, some matches were obviously more interesting than others - from both a sports as well as a data  point of view.",- With a small team of four people we were able to claim (data driven) sports journalism as a valid subject in our newspaper. Doing so we happily surprised our readers and other major news outlets who even congratulated us with our innovative approach.  - The results of our efforts wasn't limited to an online dashboard but also resulted in more than 20 individual articles that were fed based on the findings of our data analysis. This means our time-investment at the start resultated in a more efficient reporting later on.   ,Dutch,https://multimedia.tijd.be/ek2020,,,,,,,,"Thomas Segers, Thomas Roelens, Raphael Cockx, Dries Bervoet",Thomas Roelens — Head of Datajournalism Thomas Segers — Datajounalist De Tijd Raphael Cockx — Newsroom Developer Dries Bervoet — Journalist,
Belgium,De Tijd,Big,Participant,,Where Does Your Tax Money Go?,06/10/21,"Explainer, Fact-checking, Infographics, Economy","D3.js, Microsoft Excel, R, RStudio","In the digital article ‘Where does your tax money go?’ we tried to offer readers an overview about government spending. The Belgian government lacks a central platform where this information in easily available in a comprehensive way. Although we wanted to fill this information gap, we were reticent to just drop all the numbers in one visualisation. We still strove to fulfil our role as a newspaper and guide our readers through the story.","The article was published in November 2021, during the parliamentary debates about the budget for the coming year. Because the numbers for 2020 weren’t available we focussed on the government spending from 2000 to 2019, using this period as a summary of all the structural features of Belgian government spending. The data revealed a pattern of skewed expenses due to our complex federal structure, high government debt, shattered land use and ageing population. All of these were often mentioned before but for the first time they became visible in a comprehensive visualisation. The article became our nr 1 best read interactive of the year, gained a lot of traction of social media and sparked the debate about government spending spiralling out of control.  ",The data was collected from the national bank of Belgium. Analysis of these figures was done in R while the visualisation was entirely created with javascript and d3.js. Two data journalists from our datateam first wrote a draft themselves and then passed it to one of the senior political writers in order to add hooks to the current political debate. For the translation to print an export of the svg was made and the final annotations were added in illustrator. ,"The most striking part of the project is that we were the first to create a central visualisation of Belgian government spending. Although such dashboard exist in many neighbouring countries this was still lacking in Belgian media. Rather than just copy one of those platforms we crafted a custom story ourselves, staying close to the central function of our newspaper: giving insight and guidance through the noise. The creation of the visualisations and scrollytelling format was daunting but luckily we can rely a shared expertise and many internal examples that were created during the past couple of years. This allowed us to create the visualisation in no more than a week with no more than 4 journalists.","In our view, the role of a newspaper is different from a statistical (governmental) organisation.

United Kingdom,"Finance Uncovered, Premium Times",Big,Participant,,Secret Nigerian investors in UK real estate — a Pandora Papers investigation,06/10/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Corruption, Money-laundering, Business","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, OpenStreetMap","Produced as part of the Pandora Papers, this collaboration from Finance Uncovered and Premium Times was designed to stand out from past reporting on corrupt Nigerian funds sequestered in Britain. Yes, it too reveals the names of wealthy and connected Nigerians buying UK property. But the audience also gets a chronologically-animated, interactive map — an unprecedentedly data-rich perspective on the wave of suspect money flowing into UK property. Journalists found 233 properties, worth £350m, secretly bought by 137 Nigerians. One in six was owned by an offshore company of interest to law enforcement. Money laundering was suspected in most cases.","After our work was published, some Nigerian politicians and officials were interviewed by the country’s specialist anti-corruption enforcement agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In addition, Nigeria’s Federal Inland Revenue Service announced an investigation into possible tax evasion and the Code of Conduct Bureau announced investigations into serving and past public officials.  Elsewhere, anti-corruption campaigners praised our Pandora Papers reporting for shining new light on patterns of corruption and money laundering. Delivering the Transparency International UK annual anti-corruption lecture, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, director-general of the World Trade Organisation and former Nigerian finance minister, explained how our work revealed a “cottage industry” of enablers — lawyers, accountants, estate agents — in London, who play a vital role in facilitating Nigerian corruption. Meanwhile, Transparency International Nigeria (CSLAC) urged president Muhammadu Buhari to allocate increased funds to the country’s anti-corruption agencies, allowing them to launch comprehensive investigations into findings from the Pandora Papers. In the U.K., the opposition Labour Party responded to Pandora Papers by setting up an Illicit Finance Taskforce to pressure the government into prioritising the fight against international corruption. However, government ministers said they would not be rushed. They insisted plans were already in train that would eventually outlaw the use of anonymous offshore companies in the UK property market. These measures —contained in the Registration of Overseas Entities Bill — had first been promised in 2016 but are still not included in the government's current legislative programme. After the Pandora Papers, more than 40 MPs, from all parties, accused the U.K. was showing insufficient urgency. They have written to the prime minister calling on him to prioritise long-promised anti-corruption reforms, without which, they MPs said, the U.K. found itself “at the heart of the world’s dirty money crisis”.","This project started as a slowly expanding list of people who owned companies incorporated in secrecy havens such as the Seychelles and Panama. The ownership data was painstakingly extracted from the Pandora Papers, a leak of 12 million PDF, XLS, Word and other files, all from the offshore company-formation industry. The process took six months. From the resulting Ms Excel dataset, two patterns emerged: many offshore company owners were wealthy Nigerians, and many offshore companies were used to buy UK real estate. The leaked documents didn't mention specific U.K. property purchases, but we were able to match Pandora Papers companies to the names of anonymous offshore companies found in UK Land Registry records. Finance Uncovered (FU) shared its methodology with the BBC and The Guardian. Together, the three organisations went on to identify more than 1,500 UK properties, worth £4 billion, secretly bought by about 600 wealthy individuals. Techniques used to find matches included Ms Excel functions such as MATCH, VLOOKUP, INDEX(MATCH) and pivot tables. SQL was also used to combine and interrogate Land Registry data. For FU and Premium Times, the main focus was Nigerian owners of U.K. property. So together we assembled profiles on the wealthy Nigerians who had appeared in our research. Later, the same methodology — search, data-matching and profiling — was applied to other leaks, including Panama Papers and FinCEN Files, further expanding our dataset. To highlight the many U.K. properties acquired during the corruption-blighted presidency of Goodluck Jonathan (2010-15), we used Flourish tools to plot our findings on an animated map. Each property was represented as a pin-drop ""blob"" that appeared in chronological order. We also used Flourish tools to build a slide show highlighting other data trends, such as properties owned by oil tycoons, and properties owned by companies of interest to law","After months of research, FU and Premium Times had amassed an unprecedented amount of intelligence on hundreds of wealthy and powerful Nigerians who secretly invested in UK property. But we faced two challenges. First, we wanted our work to stand out from the steady flow of piecemeal reporting on suspected corruption and money laundering. Second, we had to navigate tough U.K. publishing constraints. Even though the U.K. government had failed to deliver on a 2016 pledge to introduce a public register of those who anonymously bought U.K. property, FU found it could not simply print those names that ministers had not. Strict local privacy laws still applied.   As a result, FU ultimately named just five wealthy Nigerians (from a total of 137) in published case studies. The rest of the dataset then went through an anonymising process. Names of individuals were replaced by the fields in which they worked: “oil”, “politics”, “banking”, etc.   These industry categorisations, together with other anonymised data points — property ownership dates, purchase prices, current valuation estimates, law enforcement interest — were all assembled in a revised dataset. In addition, the precise locations of properties were very slightly blurred, completing the anonymising process.  While the results were not easy to fashion into a piece of written journalism, they were ideal for data visualisations, using Flourish tools. In particular, once we saw the chronologically-animated map, we realised that we had landed on a fantastic story-telling medium for our data. The visualisation was both instantly arresting and information-rich. We believe it also sets our project apart from previous reporting on suspected corruption or money laundering.","We are especially proud of this project because we were forced outside of our comfort zone — follow-the-money investigative reporting — in order to tell an important data story through an animated and interactive visualisation.   Doubtless, Sigma Award judges will receive many entries from journalists highly experienced in data visualisation work. That is not us. We came to this form of story-telling by accident. We hope our efforts will spark ideas for others who tend to think of themselves as traditional reporters, confined to words and a few numbers numbers.  As well as offering an elegant technical solution to the legal limitations on our story-telling, we were surprised and delighted to learn that our visualisation also allowed us to reach new audiences. As one of our Premium Times colleagues told us, people in remote, up-country Nigerian villages were excitedly using their mobile phones to study animated maps of London, with coloured dots showing properties bought by Nigeria’s wealthy elite.      This anecdotal feedback was inspiring for us. FU’s mission is to help make follow-the-money investigative journalism a reality in some of the most challenging parts of the world. We will certainly think harder about how to use data visualisation methods to build new audiences on future projects. We hope our work will inspire others to do so, too.",English,https://www.financeuncovered.org/investigations/pandora-papers-nigeria-offshore-london-properties/,https://www.financeuncovered.org/investigations/pandora-papers-nigeria-offshore-london-properties/#pandora-papers-nigeria-graphic,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/488341-pandora-papers-for-179-million-pounds-137-nigerians-acquire-233-u-k-properties.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/pandora-papers/488346-pandora-papers-inside-the-secret-offshore-companies-london-properties-of-npa-chief-bello-koko.html,https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/488358-pandora-papers-how-stella-oduah-secretly-bought-n5billion-london-properties-with-cash.html,https://www.financeuncovered.org/the-london-connection/pandora-papers-uk-cottage-industry-enablers-wto-director-general-ngozi-okonjo-iweala/,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58792393,,"Simon Bowers, Lionel Faull, Purity Mukami, Ted Jeory, Nick Mathiason, Musikilu Mojeed, Nicholas Ibekwe, Taiwo Hassan Adebayo","Simon Bowers, Investigations Editor at Finance Uncovered, led FU’s work on the Pandora Papers.

They are the acquaintances of the policemen or those who are dependent from them. Despite gross violations of the law, the judges sent hundreds of people to jail.","After this story, many people who found themselves in a situation where the police involved regular witnesses now know how to prove in court that the witness is dependent on the police. In addition, their lawyers can do this work. Also after the publication, the number of cases where the only witnesses were police officers and their tame witnesses noticeably decreased. The problem has become widely known.","To find suspicious police witnesses, it was necessary to find their names in the texts of verdicts or orders, and then to see if they can be found in other cases. Most of the said texts and rulings are published by Moscow courts in the public domain on the website of the Moscow City Court. Journalists of the Important Stories have downloaded (using Python) 56,860 documents from there for the entire time under 12 so-called drug articles of the Criminal Code. In the texts of verdicts and rulings are usually mentioned the testimonies of witnesses, byers and police officers. Or at least the names of people and their role are named. In those cases where the names have been preserved, we have extracted them from the texts using programming and found the names and surnames that can be found in documents of various cases.  In our Workshop we’ve discussed how you can extract names from the texts using Python. We shared our code.    ","After we got a list of names of witnesses who met not only in one case with the help of programming, there was a huge manual work ahead. It was necessary to check more than 100 thousand names, examine all the documents to make sure that we are really talking about the same witness. Exclude errors. It is very time-consuming and time-consuming, reading court decisions one by one all day long. Then it was very important for the material to find a live full-time understood and talk to him.

The second, a similar attack in 2013 which again killed an extended family, but left a four year old girl alive; BBC Pashto kept in touch throughout the eight years since, so her story became the 'entry point' for the data investigation.   ","Tackling a complex story during the upheaval Afghanistan went through last summer was a challenge. We still hit the 10K mark for most audiences (12,303 page views Persian, 17,210 page views Urdu), but what was really encouraging was the way above average engagement time for this ranging from  , 1:08 to 1:22 on average per reader).  The story has good evergreen potential, given that the 'drone wars' are by no means over, and even in Afghanistan, the continued presence of so-called Islamic State provides the potential justification for strikes, at least in the border areas where they never stopped. ","The key to this was to find reliable data to show the impact of the air strikes launched by the US and its allies in Afghanistan.  Choosing from three main available data sets (US Airforce: Air power summaries, Bureau of Investigative journalism: Drone Wars and the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan's annual reports on civilian casualties) we opted for the UN data as a base line, giving a good compromise of available time series (2009 - 2020) and breakdown of civilian casualties in injuries and deaths, adults and children. (BoIJ shorter time series, US airforce, no detail beyond weapons release). The UN data needed extensive cleaning as figures from older reports were updated later as new information became available, and some data, e.g. the number of child casualties, was hidden in footnotes and appendixes.  An additional weakness of the UNAMA data sets was the lack of breakdown into different aerial platforms, i.e. helicoper, strike aircraft, drone.  We needed a series of expert interviews to come to an estimate that could be used to back uo the limited data that was available. ","There were significant challenges: Editorial: The Taliban takeover of Kabul fell right in the middle of the project timeline, posing a number a number of significant challenges: We had far less access to our first person story, the miracle girl who survived the devastating drone strike 8 years ago. The equally shocking strike on August 29th then provided a new peg, albeit required a restructuring of the story sequence. Data: As described, the cleaning of the data set was challenging as some of the UN's reporting was 'hidden' within report appendixes and some figures changed over time due to a complex methodology reflecting a mix of eyewitness accounts, media reports, ongoing investigations etc... Extensive cleaning and cross checking with other data sources and experts was needed. Design: GIven the entry point to the story, i.e. a single incident, we decided to reveal the data in a 'scrolly format', step by step, 'zooming out from the province where it happened and the time when it happened to a provincial and the n from her province and expanded to the whole Afghanistan and from there the date for the 10 years. This was achievable by building the scroly page to get the reader engage with the story and data. Showing data by moving the dotes on Afghanistan map, is the visual intimation of drone hovering on the lands. We also want to show how drone war works, we tried to simplified the stages and reveal them in 3 steps with flat graphic. One challenge for both graphics was to avoid text on the graphics and only use visuals to tell the information. For the scroly I divided the page into two section, one for the keys to be translated and work separately from the moving map to avoid complication on the map","The main learning points are: How to turn a limited data set into a credible story by cross checkign with other data sets and supplementing the findings with expert opinions from additional interviews.  Integrating a personal story with data and making it relevant to a wider picture. Working in a way that makes re-versioning into multiple languages easier, by minimising text in graphic and transferring labelling to crolly text.","Pashto, Persian, Arabic, Urdu",https://www.bbc.com/persian/resources/idt-1fae7d1f-1ece-42b9-8534-9e8d34fa1e0e,https://www.bbc.com/arabic/resources/idt-1fae7d1f-1ece-42b9-8534-9e8d34fa1e0e,https://www.bbc.com/pashto/resources/idt-1fae7d1f-1ece-42b9-8534-9e8d34fa1e0e,,,,,,"Sayed Abudullah Nizami, journalist; Leoni Robertson, data journalist, Maryam Nikan, designer, Eleanor Keane, developer, Sally Morales, project manager, Adam Allen, tester, Johannes Dell, editor","Sayed Abdullah Nizami, BBC Pashto, Multimedia journalist.

But that’s if you’re not counting the cooking, cleaning, washing, running of errands, taking care of children, and other activities that most households have to do on the side. In Costa Rica women continue to bear the burden of unpaid domestic work, which consumes twice as much time for women when compared to men, according to a data analysis over a national survey. Although there are still people who consider domestic work ""is not a job"" its value equals a quarter of GDP in 2020","The project revealed, for the first time in the country, disaggregated data for different profiles of women who carry the burden of unpaid domestic work. It also demonstrated the enormous amount of money with which household chores subsidize the national economy. The report allowed to open spaces for debate in news programs specialized in gender. For example, Contravía (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOer0aCujDY)   It was also used in workshops on masculinity of the organization Voces Vitales, to exemplify gender gaps (https://twitter.com/egeax/status/1375864785875705872)","R: To convert the SPSS file of the National Survey of Time Use, data wrangling, analysis, and data visualization Excel to understand the data tables of Unpaid Domestic Work Account of the Central Bank, related them and create women´s profiles of economic contribution, according to several variables and indicators.

The variables in the database were coded like this: A1, T2, TDNR_H, for example. Before drawing any conclusions, it was necessary to understand very well what each variable meant. Understand the 21 data tables in which the Central Bank separates the national account of unpaid domestic work. Then, based on these tables, create a precise indicator to estimate the relative weight of each variable in the grand total of the value of women's unpaid domestic work. The variables used by the Bank are: activity, sex, area, age, level of education. This calculation was the one that allowed to create the database that feeds the visualization called: The great economic value of women´s unpaid domestic work and to make visible the contributions of these women, according to different profiles.

United States,GoodRx,Small,Participant,,Mapping Healthcare Deserts: 80% of the Country Lacks Adequate Access to Healthcare,09/09/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Python","Our project maps out areas that lack the proper infrastructure to ensure a healthy community. We did this by identifying “healthcare deserts,” or areas across the U.S. where people lack adequate access to six key healthcare services: (1) pharmacies, (2) primary care providers, (3) hospitals, (4) hospital beds, (5) trauma centers, and (6) low-cost health centers. We then looked at how socioeconomic barriers, such as low income, lack of insurance, and limited internet access, can make it even harder to access care in a healthcare desert and perpetuate health disparities.","Since release, our work has been shared in the Washington Post, and the Philidelphia Inquirer among others, showcasing the shortage of healthcare that many American's face. Our data insights have also helped inform fieldwork for practitioners as well. Rural pharmacy and medical students have used our data to learn about the challenges their patients face and to develop community health projects. Additionally, we are working with researchers who are innovating in areas such as affordable housing and public insurance design to incorporate our healthcare deserts data into their work.","Using Python, we wrangled data from multiple sources to build our measure of healthcare deserts. To create data visualizations, we needed to tie the data together to a common geographic unit, so we geolocated facility addresses to latitude and longitude coordinates and built Census tract-level and county-level data. Since several of the clinically-based criteria for healthcare deserts were based on transportation time, we calculated driving times to healthcare facilities utilizing a Euclidean distance measure combined with a validated detour index and location- and vehicle-specific average driving speeds. We also brought in population data from the Census to understand the real magnitude of who is impacted by lack of healthcare access. We estimated the size of the populations living in healthcare deserts as well as looked at the socioeconomic characteristics of those populations. To summarize the Census tract- and county-level data and look at the national picture, we calculated statistics on the distribution of the population (and population characteristics) across different healthcare desert dimensions and levels of healthcare desert intensity.","One of the greatest challenges was coming up with a meaningful definition of a “healthcare desert.” Rather than use a systematic definition based on arbitrary thresholds (such as looking within a 10-mile radius or using relative measures such as percentiles), we conducted an extensive review of existing health services literature in order to develop criteria based on real data and clinical research. Healthcare access is a multi-faceted problem, and we wanted to come up with a measure of “healthcare deserts” that translated all of these important dimensions into an easy-to-understand measure.",Our project was impactful because it distilled a lot of complex information into a simple metric that makes sense and is grounded in research and data.

Brazil,"AzMina Magazine, Volt Data Lab, INCT.DD",Small,Participant,,Female journalists receive more than twice as many insults as their male counterparts on Twitter,23/11/21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Politics, Women, Human rights","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL","AzMina, Volt Data Lab, InternetLab and INCT.DD monitored 200 profiles of Brazilian journalists on Twitter. Using a dictionary made up of offensive, misogynistic, sexist, racist, lesbo, trans, and homophobic words, we analyzed 8,300 tweets and found that, while 8% of potentially offensive posts aimed at male journalists were in fact hostile, 17 % of those targeted at female journalists were attacks. Among the most used terms against them are “ridiculous”, “scoundrel”, “crazy”, “little woman”. ","We believe that in cases like this, data has the power to empower victims. Many women journalists suffer from cyberattacks but their speeches are minimized and they often fail to grasp the real dimension of this wave of offenses. We talked to journalists who were attacked for the first time who were able to see themselves in these numbers and use them, in their speeches and social networks, to denounce this problem. The misogyny against female journalists on social networks is already a known phenomenon, but the press was able to reflect it with data. The data from our analysis were republished by national vehicles such as Folha de S.Paulo, Yahoo and Claudia Magazine, and by vehicles that cover the journalistic market such as Portal Imprensa and Portal dos Jornalistas. We were also able, with this data, to question Twitter about its actions to try to combat misogyny on the platform.","Seeking to build an analysis that would allow us to articulate social markers of gender, sexuality and race, we paid attention to include in the list of journalists who would have their profiles monitored different gender, racial-ethnic profiles and different sexual orientations. The list, which sought to mix journalists with works in several vehicles of the Brazilian press, different regions and, at the same time, in different stages of their careers, included 200 journalists. Among them, 133 women and 67 men. We collected tweets and retweets that mentioned the monitored journalists and that contained at least one of the words present in our lexicon. The lexicon was built through different phases by linguists, journalists and other specialists, and ended up with 54 terms who included offensive terms, misogyny, racism, homofobia, etc. The collection of the tweets which mentioned these journalists was carried out from May 15 to September 27. We collected, in the period mentioned, 3,196,086 tweets and retweets mentioning female journalists and 3,886,861 tweets and retweets mentioning male journalists. When we disregard the RTs, we have 2,139,593 tweets mentioning female journalists and 2,509,691 mentioning male journalists. Therefore we collected a total of 7,082,947 tweets and retweets targeting male and female journalists. Data collection was performed using the R programming language, with the rtweet package (https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet). Searches were made for tweets that mentioned at least one of the profiles of a list of journalists, categorized according to vehicle, genre and other characteristics. The crossing and organization of this content was done in R and SQL, and the dashboards for data analysis were developed in R and metabase. With filters and features we were able to make queries and create databases in CSV for smaller and more specific analyzes, using mostly Google Sheets.","In addition to dealing with the large amount of data, it was also difficult to build the lexicon that would allow us to refine our capture. In the first stage, we updated the lexicon developed for MonitorA, a political violence observatory conducted by InternetLab and Azmina magazine in 2020. As the lexicon had been designed to monitor political violence against candidates, many of the words did not fit in the new research and many others needed to be included. After testing the initial lexicon, we were able to refine it through qualitative analysis of the first collected tweets. We then included terms that had appeared during the analysis and removed false positives that increased the number of collected tweets. After the collection was completed, we analyzed the tweets addressed to men and women separately. Since it was impossible to qualitatively analyze all the tweets and retweets mentioned, we chose to analyze only the tweets that had at least 5 likes and/or RTs as engagement. The manual analysis was important to remove ‘false positives’ tweets that could have been incorporated by quoting words that appeared in the lexicon but were decontextualized, and sometimes not actually offensive. To make sure that there was a common understanding between the researchers of what constituted offenses and what was just criticism, we initially analyzed the first one hundred tweets together. In addition, the tweets that had more complex contexts and could not be easily labeled by just one researcher were analyzed by more than one researcher.","We really believe that data journalism can learn a lot from the methodology that we have implemented, since 2020, - also with MonitorA, AzMina and InternetLab's gender policy violence observatory -, of merging quantitative and qualitative techniques to collect and classify data. There are many lessons learned about how to monitor phenomena in social networks using textual corpus - which, we know, are alive, need to be updated and constructed under different perspectives. It is also possible to learn from the interdisciplinarity of the project, which included the work not only of journalists, but also of lawyers, anthropologists and other specialists.",Portuguese,https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/mulheres-jornalistas-recebem-mais-que-o-dobro-de-ofensas-que-colegas-homens-no-twitter/,,,,,,,,"Bárbara Libório, Jamile Santana, Helena Bertho, Carolina Oms, Thais Folego, Fernanda Martins, Jade Becari, Blenda Santos, Catharina Vilela, Mariana Valente, Sérgio Spagnuolo, Renata Hirota, Felippe Mercurio, Carolina Herrera, Larissa Ribeiro, João Santos","AzMina is a non-profit organization fighting for gender equality.

It does that by inviting the reader to sync its breathing with the animation being displayed on screen. The video translates the number of daily deaths as the speed and color of an expanding circle. After it reaches 500.000 deaths –the mark of July 18th, when it was released– it proceeds to expand at the same speed that tooks for 1 person to die of Covid the day before.","The mark of 500.000 deaths was represented in Brazilian newspapers in several ways, and was an opportunity for newspapers to show the gravity of the pandemic in our country. We chose the data visceralization media as a way to involve the public in this narrative, bringing it to their own body into it. Piauí Magazine is known for its longform journalism, with textual and narrative quality. The choice to publish this kind of innovative infographic, taking a whole page scroll in the homepage, makes clear the potential that visual journalism has to communicate complex stories.","Data from Conass (brazilian's National Council of Health Secretaries) was used to determine the breathing paces for each month of the pandemic. For example: the highest value in mean daily deaths corresponds to 6 breathing cycles in a 5 second period, while the lowest value corresponds to 1 breathing cycle in a 5 second period. With these reference values, the animation was produced in Adobe After Effects, with sonification produced in Ableton Live. The interactive piece that follows the video was developed in HTML, Javascript and CSS, daily updated by the journalists CMS platform.",Finding a correspondence between daily death counts and different breathing paces that felt natural and appropriately conveyed a situation of crisis was a tricky challenge.

Our findings were used by parliamentarians, who republished it on their social networks, charging the federal government for the lack of action in the fields of gender and women's protection. AzMina has a wide network of publishing partners and our complaint also featured articles in national media such as Folha de S.Paulo and also in places such as O Estado de Minas. The database built for the report was also made available so that readers, specialists, or other journalists could make use of it for other investigations. The report was also one of the finalists for the Claudio Weber Abramo Prize for Data Journalism, the highest award for data journalism in Brazil.","To build this database, we gathered data from three different public budget platforms in Brazil: Portal da Transparência, SIGA Brasil and Sistema Integrado de Planejamento e Orçamento (SIOP). At first, we were testing the platforms to find out more about the specific budget for women across different federal government portfolios. Before we knew that the platforms had conflicting information between them, we coded a scraper using Python to return what we thought was a comprehensive database of budget entries. As it turns out, the first results we got were not only incomplete but made us understand that the work was never done before because it cannot be automatized - it had to be done reading entry by entry and re-checking the information. So we did exactly that: we learned how to navigate the different portals and checked hundreds of pages for each of the budget actions we mapped that were linked to the overall budget for Brazilian women. We closed the time window from 2016 to 2021 to encompass the last three governments and populated a table with the results. In total, 10 budget actions were found to be active during this timeframe. Then, we proceeded to analyze their specificities and all the steps - from conception to approval in Congress and, finally, executions - to understand where did the money go.  We also used the Brazilian version of the FOIA - LAI (Lei de Acesso à Informação) - to find pieces of data missing from the government platforms. By placing multiple requests, we were able to identify that the ‘Protejo’ program and the Women of Peace Project were being scrapped and left with almost no money to continue operating.  Finally, with the database ready and checked, we used Flourish to visualize the information. ","Our first conversation about this story was about precision. We both questioned ourselves on how we would come up with a methodology that was strong enough not only to accurately find the information we needed but to counterattack possible flak. As freelancers, we wanted to make sure we were anticipating potential assaults and protecting ourselves and the newsroom we were writing for.  With an entire team of women journalists behind this investigation, we knew how exposed we were to attacks by pro-government tropes. We were also sure that transparency was a key factor in our safety strategy. We focused a lot of time not only on the methodology and gathering the data but on fact-checking and challenging the database we created. In the story, you can trace every step of the investigation and even recreate that. Towards the end, we encourage the readers to do so by making the database publicly available. We also made an effort to make it all accessible to the general public - hence why we decided to go for a filtered table in Google Docs instead of a more sophisticated structure.  Precision was definitely the biggest challenge of this project. After the publication, I am happy to say that our expectations were positively surpassed. Instead of the attacks we were preparing for, we were met with a high level of interest for the story, which is proven by the number of news outlets that republished the investigation and the huge amount of people, especially women, it reached.","Among many things, this project teaches the value of having a gender perspective inside the newsrooms, especially in the Public Policy and Budget beats. This database was put together from the questions brought up by and with the curiosity of women journalists. It also teaches how impactful data journalism can be by using techniques that are easily understood by the public.

United States,Quartz,Big,Shortlist,,Fashion brands aren't keeping their Instagram diversity promises,16/03/21,"Investigation, Database, Infographics, Chart, Arts, Lifestyle, Business, Culture, Economy, Human rights","Scraping, D3.js, Python, Node.js","A year after fashion and beauty companies took to Instagram en mass to show support for the Black community and the Black Lives Matter movement, our analysis of 27,000 images posted by 34 brands showed that while many did increase the diversity of skin tones in their Instagram images, the increases were often only marginal. Light skinned models still prevail. We made this readily apparent with interactive and static data visualization.  ",The piece was one of the more widely read items on our site and was especially well read by members of the fashion and beauty industry. Researchers of inequity and company representatives reached out asking us to share our data and methods so that they could bring better accountability to their organizations and study it further. Influencers shared the story and graphics with their followers. Fashion influencer Bryanboy called it “very essential reading” Later in the year our data and graphics were included in an episode of an episode of the The BoF Show on Bloomberg TV.,"First we used custom built tools to collect and store Instagram posts using python and node. Then we constructed a database front-end that allowed us to evaluate and categorize every image we collected. That piece of software was written in node. We then analyzed our data using the python library pandas. Visualized the data using HTML, CSS, and D3.js and added interactivity using javascript.  The visualizations have three modes to allow readers to explore the data. A timeline view, a clustered gradient view, and a combination of the two—a view of two clusters, split by whether the post was from before or after Blackout Tuesday. These three modes deftly showed how long brands stopped posting to Instagram during the US unrest, the distribution of skin tone depicted on a brand’s account, and how that distribution changed after Blackout Tuesday. In all three views, dots can be tapped or moused-over to reveal the image it represents. We size-optimized the photographs using the command line tool imagemagick.  ","Collecting this data was extremely hard. Instagram does not have an API and the site will block IP addresses that it perceives as trying to harvest data. Nevertheless, we devised ways to both collect the data without violating the site's terms of use—and avoid being blocked. But that was just the start. We then used the software we wrote to evaluate each image by hand, establishing the number of people in the image, their skin colors, and whether or not the image was suitable for inclusion in our analysis.   ","Firstly, our project is a great example of how to hold organizations accountable through data. Second, it shows the opportunity for journalists to create data where none previously existed. There was no dataset of the skin tones of models promoted by fashion and beauty brands, despite the information being in plain view. We were willing to put in the work, and made a first-of-its kind dataset.   ",English,https://qz.com/1971689/,https://qz.com/1981716/,,,,,,,"Amanda Shendruk, Marc Bain, David Yanofsky","Amanda Shendruk is a visual journalist on Quartz’s Things team.

This raises awareness on the invisible barriers faced by female entrepreneurs and aids in spurring action on levelling the playing field. Analysis of women-led start-up missions and interviews with five female entrepreneurs from across Asia also further reveal the benefits that women not just bring to the table, but to wider society. By centering the experiences of female founders through an interactive map, readers get to hear from women themselves and be inspired by the innovative tech they have introduced to benefit their communities. ","For the dot plot and bar chart, we edited basic visualisations from RawGraph by adding illustrations and stylizing them further on Figma. The data was sourced externally and extracted from reports by United Nations Women and International Finance Corporation.  For the word cloud, we did a text analysis of the mission statements submitted by applicants to the 2021 She Loves Tech Global Competition and generated the visualisation on Flourish.   ","The lack of open financial data, particular sex-disaggagrated data, made this story challenging from the get-go. Most investment data found online were hidden behind a paywall, while the numbers we could find were not broken down into male and female-led businesses.  Although we know that women face far more obstacles in accessing start-up funding and participating in paid employment, for some reason this data hasn't been collected globally or made publicly available to understand the full scale of the problem.  ","Many issues facing women go under or unreported, although there is a wealth of stories that can be gleaned from speaking to women, or exploring what exists and what’s missing from gender-related data.  This project underscores the importance of telling such stories, and as data journalists, seeking and gathering sex-disaggregated data.

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Participant,,What Asia's trees tell us about inequality,19/08/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Open data, Illustration, Map, Environment","QGIS, Google Sheets",This story explores the inequality of heat in Asian cities and how urban planning has left more marginalised or lower income communities with less access to life-saving greenery in the context of global warming.,"In the last few years, more investigative reporting has been done on how redlining has resulted in the unequal distribution of greenery and tree cover in urban cities and how this leaves the most vulnerable and disadvantaged communities at risk from air pollution, extreme heat and other effects of climate change. However, coverage on this issue has largely been US-centric, so we wanted to bring this conversation to Asia and look at inequities in the urban Asian landscape. We have received feedback that the story was a much-needed one to be told, particularly in Singapore where urban greenery is taken for granted. We hope this story drives urban planners in Asia to make tree distribution more equitable.  ","In order to map open space and tree distribution in relation to income in two Asian cities, Singapore and Hong Kong, rigorous data gathering and data processing had to be done to produce a comparable result.  We calculated the cumulative median income population for each income bracket, by planning area, using Excel. We then found the cumulative median population to find the corresponding income bracket. The midpoint of this income bracket is used to estimate the median income of the planning area. Next, we split both sets of data into tertiles each, labelling them A-C and 1-3 by tertile of the respective variables. Finally, we merged both variables into one label. For example, a planning area with low income and few trees would be labelled A1. To map these, we assigned each unique label (e.g. A1) a colour along a bivariate spectrum.  For Hong Kong, we first split the data into two groups: below and above average. For the ‘above average’ group, we split that equally into two. This was done as Hong Kong’s average countable open spaces per capita is already much lower than international numbers, making it meaningful to compare districts that fall even further below this average. We used the same methodology of labelling and mapping the labels along a bivariate spectrum.","The biggest challenge was in defining “greenery” or “green space” and finding the right datasets that were comparable between Singapore and Hong Kong. In mapping Singapore, we were able to obtain data on tree distribution, while Hong Kong only had data open space, which includes green space.","Although the issue of redlining and inequities in urban planning is underreported in Asia and available data might not be as abundant as in other regions, this story showed that with enough digging and analysing existing data, one is able to produce a compelling story that addresses urban development  issues that are both unique and shared.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/who-trees-dont-shield-from-the-urban-heat-island-effect,,,,,,,,"Zafirah Zein, Munirah Mansoor, Zenn Wong","Zafirah is a freelance writer and journalist as well as the co-editor of an independent magazine called AKAR.

Spain,El Confidencial,Big,Participant,,Spain empty of ministers: 80% of the provinces do not appear on their agendas,07/11/21,"Investigation, Database, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","El Confidencial analyzed all the records of the minister’s agendas (meetings, institutional events, trips…) during the last six years. From the information collected (24,236 recorded events), we seek the location at a provincial level. As a result of this analysis, we can conclude to which territories more attention is paid and to which less when organizing the agendas of the ministries: 80% of the provinces practically do not appear. In addition, we were able to observe the differences between government parties to plan foreign official visits, communication media for interviews and the times in which the events are held.","The Spanish territorial model is based on the system of autonomous regions in which all have, on paper, the same importance. However, this system presents inequalities when it comes to national policy. Madrid, the autonomous regions where the country's capital is located, accounts the most of the presence of politicians at this level. Thanks to this data journalism project, we provided information about this reality for the first time, providing conclusions that show the mismatch. On the day of publication, the main topic was the opening of the newspaper, and five other related news were also published as a block, including an interview with a former minister and an opinion article. El Confidencial's commitment to achieving a greater impact was total and the reception was good. The information block obtained about 85,000 visits, a good figure considering that there was a paywall and that it was a weekend. In fact, in the days prior to the publication of this information by El Confidencial, the government had raised the possibility of moving some ministries outside the autonomous region of Madrid. In addition, the subject is one of the political keys today. In the last national elections, a party that fights for a better balance of territorial decompensations, Teruel Existe, achieved representation for the first time in parliament. And facing the next elections, parties with demands of this type are already proliferating in what is called ""emptied Spain."" But in addition, the analysis serves to highlight another issue: the agendas of the ministries are not complete. Not all the activity of each minister appears, but only the ones that each cabinet wishes to communicate.","The first step was to scrape the information from La Moncloa website and structure it in the form of a table, for which Python was used. The URLs did not always follow the same pattern, so we simulated the behavior of a person clicking with Selenium.    Once we had the data in csv format, a first approach to the location was made by looking in the event description for names of cities or countries, and creating an additional column with them, using Python again. However, on many occasions a place is mentioned but this doesn’t mean that the event takes place in that place.   For this reason, it was necessary to review each of the elements and check the location. This was the process that took the longest (about two weeks to clean this data) and that adds great value to this work. We will explain later why this work was so important.  ","As we said, it was necessary to review each of the elements and check the location one by one. Thanks to this, we were able to have a very complete panoramic view of what type of events are recorded in these agendas and which ones are left out, something very important to understand our data.   But in addition, it was not enough to extract the location of each event from the agenda. For the analysis to be better, we decided to categorize those events that took place at the headquarters of the ministries, since all of them are located in Madrid. In this way, our main conclusions eliminate this centralist effect and, even so, it is observed that centralism is an evidence. We contribute with data to the debate from the public activity of the ministries for the first time.   We also established categories to differentiate interviews in the media or telematic events during de Covid-19 pandemic. This allowed us to draw conclusions about the differences between the media chosen by each cabinet, depending on who is in government. The analysis of the information is useful, therefore, to see which territories are given more importance in order to communicate the government's action, but it is not possible to go much further. The specific individuals or bodies they meet with, for example, are not listed entirely. All of this is clearly reflected in our analysis so that the reader understands how to interpret it, and also highlights the lack of transparency on a totally public management issue.  ","One of the most important things we learned with this project was the importance of decision-making prior to creating a unique and proprietary database. For this, it was important to previously agree on the categories that we were going to need. After several days working with this data, we understood that the quality depended on a careful review of all the information. Only when we were sure that our data were completely clean to work with, were we able to start the analysis. In addition, we understood that on many occasions the information necessary to make good information is already published. It’s necessary to have a journalistic vision and a way of working based on data analysis to be able to extract exclusive and original information from databases of your own creation. Also, the review and teamwork were so convenient. In addition to data journalists and developers, we wanted to engage other journalist at the newsroom specialized on political news in order to provide the best possible context and approaches to the reader. We also understood the importance of knowing well the origin of the data you are working on so as not to publish erroneous conclusions. Knowing that what is published is a selection of what the ministers do was very important, so we investigate to understand how that selection was made: based on communication strategies. And this brings us to the last lesson learned, although it was not a surprise: the level of transparency of the activity of ministers in Spain is really low and, although the improvement of this transparency has been a political promise, it has not been fulfilled.  ",Spanish,https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2021-11-07/ministros-agenda-moncloa-provincias-abandonadas_3319370/?utm_source=direct&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=data,https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2021-11-07/gobierno-agenda-entrevistas-medios-comunicacion-radio-tv_3311244/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2021-11-07/noche-domingo-ministros-suspende-conciliacion_3318739/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2021-11-07/asi-es-el-mapa-de-la-diplomacia-de-espana_3318519/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2021-11-07/manuel-pimentel-gobernar-espana-empresa_3319906/,https://blogs.elconfidencial.com/espana/ideas-ligeras/2021-11-07/conciertos-judiones-motos-y-procesiones-no-es-drama-todo-lo-que-reluce_3319547/,,,"Fernando Anido, María Zuil, Darío Ojeda, Marta Ley","Fernando Anido is a journalist and developer.

We requested data from the 300+ social housing corporations in the country, to find that in at least a quarter of the municipalities you’ll need to wait for more than 7 years. In some parts of the country waiting times were as high as 20 years - or more.","Our investigation added to the national society wide debate about the current housing crisis, its consequences and possible solutions. Following our addition to the debate the housing crisis was high on the agenda of the newly formed political coalition. Who, when presenting themselves merely weeks ago, installed a minister of housing as part of the Ministry of Interior and Kingdom Relations. We published across different media - online news article, online interactive, radio reportage, tv-broadcast - on the last Saturday of april 2021. Come Monday the new insight on exact waiting times for every municipality dominated the frontpages of all newspapers - both national and regional, as well in local and regional broadcasts. As the national public news broadcast, our reporting reaches a great audience. Yet by sharing the outcomes and data with regional news outlets, our impact further increased. Our results can be seen in an interactive that can be personalized on a municipality level, an explainer-video on Youtube, and on our site and newsapp, reaching over hunderds of thousands unique visitors. The articles were viewed 400.000+ times, the interactive has had 400.000+ unique visitors, and the YouTube video has 280.000+ unique views. Together with our television- and radiobroadcasts, which usually reach millions of people.","Most of our research consisted of classic journalistic slog e-mailing the 300+ corporations responsible for social housing throughout the country. Many of them did not answer our e-mails, so we ended up calling those corporations, explaining what we were trying to do and asking them for data. Once corporations agreed, we had to get the numbers out of the files they sent us (PDF’s, Word documents, annual reports and emails) and into our spreadsheet. For data analysis purposes we mostly used Google Spreadsheets and Python Pandas - though most of it was spreadsheet based. The Netherlands is made up of a multitude of municipalities and in most of them the social housing is dealt with by multiple corporations. We therefore needed to calculate weighted average waiting times, to make sure we had a good understanding of the situation in every municipality. (We used a threshold of 75% of all social housing in a municipality; if we had less than 75% of results for a given municipality, we showed no data.) For our interactive we wanted to provide readers/visitors with more contextual data; these numbers, mostly open data, were also collected and edited in the spreadsheet. The interactive was built using the Nuxt.js and designed with Adobe XD. For graphics Adobe illustrator was used, and After Effects for animations.","The hardest part of this project was the sheer number of unknown unknowns we had to overcome, and the vast number of sources needed to gain insight into waiting times for social housing. The Netherlands is made up of a multitude of municipalities and in most of them the social housing is dealt with by multiple corporations. Every organization had a slightly different definition of waiting time, active and passive. We ended up resolving this with personal contact - explaining our needs to many organizations.","It’s always worth asking simple questions even when people think the answer is obvious. Everyone “knew” that waiting for social housing was a matter of years and years, instead of months. Yet nobody knew exactly how long the wait was. We found out why nobody knew soon enough: the information needed to get to an average waiting time on a municipality level was scattered among hundreds of organizations. Second lesson for others - one story begets many more. By building an interactive website where users need to fill in their municipality, we ended up with 355 different stories: one story for every municipality. So instead of spending months apparently working on one production, think of it as time well spent telling 355 different stories. And finally, note how this story did not start with a simple downloaded dataset. Some data-driven investigation require you to build your own dataset, e-mailing and calling hundreds of sources.",Dutch,https://app.nos.nl/op3/socialehuur/#/?gemeente=alkmaar,https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w64ubzr3fc9b15i/AACdGeO9qOeyxkT1hSvVJs6ga?dl=0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RBQ60O8SRs,https://nos.nl/op3/artikel/2377995-sociale-huurwoning-in-zeker-een-kwart-van-de-gemeenten-wacht-je-meer-dan-7-jaar,https://nos.nl/video/2378050-22-jaar-wachten-op-je-sociale-huurwoning-krijgt-emma-er-een-voor-haar-veertigste,https://www.nporadio1.nl/fragmenten/nos-radio-1-journaal/6fdc677b-2ea7-4d39-93a1-31068711486f/2021-04-24-langere-wachttijden-voor-een-sociale-huurwoning,,,"Daan Kool, Lars Boogaard, Cheuk-Ming Tang, Winny de Jong, Jurjen IJsseldijk, Emil van Oers, Leen Kraniotis, Wessel de Jong, Jeroen Schutijser, Emma Jackson, Jos Stolper, Stephan Vegelien en Hugo Janssen.","NOS is the national public news broadcaster of the Netherlands.

Using data from the latest IPCC report, we visualized the best- and worst-case scenarios for sea-level rise by 2100. The story also highlights the impact of climate change on extreme weather events, and the measures that are put in place to protect the low-lying island-nation – from nature-based solutions to infrastructures to funding climate research.","The latest IPCC report garnered much attention to the topic of climate change, but most of the contents of the report remain too complicated for many. We are making this topic more accessible through the use of the 3D simulation and animated graphics to explain the complicated sea-level processes. This project will also be displayed at an exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore from Jan 14 through Feb 8. The exhibition, called ""Through the Lens,"" is a celebration of the best in visual and interactive journalism. It explores the impact of global climate change on Singapore and showcases how even a small country can do its part to tackle the challenges of the crisis.","This project uses 3D modelling in Unreal, and it required scaling the models manually to make sure they are accurate. The 3D simulation is then exported as a video and we used our video scrolly template to display them on the web. The animated graphics were created on Adobe illustrator, then animated using Adobe AfterEffects. The 3D map was created in Blender and was also exported as a video. In addition, we also used datawrapper for some of the simple charts.","The hardest part of this project was making sure we are accurate. First of all, the IPCC report itself is complicated and not easy to understand. Terms such as ""ice-cliff instabilities"" were totally new to us. The sea-level projections also come with caveats to the data. We consulted with researchers at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, who helped us understand the complex sea-level processes and made sure we were explaining and visualizing them correctly. Another challenge in creating this project was striking a balance between showing all the scenarios – even the extreme worst-case scenario, while also delivering the message that these are merely projections, and it's not too late to minimise the damage. We strived for this balance through adding annotations in the 3D merlion scrolly, and also having the second part of the piece solely to highlight many of the existing and planned measures to protect Singapore's coastlines.","We think it's important make complicated topics such as climate change more accessible and understandable to readers who would otherwise not seek out information on this topic. While the 3D visualisation took a lot of work and back-and-forth to get it right and accurate, we believe this is the best way to visualize this data and drive this story home. We also think it's important to consult with the scientific community to make sure we are representing the data as accurately as possible. In addition, as with any other climate change-related topic, it's important to strike that balance between the problem and the solution.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/01/singapore-protect-sea-levels-rise/index.html,,,,,,,,"Charlene Chua, Luo Mingxuan, Ryan Tan, Rachael Lee, Stephanie Adeline, Zachary Tia, Zeke Tan",Charlene Chua - Digital Graphics Journalist; Luo Mingxuan - Designer intern; Ryan Tan - 3D/Designer; Rachael Lee - Designer intern; Stephanie Adeline - Digital Graphics Journalist & project lead; Zachary Tia - Data journalist intern; Zeke Tan - Real-time Graphics Developer;,

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Covid-19: When will Singapore's air travel take off again?,10/12/21,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Map, Lifestyle, Economy","D3.js, Canvas, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV","This story looked at the impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector, and whether the launch of vaccinated travel lanes has brought signs of recovery to Singapore's air travel. We visualised the number of flights departing from Changi Airport over the last two years, to help readers see the extent of the impact on the airline sector and used animated graphics to visualize the trends in air traffic. The interactive graphic also included a quick guide for vaccinated travellers who are hoping to travel.","The story helped readers to evaluate the factors that need to be considered if they wanted to travel during the holiday season. It explained that while we are seeing signs of recovery, it is unlikely that air travel will return to normal anytime soon, given the new variants.","For the opening scrolly, we visualised air traffic using data from flight-tracking site FlightAware. The planes were rendered in Canvas using WebGL renderer PixiJS. Their animation is done using MotionPathPlugin from GSAP.  For the second scrolly, we did a similar visualisation to the intro, but instead of a map, we used a simpler network-style graphic. This was created in illustrator and exported as SVG, then we animated the SVG using CSS and JS based on the data for each routes and each year. The animated planes on this graphic are actually 3 paths on top of each other. We tweaked the widths and dasharrays to make them look like planes. To animate it, we adjusted the dashoffset according to the data.  The boarding pass-style cards that showed the top destinations and their travel requirements were coded in HTML and CSS, and we store the data in a Google Sheets that was pushed to a Json link, which makes it easier for us to update anytime there is new information.  We also used Datawrapper and Adobe Illustrator for the other static charts in the story.","One challenge in creating this project was deciding the best visualisation for the data. We had seen a few data stories on Covid-19's impact on the aviation industry and wanted to differentiate our graphics. We decided on the network graphic because it is a better way to compare the four popular Singapore routes better than using a geographical map, but keeping the planes theme, since it is a memorable visual metaphor.  Another challenge was gathering all the travel restrictions information for the cards, since the information keeps changing rapidly. In the final days before publishing this project, we had a few of our team members check and double-check the information, and we also worked with our aviation reporter who are on top of all the travel updates to make sure our data is up-to-date. For the Covid-19 info, we pulled the data from Our World in Data’s Covid-19 tracker, so that we didn’t have to update it manually.","This story was published in December, when many people are looking to travel, and many are hopeful, but it's also important to explain the risks of traveling to our readers. We wanted to show that things are looking slightly better for the airline industry, but also explain to our readers that travel restrictions may change and for them to be aware of this as they make their travel plans.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Red alert! What can you do to help bring carbon emissions down?,18/10/21,"Explainer, Quiz/game, Infographics, Chart, Environment","D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV","This story aims to emphasize how rapidly we have spent almost 90% of our planet's carbon budget — that is, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere above which the world is guaranteed to see +1.5 deg C rise in temperature because of climate change. For most readers - those born since the 1950s, most of the emissions have happened within their lifetime and this has become a key feature of the interactive.","The red smoke effect adds to the sense of urgency that can be viscerally felt when one is actively scrolling through the first part of the interactive. Everyone who saw this graphic has instantly been able to recall it and understood it's intention - that we don't want to fill up the screen with red smoke. To make it feel like all these changes are happening right now, we also gave users a tool where they can choose their birth year and see how much carbon was emitted during their lifetime.  Finally, it is not just about getting people to care but also trying to look at some probably solutions. We included a heavily curated calcluator that show how a combination of individual, companies and governments-wide measures may help to stop - or even reduce -  further carbon emissions.","We mostly used our in-house scrollytelling component and D3.js for making the main visualizations. In the first component the scroll position is tied to the time flow. You can see the pace increase as you get closer to today. The challenge here was how to consider uncertainty. That's why the edge of smoke container is fuzzy, the clouds curls back and forth from the actual value for any year. We also spent a lot of time looking for a suitable smoke video sample which is wide enough with rather thin bound of curling smoke at the edge.  The second component is based on the first one, only the bar that represents the amount of pollution emitted during your lifetime is added over it.  The third component is a set of check boxes, where you can evaluate how different measures affect the carbon emissions.","The idea here was to make readers feel that it's an urgent issue. It's not a steady process of pollution accumulation but an exponential growth we are witnessing. The hard thing was to choose a symbol which grabs attention and alarms. Eventually we picked the red smoke which is crawling faster and swallowing everything in its way. Carbon emissions are usually depicted as grey smoke, but we chose to use red as it turns out, scientifcally speaking, if we could see carbon in the atmosphere it would be red because of it's heat trapping quality. Design nerd side note, the hex code for red is #CC0022, CO2, get it?  We also felt that often a lot of the conversation is on the individual taking their part in recycling or going vegan but upon investigation, we realised it was a combination of individual, company and goverrment wide efforts that could truly help reach a net zero target something quite heavily discussed at COP26 at the end of 2021. This is why we chose to produce a calculator that can only be brought down close enough to zero if more than two categories are selected. It's heavily curated and simplified to get this point across to the reader.","Sometimes the memorability aspect of a project can be overlooked especially if we have done all the hard work of selecting and curating the right data, content and messaging. The visual cues must be as highly curated and edited as the data insights or text. The closer we can all get to seamless integration of a clear message with a strong visual metaphor, the more memorable our graphics become for our readers to remember long after they've moved on to something else.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2021/10/singapore-carbon-emissions-climate-change/index.html,,,,,,,,"Alyssa Mungcal, Anton Dzeviatau, Rebecca Pazos, Zachary Tia, Nuria Altimir, Oriol Vidal, Victor Garcia","Alyssa Mungcal — UI/UX Designer; Anton Dzeviatau — Data visualisation developer; Rebecca Pazos — Interactive graphics correspondent; Zachary Tia — Data journalist intern; Nuria Altimir, Oriol Vidal, Victor Garcia - initial research and prototyping",
Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Shortlist,,"Supply chains, interrupted. Why a bicycle takes 40 days to reach Singapore",03/12/21,"Investigation, Illustration, Map, Satellite images, Economy","D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","Over the past year, the world’s logistics network has seen unprecedented upheavals, affecting deliveries of everything from bottles of champagne to iPhones. The story uses a bicycle as a case study for the global delays in deliveries. We visualised a pre-disruption delivery timeline and contrasted it to the same delivery amid the global disruptions. The story then looked at the factors influencing the delays, as well as the results of them, with a focus on how congested ports had become since the beginning of 2021.","The topic of supply chain disruptions has been the subject of countless stories published over the past year but few have taken a predominantly visual approach to explaining the topic. It’s a complex subject that spans economics, politics, manufacturing, and a global pandemic. We simplified the idea by providing a scenario that most people can relate to — ordering a product online, making the subject and its impacts easy to understand.","For the introductory scolly section, we used our in-house scrollytelling component coupled with SVGs created in Adobe Illustrator. The SVGs contain multiple layers, which allowed us to manipulate them using CSS and Javascript. The ships and trucks are animated along SVG paths based on how far a reader had scrolled down the page, while other elements are animated using CSS keyframe animations. Elements like the wakes of the ships were made visible or hidden based on how far the ship had travelled since its starting position.  We created the second scrolly using satellite imagery sourced from SentinelHub. We manipulated the images in Photoshop and created SVG annotations in Illustrator and QGIS.  Lastly, the map component near the end of the story was created using D3.js with data from GoComet. The map is rendered as an SVG and is only visible on desktop. On mobile, it is replaced with a dumbbell chart.  ","The idea for the initial scrolly section took a long time to form. As a result, the ideation phase made up a significant amount of the overall time we spent on the project, and the introductory section went through several iterations. We started out wanting to create a globe and zoom into congested ports to display satellite imagery but decided we needed to ground the idea to make it more relatable.  We then settled on the idea of tracking a single product, though our initial thinking was just to have lines running down the page to show the relative trips of the bicycles before and after the disruptions. We eventually decided to go with illustrations to make a serious idea easier to approach and to move away from the abstraction of lines running down a webpage to something more literal that included actual modes of transport.  Another issue we encountered early on was dealing with the sheer amount of data needed to create a visualisation of ships traversing the globe, but as mentioned above we eventually dropped this idea.","Most interactive stories you see are visually quite serious, but it’s acceptable to lighten a serious topic with visuals that a child would understand. This is something we discussed a lot when putting the piece together. Our senior editors were worried about the seriousness of the topic and whether it would resonate with our readers. We brainstormed how we could go about engaging readers and decided to go with more “cutesy” animations as a way to draw readers into the story.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2021/12/global-supply-chain-problems/index.html,,,,,,,,"Alyssa Mungcal, Carlos Marin, Charles Tampus, Christopher Udemans, Joyce Lim, Rachael Lee, Rodolfo Pazos, Xaquín G.V",Alyssa Mungcal: UI/UX designer Carlos Marin: Data visualisation developer Charles Tampus: Web developer Christopher Udemans: Graphics journalist and project lead Joyce Lim: Reporter Rachael Lee: Graphic design intern Rodolfo Pazos: Interactive graphics editor Xaquín G.V.: Data and graphics editor,

The interiors/design of each flat varies based on the decade/year they were built in, saying a lot about the ways people lived over the decades. In the article, we visualised two flats - one built in the 1970s and the other in 2020s - in 3D for a deeper look into how the spaces have changed. We also looked into the other factors at play when building a home, and other societal changes such as having smaller family units.","Housing is a hot topic in Singapore and this hit home for many Singaporean readers. On a local level, there has been talk on how HDB flats have become smaller over the years. Through this, we showed that the size of HDB flats over the decades is not a linear trend. Homes are indeed smaller compared to flats built in the 1980s and 1990s but overall it is larger than flats in the 1960s and 1970s. Readers also got to take a closer look at how the flats have evolved over the years and how specific design choices have been made to suit their lifestyles.","For the introduction scrolly, we used our in house video scrolly template. The visuals were made using blender, with Open Source Map data. We also managed to get data of HDB flats and the years they were built in from Data.gov.sg. Then we were able to animate and color in the blocks gradually according to year, and exported it as a video.  The other two floor map scrollys were mostly built with Blender and Premiere pro. The modelling, highlighting, and animation were done on blender, and final refinements were done on premiere pro. We did the modelling using the floorplan of the particular flat, then added in simple furniture and materials from the blender kit online library. The last step was to use premiere pro to composite the animation and create the smooth transitions between the frame with no-highlights to the frame with highlights.  We also created an animated top down overview of Toa Payoh, the town we were focusing on in this piece. This was actually a last minute addition to the piece. We used an old code from a previous project and updated the infomation with the latest data and geojson.  The other graphics were also datawrapper charts and SVGs.","The greatest challenge for this project was obtaining the right type of flats to show true comparison over time in terms of lifestyle changes from 70s till now.  Also, the top down map animation was also a last minute inclusion to the piece and we had few days to work that out. It was a code that was written by one of our ex-developers two years ago, and we had to figure out the logic and then update the code with new data and make it work on our existing framework. Code is sometimes not as reuseable as we'd like to think!","That even interactives can be profile driven. I think with interactive stories it can sometimes be difficult to have that human aspect to it, and we made it a point to include the profiles relatively high up in the story to bring out the human aspect in the story. Without the humans and profiles, I think the story could have still worked. We could still show the structrual changes in the interiors of the two flats, but adding the profiles gave it another dimension, reminding readers that these are not just spaces but it is the homes of your average Singaporeans and their aspirations, which helped to make the story more engaging and relatable for the local reader.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2021/12/millennial-hdb-design-singapore/index.html,,,,,,,,"Carlos Marin, Charlene Chua, Choo Yun Ting, Rachael Lee, Rebecca Pazos, Ryan Tan",Carlos Marin: Data visualisation developer Charlene Chua: Digital graphics journalist Choo Yun Ting: Journalist Rachael Lee: Designer intern Rebecca Pazos: Interactive graphics correspondent Ryan Tan: 3D/Designer,

However, the constantly growing death counts had left people numb and confused. This story took a unique visualisation approach in the hope to break the numbness. We connected the visual metaphor of condolence flowers with death counts in an attempt to humanize the number and serve as a reminder for lives that have been cut short by the virus.  ","The piece was one of the most well-read interactives of the month on our site. Given that it’s almost two years into the pandemic, it was quite a challenge for a repetitive theme to attract this much attention from the audience. In addition, this project was one of the first nontraditional charts our graphics desk has been published so far. It introduces more visual possibilities our newsroom can offer for our readers.","1) We conducted visual research and mood boarding in Miro to collect and organise references from publications that had put up visual pieces when the global Covid-19 death count passed the one million mark. And then we came up with the flower visualisation concept as a digital memorial to pay tribute to the lost lives.  2) Data wrangling and visualisation prototype are both done in Observable notebooks. The notebooks allow us to work collaboratively and transparently to easily iterate the design of a nontraditional look of a chart. We first used Arquero, a JavaScript library to perform dplyr-like data queries, to transform Covid-19 data sourced from Our World in Data (OWID). Then we imported the data from one data-wrangling notebook to another to test out different types of flowers with D3.js to encode time series data with animation.  3) We exported SVGs from Observable notebooks and refined the layout in illustrator. The top scrolly made with Vue.js then animate different layers in SVGs with CSS as users scroll through. The bottom exploratory tool adapted D3.js code from Observable notebook and turned it into a Vue.js component.  4) To engage our readers throughout, we relied on the classic Martini glass narration structure to lay out the key moments and details almost two years into the pandemic. It stats with explanatory scrolly to take readers through ebbs and flows of the pandemic globally. Next, it narrows down to profile five countries of interest and lastly it offered an animated exploratory tool for readers to learn more about the situation in each continent.  ",The most challenging part is conceptualisation since the topic has been covered extensively with all types of charts when the world first cross one million deaths. It took us quite some effort to come up with a visualisation solution that is both refreshing and meaningful. Another challenge lies in turning the intricate SVGs performant as they are rendered in a browser. It took trial and error to optimise the file size of our SVG with several layers.  ,The main takeaway from this project is how to report a topic that has been covered extensively. We deliberately stayed away from charts that other publications have already used. We also drew inspirations outside the visualisation world - the Japanese funeral floral arrangements - for an organic look of the layout.  This time we have also incorporated Observable into our workflow from data wrangling to visualisation. This allows us to make quick updates as live data came in from OWID. We were able to put together an interactive demo for our editors to facilitate the discussion.,English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2021/10/covid19-5million-deaths/index.html,,,,,,,,"Arvind Jayaram, Charles Tampus, Christopher Udemans, Leonard Lai, Rodolfo Pazos, Spe Chen, Xaquín G.V.","Arvind Jayaram: Assistant foreign editor Charles Tampus: Web developer Christopher Udemans: Graphics journalist Leonard Lai: Assistant digital editor Rodolfo Pazos: Interactive graphics editor Spe Chen: Data visualisation designer and project lead Xaquín G.V.: Data and graphics editor Correspondents: Timothy Goh in Singapore, Debarshi Dasgupta in India, Arlina Arshad in Indonesia, Wahyudi Soeriaatmadja in Indonesia, Nadirah H.

United Kingdom,BBC News,Big,Participant,,World now sees twice as many days over 50C,13/09/21,"Breaking news, Map, Environment","QGIS, R, RStudio, Python","The BBC investigated how climate change had made extremely hot days above 50C a more common phenomenon globally. Our unique analysis of 15 billion datapoints found the average number of extremely hot days in a year has doubled since the 1980s and now occurs in more areas.  Global average temperatures are rising, but abstract increases of 1C and 2C are experienced differently in different places. In the hottest regions, exceptional heat is becoming the norm. Our study of extreme temperatures shows some of the present-day impacts of a changing climate. This data story launched the BBC Life at 50C series. ","The breaking news story of our results was published on the BBC News website and received more than a million page views on its first day. The article included an animated data visualisation showing the change in the number of days over 50C over the past four decades, which was featured on social media and had high engagement. The full story was also published on 19 BBC World Service language sites, including Arabic, Persian, Punjabi, Chinese and Spanish, with hundreds of thousands of additional readers. The English version had an above-average proportion of young readers in the 18-24 age group.  The BBC World Service’s Life at 50C series, which was kicked off the same day, ultimately spanned eight short documentary films promoted on the BBC TV, News website, and YouTube channel in the lead up to the COP26 climate summit. The films showcased people’s experiences of extreme heat in a range of environments worldwide and featured the core findings of our analysis. On the day of publication, multiple BBC broadcasts carried our data findings and clips of the first film in the Life at 50C series, including BBC Two’s flagship current affairs programme Newsnight where it led the news agenda. TV news reports and radio programmes promoted discussion of the current impacts of more days over 50C on people across the world and how an increasing rise in extremes could change livelihoods even further in future.  The data story received some very positive feedback and was shared online by leading climate scientists. The key results were also picked up and featured by a number of specialist websites covering climate change, such as Carbon Brief, as well as other media outlets across the world, for example in Nigeria and Greece. ","We used the programming language Python to download the high-resolution ERA5 dataset on maximum temperatures and stored the files in the cloud-based storage space Dropbox. The data included a temperature value for every day between 1980 and 2020 in over one million grid cells covering the globe. In total we worked with more than 15 billion datapoints.  We used another programming language, R, to compute our entire analysis. Our scripts were routinely shared in GitHub to facilitate easy collaboration.  The data comprised 492 ‘netcdf’ files, which required special tools to work with. Each file contained a grid, with each cell value representing the underlying geographic area.  For every unique location, we identified the number of days when the maximum temperature exceeded 50C in all 41 years covered by our dataset. We then imported the annual data into QGIS mapping software and scaled the points by the number of days over 50C. We animated these maps for our published story, first building a prototype in Flourish. The final product was made bespoke by BBC designers and developers with accommodations made for languages, accessibility needs and low-speed internet. Our analysis employed several common methods used to determine climatological change over time. A 30-year average baseline, known as a climatology, mediates variability in historical temperature datasets and helps measure the significance of temperature change in a separate period. We compared the average number of days over 50C for a recent period of 10 years (2010-2019) against an earlier climatology (1980-2009). We did this for unique locations as well as the global average.  To map the global change, we again used QGIS and a colour scale developed together with a climate scientist. We applied a mask to conceal sea areas and a smoothing technique to reduce the pixelated appearance of the grid cells.","The core challenge we faced in our analysis was the lack of existing and credible research on our chosen metric of 50C. The inability to cross-reference our results with similar figures by established institutions put a heavy burden on our verification processes. This was labour-intensive and time-consuming and necessitated frequent communication with a range of climate experts.  To a lesser degree, the huge scale of the dataset was challenging. We analysed all 15 billion datapoints on our local machines by running a series of R scripts specifically coded to respect the limitations of our processing power while still producing viable results.  We repeated the entire analysis multiple times. Twice we recalculated at lower thresholds, 45C and 40C, to confirm our results at 50C were consistent with the global trend and not a unique phenomenon. As days reaching 50C is still a relatively rare event globally, an analysis focused on that high value could be susceptible to higher variability and changes risked being attributed purely to chance.  We repeated the analysis again comparing a non-standard 20-year climatology (1980-1999) against a 20-year current period (2000-2019), to confirm that the trend was not unique to the most recent years. And we calculated each decadal average individually to determine that the trends were consistent. We even cross-referenced our results for specific grid cells with weather station data, where this was available and robust enough to sense-check accuracy.  Finally, we asked non-affiliated climate scientists to check our methodology and findings with different climate datasets. They were able to achieve similar and similarly significant outcomes, which ensured we were consistent with the broader body of climate science. Through this process, we were successful in providing a robust contribution to the understanding of rising extreme temperatures around the world.","Collaboration with multiple experts is key to producing a story of this type. The threshold of 50C we were attempting to analyse was higher than most climate scientists typically attempt, and the ones we worked with were equally keen to know our results. Their expertise was critical to choosing the appropriate dataset, developing a strong methodology and verifying the findings. Any journalist should be sure to use the appropriate dataset for the job. We used the ERA5 reanalysis dataset because it has the most reliable measurements for the entire globe over an extended period. Reanalysis data is a combination of actual weather observations from sources such as stations and satellites with data from modern weather forecasting models. The process fills in gaps created by poor station coverage in many parts of the world and ensures a dependable longterm history of temperature measurements in all locations. There are strengths and weaknesses to any climate dataset. In the case of ERA5, the robust global coverage meant that the area size represented by each grid cell was larger than that of a weather station. ERA5 maximum temperature records did not precisely match the weather station maximum temperature records in a given place, but they were still reflective of the average maximum weather measurements of the area. Large datasets, such as ERA5 or other climate data, require patience and time to analyse and to verify the findings multiple ways. There may also be a learning curve to understand how to work with the specialist filetypes. But with support from experts and a strong methodology a journalist can find unique stories even in well trodden territory like climate science. We hope our story can  encourage our fellow journalists to pursue similar intensive and groundbreaking analyses of climate data at a global or regional scale. ","English, Arabic, Gujarati, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean, Spanish, Persian, Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Serbian, Swahili, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Marathi, Chinese, Telugu",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-58494641,https://www.bbc.com/hindi/science-58557859,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyiRXBBdB4Y,https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000zqsy/newsnight-13092021,https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0011h0g/life-at-50c-special,https://www.instagram.com/p/CT9w7KtIUbD/,https://www.tempo.com/noticias/ciencia/dias-de-calor-extremo-acima-de-50-c-estao-aumentando-em-todo-o-globo-mudanca-climatica.html,,"Nassos Stylianou, Becky Dale, Prina Shah, Sana Jasemi, Joy Roxas, Catriona Morrison, Becky Rush, Scott Jarvis, Alison Benjamin, Namak Khoshnaw, Stephanie Stafford, Monica Garnsey.","The BBC's Data Journalism team led the investigation and analysis of the climate data and also wrote and produced the final interactive story.

Our data analysis shows that the number of fastfood franchises and other unhealthy food shops such as ice cream parlors, kebab shops and pizza takeaway joints have increased by 30% in the last 10 years. The analysis not only paints a national picture, but also shows the changes at neighborhood level. With this detailed dataset we created an interactive story where text and visualizations change based on where the reader lives.","Pointer creates interactive scroll stories more often, but usually they (don't yet) do so well in terms of readership when you consider how much work it takes. This production, on the other hand, did very well and is ranked 11th (out of hundreds) on our list of best read pieces of 2021! The news about 30% increase for unhealthy food stores and the 15% decrease of fresh food stores (greengrocers, fishmongers, bakers) did well. It was picked up twice by a national newspaper. A half-hour item was built around it on national broadcast radio. Many food interest groups that try to influence political policy published the news and link to the interactive on their blog. The interactive and follow-up article with figures per municipality were widely shared and published by regional news websites. Municipal politicians indicated that they do not yet have the right legislation to ban fast food chains in places. We also made a TV broadcast about the rise of unhealthy food stores. The broadcast was very well viewed for Pointer and Dutch standards: 300,000 (mean) viewers watched it. After publishing the interactive, articles and the TV broadcast, our inbox was flooded with positive reactions from doctors and scientists. The created dataset will be used in more coming publications that teaches us more about the rise of junkfood in our daily lifes. Further questions we want to explore: Are we increasingly tempted to buy junk food on our way to work? Are teenagers more exposed to junk food as they used to be? In neighbourhoods where the majority of residents have low income the increase in junk food providers is greatest. Do we see that reflected in the obesity numbers as well?","Underlying the entire project is a data analysis in R. A dataset with the (40,000+) locations of all food stores and the categories they are classified in and a GeoJSON with all over 7,000 neighbourhood boundaries of the Netherlands were combined to calculate the changes from the number of food stores from 2011 to 2021. As a third dataset we used the dataset on the share of overweight people per neighbourhood from the RIVM (the Dutch CDC or ECDC). To share the figures, findings and conclusions with developers and less tech-savvy colleagues I created a Rmarkdown report (although not officially published, it's in the project links below). This report contains the context, documentation of the datasets, choices made, interactive tables and graphs. My colleague with whom I also wrote the articles was not specifically focused on data at first, but this webpage turned out to be a valuable research source for her. For the interactive, our data journalist worked closely with developers and designer from the beginning. Our designer created wireframes of the entire production in Figma. The rest of the team could leave comments for improvement on each artboard. It turned out to be a good way to consult visually from a distance (because Covid-19). Apart from the look and feel of the interactive the designer made the video, embedded in the production, stand out. Then the developer built the web page. The data journalist and developer worked closely together to get all the ideas and data challenges working. The interactive is built using mainly Vue, Openlayers and Mapbox. In the data analysis all kinds of choices are made that influence the final result. Choices that didn't make the production are explained in a separate article, because numbers are not objective.","- No open data of this level of detail was available. As an exception, we bought a dataset from a research bureau that maunaly and regularly checks whether every store in the Netherlands is still there, where it is located and what it sells (in categories of our chamber of commerce). - Next, we could not simply link the store data to the neighborhood boundaries because of non-present neighborhood codes. We decided to plot coordinates in the polygons of the neighborhood borders. This allowed us to calculate the number of locations per neighborhood and show them on the map within the right borders. - The data journalist had as output one big CSV. For a sufficient browser performance, our developer had to serve this file in multiple usable JSON files. - Visualization-wise, another problem was that we had a unique id number of the store location, but not of the company itself. We solved this by showing the actual situation of 2011 and 2021. - Next to smoking and alcohol use, obesity is the biggest cause of disease in the Netherlands (which is the case in many countries). Experts even speak of obesity as: 'a pandemic in slow-motion'. - But there is still a persistent misconception among many people that healthy eating is an individual responsibility ('overweight people have no discipline'), and that government intervention would be patronizing. - While research shows that we make as many as 200 food choices per day, 90% of which are unconscious. For years, many scientists have pointed to the changing food environment as one of the main causes of obesity. - Pointer decided to visualize the unhealthy street environment and show how making the healthy choice is becoming increasingly difficult. At the neighbourhood level, so that it comes much closer to the reader's","Our regional analyses at the neighborhood and municipality level allowed journalists from local websites and newspapers to create their own stories. This was particularly well picked up because we included an interactive table in one article. In the context of transparency, our data journalist made an article about which choices are at the basis of the conclusions made. This can teach journalists that objective figures do not actually exist, but that figures should always be understood in a broader context. Hopefully it will inspire other journalists to publish more transparently about their work. In addition to interactive tables or maps, we actually always try to publish the raw data behind our data stories so that people interested can replicate our analyses. Unfortunately, that was not possible this time because we bought data from a commercial party. With his Rmarkdown webpage, our data journalist inspired his fellow developer (who also does her own research) to document and present her data research in similar Jupyter notebooks from now on. It seems like a small thing, but this way data research becomes much more accessible to journalists outside of our data team. A next step is to publish these Notebooks as well.

United Kingdom,The i newspaper,Big,Participant,,The English Channel Migrants' Dinghy Tragedy,04/12/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Breaking news, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Politics, Immigration, Brexit, Crime, Human rights","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, R, RStudio","One of the biggest stories of 2021 was the desperate efforts by migrants to cross the English Channel in small boats – a story which made headlines around the world in November following the deaths of at least 27 people when their dinghy sank. The i paper used a pioneering method of analysing maritime and aviation tracking data obtained through open sources, combined with traditional journalism methods, to reveal how the migrant boat sinking unfolded. This was part of a wider project to understand the extent of the small boat crisis using data obtained under FOI laws.","Our stories on the migrant boat crossings have had more than 40,000 page views in 2021 and have fed into the UK and international debate on the issue. With human rights bodies calling for an inquiry into the November dinghy sinking, they provide evidence of what took place. At a time of our investigation, there was little information in the public domain and little transparency about what had happened in the Channel. Our investigation was able, for the first time, to give an account of how the tragedy unfolded, miles out to sea, over a period of 24 hours. The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency initially declined to confirm details of its operations as the tragedy was unfolding but, following our investigation, confirmed that it rescued three other boats during a search operation launched on the night of the sinking. i’s data reporter Tom Saunders analysed and mapped the location data, which was obtained and explained by investigations reporter Dean Kirby. We also used traditional reporting techniques, with i’s chief reporter Cahal Milmo travelling to Calais to interview migrants, and interviewing British and French officials. Economics editor David Parsley and deputy political editor Arj Singh also working on the initial story. The investigation has shown what can be achieved by reporters using tracking data alongside other reporting methods – and will act as a model for others to follow. The story followed an investigation in the summer, using data obtained from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency under FOI, which was able to show for the first time the full extent of the migrant crossings and how the people smugglers were operating. In that project, we interviewed migrants who had survived the crossing, as well French police sources and human rights groups in the UK, France and Tunisia.","We used QGIS to analyse and clip elements that were relevant to the investigation which could be found within the bounding box of the data we received. This included maritime boundaries along with land borders in SHP file format. We clipped these files to the boundary box of the data we received then exported them for use within R. We then used R and the readr package to read the AIS data as a delimited text file. Using base R we can convert the timestamps to POSIXct. We then filtered for different types of ships that may be relevant to the investigation such as lifeboats, military boats and border force ships. By orientating the data by timestamp and ship we were then able to plot the path of the relevant ships throughout the time period. This was done through simple features and RGDAl packages which allowed us to plot the delimited file on top of geospatial data. Then using the geosphere package we were able to use the Haversine formula to calculate the distance between points of interest such as the distance between the mayday call and the flight path of the helicopter. By splitting the time into 3-hour sections we then were able to analyse the path of ships to identify the different types of rescue manoeuvers that both the aircraft and ships took while looking for the dingy.","The hardest part of this project was combing through thousands of data points in one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to identify the ships that were relevant to our investigation and then plotting that data in order to analyse in detail the paths taken by the different rescue crews. It was also difficult to combine the delimited AIS data with the geospatial data in a meaningful way. It was an essential part of our analysis, but the raw data was not easy to incorporate particularly when you consider that we had to plot in three dimensions, taking into account not just the longitude and latitude of each shape but the time and the orientation of each ship at each given moment. We worked under considerable time pressure to break a new, exclusive line on a story which was being probed by journalists around the world. Our findings created additional pressures as they were initially at odds with what officials were saying, but ultimately led to them confirming our findings.","Other journalists can learn that data journalism and geospatial analysis has just as much application in breaking news environments as it does in a slower cycle of longer-form investigative journalism. The data analysis of the dinghy sinking that we carried out was essential to building out the rest of the piece and unlike many investigations, it was the first part of the puzzle, rather than the last thing to be included in the finished article. On top of this, journalists can also realise the value of quick and efficient data analysis as a way to further breaking news stories. We were able to work on this analysis in two separate directions. Firstly, the data was analysed and rudimentary graphics were distributed to journalists on the scene who could use it as a tool for directing their enquiries while on a separate track we worked on presenting the data in a legible format that would work for both our print and online audiences.",English,https://inews.co.uk/news/english-channel-migrants-dinghy-tragedy-border-force-calsi-dover-coastguard-rescue-france-uk-1334976,https://inews.co.uk/news/uk-rescue-teams-calais-migrants-channel-scramble-1332663,https://inews.co.uk/news/channel-migrant-disaster-coastguard-dinghy-sank-rescue-boats-uk-border-force-1334710,https://inews.co.uk/news/migrants-calais-channel-crossing-kurdish-chef-1321402,https://inews.co.uk/news/calais-migrants-determind-cross-channel-france-uk-dinghy-tragedy-deaths-1319810,https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/channel-crossings-desperate-migrants-gangs-trafficking-decoy-tiny-boats-first-class-refugees-1081211,https://inews.co.uk/news/long-reads/channel-migrants-crossings-calais-people-smugglers-small-boat-1081333?ito=twitter_share_article-top,,"Thomas Saunders, Dean Kirby, Cahal Milmo, David Parsley, Arj Singh","This investigation was carried out by staff reporters at i paper, a national UK newspaper based in London. Thomas Saunders is the paper's data journalist.

It also reveals the suffering of the local population with epidemics, diseases and stray dogs due to the spread of these corpses in very large numbers.","During field work on this investigation, we discovered the presence of 50 bodies of women and children in one of the destroyed houses, and the authorities were able to retrieve those bodies. We were also able, through the investigation, to reveal the involvement of the governor of Nineveh in giving orders to bulldoze archaeological areas in the old city of Mosul.

The Botometer came in handy for checking the identity of many accounts on Twitter that were spreading the news about the numbers of casualties and missing persons in the battle of Mosul.","The most difficult part in this investigation was the great danger represented by the presence of explosive belts, mines and other ordnance, which we had to deal with ​while documenting the presence and spread of corpses under the rubble of destroyed buildings and neighborhoods in the city of Mosul. Thousands of explosive belts, explosives, bombs and mines are still scattered with the corpses, and many corpses of ISIS fighters still have unexploded belts on them, and sometimes we had to take risks to take pictures and shoot videos. These were hard times, especially as it coincided with the spread of COVID-19, which exacerbated the risk.","If there is one thing that can be learned from this investigation and all the investigations in which journalists take risks to expose a problem in the system or society, it is to appreciate the high value of the task of a free press to improve life on the globe, and to deliver the voices of people whose voice is not reaching the world as it should.",English,https://assafirarabi.com/en/37783/2021/05/18/the-other-war-living-with-corpses-and-stray-dogs-in-the-city-of-mosul/,,,,,,,,Mizar Kemal,"Mizar Kemal Iraqi Journalist  Second prize: Fetisov Journalism Awards 2020 (Outstanding Contribution to Peace).

United States,Quartz,Big,Participant,,We read the 4000-page IPCC climate report so you don't have to,10/08/21,"Explainer, Environment","Json, Node.js","The final IPCC climate report is nearly 4,000 pages long—much of it written in inscrutable scientific jargon. We reviewed the data, summarized the main points, and created an interactive way to read the report all while showing scientists’ confidence in their conclusions. It made the daunting and technical report accessible to everyday readers around the world who want to understand the scientific evidence of man-made global warming.","In a crowded field of coverage our report stood out. Our readers raved about the work, calling it “one of the best summaries” of the report, and “a thorough but easily digestible breakdown.” Data visualization expert Jon Schwabish said that he “loves this” and world renowned data designer Jan Willem Tulp said that our display “should be the default in the report itself” Even months after publication this work is averaging thousands of visitors a month. Reflecting the gloabl importance of the climate change readers have come to this story from almost every country on earth, from Peru to Rwanda, Tajikistan to Laos. In total, people in 179 countries have read it according to our analytics.  ","We structured the data as ArchieML to mark up the text from the report, then used a templating language called pug to create the HTML and styled it with CSS. The interactive features were custom written in javascript.","The hardest part of this project was converting the text of the report and inline plain-text confidence levels into structured data. Because the report was released in a PDF format, and the peculiarities of the document couldn’t be known ahead of time, we determined that extracting the information using software would have been more error prone and possibly time consuming.

They can also learn that journalism doesn’t need to be wordy to be successful at deeply informing people. This piece is more comprehensive than most of the news coverage published around the report. They can also learn that different work isn't always needed to serve different types of readers. The format and structure of this piece serves readers of all interest levels:  For readers who want a quick summary it is skimmable.

We were blown away by the consistent excellence in data analysis and reporting, across a wide variety of stories. We very much agreed with the citation letter: The work ""challenges mainstream myths about crime and punishment and empowers community members to use data to hold the powerful accountable."" It is particularly impressive that such strong work was done on the subject of the incarcerated, a population that can be challenging to cover using the customary tools and techniques of journalism. The Marshall Project's effort to create a community of the incarcerated in order to center stories around those voices and experiences is an example for us all.",Millions of People with Felonies Can Now Vote. Most Don't Know it.,23/06/21,"Investigation, Open data, Infographics, Elections, Politics, Crime","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","After several battleground states reinstated the right to vote for people formerly incarcerated for felonies, we undertook a complex data investigation that revealed that no more than 1-in-4 of them registered to vote in time for the 2020 election. We used text messaging to directly engage with people who were newly able to vote in Nevada, Kentucky, Iowa and New Jersey. Many of the people we spoke with didn’t know they were eligible to vote; our investigation showed that states do little to notify them of their restored rights.","This reporting opened the door to a legislative resolution in Nebraska to study voting among formerly incarcerated people. As the resolution states, “data and system errors have impermissibly disenfranchised eligible voters from participation in the election process.”  The resolution exists in large part because of Nicole Lewis’s nuanced reporting in the story, and Andrew R. Calderón’s detailed description of how to unearth and contextualize such data  that demonstrated to civil society groups like the ACLU that such a study is feasible and explained how to conduct it efficiently.  The nature of the system means impact will be slow to materialize, but as the pending legislation in Nebraska shows, we believe that over time the exposure of the ways voting participation is still stymied can affect tens of thousands of people. Our story was co-published by the Louisville Courier-Journal and USA Today Network, appearing in the Des Moines Register, the Reno Gazette-Journal and several Gannett newspapers in New Jersey. That helped bring the issue to the forefront nationally and in the states we analyzed. The project also raised awareness of the issue through media appearances on CBS News, NBC/Peacock on Zerlina Maxwell's show along with two more NBC Now appearances, and NPR and WBUR’s Here And Now.  It was also covered by Politico and Talking Points Memo.","Entity matching: We used Python to join the datasets. Early iterations of the project used natural language processing tools like Dedupe, but we were happily able to simplify the problem to the point where we could use more straight-forward techniques.   Surveying: We used Typeform to design and build a custom survey to embed on our site.   SMS (text messaging): We used the Twilio API to run our direct survey of formerly incarcerated people in Kentucky.    Cloud computing: We tracked and logged our SMS survey using Docker containers running on Amazon Elastic Cluster Service (ECS). We used Terraform to manage the stack, allowing us to quickly deploy serious computational resources but only pay for what we actually used and avoid long-term maintenance debt.   Observable notebooks for sharing results with the editorial team. These included editorial analysis, but also helped show the status and results of the SMS survey for internal use.   D3.js to visualize the percentage of potential voters who registered.","Our nuanced approach to understanding the data behind this project made this project unusual for a newsroom. Despite the fact that nearly every state purges people from the voter rolls once they go to prison, few states keep track of how many formerly incarcerated people re-register once they are released. This makes assessing the success of the re-enfranchisement laws incredibly difficult. We had to figure out how to do our analysis with imperfect and ambiguous data, using only publically accessible records.  We developed a methodology for joining voting records with release records that was conservative but accurate (“at least one in four”). By using complex logic based on release date, age at release, and name, we were able to set an accurate but fair minimum value. Another challenge was building relationships with formerly incarcerated people who had been re-enfranchised. When we did our survey, we got negative responses from people who it seemed didn’t want to talk about their experience with the criminal justice system. There is a stigma associated with incarceration . Upon release, people often want to focus on re-entry rather than their time behind bars. Fortunately, we came in contact with a source through our SMS campaign in Kentucky who was willing to share her story, and her anger that the Kentucky government had not done more to inform her that she had the right to vote in the 2020 election.","Generally speaking, this project demonstrates that entity resolution problems in datasets from multiple sources can sometimes be solved with simple techniques available to many newsrooms. It also demonstrates how journalists can answer a question that the government has not answered using the government’s own data from multiple agencies. And it shows how journalists can use release records and data about prisoners to answer questions about a topic like voting, and similarly how voter rolls are a powerful source of useful information for many kinds of journalistic inquiry.   More specifically, journalists can learn from Andrew R. Calderón’s open methodology on how to measure voting patterns of people released from prison. For practical reasons, we did not consider all states that re-enfranchised people with felony records. In addition, the analytical techniques we used are not limited to states that recently gave people with felony records the right to vote – these techniques could be applied to other questions about the voting patterns of formerly incarcerated people.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/06/23/millions-of-people-with-felonies-can-now-vote-most-don-t-know-it,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/07/01/how-many-people-convicted-of-felonies-are-registered-to-vote-in-your-state,,,,,,,"Nicole Lewis, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, David Eads, Susan Chira","Story and engagement reporting: Nicole Lewis, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón Data and engineering: Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, David Eads Editors: Susan Chira and David Eads",
United States,"The Marshall Project, Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, The New York Times, Lexington Herald-Leader",Big,Participant,,High rates of fatal police shootings in rural communities draw little attention,13/08/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Politics, Crime, Gun violence","Json, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python","High-profile police shootings in cities have set off protests across the country. But police in rural areas have fatally shot about 200 people a year since 2015, our investigation found, with little scrutiny. Rural shootings are in many ways similar to urban shootings: the dead are mostly men who are often suffering from drug addiction or mental health problems. But in rural areas, those shot by police are mostly White. The agency with the largest number of rural shootings was the Kentucky State Police; its troopers don’t wear body cameras and have never been prosecuted for a shooting.","Our investigation – which was co-reported with the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting and co-published The New York Times and the Lexington Herald-Leader – found that police shootings in isolated areas are rarely captured on video, and many rural officers don’t wear body cameras. We found many disputes about what happened during shooting incidents. Shortly after our stories were published, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear requested millions of dollars to equip troopers with body cameras. Some local media used our reporting on the troopers to inform their own work and both editorial boards and advocacy organizations including the ACLU called for changes at the state police. Having The New York Times as a media partner and two publishing partners in Kentucky ensured our reporting would be widely seen, both locally and nationally.","GIS tools: The analysis made extensive use of GeoPandas for the initial analysis and PostGIS for the final analysis and review.    Geospatial joining of disparate datasets: We combined geographic data from the US Census, police shooting data from Kentucky as well national datasets published by the Washington Post and Mapping Police Violence, and applied an urban/suburban/rural classification scheme published by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.   The project also involved significant work with records requests and document-based research, as well as legal challenges to enforce public-records laws.","The data reporting for this project was laborious. Reporters Alysia Santo and Weihua Li used a database to mark the locations of police shootings between 2015 and 2020. They then worked to determine whether the shootings had taken place in rural, suburban or urban areas. There is no universal classification for what qualifies as a rural area, so they tested the police shooting data in several different government systems. They settled on the Department of Housing and Urban Development's system, which uses survey information from people about their communities to define rural areas. In Kentucky, figuring out who had been fatally shot by officers, and what exactly happened in each incident was no small feat. State police wouldn't provide answers, so The Marshall Project and KyCIR used public records requests to build a database of fatal shootings by troopers. Obtaining the documents necessary for this required a legal battle, including multiple appeals. Eventually, the Kentucky attorney general found that the agency violated the state's open records law when it denied The Marshall Project's request. Santo submitted records requests for each of the 41 fatal shootings by Kentucky state troopers in the previous five years. She built a database with those records, which allowed the reporters to search what kind of call officers responded to and whether the people who were shot had been armed, had a history of mental illness or were intoxicated. Of the 41 shootings, 33 were in rural areas of Kentucky. Despite restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Santo and R.G. Dunlop, a reporter with the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting, interviewed more than 100 people and reviewed dozens of court cases and thousands of pages of police investigative reports. Santo researched obituaries, and used Facebook and other public records databases to find family members of the",We hope this project will inspire other journalists to look at police shooting deaths in their states that aren’t getting attention and figure out what happened.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Shortlist,,Sacrifice Zones: Mapping Cancer-Causing Industrial Air Pollution,02/11/21,"Investigation, News application, Map, Environment, Health","Personalisation, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, OpenStreetMap, Python","In a groundbreaking interactive-first investigation that the EPA’s own staffers praised as “a wake-up call,” ProPublica revealed more than 1,000 hot spots of cancer-causing industrial air pollution that the agency allowed to take root across America. These are “sacrifice zones.” Residents pay the price so that consumers can enjoy products made there. We captured the ways EPA has failed to protect the public, not just through weak policies, but through deliberate choices recounted to us on the record by insiders. This project was conceived by journalists on our interactive data team and grew to include expertise from across our newsroom.","The project, which the EPA’s own staffers praised as “a wake-up call” and “a huge bucket of cold water in the face,”  led to the kind of impact environmental advocates said they had been working for decades to achieve. Two days after the first parts were published, the EPA announced that its administrator Michael S. Regan would visit the communities we featured; on his tour, he said the agency had “looked very carefully” at ProPublica’s reporting and was “incorporating much of it” into plans for reform, which include increasing air monitoring and enforcement and reexamining the way the agency assesses cancer risk. New cumulative risk assessment guidelines are expected to be released in early 2022, along with an updated “more robust” analysis of air pollution. In response to our reporting, officials launched air monitoring efforts in Laredo, Texas and Pascagoula, Mississippi.  The investigation, which we distributed to impacted communities through an unprecedented engagement effort, also led to a groundswell of activism among residents, many of whom said they had been unaware of the dangers they’d faced. Residents lobbied for air monitoring, packed town halls, circulated petitions, started neighborhood health surveys, and called for the CDC to conduct blood testing on schoolchildren.  More than 60 local TV stations aired segments about our analysis; at least 16 local newspapers did the same. Their stories extended our impact — an article in a Michigan newspaper led state officials to investigate a polluter that had never been permitted; a Missouri television station’s report prompted such outrage that the EPA called a meeting in Verona, Missouri in response to community outrage over the extreme cancer risks we revealed. “As soon as I saw that report, I knew I needed to come down here tonight,” Greg Winters told us at the meeting. “It pissed me off.”","We used five years of the EPA's Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) database, along with EPA's Toxics Release Inventory to generate estimated additional cancer risks from industrial emissions down to 810 x 810 meter grid cells for the whole country. We averaged values over the years 2014-2018 to get a better idea of long term exposure. We used US Census data to determine racial disparities in cancer risk from industrial emissions. We obtained all of this data through online government servers.    At around 7 billion rows, our data was too large to use the analysis tools we’d normally use, so we turned to  Google BigQuery. Using BigQuery, we were able to compute cancer risks at an incredibly high resolution -- each grid cell in our analysis represents a quarter of a square mile of the country. We used Ruby and Python to write a clustering algorithm that generated ""hot spots"" around areas that represented estimated lifetime cancer risks from industrial emissions of above 1 in 100,000. We used R to do our race analysis. We used Ruby, Python (with rasterio) and Photoshop to generate static maps of high risk zones. To make our interactive map, we took the result of our analysis and compressed it into mbtiles format with tippecanoe. We then designed the interactive map with Mapbox Studio and wrote a JavaScript web application using Vue.js and the Mapbox API to geocode user input, query the data and surface it for readers. The web application also included d3.js charts for individual results.","Five years of EPA modeled industrial chemical concentrations added up to about 7 billion rows of data. Turning the disaggregated concentration data into cancer risks required learning how big data systems worked, and then learning how to distill the outputs into something that could be served in a web application and queried on the fly. It took the better part of a year to develop that pipeline. But once we had initial findings, we ran into another issue: the quality of the government’s data. Because the EPA doesn’t directly monitor the air, it accepts self-reported emissions estimates that companies often derive using flawed formulas. The EPA does little to check the accuracy of these numbers and failed to catch major errors that our reporters began to spot. To publish an analysis we could trust, the entire reporting team undertook a vast, weekslong data quality scrub that the agency had never bothered to do. The scrub led more than two dozen facilities to correct their data with the EPA and for agency officials to admit that the EPA needs to do a better job of ensuring data integrity. We then wrote software to reintegrate those updated submissions into our overall analysis. From the very start, we recognized that all of this technical work would amount to little, however, if it neglected to serve the people in these hot spots. We launched the most ambitious and far-ranging community engagement endeavor ProPublica has ever undertaken to make sure our work reached those most impacted by the risks we’d uncovered. We reported on the ground in 10 states and mailed postcards to 8,800 homes. In the end we heard from more than 1,000 impacted residents across 34 states, many of whom had been unaware of the dangers posed by nearby facilities.","Cross-newsroom collaborations yield incredible results. The custom analysis undertaken by our newsroom’s data journalists for over a year laid a foundation upon which we could tell uniquely authoritative stories. Seven reporters then joined in the effort to illuminate how and why these hot spots came to be. Together, the team distilled our findings— powered by billions of rows of data, countless records and scores of interviews— into lucid language with a clear presentation. Our visuals team, for instance, developed an interactive graphic to teach readers about cumulative risk—a concept they needed to see to understand. We learned that giving readers such an intimate and personalizable look at a problem makes for effective storytelling. Readers had strong emotional reactions to being able to plug in their address and get a precise view of the estimated industrial cancer risk where they live for the very first time. Especially since no one else had ever compressed, processed and made this data accessible in this interactive form. Our map quantified a problem in many places that was previously anecdotal, allowing residents in the most marginalized communities to point to hard data when discussing the risks in their neighborhood.  Visualizing and publishing a government’s agency data in such a granular way can also drive change and conversations among policymakers. EPA employees told us that our presentation has led the agency to improve its own data analysis efforts.  Finally, the careful way in which we approached our analysis helped it be taken seriously by experts who might otherwise dismiss work by non-academics. Prior to publication, we invited air toxics scientists to give us feedback during map demonstrations and went over our detailed methodology with them, word for word. This was hard and unglamorous work, but it demonstrated to key stakeholders that our approach was sound.","English, Spanish",https://projects.propublica.org/toxmap/,https://www.propublica.org/article/toxmap-poison-in-the-air,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-created-the-most-detailed-map-ever-of-cancer-causing-industrial-air-pollution,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-dirty-secret-of-americas-clean-dishes,https://www.propublica.org/article/whats-polluting-the-air-not-even-the-epa-can-say,https://www.propublica.org/article/they-knew-industrial-pollution-was-ruining-the-neighborhoods-air-if-only-regulators-had-listened,,,"Lylla Younes, Al Shaw, Ava Kofman, Lisa Song, Max Blau, Maya Miller, Kiah Collier, Alyssa Johnson, Ken Ward Jr., Jeff Kao, Lucas Waldron","Lylla Younes and Al Shaw are interactive data reporters and news applications developers.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Participant,,The Secret IRS Files,08/06/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Sports, Politics, Business, Economy","Animation, Drone, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Python","The Secret IRS Files used a historic scoop—the greatest trove of heretofore secret financial information on the ultrawealthy ever made public—as the starting point to build a deeply reported series that revealed dramatic, systemic inequities that allow the ultrawealthy in the U.S. to pay tiny amounts of federal income taxes. Unlike most Americans, whose taxes are automatically removed from their paychecks, the ultrawealthy live in a different reality where they can overwhelmingly control what they pay—or don’t pay—in taxes. The series revealed the myriad, sometimes shocking, ways in which they do that—and how the law allows it to happen.","The series led to proposed legislation (now stalled by the seeming demise of the Build Back Better plan) that would close tax loopholes on IRA accounts that benefit the ultrawealthy. And a US senator proposed a rare tax on the wealth (rather than income) of America’s richest, precisely what ProPublica focused on. The series also sparked a counter-reaction by Republican senators, who have fulminated against the fact that tax information of the nation’s wealthiest people was provided to ProPublica, as well as ProPublica’s willingness to publish it (see our editor’s note explaining why we published private information). Indeed, according to recent reporting by Axios, the information provided to ProPublica forms a key element of the party’s attempt to take on President Biden. Should the Republicans reclaim the House, according to Axios, the prospective Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, is planning a series of investigations to “deflect attention” from the commission investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol and “stoke culture wars for 2024.” First on McCarthy’s list is an investigation of the leak that formed the basis for ProPublica’s series. Certainly, that qualifies as anything but an endorsement by the Republican legislators. But their efforts to use the leak against the IRS and the president—and along the way, use the government’s might against the press—is a testament to the crucial importance of the information that has been uncovered. More broadly, ProPublica’s reporting has prompted a national conversation that penetrated multiple realms, from calls for reform, to an awareness of wealth as a tax issue in reporting on the subject, to a change in the public discourse such that when Elon Musk was named Time’s Person of the Year in December, there was an immediate backlash in the press and social media that cited Musk’s failure to pay taxes.","Two journalists, one from our data team and the other a data-savvy reporter from the wider newsroom, spent months transforming what was largely an undifferentiated mass of data, with millions of bits of information identified only by arcane tax jargon into a searchable SQL database that allowed reporters to process the information in a way that would let them identify patterns and glean insights.  We also relied on a variety of technologies to communicate and collaborate securely in order to avoid compromising our sources and to protect the sensitive information we obtained. We primarily relied on Python to build this system. Unfortunately, we cannot be more descriptive than this, out of an abundance of caution for protecting our sources. In addition, to compare the wealth and taxes of billionaires to typical Americans, we performed a unique analysis of the Survey of Consumer Finances. We calculated how much a typical working-age, wage-earning American earned and how much wealth they accumulated, which we then used to calculate their taxes in recent years. In doing so, we were advised by a former Federal Reserve economist who worked on the SCF and had used it to study the ways in which typical Americans build wealth over their lifetimes. We used R to assist with this analysis. The result was a more accurate way of comparing the tax situations of the ultrawealthy to that of typical Americans.","Obtaining secret information is every journalist’s dream, of course, but the good fortune of receiving records obscures the intense efforts ProPublica invested in both validating the information and extracting meaning from it. Reporters and researchers spent months combing through everything from Securities and Exchange Commission filings and lawsuit records to announcements of lottery winnings, as well as interviewing a variety of sources, to confirm that the data was accurate. That was in some ways easier than trying to then make sense of millions of numbers, particularly given that the reporters were limited by the need to keep the information confidential in the early months, which in turn limited how much they could reveal in interviews with experts — and in some cases prevented it entirely.   In addition, tax law is incredibly complex and has evolved greatly over time. That made performing analysis and finding clear and compelling storylines challenging for each and every story in the series.","Why did ProPublica receive the IRS trove rather than another publication with far greater resources? One clue was the extraordinary efforts ProPublica had previously devoted to reporting on the failures of the tax system: The 17 articles in its “Gutting the IRS” series investigated everything from the stripping of the agency’s budgets, to its inability to take on the rich, to the fact that the poor were increasingly more likely to be audited than the rich.     ProPublica also has a long track record of doing sophisticated data analysis, which perhaps made us a more likely candidate to receive such material and also allowed us to hit the ground running after receiving the data set.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax,https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank,https://www.propublica.org/article/secret-irs-files-reveal-how-much-the-ultrawealthy-gained-by-shaping-trumps-big-beautiful-tax-cut,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-great-inheritors-how-three-families-shielded-their-fortunes-from-taxes-for-generations,https://www.propublica.org/article/these-real-estate-and-oil-tycoons-used-paper-losses-to-avoid-paying-taxes-for-years,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-billionaire-playbook-how-sports-owners-use-their-teams-to-avoid-millions-in-taxes,https://www.propublica.org/article/when-youre-a-billionaire-your-hobbies-can-slash-your-tax-bill,,"Jesse Eisinger, Jeff Ernsthausen, Paul Kiel, Justin Elliott, James Bandler, Patricia Callahan, Robert Faturechi, Ellis Simani, Doris Burke, Agnes Chang and Lucas Waldron",Jesse Eisinger - Senior Editor and Reporter Jeff Ernsthausen - Senior Data Reporter Paul Kiel - Reporter Justin Elliott - Reporter James Bandler - Reporter     Patricia Callahan - Reporter     Robert Faturechi - Reporter     Ellis Simani - Data Reporter     Doris Burke - Senior Research Reporter     Agnes Chang - Creative Story Technologist  Lucas Waldron - Visual Investigations Editor    ,
United States,ProPublica,Big,Shortlist,,Unchecked: America's Broken Food Safety System,29/10/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, News application, Crowdsourcing, Business, Agriculture, Health","D3.js, JQuery, Json, PostgreSQL, Python","We analyzed genomic sequencing data and used phylogenetic tree visualization software to show that even after the CDC ended its outbreak investigation into salmonella infantis, the dangerous and drug-resistant strain was still running rampant through the chicken industry and sickening tens of thousands of people. The unchecked spread of this strain is emblematic of America’s baffling, broken food safety system, which is ill-equipped to protect consumers or rebuff industry influence. We also built an interactive database using the USDA’s microbiological sampling data to allow consumers to look up the salmonella rates of the plants that produced their chicken or turkey.","A week before the first story was published — after about a month of interview requests about our findings — the USDA announced that it was rethinking its approach to salmonella. In November, the department asked a key advisory committee for suggestions on how to improve its testing program to focus more on public health risks. In particular, the USDA said it wanted recommendations on how to focus on the riskiest types of salmonella, how much salmonella was present and how to better control the bacteria on farms — all vulnerabilities highlighted by ProPublica's reporting. And in early December, the USDA asked poultry companies for project proposals to test new strategies for reducing contamination. ProPublica's reporting also spurred one of the country's leading food safety lawyers, Bill Marler, to threaten to sue the USDA if it didn't respond to his long-pending petition to ban the sale of raw meat and poultry tainted with certain types of salmonella — including infantis. Our Chicken Checker app engaged thousands of consumers across the country who, for the first time, were empowered to make more informed shopping decisions. And through the app, we received nearly 900 submissions from people who collected information from packages of poultry, which allowed us to see which supermarkets had received poultry from the most problematic plants. Several readers wrote in to say that they had sought to avoid industrial poultry processors and were surprised to learn through Chicken Checker that the organic, free-range chicken they paid a premium for was actually processed by a big chicken company. One Maryland reader called our investigation ""eye opening and upsetting piece."" ""Congress is supposed to be protecting us, the consumer, and yet they are constantly letting us down by siding with the very industry they are supposed to be protecting us from,""","Data reporter Irena Hwang used a combination of command-line tools, DB Browser for SQLite and various Python open-source libraries. Hwang used command-line tools to obtain data from the NCBI Pathogen Detection Browser’s (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/) public API and DB Browser for SQLite to convert raw TSV files into query-able SQL databases. Then, Hwang used the Jupyter Lab user interface to write Python scripts for combining and analyzing data from public APIs and state and federal information requests, using Python packages including pandas and sqlite3. Hwang also used the Interactive Tree of Life (https://itol.embl.de/), software developed by researchers in Germany, to visualize phylogenetic data.   News applications developers Andrea Suozzo and Ash Ngu combined 15 datasets, including the USDA’s list of registered poultry processing plants and corresponding salmonella sampling data, into a PostgreSQL database. They adapted federal regulatory methodologies used to evaluate salmonella prevalence in plants to focus on the types of salmonella most likely to cause human illness, then built a front-end searchable interface to surface and visualize that data using Ruby on Rails and D3. The Chicken Checker app showed consumers how to find the plant code, which may appear in several places on raw poultry packaging, and presented information about the plant’s salmonella record in an easily understood format.","The project depended on analysis of data that was new to ProPublica, particularly genomic sequencing data. Given the highly specialized nature of this data, much of our reporting focused on gaining a thorough understanding of the origin and scope of the data, identifying which analyses were most informative and useful, finding and familiarizing ourselves with the right software for analysis, interpreting our results and verifying those results with federal agencies and nearly a dozen outside experts. ","ProPublica is excited to bring to the attention of other journalists underutilized databases like the NCBI Pathogen Detection Browser and USDA Food Safety and Inspection Services Laboratory Data. We believe that these databases can and should be used for additional reporting on food safety and public health, and accountability stories about the federal agencies that gather and review this data in order to regulate industries. We also believe that this story can help expand the definition and scope of data journalism to a field that can leverage even the most esoteric datasets from academic science. Investigative stories are often data-driven, and we believe that our story and Chicken Checker news application help expand that definition to include “science-based” and “public-service oriented.”",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/salmonella-chicken-usda-food-safety,https://projects.propublica.org/chicken/,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-propublica-used-genomic-sequencing-data-to-track-an-ongoing-salmonella-outbreak,https://www.propublica.org/article/your-free-range-organic-chicken-may-have-been-processed-at-a-large-industrial-poultry-plant,https://www.propublica.org/article/when-dangerous-strains-of-salmonella-hit-the-turkey-industry-responded-forcefully-the-chicken-industry-not-so-much,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-low-and-slow-approach-to-food-safety-reform-keeps-going-up-in-smoke,https://twitter.com/propublica/status/1454886464433659905?s=20,,"Irena Hwang, Andrea Suozzo, Ash Ngu, Michael Grabell, Bernice Yeung, Mollie Simon, Maryam Jameel","Irena Hwang is a data reporter at ProPublica.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Shortlist,,What Parler Saw During the Attack on the Capitol,17/01/21,"Breaking news, Documentary, News application, OSINT, Video, Politics","D3.js, QGIS, Json, Google Sheets","Shortly after the attempted insurrection on Jan. 6, we were the first news organization to publish the majority of these videos, which had been uploaded to the then-defunct social media service Parler. Although that system had been taken down by its hosts, we received and combed through a trove of thousands of video files collected by an online group that had archived them. The result of our work was a harrowing interactive and social media-like experience that let users experience the riot as though they were in the midst of its participants.  ","Readers responded strongly, making it one of the most-viewed features on the site in 2021. The Department of Justice cited the videos we published dozens of times in documents charging  insurrectionists with crimes committed that day, and the videos were played countless times in Congress during former President Trump’s impeachment trial.  Perhaps most crucially, because these videos were made inaccessible when Parler’s web host took it off the Internet, if it weren’t for our project, all of this documentary evidence might have been lost.","This project was a huge technical undertaking. The initial cache of videos was over 30 terabytes, a truly enormous amount of data. We had to use metadata and write code to narrow down the videos to a reasonable number to review.  We put out a call to the rest of the newsroom and asked for volunteers to review the videos so we could surface the  germane and newsworthy videos from the day. ProPublica journalists watched and tagged hundreds of videos in a spreadsheet. We also needed to think through the experience we wanted readers to have. We wanted it to be easy to navigate and tell a gripping, unfolding story, but also let them specify which parts they wanted to see. We color-coded the videos and organized them by time, creating a timeline scrubber that is its own data visualization: because the timeline is color-coded, you can see at a glance how over time the videos go from outside of the Capitol complex, to inside the building itself.  Further, video is not easy or cheap to deal with. We had to transcode all of the videos to create versions of the files that we could serve to users, including those on mobile data connections. What’s more, some browsers crash when you load too many videos at once, so we had to create technical workarounds to make it possible for browsers to handle that many videos. ","The sheer size of the original dataset — 30 terabytes comprising many hours of footage — made it a complex project from the start. The data we got from our sources included the full EXIF metadata, we were able to narrow the trove down to using timestamps (starting from Trump’s speech through the end of the day) and geographic coordinates (in or near the Capitol).. However, the EXIF data was messy and inconsistent across different devices so we needed to be careful to avoid missing pieces of video evidence. More than  35 ProPublicans contributed to this project. They watched and tagged videos to augment what we knew about each of them past what the metadata could tell us, which helped  narrow down to just videos we wanted to publish. Corralling dozens of colleagues into a Google Sheet together on such a tight timeline was hard work.  Really, the main challenges here given the scope of information we were working with was speed. We’re not a breaking news organization, but we sprinted and worked together to make sure we got these videos to the American people as soon as we could. We consider it a public service.","Sometimes an event comes around that is so momentous you need to drop everything to cover it. Most journalists know this, but knowing how you can make an impact on a national, fast-breaking story is hard.  We stuck to our strengths: Computational journalist Jeff Kao found a source with a huge cache of data, and collaborating with our news apps editors created a way for the entire organization to pitch in and help. The news apps team then got to work immediately sketching out how we could present videos to people in a compelling and meaningful way.  While other news organizations went with curated walk-throughs of the day, we realized there was power in a minimally-filtered and immersive piece. Giving people the “Parler-eye view” of the day gave people the ability to experience the day through the eyes of those who posted videos from it. That way of looking at it turned out to be powerful.",English,https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/,https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-the-capitol-riot-what-the-parler-videos-reveal,https://www.propublica.org/article/why-we-published-parler-users-videos-capitol-attack,https://www.propublica.org/article/capitol-eugene-goodman,,,,,"Lena V.

Yet sugar companies and regulators have reassured people that the air is healthy.  The Palm Beach Post and ProPublica tested that proposition, using our own monitors to produce a first-of-its-kind analysis tying the burning to spikes in pollution, which experts said posed health risks. We also analyzed hospitalization records and even traveled to Brazil, where São Paulo officials have largely phased out burning after residents there voiced concerns similar to those of Floridians today.","Our investigation revealed that regulators depended on an unfit air monitor and measured pollution in a way that failed to capture the impact of cane burning. After we started asking questions, officials replaced the monitor, and federal lawmakers pressed to tighten the nation’s pollution standards.  Citing the reporting, Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon and one of the upper chamber’s leading voices on environmental justice, called for greater federal oversight to make sure a similar situation does not happen again. “What the predominantly Black and Hispanic communities living near cane fields in Florida have been put through is completely unacceptable,” said Merkley, who serves as chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee’s subcommittee on environmental justice.  Changes to the nation’s air-monitoring framework are necessary, Merkley said, “to make it harder for industries to bury evidence of the dangerous pollution levels they’re causing.” Moreover, the investigation prompted new research that will add air sensors in the sugar-growing Glades region and examine health trends this year — something Florida has failed to do. The study, funded by NASA, will be the most comprehensive effort of its kind in the area. The Post/ProPublica project is also reshaping the political debate in Florida, where both parties have long supported the sugar industry. In December, Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation to roll back a law that protects farmers from lawsuits over air pollution. And U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist, who previously served as governor and is now a contender for the post again, has pledged to push for “a shift away from burning and towards a cleaner harvesting process” if elected governor this year. He called for action in response to our reporting, saying “we cannot continue to turn a blind eye to the air pollution and health hazards this community is experiencing.”","To collect real-time air-quality data in the Glades, ProPublica and The Post collaborated with residents to set up low-cost sensors outside their homes in Pahokee, one of the towns that dot the area. These PurpleAir sensors constantly recorded air pollution levels over four months of the cane-burning season. The air-quality data was analyzed in tandem with burn permit logs and smoke plume projections from the state Agriculture Department. We sought to discern the relationship, if any, between cane burns and increased air pollution at residents’ homes while taking into account wind and other atmospheric variables that affect how smoke travels. Armed with the state’s smoke projections, we used mapping software to categorize each day based on whether smoke from the burns was projected to reach Pahokee. Our analysis of more than 100 days of data found repeated spikes in particulate matter, or PM2.5, on days when the state authorized cane burns and projected smoke would blow toward instead of away from town. Our sensors reported more spikes in PM2.5 between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. — the hours when cane is burned and the resulting smoke may linger. In addition to the analysis of the air-quality data, we also gathered qualitative data about the effects of cane smoke using a text bot that surveyed residents whenever our sensors detected a spike in pollution. The residents were asked how the air smelled, how much smoke they saw in the air and what health-related reactions, if any, they had. To sign up community members, we called every sixth person on the voter rolls; we designed flyers and posted them on bulletin boards and community gathering spots; we attended a Zoom church service to discuss the effort; and we contacted local leaders and knocked on doors.","Until our investigation, reporting on cane burning in the Glades largely rested on anecdotal accounts and political spin. This project combined original records research and reporting, deep community engagement and a novel citizen science experiment using low-cost air-quality sensors to produce a first-of-its-kind analysis showing the link between cane burning and air pollution near residents' homes. The effort underscored why officials’ claims of safety have persisted for so long. Sugar cane burning is uniquely challenging to track because the burns last roughly 15 to 40 minutes and occur in fields across a 400,000-acre region. Air pollution analyses often rely on hourly or daily data from a regulatory monitor that can miss or mute short bursts of pollution. Our project, however, used PurpleAir sensors to measure air-quality levels in real time. The data allowed us to identify the existence of short spikes in pollution during cane-burning hours on days when the smoke was projected to blow toward Pahokee. The project was made possible through a deep level of community engagement. But outreach was particularly complicated because many of the same people who are affected by the seasonal burns also benefit from the industry’s role as one of the biggest employers in the region. Residents in the area also often have unreliable Wi-Fi, which made it challenging to find residents who wanted to and were able to host a PurpleAir sensor. The stakes for the billion-dollar sugar industry were high, and it challenged the project’s reporting and methodology at every turn. We published an explainer to address criticisms and walk readers through the complex science and regulation. Even then, one of Florida’s largest sugar producers mounted a public relations campaign in the Glades to discredit ProPublica, which it called an “activist, agenda-driven, online-only website.” The project has no corrections or clarifications.","PurpleAir sensors are a relatively recent innovation; the first version of the sensors was created in 2015. In the past few years, though, the sensors have undergone enough development and testing by universities, air-quality groups and regulators like the EPA that they are able to be used in a project where reporters work with residents to do their own monitoring of air pollution in places where the government's air-monitoring system is lacking. Since publishing “Black Snow,” the PurpleAir staff has emailed the reporters to say that “tons of groups have been following suit” and that “it really gave lots of folks who struggle with localized pollution ideas and courage to set up sensors and do their own research.” Journalists can do the same.  Additionally, the project’s reporters have already begun sharing the tools they used for community engagement that made this project possible. At the Investigative Reporters and Editors conference last year, Ramadan and Miller detailed how to use free text bot tools to get real-time feedback from dozens of sources at once. They also shared tips on conducting community research to then generate and launch tailored outreach strategies to reach communities where they are (this can range from letter-writing to door-knocking to hosting events, among others). Reporters from other news organizations have since reached out and said they have deployed these tips and tools in their own journalism. We expect that will only continue.","English, Spanish",https://projects.propublica.org/black-snow/,https://www.propublica.org/article/a-complete-failure-of-the-state-authorities-didnt-heed-researchers-calls-to-study-health-effects-of-burning-sugar-cane,https://www.propublica.org/article/burning-sugar-cane-pollutes-communities-of-color-in-florida-brazil-shows-theres-another-way,https://www.propublica.org/article/after-years-of-complaints-florida-improves-pollution-monitoring-near-burning-sugar-cane-fields,https://www.propublica.org/article/sugar-companies-said-our-investigation-is-flawed-and-biased-lets-dive-into-why-thats-not-the-case,https://www.propublica.org/article/we-reported-on-pollution-from-sugar-cane-burning-now-federal-lawmakers-want-the-epa-to-take-action,https://www.propublica.org/article/they-deserve-to-be-safe-candidates-call-on-florida-to-investigate-the-health-effects-of-sugar-cane-burning,,"Lulu Ramadan -The Palm Beach Post, Hannah Morse - The Palm Beach Post, Ash Ngu - ProPublica, Maya Miller - ProPublica, Nadia Sussman - ProPublica","Lulu Ramadan was an investigative reporter at The Palm Beach Post, where she worked from 2015 to 2021.

United States,NPR,Big,Participant,,Pro-Trump counties now have far higher COVID death rates. Misinformation is to blame,05/12/21,"Investigation, News application, Infographics, Chart, Elections, Politics, Health","D3.js, Google Sheets, Python","An analysis by NPR shows that since the vaccine rollout, counties that voted heavily for Donald Trump have had more than twice the COVID mortality rates of those that voted for Joe Biden.","To our knowledge, this is the first story from a major news outlet that both analyzes these correlations and gives readers the ability to find their individual county in the data. While each of these sources (elections, COVID deaths, vaccination rates) is widely available, combining these data and making a coherent methodology represents a step forward in discussions about the virus, vaccines, partisanship and misinformation.  This story was the third most-viewed story on NPR.org for the month of December. It was widely shared on social media and reddit. And the analysis was picked up by Rolling Stone, Salon, Politico, NBC News and others. Further collaborations and analyses are in the works. ","Data was collected from various sources, then joined and analyzed using Jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib and other Python libraries. Once processed this way, the data was brought into the browser, where it was visualized using d3.js. We wrote custom JavaScript to allow for individual counties to be looked up. Two additional charts were created using d3.js and our team's homegrown graphics rig.","While the data collating and visualization were difficult for these diverse and large datasets, the biggest challenge was coming up with a cohesive, defensible, and straightforward methodology. The quality of county-level COVID-19 death data is notoriously spotty. Since some counties and entire states have ceased sharing new COVID-19 data altogether, it was difficult to know whether records of counties with no or very few new deaths since May 2021 were accurate. None of the options available to address this were very good. We could try to verify individual counties piecemeal, but that would be very tedious and error prone. We could try to patch specific states when alternative data was found, but we tried to limit this where possible due to the complexity, error and bias it adds to the methodology. Finally, we could simply leave this data as is, and understand that it introduces some error to our findings.  Ultimately, we mostly chose the final option. Our reasoning was that since most of the counties with erroneous zeros were a high percentage of Trump voters, including these zeros as “true” would weaken our analysis, and be a more cautious course of action. Thus, if a weaker analysis is still a stunning correlation, we can err on the side of caution knowing that, while not perfect, our findings are defensible.  ","I think this analysis shows that it is impactful to apply numbers to our suspicions, to see if they are true. This analysis may be somewhat unsurprising on one level, because it confirms what many of us have long suspected about vaccine-denialism. But it is not enough to suspect these things. If these things are true it is a disturbing indictment on those sowing disinformation, and important for the public record to have it down in black and white. Similarly, other journalists ought to apply data to their instincts, strengthening arguments where correlation is found and dismissing it where it is not.",English,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/12/05/1059828993/data-vaccine-misinformation-trump-counties-covid-death-rate,,,,,,,,"Reporting/Analysis: Geoff Brumfiel, Daniel Wood.

Additionally, the story was adapted for the Appalachia Journal, the journal of the Appalachian Mountain Club.","This project is a combination of original drone footage and photography, maps, charts, and reporting. The maps were made using QGIS, GDAL, Adobe Illustrator, and AI2HTML. The chart was made using d3.js and our internal templating tool. This project was built with NPR’s own in-house developed scrolly-telling based interactive template. The template makes it easy to integrate photo, video, interactive elements, and text. ","The map of fire-return intervals – average years between wildfires – was essential to explaining the shocking truth of this story: that much more of the U.S. is more fire-prone than we understand. But the maps were extremely difficult to produce owing to the enormous size and complexity of the raw data. I wrote a blog post about the process, which can be found at https://n.pr/33as3aN. In short, the tremendous size (over 2GB) of the raw data made processing difficult, and downsampling the data essential. Once this was done, selecting a descriptive and user-friendly color palette was also quite a challenge, as we wanted something that was divergent (went from “safe” to “danger”) but was also color-blind friendly. In the end, I believe we produced a map that is revelatory, showing a hidden and worrisome side of the land we inhabit today. ","This project is a good reminder of the value of both looking at history and trying to localize issues from other regions — you may find something that’s been overlooked or undercovered.

Lauren Sommer and I (Daniel Wood) collected detailed parcel information from several different counties to create the data sources at the heart of this story. Some of the data was extremely large and hard to work with. Some of the parcels were held by third parties but rented to the companies. Other parcels were owned by the companies but as-yet undeveloped. Creating this layer with a cohesive methodology from messy public sources was very challenging.  Building a slippy map that flew and zoomed on scroll was essential to locating this story within a place. Working on a tight budget, we opted to use a free web mapping library called leaflet.js, rather than spend extra for something like Mapbox. But this came with several difficulties. One downside of this was that we had to populate the imagery with our own custom labels, and we had to have them work well on desktop and mobile. Another challenge was loading and painting the geo data while keeping the load times low. While Mapbox would allow you to preload this data into their tiles, our system doesn’t pre-bake tiles, making this impossible. On the plus side, loading the geo data in the browser allowed us to easily manipulate the layers with javascript and css. This made the water effect possible and the timeline of loading data later on. ",Animated maps such as these can be a good way to step laypeople through the factors and impacts of issues that otherwise can be very dry and difficult to grasp with text and photos alone.

That is now starting to change as the company expands aggressively into new countries as part of Beijing’s controversial “Belt and Road” initiative.   OCCRP and its partners on five continents spent months investigating the massive corporation. They discovered China Tobacco is using the same strategies Big Tobacco used in the '90 s - flooding countries with cigarettes and working with smuggling networks.","Romanian and Italian police are now investigating the involvement of China Tobacco officials in the smuggling phenomena. The authorities are searching now for a possible pattern of business with organized crime groups and China Tobacco Corporation.    In Italy the investigation published by our partner IRPI Media won the first prize from the Italian Society of Tobacco and the Fondazione Umberto Veronesi.      In Brazil, the story published by our partner Intercept Brazil won one of the most relevant human rights awards in the country (Premio Direitos Humanos de Jornalismo, Categoria Online).    The maps and databases that OCCRP published, regarding the Chinese cigarette exports and imports in war torn countries, soon became a platform that is used by national authorities in their official investigations.    The OCCRP project was a breakthrough also for the academic and tobacco control organizations worldwide. China Goes Global Project is the first investigative journalistic project that analyzed and investigated the China Tobacco Corporation model of business and showed that the Chinese tycoon is using the same illegal schemes used by the other big western tobacco corporations. The information OCCRP provided became the base ground for a deeper academic research.   ","To process and crosscheck the data, obtained from all teams in different continents, we used Aleph, OffshoreLeaks by ICIJ, Open Refine, OCCRP ID.    For one story, to identify a Chinese partner in Iraq, we combined the data we had on one company with Google Imagery and Youtube to locate the exact address of the building HQ we were interested in finding.    Google Imagery and Leaflet combined with information obtained from police were also used to draw the map of a truck that smuggled chinese cigarettes between Romania and Italy.    Flourish was used to draw the map that included top 20 China Tobacco Europe partners worldwide and to identify the destination countries and social and economic impact of the chinese cigarette trade.     Vessel Tracker was used to obtain data and track vessels and containers that were used by organized crime groups to smuggle chinese cigarettes.   For the European stories we cross-checked export and import data from China Tobacco factory and we found connections to politicians in Ukraine and cigarette smugglers in Italy, Romania, Ukraine, Republic of Moldova, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo.   For the Brazilian story, we've cross-referenced data from China Tobacco and other tobacco companies to political donations and found out that people and companies who have successfully changed public policies in favor of the tobacco sector have already been funded by companies like Philip Morris, Souza Cruz, etc.    We've also obtained and organized a huge dataset of cigarette seizures by the Brazilian Federal Police, including brands, amount, date and origin.","OCCRP had to deal with a huge information shortage when it started this project. The investigation did not kick off with a leak or access to whistleblowers.     During the documentation process the data OCCRP journalists obtained from five continents via anonymous sources, open source data or official requests was incomplete and fragmented and it was very hard to compare from country to country in order to obtain a coherent global analysis of the China Tobacco Corporation model of business.    The difficulty was doubled by the way the smuggled seized cigarettes were categorized by the police and customs. In one case, for instance, law enforcement mistakenly identified cigarettes coming from Romania, where the Chinese factory is located, as Romanian cigarettes.      ","We based this investigative project on three main pillars – field reporting, data analysis and cross border partnership. The combination of these three elements was the key to the success of China Goes Global.    China is a secretive state and the information is almost impossible to obtain, so we had to concentrate our efforts into obtaining information from countries where the Chinese tycoon does business and where more information and resources were available. So, satellite companies became small gateways into the vault of secrets and business of this opaque tobacco giant.      That is why, after extensive documentation about this big corporation, we chose to work with partners on continents where different countries housed China Tobacco importers. Local investigative journalists cultivated sources, had access to court documents, to local assets involved in the trade or investigating it and to import and export transactions. All this information exchanged and combined between partners, using secure platforms, offered the big picture that nobody had before about China Tobacco. ",English,https://www.occrp.org/en/loosetobacco/china-tobacco-goes-global/,https://www.occrp.org/en/loosetobacco/china-tobacco-goes-global/illegal-chinese-cigarettes-flooding-latin-america-flow-through-panama,https://www.occrp.org/en/loosetobacco/china-tobacco-goes-global/huge-quantities-of-chinese-cigarettes-smuggled-into-ukraine,https://www.occrp.org/en/loosetobacco/china-tobacco-goes-global/a-fake-shipping-container-leads-to-chinese-cigarettes-and-italys-camorra-crime-group,https://www.occrp.org/en/loosetobacco/china-tobacco-goes-global/china-tobacco-very-discreetly-becomes-leaf-buying-powerhouse-in-brazil,https://www.occrp.org/en/loosetobacco/china-tobacco-goes-global/contract-tobacco-farmers-in-zimbabwe-say-they-are-drowning-in-debt,,,"Alessia Cerantola, Andrei Ciurcanu, Jared Ferrie, Caroline Henshaw, Nathan Jaccard, Lilia Saúl, Luiz Fernando Toledo, Julia Wallace, Sol Lauría, David Tarazona, Mateo Yepes, Naira Hofmeister, Anna Myroniuk, Owen Garare, Nhau Mangirazi, Dumisani Muleya","Alessia is an investigative journalist with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).

United Kingdom,"NationalWorld.com, JPIMedia",Small,Participant,,England's swimming ‘deserts' revealed: some areas have 10 times less public swimming space than others,24/08/21,"Investigation, Open data, Chart, Map, Sports, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","As Team GB celebrated success at the Tokyo Olympics, gold medallist Duncan Scott made headlines by warning of a spate of pool closures i. I used a mass of complex data held by Sport England and others to calculate the square metres of public swimming pool space per 100,00 residents available in every part of England. I then used this to identify and map the country's ‘swimming pool deserts'. This work uncovered vast regional disparities: for example, the North East had less than a third of the public pool space found in the South East, equivalent to 56 Olympic-size swimming","My article was the top story on JPIMedia’s national site NationalWorld that day. I also made my findings and a template story available to the local and regional titles in the JPIMedia group. Localised versions of the project were was carried by many of these titles.  This sparked substantial debate both on social media and on newspapers' letters pages. For example, The Yorkshire Post splashed on the story and used it to kick off a campaign calling for better swimming provision.  They secured an op-ed from Swim England’s chief executive Jane Nickerson, talking about the importance of access to swimming facilities so children can learn this life-saving skill at a young age. They carried their own follow-ups on subsequent days, reporting on a spate of teenagers drowning and revealing that 96% of children were not meeting swimming lesson targets set by Swim England. My work and the resulting Yorkshire Post campaign were also featured on the website HoldTheFrontPage.","I had a hunch that some parts of the country were seeing large municipal pools close, with smaller community pools opened in their place. On paper the number of pools in an area would stay the same but in reality the provision would be substantially lessened, particularly with the loss of diving pools or other specialist facilities. For this reason, to find ‘swimming pool deserts’ I wanted to calculate the square metres of public pool space per 100,000 residents in every area, rather than simply the number of pools. I also wanted to look at the facilities offered at each site. I used Microsoft Excel to gather the information I wanted from a vast selection of open data held by Sport England, as well as population data from the Office for National Statistics. This involved combining many datasets into one using vlookups. I then ran a series of calculations, such as using data on the width and length of pools to work out the square metres of public pool space per 100,000 residents in each local authority area and region of England. I mapped my findings using Flourish - creating a choropleth map showing the swimming pool provision in each local authority area of the UK. I also created a ‘points map’ showing the location of each public diving pool, which demonstrated how sparsely these were spread in some parts of England. Hovering over the points would display the age of the facility as well, with ageing pools a key concern for campaigners.","The data held by Sport England on swimming pools was difficult to find. To start with, I asked Sport England’s press team for data on swimming pools and they said the organisation didn’t have any. My own searches proved otherwise. Sport England has a series of huge datasets on all sporting facilities in England, both publicly and privately owned. Information is spread out over a series of spreadsheets - for example, addresses were in one file and size of swimming pools in another. I spent a long time combining these datasets to create the spreadsheet I wanted, listing the names and locations of each public swimming pool as well as the number and type of pools, facilities offered and so on.  The data needed substantial cleaning. Deciding what constituted a ‘public’ pool was also tricky. For example, should I include school pools open to the wider public for a limited time each week? I had to consider different aspects of the data - ownership of the site, terms of access for the public (e.g. pay-to-swim or members only) and opening times to decide whether I thought the pool could be branded ‘public’.","Firstly, not to assume press teams know about the data held by their organisation. Journalists can learn that they can create their own metrics to determine whether provision of a certain service is fairly distributed across the country or society - they don’t need to rely on the metrics used by official bodies if they don’t think these are the fairest measures. In this case, I first thought up my ideal metric - square metres of public swimming pool space per 100,000 residents - and then set about finding the data I needed from an array of open data sources to work this out. This allowed me to discover that some areas of the country were indeed being incredibly poorly served.   Please note: I have selected 'small' for organisation size as I work within a NationalWorld team consisting of fewer than 35 journalists. However, I made my work available to the wider JPIMedia network which has more than 35 journalists.

""Spain lives in flats"" is an innovative and  interactive journalistic project by elDiario.es that analyzes the footprint of more than 12 million buildings  to map the height of Spanish cities in 3D to analyze their sustainability and impact on the current urban society. The investigation that includes narrative visualizations shows why Spain is one of the countries in the world that has built the highest and most dense cities compared to other countries.","This project compiled for the first time in a single database the cartographic plans of all the buildings currently standing in the Spanish territory. The map, which can be consulted by all readers, allows the users to understand the vertical urbanism that has characterized Spanish cities in the last century. The innovative format allows readers to explore the heights of their buildings in three dimensions while we explain with graphics and data the urban decisions that were made in each decade, along with the socioeconomic context of each moment. Furthermore, the project used solutions journalism techniques by explaining and proposing several sustainable models for the European cities of the future based on many interviews with experts and the analysis of the mistakes and challenges of urban planning discovered in the historical data analyzed for the project.   This project has proved that innovative narratives are useful and welcomed by elDiario.es users. This project was also a bet to publish for the first time content in English, due to the importance of giving access to first time published data to an international audience. The publication has been viewed by more than 200.000 users and it was one of the most read of the year in elDiario.es and also one of the articles that made most people subscribe and pay to support elDiario.es during the year, according to our statistics. Added to this, the publication doubled the average time of view of a usual article in elDiario.es. This project was also an opportunity to work with our local editions that made specific publications for their local audience using the project content.   ","R, Rstudio, QGIS and Tippecanoe for data compiling and data analysis.

HTML, Javascript and Scrollama for scroll webpage.","The hardest part of the project was compiling and automating the download of the building footprint of more than 12 million buildings and processing that amount of information. We created an R script that downloaded cadastral data of the buildings of more than 7,600 municipalities, one by one. The total size of the downloaded files exceeded 200GB. During the processing of the data, the journalists found errors in the files that were later corrected after notifying the cadastral institution.   Then, we processed and joined in R all downloaded files to have a single database with the details of all the buildings in Spain. For example, we verified the data of 12 million buildings, we calculated the height of every building from the part that occupies the most built volume in the plans and we extracted the date of the building from the start of construction. All these processes were repeated several times during the year due to the publication of corrections and allowed us for the first time in Spain to have a database and a visualization with the heights of all the buildings in the country.   In addition, Tippecanoe was used with different configurations to reduce the size of the files and thus be able to work with it in Mapbox.  ",This project shows how the information available in national cadastres could be exploited in other countries to explain the urban planning of each territory and to tell stories of how other cities were built and find solutions to create more friendly and sustainable cities.

The data, which the government insisted on hiding for months, shows which cities were the most affected by the worst mortality crisis of the last century.  ","This project revealed for the first time in Spain the figures for deaths with Covid-19 confirmed results in each municipality. Until that date, the Government had only published the death figures broken down by region, which did not allow the identification of the cities where the virus had the greatest impact. The information was obtained after a legal battle lasting several months in which the government refused to provide the information to journalists. elDiario.es sent a complaint to the Transparency Council, the body in charge of ensuring compliance with the law, which agreed with this media and forced the Government to send the requested information. This resolution set a legal precedent in Spain to access public information related to the pandemic since it determined that these data were of public interest.   Measuring the local impact of the epidemic at local level is one of the most accurate ways of pointing out the factors that contributed to the spread of the virus in Spain.

Considering the gender, age, educational level, region of the country and quarter of more than ten million records, we built the unemployment evolution for more than 900 demographic profiles. Then, with the voice of experts and testimonials we explain the differences between groups and with interactive visualizations the audience can compare themselves with the rest of the population.","Although every quarter most media report on the unemployment rate published by the EPA, the focus is usually on its evolution in comparison to previous quarters or years. Sometimes youth unemployment or the gender gap also make it to headlines, but rarely all the variables are crossed to have a more detailed picture. In this article we published for the first time the unemployment rates of very specific groups of the population.   The article was widely commented on social networks by experts and readers, who also specifically shared the graphs with the unemployment rate of their group and drew their own conclusions. In addition, its publication coincided with the end of the negotiation of the labour reform in Spain, which made it a very topical issue. Also, for elDiario.es it meant the acquisition of new subscribers.  ","To obtain, merge, analyze and reorganize the data we used R and RStudio.

Instead of waiting for the end of the hottest months, at elDiario.es we decided to monitor, in real time, maximum temperatures in all regional capitals to see if they deviated from the normal temperature. In our tracker we visualize, day by day, the highest temperatures and the differences from previous summers. This tracker also served as a support for other informative articles, such as an historical analysis of summer temperatures.","This summer temperature records were broken in many Spanish regions and there was a heatwave in August. Thanks to having the temperature data monitored daily and the visualizations updated, we were able to report on all these historical events quickly (link 2).   In addition to those days with temperature spikes, the newsworthiness of the article lasted all summer. Among the public, the tool was useful to verify with data if their feelings of it being a hotter or colder summer than the previous one were real. With their own perceptions we wanted to raise awareness about the consequences of climate change in their city.  ","  For this project we built a database using records from AEMET’s (the Spanish meteorological agency) API. With R and RStudio we connected the API with our database and this with the visualizations. The graphics were made with Datawrapper and D3.js. We also included a text paragraph that changed daily with new data, coded using Javascript.    ","The choice of the appropriate meteorological stations for this analysis was a fundamental part of the development of this project. Not all AEMET stations had both real-time and historical data, so we had to make cross-checks and ask experts which was the best option.   Coding the R script that linked the API data with the visualizations and our website was another important step.

For rice too, production numbers have consistently been rising since 2016-2017. According to official estimates, current rice production in India is 12.23 MT higher than the past 10 years’ average production of 108.09 MT. But is it rising fast enough to meet future demand? The story tries to find the answer to this question. It also takes into account various aspects like climate change, elevated levels of carbon dioxide, stressed water levels and farming techniques that directly or indirectly affect agriculture in India.","The project was shared widely amongst the scientists working with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR)- an autonomous organisation under the Department of Agricultural Research and Education (DARE), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India. Since ICAR is dependent for production of new varieties of crops, this story delves into the science behind it by talking to scientists from the institution. Rice has been a staple food of India for decades. The project tries to bring the story behind the future of rice to the audience with a focus on the effect of climate change, stressed water levels and elevated temperature and carbon dioxide on the crop.  The projected demand for rice by 2050 is estimated to be 197.40 MT for a population of 1.65 billion— almost 80% higher than the current demand.  This story served as a reality check to the government, scientists, farmers and people who are dependent on rice directly or indirectly. ","The story required a lot of research. It took into account a lot of scientific research papers to extract data to get the numbers for the yield, production area and productivity of rice. A lot of data was available to scrap. Tabula was used to scrape the data from pdf files. The data was cleaned in Google Sheets and for visualizations, Flourish was used. ","One of the hardest parts of the project was to determine how much carbon dioxide (CO2) is too much CO2 for rice since rice responds positively to elevated levels of CO2. This meant that as global warming would increase, the yield and productivity of rice would also increase. To find the answer, I went through a lot of research papers and talked to scientists and Phd candidates to know the real picture behind it. Ultimately I did get a response but I was looking for a number that was provided by one of the scientists who has done extensive research on rice in India.

The overall goal was to deliver a memorable, compelling explanation of a topical story. This was achieved by assembling an inter-discplinary project team to work with the FT's energy correspondent. The project was executed within a two week window and published while the crisis was still at its height.","In a word, enlightenment.

The articles have the aim of showing the flows in the Erasmus program and the inequalities between the countries taking part of it. Although is a very popular academic program, since its origins Erasmus has failed being accessible for people from different cultural and economic backgrounds. The amount of the grants are very different regarding the country, the region, or even the university, which could be discriminatory for the European students and has social consequences such as less labor insertion, among others.","The project was published a few days ago at El Confidencial and reached more than 120.000 viewers between the two articles published. Our partners, Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso Transeuropa (OBCT) are publishing on the following days, so it is soon to know all the impact that it will get. However, we consider it has been a pioneer project, since this topic haven't been reached before like that in a massive media. The visualization of the student flows by country, region, academic field and economic level are accessible for the very first time in a newspaper, so everyone can look and play with the data.  This is interesting for all the present and future students and also for the European public, since inequalities in the European framework is actually a problem that affects all of us.  Besides, the second part focused on the differences between cities in terms of daily cost, are also attractive and useful to any reader. But our main goal is to call for a change in this program. The UE authorities are already aware of the inequalities of the program, but a well-informed society will lead to a change in the policies that are made in the Brussels Parliament. The main impact we hope from ‘Erasmus a dos velocidades’  is to influence in the next programs editions and budgets to make it more inclusive. So this project wants to be a tool to give  information to the people in order to ask for a better program, which objective should be bringing the regions closer and make a stronger and more competitive European Union.","The data analysis for this project has been carried out using the programming language R and RStudio, mainly relying on the tidyverse, sf, and osmdata libraries. After an initial data exploration and cleaning, the Erasmus cities have been geolocated since there were no coordinates in the original dataset. Since city names were not entered in a standardized way, geolocation has been done either by: matching the cities’ names from the original dataset and the EUROSTAT dataset on European Local Administrative Units; geolocating the cities using OpenStreetMaps Nominatim; manually, in case the first two methods did not return valid coordinates. Finally, once we got the coordinates of the cities, these have been geographically matched with the geometries of European NUTS2 in order to cross-reference Erasmus mobilities to economic development and produce the csv files used by the design team for the visualizations. In this regard, the d3.js library was used for the visualizations of the articles and, specifically, the PixiJS library for the map, animated on canvas. Both are open source. Besides, the functionalities of the page (such as scrollytelling) are developed in pure javascript.  The data used by the Sankey diagrams was converted from csv to json format. The reason these technologies were used was to decrease the load weight of the page. d3.js is a very powerful library established in the interactive visualization development community. For its part, PixiJS makes it easier to work with canvas elements, something we needed due to the number of elements present on the map. Both libraries, combined with data processing, javascript, and the use of HTML and CSS (Sass, specifically) have allowed us to develop what the design team had in mind for this project. In addition, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets and LibreOffice were used to analyze the data in spreadsheets.","On the first hand, from the journalistic point of view, the first problem to solve was to analyze a dataset consisting of more than 17 million data points in order to obtain qualitative information with which to develop our hypotheses. For that, we used statistical programming and computational techniques working on the raw data for several days. But the information of the flows by itself was not enough, so the big challenge was to see where the gaps were. That is why we looked for a methodology that could associate the cities with the European regions to which they belong in order to cross-reference the erasmus flows with regional economic data, categorize the regions in the three official levels of economic development, and compare them to be able to infer about inequalities and how them underpin the Erasmus programme. In addition, to bring the story closer to the public, we wanted students to tell their own experience, both Erasmus program participants and those who could not afford it. For that we look for testimonials we used an online survey as a tool to obtain new data. Besides that, tackling a project of this magnitude has also been a challenge for the journalists who have been part of it. Our experience leading works between various newsrooms was scarce until now, and this work has made us learn more about the flows and communications of these types of stories.","On one hand, data analysis is essential to approach complex issues to a general audience, and along with the design team we have created useful tools for both: readers and other colleagues. We would love if this project could help other journalists from different countries to apply ‘Erasmus a dos velocidades’ approach to their own environment. That is why we are going to release the database in the coming days, when it has also been published by OBCT and the members who want it of the European Data Network, of which we are both part. Besides, the design of the visualizations and the tools to shape this project can also serve as an idea for colleagues with a more technical background such as developers and designers of data journalism when it comes to building their articles. Furthermore, European affairs are often one of the most unknown in newsrooms, usually far away of the corridors of Brussels. We believe that this story is an example of how this issues can be brought out beyond mere European politics, and look at how the policies affects its citizens.",Spanish,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/europa/2021-12-28/erasmus-dos-velocidades-programa-ue-desigualdad_3348913/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/europa/2021-12-29/erasmus-desigualdad-estudiantes-ue-becas_3348909/,,,,,,,"Darío Ojeda, María Zuil, Ornaldo Gjergji","María Zuil is a reporter and data journalist.

The project tells the story of how the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act is flawed in its scope and enforcement.  Insider reporters discovered that at least 54 members of Congress and 182 senior-level congressional staffers have violated the STOCK Act in recent months, and revealed numerous financial conflicts of interest, such as 75 federal lawmakers investing in COVID-19 vaccine makers, including during the early weeks of the pandemic.","Insider's journalism has illuminated a scandal in which members of the House of Representatives and Senate have eviscerated their own ethical standards, avoided legal consequences, and obscured the moments when lawmakers' personal finances clash with their public duties. Now, the public can see for itself how their own elected representatives rate when it comes to ethical questions that go to the core of U.S. democracy.   Following publication of ""Conflicted Congress,"" Rep. Peter Welch confirmed he and his wife would stop trading individual stocks. Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Jon Ossoff said they would introduce legislation banning lawmakers and their spouses from trading individual stocks. ""Conflicted Congress"" initially led to wide-spread criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for rejecting a stock trading ban, before she eventually directed the House to consider higher fines for lawmakers and top aides who violate the STOCK act.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pushed back on Pelosi's position, suggesting other ways members of Congress could still invest without running into conflicts of interest, including thrift savings plans or index funds. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump and Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, also blasted the practice of lawmakers trading individual stocks. Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy now says he'll potentially push to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks if Republicans win the House during the 2022 midterms — and Sen. Josh Hawley concurred.  ""Conflicted Congress"" has created a conversation about the ethics of elected officials buying and selling individual stocks — one that continues in earnest during 2022. The project has been featured by a range of national news organizations, including CNN, ABC, Fox News, MSNBC, C-SPAN, NPR, New York Times, Washington Post, Politico and a range of regional news outlets that utilized our data to write or broadcast localized reports.","Technologies and tools used by Insider in the project include Tabula for preliminary scraping, natural language processing for analysis, regular expressions for cleaning the data, Python for analyzing the data and cleaning it, and D3.js for visualizing. The databases themselves were constructed using Google sheets.  We successfully filed a FOIA request with the US Department of Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service to obtain records on whether members of Congress had paid fines stemming from their non-compliance with the STOCK Act. Insider assembled its own “conflict index” to reveal how many members of Congress faced possible conflicts of interest around investments and stock trades. We did it by combining scores for six different measures — STOCK Act violation, staffer STOCK act violations, legible disclosures, amendment findings, qualified blind trust, and individual stock trades. The bulk of the index is based around whether members of the House and Senate, as well as their senior staff, violated a 2012 law widely known as the STOCK Act.  For each of the six measures, Insider assigned each member a score between 0 and 4. Insider then took a weighted average of those scores to generate an overall composite index. Members with scores of 3.8 out of 4 or higher — generally corresponding to having no STOCK Act violations and scoring favorably on most of our other measures — were evaluated to be “solid” and rated “green.” Members with scores between 2.5 and 3.8, which generally indicates having a few STOCK Act violations either by members or their staffers, or performing poorly on our other measures, were evaluated to be “borderline” and rated “yellow.” The 14 members with scores below 2.5, generally indicating multiple or severe STOCK Act violations and poor scores on other measures, were evaluated to be “danger” and rated “red.”","Congress, at best, made it difficult to obtain and analyze data about officials' personal finances. At worst, it made it nearly impossible. ""Conflicted Congress,"" at its core, is an effort to do it anyway to reveal the depths of Congress' conflicts of interest and violations of the anti-conflict-of-interest STOCK Act. For example, Insider reporters collectively spent hundreds of work hours physically on Capitol Hill manually inputting the financial filings of top congressional staffers — the filings are not online and only available in Washington, D.C. — into a database we created. Insider data journalists, researchers and fact checkers spent thousands of work hours creating a searchable, sortable database of all members of Congress' personal finances, derived from disclosures they made on paper or PDF files. We then made this information — the most complete and detailed public accounting of the individual finances of federal lawmakers that exists — free and public for all to use after using it as the basis for our ""conflict index"" and more than two-dozen individual articles. The idea for ""Conflicted Congress"" came during late 2020, shortly after Insider established its Washington, D.C., bureau. Our D.C. Bureau reporters began identifying (and reporting on) discrete cases of lawmakers ignoring the STOCK Act's disclosure provisions. We then began tracking, on a daily basis, every new personal financial disclosure that lawmakers made, looking for potential problems. Ultimately, after determining that lawmakers were routinely violating the STOCK Act and trading stocks in a fashion that could undermine public trust, we decided to undertake what we knew would be a months-long effort to comprehensively determine the extent of this matter.","“Conflicted Congress” is an in-the-moment alarm that the adage “follow the money,” cliché as it may be, applies to government today as much as ever. The personal financial interests of lawmakers can and do conflict with the public’s trust and their official responsibilities.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Participant,,The inequality of elections in Madrid: how right-wing parties always win only with the votes of the richest neighborhoods,04/05/21,"News application, Chart, Elections","D3.js, CSV, R, RStudio","Right-wing parties have been winning elections in Madrid, the Spanish capital, for more than 25 years. An analysis of the electoral data block by block by elDiario.es revealed the gap in participation and exclusion between the poor and rich areas of the Community of Madrid, is what allows conservative candidates to win the elections only being the most voted the richest 30% neighborhoods. The investigation, published in the electoral campaign of the regional elections in Madrid, also analyzed the demography behind the victory of the new center-right candidate in the capital.  ","  For this project we crossed the electoral results with demographic and income data in more than 4,000 census sections (blocks) of the entire Community of Madrid. The results demonstrated the gap of political exclusion of the most impoverished communities of the capital that allow the conservative candidates to chain victories in the legislative elections being the most voted only in the richest areas. The story was published with an interactive scroll that served to explain as clearly as possible the key demographics of the Madrid elections.   The piece of analysis was one of the most read of the year in elDiario.es and also one of the ones that brought the most subscribers to the newspaper. In addition, the point of ​​the article was one of the main themes of the campaign - the electoral mobilization of the poor areas of Madrid - and the candidates of the main parties in the contest shared the publication on their social media accounts. Precisely, we analyzed this electoral gap between the poor and rich areas during the election day of May 4, when we updated minute by minute a piece with the electoral demography in which readers could explore the social groups where each had more strength.  ","R, Rstudio and Excel for data compiling and data analysis. Datawrapper, D3.js, Scrollama, Flourish, and Javascript for data visualization and scroll narrative.","The hardest part of the project was to obtain and cross historical electoral data and demographic data and income data for each of the 4,000 census blocks analyzed. Each of the variables had to be obtained from different sources with a different format so we have to normalize these data before crossing it with an R script. Also the process to create the narrative structure of the piece was really hard to be as clear as possible because Election data can be difficult to understand. We not only wanted to reveal that gap of political exclusion to the readers, but also visualize it in the clearest way possible and also do a pedagogical job of not only teaching but also explaining the graphics that we show them.   With this purpose, we proposed a first sketch of the structure of the piece that went from the simplest idea to the most complex. We began by explaining how conservatives were voted more in the richest areas until we revealed the reasons behind the high level of political exclusion in the poorest neighborhoods of Madrid. The end result is an animated two-line graph summarizing hundreds of thousands of voting and income records across the region.   In addition, we programmed a script to live updating during election night the graphs that indicate the gaps in the vote for each bloc and party according to age, income, educational level or place of birth  ","This project can inspire other journalists to analyze demographic voting patterns in other countries to check how levels of social and political exclusion affect electoral results in different regions or countries of the world, which is not usually used in the electoral process outside the United States. This project demonstrates that you can try to explain and understand complex data and graphs (like the one in the 4M demographic piece) with a lot of pedagogy and detailed explanations.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/gana-derecha-elecciones-madrid-mayoritaria-30-rico_1_7347696.html,https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/demografia-4m-vota-grupo-social-madrid-elecciones-resultados-electorales_1_7896397.html,https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/voto-joven-renta-baja-victoria-transversal-isabel-diaz-ayuso-cuatro-graficos_1_7910479.html,https://www.eldiario.es/datos/izquierda-recupero-cinturon-rojo-madrileno-sumando-psoe-auge-madrid_1_7882110.html,https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/resultados-4m-mapa-voto-izquierda-derecha-madrid_1_7897751.html,,,,"Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres, Ana Ordaz","Raúl Sánchez:  Spanish data and investigative journalist covering stories of inequality, gender, corruption and (now) Covid at elDiario.es.

United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Participant,,The yield curve: why investors are watching closely,15/12/21,"Explainer, Chart, Audio, Business, Economy",D3.js,An interactive explainer on what the yield curve is and why investors take it so seriously as an economic indicator. An innovation in this piece was the use of data sonification techniques which allowed readers to LISTEN to economic data as well as see it. Historical data was presented to contextualise current market movements in an immersive data experience.,"Average time on page for this piece was an extraordinary nine minutes on tens of thousands of views - for a markets explainer! This was one part of the evidence that this new method of presenting data was a hit with readers - the other was the comments that readers posted, notably ""I’m not an expert and cannot comment on the substance here but would just like to say that this was an absolutely *first rate* article. It’s taken a tricky concept and explained it well and simply to a layman; I actually learned something."" This was exactly the intended goal of the project - to take a concept that not many people are familiar with and open it up to a wider audience.","This innovative project used a range of technologies, the most novel of which related to its use of sound. It used midi-sounds-react (which leverages webaudiofont) to generate sounds that conincide with visuals. These visualisations were written with a React library that wraps d3.  The overall story structure and delivery used our own custom page environment (starter kit), which uses React and other javascript frameworks.   On the backend to get the US Treasury data, there's a Github Action script that runs daily and pulls the latest numbers down and puts them into an S3 bucket  ","Using a combination of new technologies and creating a way that makes it easy for us to deploy across all of our platforms - including the interactive story featured in this nomination, but also reusable components that could be dropped into any FT story. This is a particularly important point — with the effort involved in producing a one-off interactive story, it's great to have a reusable solution that can be used in future breaking news stories too!","That there is always another way of presenting information! While there has been an explosion in data visualisation in recent years, we are still on the frontier in terms of understanding the full range of methods that can be used for communicating data. Sound as a medium for data has barely been explored by news organisations, yet offers a compelling reason for further exploration - it requires no screen!

Tunisia,inkyfada,Small,Participant,,"Living on less than 5 dinars a day, mapping the poverty rate in Tunisia",23/09/21,"Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Infographics, Map, Economy, Employment, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, Three.js, JQuery, Json, CSV, Python","Inkyfada uses maps, infographics and interactive technologies to visualise and compare data. This article takes the form of an interactive map, visualising the poverty rate in Tunisia. Our data scientists have also conducted extensive research to be able to find data on existing correlations. Using these numbers, it was then possible to identify the distribution of inequalities within the population. These inequalities stem from various causes, such as unemployment, level of education or access to public services. Inkyfada was able to identify several significant correlations by comparing the various data.","This work is based on data from the National Institute of Statistics, published in September 2020. Through this interactive map, inkyfada has created a way to visualise the poverty rate and inequality in Tunisia, which was further exacerbated by the economic crisis. This map allows for a better understanding of inequalities across the country, and the dissemination of national data of public interest. The data science work that was conducted to find correlations, allowed for a better understanding of the variables that impact our living standards. Access to water, infrastructure, school dropouts... All of these elements were compared to the poverty rate to better understand the different factors affecting the daily lives of people living on less than 5 dinars per day.","inkyfada works primarily with inkube's in-house CMS, which was developed with native PHP and overrides the WordPress workflow to make journalists' jobs easier. inkube has more advanced article creation tools with its powerful Wysiwyg editor developed with reactJs, and its templates engine for creating custom article templates. inkube templates can be created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and even in reactJS. For backend and data provisioning services we use php or python. For articles, we use some of those technologies and libraries: D3.js,GSAP, Highcharts, jquery, OpenLayers, WebPack, WebGl, three.js For the correlations part, we also used data mining techniques with sklearn on python.","As inkyfada is a small structure, it was fairly complicated to realise this project. In Tunisia, it is the first time that an interactive article of this scale has been created. One of the main challenges of this project was to find the best way to visualise all of the data. We had data from 264 delegations in 24 governorates. We comtemplated how to make this data both accessible and relevant for a long time, making the research and brainstorming phase of the project lengthy and challenging. During the design and development phase, it was complicated to display all of the information and make the transitions smooth. Moreover, it was necessary to make sure that the map was adapted to all types of desktop and mobile screens, forcing the designers to adapt the format. Lastly, the developers encountered several difficulties in displaying all of the delegation point on the map correctly on all screens. A balance had to be struck between the density and fluidity of the project. The developers had to use various tricks and methods to make it all cohesive and work.","This project is a good example of how journalists, designers, developers and data scientists worked together to produce an interactive article. With the evolution of technology, data journalism is becoming an extremely powerful tool in order to disseminate information and data in a captivating, storytelling manner. This type of project also goes one step further than the simple dissemination of statistics. In addition to making inventory, inkyfada has done considerable internal work on correlations, which allows certain information to be highlighted, and makes it accessible.  Institutional reports are generally not very accessible to the general public, whereas this type of visualisation work makes the data more user friendly. Moreover, thanks to the data science work, it was possible for inkyfada to go one step further than the INS (National Institute of Statistics) and refine the level of analysis based on the data. Thus, based on the large-scale work that was made possible due to the work already conducted by the INS, inkyfada provided a form of complementary work, similar to a public service.","English, French, Arabic",https://inkyfada.com/en/2021/09/23/tunisia-poverty-map/,https://inkyfada.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Carte-de-la-pauvrete-en-Tunisie-INS.pdf,,,,,,,"Monia Ben Hamadi, Malek Khadhraoui, Haïfa Mzalouat, Marwen Ben Mustapha, Bilel Ben Houssine, Farouk Ali, Hayfa Mzoughi and all the other collaborators who worked in any way on this project",This article was a close collaboration between the members of the editorial team:  - Malek Khadhraoui (executive director of the association) - Monia Ben Hamadi (editorial director) - Haïfa Mzalouat (responsible for the French edition)  And the members of inkylab : - Marwen Ben Mustapha (Head of design) - Bilel Ben Houssine (developer) - Farouk Ben Ali (data scientist)  - Hayfa Mzoughi (webdesigner) And all the other collaborators who worked in any way on this project.,
Germany,Bayerischer Rundfunk,Big,Shortlist,,OBJECTIVE OR BIASED – On the questionable use of Artificial Intelligence for job applications,16/02/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Chart, Video, Business, Employment","AI/Machine learning, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel","Software programs promise to identify the personality traits of job candidates based on short videos. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, they are being advertised to make the selection process of candidates more objective and faster. In the US more and more companies and their HR departments are working with this kind of software. Also, startups in the UK and EU begin to enter the market with similar products for recruiters. We scrutinized one of those products and wanted to find out whether it makes the recruitment process more objective and fairer. ","As an interdisciplinary team that works at the crossroads of journalism and computer science we think it’s important not only to write about the phenomenon but also include data analysis that would show if such AI systems were able to deliver on the product promises. Also, algorithmic accountability reporting and AI as an investigative topic still is quite an underreported field in Europe and Germany. Furthermore, we wanted to contribute to the general debate if and how we want to use those algorithms in the recruiting process as a society.   The investigation triggered a discussion in the media and policy making landscape about the use of AI for recruiting purposes: The Markup’s Julia Angwin addressed the issue in a detailed twitter thread, the weekly magazine Der SPIEGEL and also Business Punk – a partner magazine of the political magazine stern – quoted the investigation in a longer piece about recruiting software. Also the MIT Technology Review cited our work. A tweet by one of our colleagues was largely echoed, especially in the US. In the aftermath of our investigation scientists from universities all over Europe reached out to learn more about our method and results. Also, unions got interested in the issue and refer to our findings. Policy makers who are working with and around the EU AI Act, where such AI Systems are assessed as “high risk”, regularly quote our investigation. ","Based on insights from scientific research in the field of face and personality recognition on the basis of images or video materiel we developed an experimental setup and several hypotheses to test the software. Together with test persons several hundred video clips were produced. The goal: To find out whether a range of factors would affect the artificial intelligence of the software and hence the personality assessment of the candidates. The experiment was performed in two different ways: On the one hand, a professional actress wearing different outfits would answer the various job interview questions, always using the same text and way of speaking. On the other hand, video producers technically modified a considerable number of recorded videos of a diverse group of test subjects. That way, it was possible to make sure for both scenarios that only a single factor would be purposefully changed in each experiment. ","Since we entered terra incognita – there was almost no reporting and only few research on the use of AI-driven personality prediction based on video-snippets in the context of Human Resources – it was challenging to verify the results. We did that by consulting and discussing our results with experts from relevant fields such as Business Psychology and Computer Vision / Machine Learning.  We gained access to an application that promises to evaluate the mimic, gestures and voice of job candidates on the basis of short videos. No other data journalistic team - as far as we know - has conducted such an experiment on a software that claims to use Artificial Intelligence on job interviews before. Getting access to the application and testing it under “real circumstances” – without being uncovered – was a challenging and time-consuming process. We have good reason to assume that the investigation and especially the results of our experiments can contribute to an urgently needed discussion if and how we want to use such AI driven software for recruiting at such an early stage as a society. ","As an interdisciplinary team that works at the crossroads of journalism and computer science, we find it important to not only write about the phenomenon but also include data analysis that shows whether such AI systems are able to deliver on the product promises. Algorithmic accountability reporting and AI as an investigative topic is still an underreported field. And each investigation requires an individual approach. Thus, every story adds to a better understanding of the field and algorithmic accountability in general.  Our method draws on the idea of investigating an algorithm by holding the input constant – except for a single factor under consideration – while evaluating the differences in the output afterwards. This gives you an idea of the importance and the influence of an input variable without knowing the inner details of the algorithm. These (pairwise) comparisons can and should be repeated for various factors in different contexts. That also helps in order to assess whether the impact of certain factors happens by purpose or hints to technical flaws. This approach can be applied to other AI-related investigations and black-box algorithms in general. ","English, German",https://interaktiv.br.de/ki-bewerbung/,https://interaktiv.br.de/ki-bewerbung/en/index.html,,,,,,,"Elisa Harlan, Oliver Schnuck, Steffen Kühne, Sebastian Bayerl, Benedikt Nabben, Uli Köppen, Lisa Wreschniok","Elisa Harlan works as data journalist and reporter at the German public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk (ARD).

Based on more than 11.9 million records, containing 2.94 terabytes of confidential information from 14 offshore service providers, the investigation reveals the secret deals and hidden assets of more than 330 politicians and high-level public officials in more than 90 countries and territories, including 35 country leaders. The files were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with 150 media partners around the world. They also reveal secret holdings of more than 130 billionaires from 45 countries including 46 Russian oligarchs.","The publication of the Pandora Papers has generated reactions around the world, among them:  Within hours of publication, authorities around the world vowed investigations. Officials in Pakistan, Mexico, Spain, Brazil, Sri Lanka, Australia and Panama, among other countries quickly promised inquiries while global watchdog groups demanded action in the wake of stories revealing how billionaires, politicians and criminals exploit a shadow financial system that covers up tax dodging and money laundering. Parliaments, including the European Parliament, and those in Malaysia, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, among others opened discussions about the Pandora Papers. US lawmakers proposed a legislation that experts say represents the most significant reform of anti-money laundering rules since 9/11. The chairman of a Czech Senate commission called for investigations into the offshore deals of Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis’ exposed in Pandora Papers reporting. Czech prime minister’s party narrowly lost re-election days after Pandora Papers revelations in a surprise outcome. A Denver museum promised to return looted relics to Cambodia after US moves to seize them. The repatriation of the ancient statues came weeks after Pandora Papers reporting identified dozens of Khmer antiquities linked to an accused trafficker in the collections of major art institutions. Chilean legislators voted to impeach president Sebastián Piñera after Pandora Papers revelations. Proceedings advanced to the Senate, where the Senate voted 24-18 in favor of removing him from office, but the vote fell short of the required threshold. Ecuador’s president Guillermo Lasso survived removal efforts after a majority of the country’s legislature voted against a recommendation to dismiss him following Pandora Papers revelations. In Sri Lanka, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered an investigation into the Pandora Papers findings, including those showing members of his family used shell companies to buy luxury property and artwork.","The 11.9 million records were OCRed, indexed and shared using Datashare, a secure research and analytical open source tool developed by ICIJ’s technical team. To explore and analyze the information, ICIJ identified files that contained beneficial ownership information by company and jurisdiction, structured it and generated lists by country. In cases where information came in spreadsheet form, ICIJ removed duplicates and combined it into a master spreadsheet. For PDF or document files, ICIJ used programming languages such as Python to automate data extraction and structuring as much as possible. ICIJ used machine learning and other tools, including Fonduer and Scikit-learn, to identify and separate specific forms from longer documents. Some provider forms were handwritten, requiring ICIJ to extract information manually. SVT extracted data from passports. After structuring the data, ICIJ used graphic platforms (Neo4J and Linkurious) to generate visualizations and make them searchable. Graph databases were also used in https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/ Machine learning (Universal Sentence Encoder) was used to cluster due diligence files that didn’t show offshore links and tag them in Datashare, enabling reporters to exclude them from their searches. ICIJ also used Python, ElasticSearch, Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Datashare-Tarentula for analysis on the use of offshore entities by politicians (published in our Power Players feature), use of U.S. trusts, use of offshore entities by Forbes billionaires, suspicious activity reports, lawyers connected to Baker McKenzie who previously held government posts, use of offshore jurisdictions by clients from different countries and distribution by provider, the role offshore finance plays in hiding looted art and ancient relics, Mossack Fonseca clients in the Pandora Papers (with the Miami Herald). ICIJ validated data using public records. The data and analysis were fact-checked through several rounds using spreadsheets and code. ICIJ used its in-house fact-checking tool “Prophecies” to","The Pandora Papers’s 11.9 million records arrived from 14 different offshore services firms in a jumble of files and formats presenting a massive data-management challenge. The Pandora Papers information brought a new challenge because the 14 providers had different ways of presenting and organizing information. Some organized documents by client, some by various offices, and others had no apparent system at all.  A single document sometimes contained years’ worth of emails and attachments. Some providers digitized their records and structured them in spreadsheets; others kept paper files that were scanned. Some PDFs were 10,000-pages and had information in forms that had to be structured. The documents arrived in English, Spanish, Russian, French, Arabic, Korean and other languages. The complexity of the data and the fact that only 4% of the records were in spreadsheet format required a major effort to validate and structure information about companies in secrecy jurisdictions and their owners in the Pandora Papers. The methods used to sort this out involved different approaches by provider, based on the quality of the data and format of the files. The scale of the leak required important computer power to process the information and structure data out of it to conduct analysis afterwards. The reporting effort of more than 600 journalists in 117 countries and territories was central to the project. Due to the sensitivity of the project and the difficult conditions of press freedom where many of the partners were, ICIJ took security considerations into account, such as the use of encryption for secure communication. As the investigation was done in the middle of the Pandemic, it was not possible to organize an in-person meeting with all reporters. Instead, the team looked to stay connected virtually and online training sessions also helped overcome some of the challenges.","Dealing with a large number of records in different formats requires a combination of approaches. Having a tool, such as Datashare, that facilitates the process of indexing, OCRing and sharing the data securely is central to a global collaboration. Also having a secure place where to coordinate efforts and communicate is key. In the case of Pandora Papers, ICIJ used the Global I-Hub, which is a communication platform that uses the software Discourse and has been adjusted to the specific project needs. Establishing security protocols in global projects is also important. ICIJ and its media partners used encryption during the project.  When working with diverse records coming from different sources and formats, it is important to identify key types of files that could be used to explore key topics in the data and structure information that could lead to the generation of datasets and analysis. Structuring information that comes from different files might require a combination of approaches including the use of code for automated data extraction, machine learning for more complex problems and manual work. Reporting outside the data is key to connect the dots and get the stories. More than 600 journalists worked for nearly two years on the Pandora Papers. Visualizations, such as the use of graph databases, can help with the reporting process and find connections in the data. In global collaborations, it’s important to make data accessible to all team members and facilitate its exploration in a way that reporters with or without coding skills can have the same capacity of navigating the data. Training sessions can help with the process of making data and technologies accessible to everyone. It is also key to allocate time for data validation and fact-checking of data analysis. Public records and comment requests can help with the validation processes.",English,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/about-pandora-papers-leak-dataset/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/global-investigation-tax-havens-offshore/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/power-players/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/alcogal-panama-latin-america-politicians/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/met-museum-cambodian-antiquities-latchford/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/baker-mckenzie-global-law-firm-offshore-tax-dodging/,https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/,,600 journalists in 117 countries and territories | About: https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/about-pandora-papers-investigation/ | Partners: https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/pandora-papers-journalists-and-media-partners/,"The Pandora Papers is an investigation by a global team of more than 600 journalists in 117 countries and territories.

Brazil,Estadão,Big,Participant,,Only 3% of brazilian universities have racial equity among professors,20/11/21,"Explainer, Long-form","Google Sheets, Python","The project addresses racial inequality in Brazilian higher education. In the last ten years, public policies have been implemented with the aim of including more black and indigenous students in federal universities in Brazil. The result was positive and the number of black and low-income young people in universities increased a lot. On the other hand, the number of black professors in Brazilian higher education is still very low. We used microdata from the Higher Education Census to analyze the percentage of blacks in Higher Education and discuss the reasons for low representation and its consequences.","The report was published on November 20 – a date that marks the celebration of black culture in Brazil. The repercussion on social networks was intense, generating debate in profiles of great national relevance. The project exposes the racial inequality existing in Brazilian universities and provides tools for the subject to be discussed in depth. The article compares the proportion of black professors at the university with the proportion of black people in the state where the university is based. We consider ""adequate"" the university in which the proportion of black inhabitants is equal to or greater than that of the State. We chose this methodology because Brazil is a very large and diverse country. While in some states the proportion of blacks is less than 20%, in others they are more than 75% of the population. Therefore, we prefer to analyze each reality separately. The main impact of the report is to show that elite universities, classified as the best in the country by international rankings, have very few black professors. None of them have the proper amount of blacks. At the University of São Paulo (USP), the most important in the country, only 4% of professors are black. We also show that public policies created to include more black teachers are flawed and insufficient. Another important impact is to show the consequences of low racial representation in Higher Education. Without diversity, there is no quality debate and universities are an important space for public debate. In addition, experts say that the lack of representation in classrooms ends up discouraging black students from entering higher education.","We use Python and Google Spreadsheet in this project. The pandas library was used to clean, select, cross-check and analyze the data. Google Spreadsheet was used to, after the analysis, organize the data to assemble the graphs. The github with the code is at this link: https://github.com/marihallal/Professores-negros-no-ensino-superior","The hardest part was dealing with the lack of data. The Census provides information on the race of teachers, but this field is not mandatory. About 30% of teachers did not declare race. We had to filter and exclude universities where the rate of self-declaration of race was less than 75%. Also, the 2020 data was late and had not been released. Therefore, we had to work with older data, from 2019. Despite this, the project managed to deal with the problem and present a very feasible scenario of racial representation in universities. I believe that the work deserves to be awarded because it deals with a subject that is very important, but does not receive as much attention.","The microdata from the Census of Higher Education in Brazil have already been used in several reports. However, we were able to analyze the same database and extract new guidelines.

Russia,"dekoder.org, Novaya Gazeta",Big,Participant,,The Russian Duma speaks,16/09/21,"Explainer, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Infographics, Elections, Politics","D3.js, Json, CSV, Python, Node.js","At the core of this project is a tool that analyzes and visualizes all speeches and oral contributions made in the Russian State Duma since its creation in 1994. The tool shows how often and in which years single terms (like ‘sanction’) or term combinations (like ‘alexei navalny’ or ‘foreing agent’) were used by deputies. This allows to understand the important trends in Russian politics and to trace the transformation of the Russian parliament. In the Russian and German versions of the project, the tool is accompanied by an analysis of the evolution of the Russian State Duma.   ","The Russian State Duma plays a minor role in international reporting. The aim of the project was, on the one hand, to develop a tool to make the issues discussed in the State Duma tangible and, on the other hand, to give international readers an insight into the Russian parliament and to analyse how it has changed from its genesis in 1994 and how it ticks today and is positioned within the Putin system. With this project, we have reached a broad readership in Russian and German-speaking countries, first and foremost Russia and Germany, and call the project a success with over 110,000 users. The project itself became the subject of news coverage in Russia, for example it was reported on by online media Meduza.io and independent TV channel “TV Rain”.  The project serves as a tool for many international journalists, researchers and politicians, from whom we have received very positive feedback.","The tool is based on raw data pulled from about 385.000 transcripts from speeches and oral contributions published on the website of the State Duma. The first thing we did to prepare the data was to chop the filtered transcripts up into individual words (tokens). Then we removed all of the “stop words” from the token list, which have no particular relevance for the analysis. Individual terms can occur in a variety of forms, so the next step was to standardise all the variants, i.e. change them all to their dictionary form, or lemma. In computational linguistics, this step is called lemmatisation. We used an algorithm (MyStem) developed by the Russian search engine provider Yandex for this. We also searched the data for words that occur in two or three-word strings (known as n-grams) with particular frequency, because we were interested in combinations of words like “artificial intelligence” or “Great Patriotic War”, as well as in individual terms.The last step was to count the number of times that the words and word combinations appear in the data associated with each individual year. To ensure that differences in the volume of material published in different years would not distort the results, we set up the tool to chart relative rather than absolute frequency; i.e. it shows the frequency with which a word or a combination of words appears per 100,000 words in a year. ​​The data is stored in ElasticSearch database and retrieved via React Frontend.","There were various difficulties in this project, e.g. getting the data and cleaning it up so that the results are correct. However, the most difficult was the data evaluation. We had to realize that the discourse in the State Duma (intensified since 2000s) does not correspond to the social or media discourse, so that some results were sometimes strange. Many important topics (e.g. climate change) are not taken up, for many terms are used euphemisms (e.g. 'anti-terrorist operation' instead of 'Chechen war'). We notice the similar situation with Alexei Nawalny: Although the deputies (unlike Putin) use this name regularly, much more often he is mentioned as ""a figure in a case"", ""blogger"" or ""this person"". There are also many other examples. The difficulties and the attempts to solve them have become main substantive results: parallel data analysis in the tool, analysis of the metadata of the dataset and selective ""manual"" comparisons with the stenograms led us to inhabit new insights into how the laws are passed and generally how the Duma ticks. The most important results show, on the one hand, the evolution of the parliament in Russia from the 1990s, through the early Putin era to today, and the subordinate and functional role of the parliament in the Putin system - the Duma passes more and more laws that come from the president and the government, the count of passed laws is getting bigger and bigger, laws are passed faster and faster, if there are any discussions at all about draft laws, they do not take place in plenary. These findings were published in the accompanying text on the evolution of the Duma and in separate articles on Novaya Gazeta, we link below.","First of all, journalists can use this project as a tool for their own analysis, which they are doing diligently by now)).  We believe the project can be used as a model for analyses of the big data collected in different state institutions in Russia as well as in other post-Soviet and Eastern European countries, to trace the long-term trajectories, turning points, and current state of the institutions. In relation to Russia, it applies especially to regional parliaments and local issues, which are even less transparent than the State Duma. And one can learn (again): dealing with big data is worthwhile and it is worthwhile to offer the user not only the results of a research, but also the tool itself so that one makes the analyses transparent and creates the desire to try it out oneself.

A Medicare beneficiary shares her story of how she has been negatively impacted by rising healthcare costs. While a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid representative offers insight into the federal government's future financial challenge of keeping the Medicare program solvent.  The project examines significant policy proposals, legislative and advocacy efforts, and rule changes that may impact future out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries.","Through this project, we armed Medicare beneficiaries with current and  accurate information about factors that affect their healthcare costs. We took complex data, centralized it and made it accessible to everyone. We connected readers with Medicare experts and resources that could help them find affordable healthcare options.","We used Ahrefs and Semrush to gauge interest in the topic before beginning the project. We found a healthy amount of activity around costs of medicare that signaled user interest in the topic. For example, “how much is medicare going up in 2021” had an average of 320 searches per month, per Semrush. From there, we did what we do best: ethical journalism. We gathered reports and research, interviewed experts and beneficiaries, and conceptualized a design that would enhance the user experience.  We used animation and created graphics, charts, tables and images to engage readers and display our reporting in a unique way. We incorporated an anecdote about a beneficiary and a Q&A with a health policy expert to make the topic relatable and accessible. We promoted the project on social media through paid efforts, garnering 72,258 total impressions and 18 notable shares following publication.","Analyzing raw data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) proved to be our biggest challenge. The MCBS includes data for thousands of people interviewed, organized only by abbreviations and codes. A MCBS Chartbook provides some graphs and tables for certain statistics; however, only a few applied to our out-of-pocket focus and the ones that did were mostly inconsistent. To take in the data, decode it, and use it to generate accurate new reports required more skill sets, training, and software and tools than we had available. We pivoted our approach to rely more heavily on synthesizing existing reports and conducting original interviews with experts who could provide unique insight, including a Medicare policy analyst and a representative from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Another challenge was finding a Medicare beneficiary who would go on record about the cost-sharing burden on beneficiaries. We believed strongly in the importance of humanizing this issue and ultimately included an interview with a beneficiary who struggled for months to afford her prescription drugs with Medicare.

Brazil,O POVO,Big,Participant,,Only 9 states have adoptive leave equal to maternity leave,03/06/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Chart, Women, Health, Human rights","Google Sheets, CSV, R","The adoption of children and adolescents by state civil servants collides with anti-constitutional regulations that establish differences between the children of adoptive parents and the biological ones. Most licenses granted to adopters are for just 30 days. The survey carried out in the 27 statutes of state civil servants revealed that, with the exception of the states mentioned, the license granted is inversely proportional to the age of the adoptee, that is, the older he is, the shorter the term granted.  ","The project reveals the failure of the Public Ministry to call the state and municipal Executive to update their statutes, as well as representing a total lack of information from the powers. When the state does not update its law, according to the new decision of the Federal Supreme Court, it ends up generating the burden for those who no longer have the right they should have. And this is the reality in Brazil, 67% of Brazilian states deny their adopting public servants and adopted children and adolescents, under the prism of the best interest of the child and the right to coexistence, the establishment of affective bonds and the reception in the new family nucleus.","For the construction of this report, DataDoc collected the statutes of public servants of each Federation Unit and based on official documents, we systematized by State and Age of the Child or Adolescent, the times of the maternity leave benefit offered to public servants who adopt in the parents. Data were extracted from government institutional websites and checked via the Access to Information Law (LAI). 27 requests for LAI were submitted to all Brazilian states, these requests required the time of maternity leave granted to servants who adopt children or adolescents, the duration of the benefit, the ages of the adoptees and the rules that govern the benefits.","The most difficult part of this report was to collect and systematize the statutes of public servants of each Federation Unit. Because the vast majority of these documents had updates that were in their version available on government websites. To check the correct information, 27 requests for the Access to Information Law (LAI) were submitted to all Brazilian states.

Canada,Taproot Edmonton,Small,Participant,,Taproot Survey - 2021 Edmonton Municipal Election,23/09/21,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Quiz/game, Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Elections, Politics","Scraping, JQuery, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, OpenStreetMap","We asked people what key issue they wanted the candidates to be talking about as they competed for their votes in Edmonton's 2021 municipal election. Then we turned that input into an interactive survey that would allow voters to quickly find out which candidates aligned best with their values. The survey results played a big role in our coverage leading up to election night on Oct. 18, 2021, showing not only who won but also what they stood for.","From Sept. 23 to Oct. 18, 2021, we received more than 21,000 responses to our survey from people seeking to find out who they agreed with most among those running for mayor and council in their ward. Anecdotally, a number of people shared on social media that we had the best tool to help them decide how to vote, and they shared it enthusiastically. ""The survey was very well done,"" said one user. ""The context was short, but well referenced and made for solid opportunities to explore topics in greater detail. And then at the end, you can see how each candidate responded? ::chef's kiss::"" Another said: ""Shout out to @taprootyeg, the real MVP of #yegcc #yegVote. If you're gonna give a local org some dollars, the Taproot folks are an incredible team."" The project seemed to be the deciding factor for about a dozen people to upgrade to paid memberships. Our mailing list for our daily newsletter grew from 340 in January 2021 to 2,400 by the end of October, and while this project would not be the only factor, it is part of what has grown awareness of Taproot as a reliable and valuable source of information on civic affairs.","We built a custom website to power our election matching engine and results dashboard. The site is built using ASP.NET Core in C# and runs entirely inside the Microsoft Azure cloud environment. We used App Service, Cosmos DB as our data store, Redis for caching, and other features of Azure including DNS, storage, etc. The code is hosted in and deployed automatically from the Azure DevOps service. Using Azure meant that as the election drew near and more people started using the site, we could scale it effortlessly (and for a relatively low cost) and that resulted in 100% uptime even as we served thousands of simultaneous users. We used the City of Edmonton's open data catalogue, which runs on Socrata, to bring in data such as the wards, candidate names, etc. We augmented that data using web scraping. We wrote a JSON importer to download the data from the open data catalog and input it into our data store. We also wrote a results importer for election night, to translate the raw data into our format. We used Microsoft Excel to prepare data for upload into our system, and in some cases to help with data analysis. On the frontend we used Bootstrap, jQuery, Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMaps, Chart.js, Font Awesome, and various other CSS and JS libraries. We generally looked for tools with wide usage, good documentation, and frequent/recent updates to allow us to build the site relatively quickly and reliably. We also wanted something that looked professional and clean. We built an administration part of the website, to help our team track the progress of candidates and see how many voters had completed the survey. That was protected using the Auth0 authentication service. We used Zoom for our listening sessions, and Google Jamboard to gather attendees' input.  ","Getting the categories, questions, options, and context right probably took the most time. At a certain point, it had to be set in stone, so it was very important to get it right. Then chasing the candidates to get them to complete the survey was a big, important task. In the end we got responses from 67 of the 85 candidates for mayor and council, with only a couple of the candidates who were considered contenders turning us down. The survey would not have been as useful without such a robust set of answers to work with. On the tech side of things, the most critical part of the site was calculating a match between a voter's responses and a candidate's, and displaying the correct results in an easy-to-consume way. We went through a number of iterations before we landed on the final layout. Another challenge was getting the live election results on election night into our system so that we could display a rich dashboard with charts and other results. The City of Edmonton didn't produce a feed until just a few days before the election and didn't incorporate our feedback until the day or two before, so incorporating that was a challenge. We are a very small team, but we have some advantages that other media outlets don't have, such as a co-founder who is both a developer and a nerd for city hall stories. This unique mix helped us punch way above our weight in our mid-sized market. ","A series of stories or ward profiles is not necessarily the best way to equip voters with the information they need to choose well. Neither is a steady stream of polling data indicating who is winning, no matter how creatively it is visualized. Ask people what matters to them. Then ask the candidates where they stand on this issue in a way that yields accurate but structured data that you can do something with. Also, build on the cool things that others are building. This project started out as our take on Jay Rosen's Citizens Agenda approach to election coverage, and we benefited greatly from the peer mentorship and training we received through Election SOS. Then we hit a bit of a wall when it came to deciding what to do with all of the input we had gathered. That's when we saw the Meet Your Mayor: Ultimate Match (thecity.nyc) project put together by The City to help voters choose from a large field of mayoral candidates. That inspired us to build something similar for our election.",English,https://edmonton.taproot.vote/2021,https://blog.taprootpublishing.ca/2021/10/27/thats-a-wrap-on-our-peoples-agenda-project/,https://edmonton.taproot.vote/2021/surveys/peoples-agenda,https://edmonton.taproot.vote/2021/results/survey/peoples-agenda,https://edmonton.taproot.vote/2021/surveys/peoples-agenda/statistics,,,,"Mack Male, Karen Unland, Madeleine Stout, Emily Rendell-Watson, Meenakshi Chaudhary, Jackson Spring, Chris Chang-Yen Phillips, Troy Pavlek, Elise Stolte, Rob Houle","Taproot Edmonton has been paying attention to our city since 2016.

It is a project that goes through the whole process of data journalism: webscraping, cleaning and analysis, data science, collaborative journalistic research among six media outlets and massive publication of data for reuse by the audience.","Salud, Dinero y Corrupción had and is having a very important impact on multiple actors involved in the purchase of medicines in Mexico. Dividing it into blocks: - Mexican Institute of Social Security: on the same day of publication it issued a statement acknowledging the project's information and announcing internal investigations. The statement can be found on the project's web page. - Government and opposition: Since the project crosses several administrations the information was taken up by several political parties appearing both in the President's morning conference and in the Senate's oversight session questions. - UNOPS: Following the publication, the UN procurement agency has twice updated its open procurement transparency portal to facilitate access to drug data. - Patients and civil society: The project was key in demonstrating that the consolidated purchasing system did not work and changed both the discourse and advocacy strategies of organizations.","Considering the complexity of the project we used different techniques and technologies in each of the steps. Reconstructing the process: Data collection: We did a webscrapping that first obtained the more than two million valid addresses from the portal compras.imss.gob.mx and then extracted all the data. The code was developed in node.js and to increase speed it was parallelized on several servers. Data cleaning and analysis: This was the most complex process and where we invested the most time. The main tool we used was Elastic's Kibana, but it was complemented with R, Python, LibreCalc, Google Spreedsheets, OCR processes and plain text editors, according to needs and skills. Homepage: The page was built with webflow, making graphics in svg and animations in gif. Data publishing: In addition to the homepage the two million contracts were published in the portal QuiénEsQuién.Wiki, which incorporated new functionalities and graphics (programmed in javascript most of them) in order to show this new information. For example, drug search engine: https://www.quienesquien.wiki/es/buscador?collection=products&name=&tipo-entidad=&pais=&fuente=&size=&sort-all=summaries.classification.company%2Ccontract_amount.supplier%2Cpurchase_amount.product%2Csummaries.classification.shareholder%2Csummaries.classification.boardmember%2Ccontracts.value.amount%2Ccontract_amount.buyer","The main challenge of this project was to deal with the more than two million medicine purchases and convert this data into usable information. I would highlight three key processes: Data cleaning: while the medication code was constant, the name contained small variations and the description was inconsistent. In order to systematize this information we had to obtain the Basic List of Medicines and Medical Supplies (CBMEI) of Mexico, since this was medical information we had to be very careful. Categorization: We have 26,194 different products purchased by IMSS. Finding a way to group them so that the analysis would make sense was a huge challenge. In the end, thanks to the CBMEI and an advanced understanding of the coding of the items, we classified them into medical supplies, consumables, clothing and fabrics, medicines and vaccines, and furniture. Cost overrun methodology: At the heart of this research was the cost overrun, so the calculation had to be very precise and indisputable. We went round and round with more complex options, but the simplicity of averaging and subtraction proved to be effective and understandable.","In the first instance this is a collaborative project led by PODER. At all times we understood that the rest of the media would not be able to use the analysis tools and processes and we designed learning processes so that they could investigate. We continue to train other journalists in Mexico in the use of our internal tools. As for the community of data journalists, we believe there are several interesting learnings that we can contribute: A methodology for calculating drug and medical supply cost overruns that has been tested and accepted de facto by the largest Social Security Institute in Latin America. A data journalism process that includes journalists, programmers, designers and illustrators, working closely with civil society and patients.

United States,The Atlantic Council,Big,Participant,,The China Pathfinder Project,05/10/21,"Explainer, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, News application, Infographics, Chart, Business, Economy","D3.js, Microsoft Excel","China is a global economic powerhouse, but its system remains opaque. Policymakers and financial experts disagree on basic facts about what is happening inside the country. To create a shared language for understanding the Chinese economy, the China Pathfinder project scores China and ten open market economies across six key areas and presents an objective picture of China relative to the world.","Designed to impact public discussion and facilitate better understanding of the implications of China’s different systemic path, China Pathfinder balances accessibility for non-technical readers with a commitment to robust, transparent, data-grounded methods. The primary audiences for the project are the United States private sector and policy makers, as well as government officials in other open-market economies. China Pathfinder was successfully launched in October 2021 with a special address given by OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. The launch received widespread media attention and generated articles from Politico, the South China Morning Post, and more than 100 other news organizations discussing the project’s research and findings. The US policy community has also expressed strong interest in the project; the China Pathfinder team briefed the Department of State, Department of Treasury, and individual members of both the House and the Senate. ","China Pathfinder was built using an innovative combination of Svelte.js, D3.js and the Wordpress CMS. The cutting edge Svelte JS framework allowed the application to be truly reactive, providing real time user feedback and instant interactions and page transitions without the need for a full page reload. Svelte also gave us the flexibility to develop the interactive using an agile approach, drastically reducing development time for changes in the code and allowing us to respond quickly as new algorithms for the economic projections were produced. Since the data behind the interactive was unique and original, we used the D3.js library to create the visualizations from the ground up, giving us the ability to tailor our graphics to the needs of the data rather than shoehorning the data into an existing chart template. The data-driven lines on the main home page graphic were coded from a custom bezier curve algorithm, allowing the user to instantly see patterns in the economies of the countries displayed. The Wordpress CMS gives the administrators complete control over all aspects of the website including content, page design and data. Each visualization is driven by a CSV file uploaded to a custom field on the Wordpress backend, allowing the data to evolve over time without having to touch a line of code.","One of the primary, but most challenging, goals of the China Pathfinder project was to create a data driven assessment of China and 10 open market economies that both Chinese and western audiences and policy makers could find satisfactory. In doing so we wanted to challenge the assumption that data on the Chinese economy was either too opaque or dubious to make rigorous comparison against open market economies. To solve this the pathfinder team engage in intensive research as well as consultations with senior experts across the private sector, US and Foreign Governments, academia, and international organizations such as the IMF to ensure a rigorous and accurate selection of data. The result is a project that draws on a wide range of quantitative resources which allow the team to examine China’s progress across six clusters representing the “domestic” (financial system development; market competition; and modern innovation system) and the “external” openness dimensions (trade openness; direct investment openness; and portfolio investment openness). Based on internal research and expertise as well as external consultations, the project carefully selects a set of annual indicators appropriate for conducting cross-country comparisons in each cluster. Supplemental indicators tracking China-specific data and higher-frequency aspects of China’s economy add nuance to the analysis.","China’s share of the world’s economy quadrupled over the last two decades, from just 4 percent to over 17 percent. It is now so intertwined with the interests of other global actors that few strategic, political, or business decisions can be made without considering China’s trajectory. Yet even experts within the China circle disagree about where its economic system stands, where it is headed, or what that means for the world. In recent years, the heated rhetoric around China and its economic ambitions has begun to follow an eerily familiar and dangerous pattern. Mutual trust between the world’s two largest economies has completely eroded, with one side, the United States, believing it is being taken advantage of while the other, China, convinced it is unfairly maligned for doing what any other nation would do. While both claims are rooted in some truth, over time, the arguments have become detached from data-driven reality. A fact-based assessment of this dynamic is essential in order to prevent excessive tensions between China and other nations, and properly evaluate where coordinated and purposeful cooperation among open market economies may be justified and needed. The China Pathfinder project begins to solve this by providing essential, data-driven guidance to journalists as well as the public and private sector to allow them to accurately and rigorously assess claims about the Chinese economy with relevant and easily accessible data. ",English,https://chinapathfinder.org/,,,,,,,,"Daniel H.

These technologies, which can monitor students' email, social media, Hangout chats and even Google Docs, have been used by more than 200 districts in Texas. Legal and privacy experts have long raised concerns about these technologies, but thus far their use has not been litigated by the courts. The story also documents how Texas’ top lawmakers (including the governor and a U.S. senator) pushed for the adoption of these services.","In response to my findings, a state lawmaker pledged to introduce legislation on the issue in the next session saying ""Parents do not know, unfortunately, that their kids are part of a mass surveillance effort, and we need to address that, quite simply,"" he told me. I was also asked to appear on The Daily Dive, a national news podcast from iHeartRadio, to discuss my findings.","I used SQLite, Excel and Google Sheets to compile and query my data. I used QGIS and Tableau to create the map of the school districts who use or used these technologies, and the News’  in-house charting tool Chartwerk to create a searchable database. This database included the name of the school/district, which technology they purchased, the school year they purchased the technology, the number of students that school year, the purchase description and the total purchase price. The data for this database was obtained through GovSpend, an organization that tracks state and local government spending, and the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education statistics. I also published a version of this database on my GitHub, which includes comment from all the schools who responded to my questions.    ","Perhaps the most difficult part of this project was juggling all of the public records requests I made. I filed records requests at every public four-year college in the state of Texas for correspondence from or related to one of the four surveillance technologies, purchase orders for these technologies and campus police budgets and inventories. I also filed records requests at several school districts using these services. Several of the schools and districts I filed records requests with appealed to the Texas Attorney General’s office, claiming that they didn’t have to release the material I asked for. Many of the schools also quoted outrageous initial cost estimates — for example, one college initially asked for $19,184.03 to complete my request. The jury should select this project because it is the first that I know of that has documented the true scope of digital surveillance in schools and also the first to list the schools that use these technologies, so that the students, parents and policymakers can ask tougher questions about whether they should be used in the first place.","I hope this story encourages other journalists, and particularly student journalists, to pursue stories on surveillance and AI accountability. I also hope U.S.-based journalists and researchers will use this story as a template to examine school surveillance in their state. These are by no means the only technologies schools use to surveil students, so I hope someone is able to truly examine the other services out there which seek to monitor and control their behavior.",English,https://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2021/09/02/texas-schools-are-watching-millions-of-students-online-often-without-their-knowledge-or-consent/,,,,,,,,Ari Sen,"Arijit (Ari) Sen, is a freelance investigative reporter at The Dallas Morning News and a student at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.

It is supported by a custom-PHP backend (used by the journalists to add new information to the tracking system) and a search engine based on a MariaDB database.,"One of the hardest parts in the project was to choose the promises and to establish a methodology on how to measure their progress, since not all the measures included in the coalition pact have a degree of compliance that is verifiable or measurable with objective data. 

As we explain in the project, Newtral team considered that a measure has a verifiable degree of compliance if it consists of something concrete and computable over time. For example, the approval of a certain specific measure, reform or law or the defined increase in funds or the creation of a concrete help, among others. There are promises that express the compromise to ""study"", ""promote"", ""improve"" or ""promote"" policies in general, but without defining exactly what should be implemented specifically, which makes them quite ambiguous and difficult to check. Therefore, we left those ones out of the analysis. After doing this preliminary selection, we determined how many measures its compliance status could be known after a term of legislature and, of them, we chose the 100 that we consider the most relevant. We did it based on its complexity and because it is frequently repeated in the political discourse of both formations. Making a selection also allows us to address them in depth.

The other main difficulty in the project was to decide whether to do it or not, regarding that the major part of the Government has faced a pandemic, which made it more complicated to rule at the same extent that promised at the beginning. We finally decided to do the PactoCheck because the president himself started to do a public accountability act every six months. That enabled us to do it.","We believe that factchecking journalism does not only have to be limited to spot checks of fake news, it can also be integrated into broader projects that have a continuity throughout the legislature and can provide more overall context to the performance of the administration. In this regard, Pactocheck is an extension of the verification work we do, that goes far beyond checking politicians' claims. During the campaign, politicians mention many promises about job creation and investment for which nobody usually demands accountability. We as fact-checkers cannot verify them right then as if they were already past facts, because they are conditional (if they win) and forward-looking (when they win). That is why we can do it now, once the deadlines expire and the first condition is fulfilled.",Spanish,https://www.newtral.es/pactocheck-acuerdo-de-gobierno/,https://www.newtral.es/pactocheck-metodologia/,https://www.newtral.es/rendicion-cuentas-compromisos-pedro-sanchez-gobierno/20210118/,https://www.newtral.es/dos-anos-acuerdo-gobierno-psoe-unidas-podemos/20211110/,https://www.newtral.es/compromisos-cumplidos-gobierno-acuerdo-investidura/20211227/,,,,"Alba Martín, Andrea Real, Cristina Alonso, Elena Turrión, Guillermo Infantes, Irene Larraz, José Denis Cruz, Laura García, María Pascual Gómez, Nahiara Alonso, Paula Boira, Thess Móstoles, Tomás Rudich, Yolanda García","Newtral is a media startup where we do fact-checking and data journalism.

United States,Rest of World,Small,Participant,,The Global Gig Workers,21/09/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Business, Women, Economy, Labor","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","The Global Gig Workers is a deep dive into the lives of millions of workers around the world dealing with the common concerns brought about by the emergent platform economy. It is the result of a months-long investigation and data collection effort—one that surveyed nearly 5000 workers and interviewed dozens more. It includes a longform story on efforts to collectivize, unionize, and generally connect global gig workers, data-driven investigations into gender-based pay disparity and more issues shared by workers across the world, and day-in-the-life profiles of workers in Korea, India, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and South Africa.","This package has become a reference point for our continuing work on the platform economy. We have used our findings to pursue further reporting, highlighting unethical and unsustainable working practices in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It has been cited in other media outlets (Wired, The Verge, The Guardian, Quartz, Techcabal, Tech in Asia, and more) and by academic researchers and labor activists. One of the Indian workers featured in the story, encouraged by the response to its publication, began legal proceedings against the platform company he worked for.","We needed our data to capture a multidimensional picture of the economic, personal and emotional situation of platform workers, so that we could challenge the core defenses of the platform model: that it is an evolution of labor, that it offers flexibility, fairness, that algorithms are neutral brokers of work. 

We needed an approach that joined the individual local stories that we had collected in our previous reporting into a unified global narrative, something that demonstrated the universality of the issues that workers faced without losing the texture and uniqueness of their experiences. Our solution was to perform a broad survey of gig workers in 15 countries, with questions tailored to capture hard data on their demographics, economic situation, and working conditions, as well as more subjective analysis of their emotional states. 

Working with a mobile phone-based survey company, we pre-filtered survey subjects in 15 countries to build a solid base of around 5,000 workers who responded to our questionnaire. We collated and cleaned the responses into a dashboard that allowed us to trend-spot and identify gaps and anomalies. Through extensive interviews with platform workers, labour rights experts and economists, and by collecting local data on average earnings, working hours and similar factors, we established a basic weighting system that allowed us to feed our data through into an ‘index’ that meant we — and readers — could compare workers’ situations between job function, geography and gender. 

This approach gave us a substantial statistical backing for what our on-the-ground reporting was telling us about how platform work was being experienced worldwide; it directed our future reporting on the subject, and continues to be used by our reporters to shape coverage of platform work.","The biggest challenge we had with this project was finding ways to bridge the gaps in scale between the personal stories we needed to tell to root the narrative in character and emotion, and the global macro picture we needed to present. We also needed to be able to draw broad, international conclusions while preserving the texture and uniqueness of the individual countries we covered in the project.

Overcoming this meant designing a survey that drew extensively from our existing reporting on platform work, which gave equal space to emotional and environmental factors as it did to more quantitative indicators of job quality. We were also careful to select the countries covered by our survey, making sure we had a broad spread of geographies, income levels and political and social contexts, while also ensuring that each had a large enough sample size, strong baseline data and sufficient existing information for us to be able to understand anomalies and deviations. 

The data we gathered helped us to do more than simply measure the state of platform work, but to deepen our future rounds of reporting, and to identify questions that often aren’t considered in narrower reporting on the issue: How do algorithmic management systems encode gender prejudices, and what happens when those are transplanted into paternalistic societies? What corners get cut when you run a libertarian, regulation-averse business model in a country like Ukraine, with limited state capacity and widespread corruption? Who, ultimately, foots the bill when companies don’t pay a living wage?","The core learning from this project was that journalists increasingly have the tools to perform massive-scale reporting to provide statistical backing for their on-the-ground work. Using a hybrid model that blends data collection with reporting, we were able to project human-scale narratives onto a global scale. This kind of approach — which combines an academic research model with journalistic sensibilities — will have many applications in our work as we try to find ways to verify and challenge our reporting. Most importantly, it shows us the importance of collaboration between “traditional” journalists and data specialists, with each bringing their unique insights and experiences to create a whole that’s more than the sum of its parts.",English,https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/,https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/,https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-index-mixed-emotions-dim-prospects/,https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/,https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/,https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/#case-studies,,,"Peter Guest, Youyou Zhou, Michael Donohoe, Ravi Hiranand, Katherine Lee, Anna Rasshivkina, Nilesh Christopher, Kaleab Girma, Megan Janetsky, Grace Moon, Zinara Rathanyake, Adi Renaldi, Zuha Siddiqui, Norma Young","Peter Guest is the enterprise editor for Rest of World.

United States,"Crosscut, a service of Cascade Public Media",Small,Participant,,Cops and Credibility,08/04/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Crime","Microsoft Excel, CSV, SQLite","After the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, Crosscut decided to find out how many cops in Washington state had been flagged by prosecutors as having credibility issues, yet who remained working as police officers. This involved requesting thousands of pages of documents – more than 100 records requests in all – to create a unique database of officers who had been flagged by prosecutors for issues such as lying, filing inaccurate reports, showing racial bias and using excessive force, but who didn’t lose their jobs as a result.","By examining prosecutors’ files across 39 Washington counties, Crosscut identified 183 cops who had been flagged by prosecutors as having credibility issues, yet who continued to work in law enforcement. Prosecutors track these officers using lists commonly known as Brady lists.

Additional reporting revealed some of these officers had initially been fired for their actions, but were later reinstated through arbitration. This fueled discussions in the state Legislature about reforming arbitration rules, a debate that continues today.

Our reporting also exposed the limits of a new police accountability law, showing that – contrary to key legislators’ intent – the measure would not go after officers for past misconduct. This prompted the speaker of the state House to say that it may be necessary to refine and clarify this new law.

Our reporting also pushed some county prosecutors to update their Brady lists to include additional officers. In other cases, county prosecutors refined their systems for tracking troubled cops. 

The same day our project came out, the state’s Black Lives Matter Alliance called on the state Attorney General to investigate officers who had been placed on prosecutors' Brady lists. A day after our series was published, a statewide watchdog group, the Washington Coalition For Open Government, gave us an award for advancing the cause of open government in Washington state.","We used the state’s Public Records Act to request documents from 39 counties, as well as  several dozen smaller jurisdictions. We then went through tens of thousands of pages of PDFs and hand entered information into Google Sheets to create our own database of officers on county prosecutors’ Brady lists, along with the reasons why they had been placed there. We then used a SQLite client, DB Browser, to compare our database of more than 800 officers with the state Criminal Justice Training Commission’s database of police officers who are currently working. 

This analysis, completed using relational database tools, initially produced a list of more than 200 working officers that appeared to be on Brady lists in Washington state. Our fact-checking and verification process, which involved reaching out to individual jurisdictions and police officers to confirm the accuracy of our database, showed that a few of those officers were false matches, however. In the end, we were able to confidently identify 183 officers who continued to work as cops despite being flagged by prosecutors as having credibility issues. This number, we are certain, is an undercount, as we were very careful to not count certain officers if there was any doubt about whether they were the same person named on a prosecutor’s Brady list. 

We used pivot tables in Excel to analyze how many officers were on the Brady list in each county and the reasons they were placed there. This allowed us to share with readers how many officers were flagged by county prosecutors for issues such as lying versus issues like mishandling evidence.","Getting the records and determining which officers were still working were the biggest challenges. This project involved more than 100 records requests because this information isn't kept in any centralized place. Each prosecutor's office maintains their own sets of files and lists of officers who have had past issues.

Additionally, prosecutors’ files don’t always include information about what the actual offense was, or what specific behavior caused an officer to end up on a Brady list. This meant we had to file dozens of follow-up requests with local police agencies for disciplinary records to acquire the information needed to create a meaningful database.

After creating our database of all officers on county prosecutors’ Brady lists, it became clear many of these officers no longer work in law enforcement. We wanted to know how many officers with problematic histories were still working. To find this number, we had to acquire a database of all currently working peace officers in Washington state and compare it with our built-from-scratch database (using SQLite).

Cleaning and fact-checking the database took a great deal of time because we had to use names as our field of comparison, since there wasn’t a unique identifying number for each officer that was common to both databases. Most of the records we received did not even contain officers’ dates of birth that could be cross referenced with the state’s database of certified officers. 

This meant many days of locating and discarding duplicates, as well as confirming the identity of individuals — particularly for officers who had common names or had changed departments. The difficulty involved in obtaining these records and completing the necessary follow up is part of what made this a mammoth project, one that no other news outlet in our state decided to take on.","Hopefully, this project has provided a blueprint for other reporters in other states to drill down and find out how many local officers are on prosecutors’ Brady lists, but have not lost their jobs over their lying or misconduct. 

In states with public disclosure laws like Washington’s,  journalists can check with their county prosecutors’ offices to request more information about officers with credibility issues. 

Reporters can also look to see what procedures are in place for local prosecutors to disclose information that could be used to question an officer’s testimony. Those reporters can then evaluate and explore whether prosecutors are meeting their obligations to disclose potentially exonerating information – and if not, why not.",English,https://crosscut.com/news/2021/04/nearly-200-cops-credibility-issues-still-working-washington-state,https://crosscut.com/news/2021/04/how-fired-cops-win-their-jobs-back-arbitration,https://crosscut.com/news/2021/04/getting-story-how-we-investigated-cops-credibility-problems,https://crosscut.com/politics/2021/08/despite-credibility-issues-wa-cops-find-police-jobs-elsewhere,https://crosscut.com/politics/2021/11/wa-lawmakers-want-new-police-decertification-law-apply-past-misconduct,https://crosscut.com/inside-crosscut/2021/12/how-crosscuts-brady-list-stories-impacted-wa-police-accountability,,,Melissa Santos,"Melissa Santos is Crosscut’s staff reporter covering state politics and the Legislature.

United Kingdom,JPIMedia,Big,Participant,,An Unbroken Chain: Modern Slavery in the UK,15/02/21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Podcast/radio, Video, Immigration, Crime, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Flourish","This was a collaborative project that exposed extensive inadequacies in the UK’s response to modern slavery more than five years on from the introduction of landmark legislation. It was anchored on a number of data-driven pieces and built upon by searching news pieces and features from an eight-strong team of reporters located in newsrooms across the UK. We put together a comprehensive article pack to share with our local newsrooms across JPIMedia, containing exclusive FOI findings and open data analysis with data organised to allow titles to localise their coverage to their own police force or council areas.","The UK’s landmark modern slavery legislation was purportedly designed to send “the strongest possible message to criminals that if you are involved in this disgusting trade in human beings you will be arrested, you will be prosecuted and you will be locked up”. Our reporting showed the opposite is true. The vast majority of cases investigated by police have seen no charges brought – our analysis found that UK police forces had failed to bring charges in more than 19,000 modern slavery offences since 2015, 19 out of 20 cases – while the CPS had lost four out of five of the small number of cases that make it to court, with suspects waking free and even those found guilty often escaping with nothing more than a fine. Our findings were clear – despite strong rhetoric from politicians, not only are slavery offences taking place on a vast scale in every corner of the UK, the perpetrators are going largely unpunished.

Freedom of Information Act requests also exposed how the UK may be breaching its international obligations to ensure victims of modern slavery have access to compensation – the 2015 legislation having reiterated the importance of such compensation to victims’ recovery and introduced new measures such as Slavery and Trafficking Reparation Orders. The figures we obtained showed the vast majority of applicants to Government-sponsored programmes of redress are unsuccessful. Figures also suggest courts are failing to impose compensation orders when convicting people of offences, despite their mandatory-by-default nature. This was the first time the failure to enact this part of the legislation was brought to light. We also were able to draw attention to the data gaps that exist through a failure to properly monitor the legislation’s impact.","We carried out analysis of open data on police recorded crime from the Home Office to analyse the outcomes of around 20,000 modern slavery offences recorded across England and Wales since 2015, finding around 19 in 20 cases were closed by police without any charges being brought. We also analysed open data on court records from the Ministry of Justice to trace the outcomes of the few modern slavery cases that make it to court, calculating conviction rates and average custodial sentences to highlight the relatively soft penalties faced by those convicted when compared with the tough approach promised in the legislation. This analysis was carried out with Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. We created user-friendly databases to share via Sheets with non-data specialist reporters in JPI’s local newsrooms, so they could localise our stories to their area. We also used Freedom of Information Act requests to gather similar data for Scotland and Northern Ireland, where a weaker open data culture meant these figures were otherwise inaccessible. 

Analysis of Home Office figures on the National Referral Mechanism also allowed us to build victim profiles for police force areas across the UK to give local titles an insight into the situation in their area, and calculated changes in volume of victims identified over the initial Covid period.

Finally, where the data analysis is concerned, we submitted Freedom of Information Act requests to plug data gaps on victims’ access to compensation, finding that the vast majority of applications for compensation to CICA in England and Wales had been rejected, while no compensation applications in Northern Ireland had been successful. 

Flourish was used to create data visualisations with localised filters, that could be used in all coverage, both national and regional.","If there is one thing our investigation into the Modern Slavery Act 2015 came up against time and again, it was a lack of reliable data – and this is something we sought to highlight. The 2015 Act brought in a range of measures to protect and support victims, alongside creating a new umbrella offence with tougher penalties for perpetrators.
This included Slavery and Trafficking Reparation Orders – compensation orders that courts must consider making whenever they convict someone of slavery offences, to redistribute the proceeds of their crimes to their victims. But the Ministry of Justice has failed to collect any data on their use. It rejected our freedom of information request asking how many had been issued and the values awarded, saying only individual courts have that information.

There is also no data collected on the use of a new statutory defence the Act created, to give victims who have been coerced into criminal activities through exploitation a defence in court. An independent review of the Act in 2019 raised concerns that there was “limited understanding” of this defence among police and lawyers. It recommended the Government collect data on its use, alongside that of compensation orders. 
Our project was therefore shining a light in areas where data gaps seemed almost by design to be preventing effective scrutiny.  

It was also challenging to gather data for each of the devolved UK nations that could rival that available in England and Wales, to track how slavery and trafficking is being tackled in each country. We overcame the challenge through Freedom of Information Act requests however care was needed when combining each country’s figures due to differences in data collection and definitions.","Other journalists could learn from our collaborative approach. While the data work in this project was done by one data specialist (Harriet Clugston), the project was brought to life by a series of searching features, explainers, survivor testimony and non-data driven news pieces from a team of reporters. The local knowledge held by some of the team – for instance of the pressing issue of sex trafficking in towns in the North West of England – also shaped our focus. We also worked with audiovisual producers to create video content and a podcast to repackage our findings to new audiences.",English,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vHOyQPo70auq3EOuwk9UifQY5Flj21V0P7zkvvHtU-M/edit,https://www.shieldsgazette.com/read-this/more-19000-slavery-and-human-trafficking-crimes-left-unsolved-uk-police-forces-2015-modern-slavery-act-3135128,https://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/read-this/crown-prosecution-service-failing-on-modern-slavery-as-four-in-five-suspects-walk-free-from-court-3135185,https://www.wigantoday.net/news/crime/uk-failing-legal-duty-provide-compensation-modern-slavery-victims-3130379,https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/news/crime/two-three-councils-using-suppliers-who-are-not-complying-modern-slavery-act-3134683,https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/read-this/almost-30-modern-slavery-victims-found-every-day-in-the-uk-last-year-figures-reveal-3140204,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0LYY2Ig86sBiFsUCQSKZ05,,"Harriet Clugston (data journalist and editor), Ethan Shone, Isabella Cipirska, Michael Holmes, Conor Matchett, Philip Bradfield, Millie Salked","JPIMedia's regional investigations team, led by data and investigations editor Harriet Clugston",

A global team of journalists investigated the names & companies in the database. Collaborating with 16 media outlets & scores of reporters, we found several instances of elites hiding their business activities from the authorities & public scrutiny.","In Luxembourg, the prosecutor has opened at least 12 cases as a result of the OpenLux investigations. The government has committed to putting more people in the prosecutor's office to investigate financial crime.
 
The Luxembourg government put forward a draft bill aimed at allowing authorities to sanction those who use the country’s financial system for money laundering and tax evasion. The law will grant the LBR the power to impose sanctions and relieve the country’s justice system in cases where the registry is abused. “I can confirm that the Minister of Justice will submit to the government a draft bill allowing the Luxembourg Business Register (LBR) to impose administrative sanctions,” Luxembourg Ministry of Justice Press Attaché Monique Feidt told OCCRP.
 
In Serbia, the Openlux investigation created a huge political scandal and forced the president to give an explanation to the press.

In Spain, the Openlux investigation connected a former IMF director, Rodrigo Rato, to the company owned by an arms trafficker, Abdul Rahman el Assir.
 
Several EU parliamentarians are using the OpenLux investigation to strengthen the legislation for the next EU directive in terms of requirements for future registers. 
 
A month after the publication of the investigation, the European Parliament held a plenary debate titled “Reforming the EU policy framework to stop tax avoidance in the EU after the OpenLux revelations.” 
 
A German MEP used OpenLux to press for open company registers after investigation with Indonesian partners showed a palm oil magnate owns a Frank Gehry structure in Dusseldorf — a fact unknown to the German authorities.
 
Reacting to the publication of OpenLux, EU Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said he is considering an amendment to the anti-tax avoidance directive.

European Economic Commission officials requested that a Le Monde reporter explain the revelations from OpenLux.","his project was based on the exploitation of public data and was unusual in its large size and geographical scope.   We built a gigantic database from two public registers: the trade and company register ( RCS), which brings together all the administrative acts of Luxembourg companies, and the register of beneficial owners (RBE), which lists the ultimate owners of these companies.  This data and documents were mapped to match OCCRP’s Follow the Money data structure and then ingested into Aleph.  OCCRP Aleph is a data platform that brings together a vast archive of current and historic databases, documents, leaks and investigations.  Adding the Luxembourg data to Aleph automatically extracted the names of companies and people that we could then match up with other records we hold to find leads for stories.
Luxembourg has initiated in recent years a process of financial transparency, but this has its limits: the information contained in its registers is not freely offered to the general public in an open data process (open data), as in other countries. To access it, you must connect to the Luxembourg Business Register (LBR) site, and type the name of a company that you know beforehand. Impossible, on the other hand, to submit the name of a person to know the companies which it owns, nor to make a search on the contents of the documents, as on a search engine.  By scraping and importing this public data into Aleph, we enabled journalists to overcome these imposed technical obstacles and easily conduct reverse-company look-ups and searches and match the results against other datasets to find what would have otherwise proven to be difficult, if not possible, to find connections.","The size of the data was unwieldy, and without context it didn't mean much. To get the context and find the leads we needed to a) use Aleph to find overlapping data and connections and b) find the right journalists who knew enough about the people and companies mentioned to understand the importance of what they were looking at, and then spend the time to tenaciously dig to turn that into a story. Aleph enabled journalists to overcome the limitations of the site itself - reverse-company look-ups by people and in bulk, in addition to the cross referencing matches across datasets.","With the right tools and expertise, public data can be used to find important stories and push for change. 
The data can continually be mined for stories by partners and others, like this one published months after the initial OpenLux project came out. https://www.occrp.org/en/openlux/trail-of-venezuelas-stolen-billions-leads-to-caribbean-luxury-properties

United States,The Intercept,Big,Participant,,"Network of Right-Wing Health Care Providers Is Making Millions Off Hydroxychloroquine and Ivermectin, Hacked Data Reveals",28/09/21,"Investigation, Breaking news, Database, OSINT, Map, Politics, Health","Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python","Since early in the COVID-19 pandemic, America’s Frontline Doctors has been lying about public health, including spreading disinformation about vaccines and promoting unproven medicines hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as miracle cures for the virus. Our investigation, based on hacked records that an anonymous source sent us from AFLDS’s telehealth partner SpeakWithAnMD and online pharmacy Ravkoo, showed that during a two month period, 72,000 patients paid $6.7 million for phone consultations alone. The vast majority of 340,000 prescriptions filled were for ineffective COVID-19 medications, costing patients $8.5 million for these bogus drugs during 11 months of the pandemic.","Following our story, the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, a committee in the U.S. House of Representatives, announced an investigation into AFLDS and SpeakWithAnMD, widely citing our work. The committee also wrote a letter to the chair of the Federal Trade Commission requesting that the agency “investigate the deceptive conduct of companies promoting and profiting from misinformation” about the pandemic.

In response to our reporting, and similar reporting by other newsrooms about AFLDS, we have confirmed that the Medical Board of California is investigating Dr. Simone Gold, the founder of AFLDS who was arrested while storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021, which could lead to her getting her medical license revoked.","An anonymous hacker sent The Intercept health care records from SpeakWithAnMD’s partner Cadence Health and from the online pharmacy Ravkoo. The Cadence Health data was in hundreds of thousands of JSON files full of patient data, and the Ravkoo data was in enormous CSV files full of prescription data.

Because there was so much data and it was all in machine formats, roughly half of the time working on the story involved writing Python code to parse the data and convert it into usable components. These included  spreadsheets containing useful fields related to patients, simplified versions of the prescription data that could be graphed in a pie chart, or spreadsheets listing city names, number of patients, and geolocation coordinates to build a map.

We also used several other tools and technologies for this project. In order to untangle the history and ownership of domain names belonging to a network of LLCs, we made extensive use of the service WhoisXML API to look up historical domain name records. The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine was extremely useful in building out a timeline of events of AFLDS’s activities. We also made use of the OSINT tool Maltego to build a graph that shows the links between the various organizations, individuals, and domain names.","The hardest part of this project was making sense of massive, unintelligible datasets in a short period of time, all while protecting the privacy of individuals. Because the data we were working was sensitive patient and prescription records that are subject to HIPAA regulations, we had to take precautions to carefully protect it, including not uploading any of it to third party services.

The anonymous source provided hundreds of thousands of JSON files and several CSV files each containing hundreds of thousands of rows, but without any documentation. It wasn’t until we began closely looking at the data, and parsing it all using Python scripts, that what we actually had became clear: a network of companies were making millions of dollars off of pandemic misinformation. The fact that these were two separate datasets, one from the pharmacy and the other from the telehealth company, each covering data from different periods of time, made it all the more complicated.","Although journalists have a responsibility towards the public and towards the data they use and publish, we found ways to responsibly investigate a large hack of medical records without compromising the privacy of individuals. We compared public social media posts by individuals who were in the hack to confirm that they were patients, and conducted all of the data science locally without sharing it with third parties.",English,https://theintercept.com/2021/09/28/covid-telehealth-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-hacked/,https://theintercept.com/2021/11/01/covid-hydroxychloroquine-ivermectin-investigation/,https://theintercept.com/2021/12/20/americas-frontline-doctors-covid-clinics/,,,,,,Micah Lee,"Micah Lee is the Director of Information Security for First Look Media, The Intercept’s parent company.

Jordan,Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ),Small,Shortlist,,Nepotism in Palestine: Officials’ Relatives are Guaranteed a Job Upon Graduation,09/07/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Chart, Corruption",Python,"This investigation documents the appointmnet and promotion of the relatives of officials in the Palestinian Authority in public offices or diplomatic corps without any transparency in these appointmnets.
This is a clear violation of the Palestinian Basic Law, the Palestinian Civil Service Law, and the Diplomatic Corps Law, and it erases the principle of equal opportunities when getting a job.","This investigation provoked reactions and caused repercussions in the Palestinian and Arab public opinion, especially since it was published in the same day when the activist Nizar Banat was killed by the Palestinian Security forces for his rejection of the policies and corruption of the regime.
The investigation was circulated by many institutions, organizations, and local and international networks, and it was republished by many websites, electronic pages, and dozens of websites in Palestine and the Arab world. It also caused an uproar on social media and campaigns were made for it. The investigation also received a certificate of appreciation from ARIJ Annual Awards for Arab Investigative Journalism in 2021 in the Best Arabic Investigative Report - Data Journalism category.","In this data-driven report, we analyzed the official and unofficial databases of employment in the Palestinian government and diplomatic corps over 10 years, and built 5 databases on Microsoft Excel to organize, clean, and analyze quantitative data.
We compared the percentage of government job advertisements to the number of job applicants, as well as extracting the number of relatives of government officials in those jobs. We also used the “Tableau” program to extract tables from the official gazette files in Palestine, as it is one of the important open data sources we relied on. We also used the “Import.io” program during the process of collecting data from the local news archives in Palestine.
As for the visual representation of the data, we relied on the Tableau, Flourish, and Infogram programs. This data visualization played an important role in communicating the message of the investigation.","We faced a set of difficulties and challenges during the investigation, including: ensuring the validity of the data circulated, preparing lists of data on cases related to appointments and promotions, persuading sources to speak because of the seriousness of the issue, communicating with credible sources and experts, and ensuring the “right to comment” from senior authorities in the Palestinian Authority.

We faced indirect threats from some cases during the step of the ""right to comment"", including Hala Fariz, the Palestinian ambassador to Sweden, who hinted that she would go to the judiciary in the event of writing contrary information that denies her account. We were forced to publish the investigation under ""pseudonyms"" because it documents and exposes the corruption of senior officials in the Palestinian Authority and in the judiciary and intelligence agencies who keep promotions and appointments for their relatives and families in clear violation of the law.

The publication of the investigation coincided with the killing of the Palestinian activist Nizar Banat, and sparked widespread controversy. Which made us more insistent on the issue of the pseudonyms, fearing for our safety, especially because one of our colleagues lives in the same city in which Nizar was assassinated and the series of arrests that joined the ranks of journalists in that during that period.

Jordan,Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ),Small,Winner,"Data journalism can contribute to saving lives, and this is what Mustafa Mansour Mohamed and his team at the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) set out to do with their “Lanes of Death in East Cairo” data investigation. They put themselves in harms ways to confront officials in a country where journalists often see the inside of a jail cell for daring to speak to authority and they collected field data about the rising death toll among pedestrians on the roads of East Cairo while trying to avoid the Egyptian security services that might have categorized their activities as subversive.  The risk paid off - the President of the country addressed the issues highlighted in the investigation and the road infrastructure was improved through the building of pedestrian bridges in dangerous traffic areas and through smart safety systems that were also put in place. The ARIJ investigation combined satellite data, direct data collection and very thorough data analysis to make a big difference for the citizens of Cairo.",Lanes of Death in East Cairo,30/09/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, OSINT, Chart","Microsoft Excel, Python","The investigation documents the increase in deaths and injuries of pedestrians on the restored roads (developed and expanded) in East Cairo, due to the failure of the Ministry of Local Development to establish safety means on those roads, such as speed bumps, pedestrian crossings lanes, traffic lights or providing pedestrian bridges, which increased number of victims on the asphalt, with those reposnible for the lives of people in Egypt being complicit in their deaths.
This is in addition to an environmental defect that resulted from the destruction of trees and historical plantings to expand those roads.","After publishing the investigation, Egypt's president called for emphasizing the safety of roads and facilitating pedestrian crossings lanes, and also called on government officials to expedite the launch of the smart security system that would prevent accidents, monitor roads, and ensure rapid intervention. Some pedestrian bridges were built, and the president also instructed to hold community meetings with the residents to explain what happened.
Here, I would like to point out that in Egypt there is no significant influence of the press, and there is usually a negative and misfortunate influence on the journalist or the newspaper that publishes the investigation.","1. Excel sheets: to build two big databases. The first is for the victims of road accident victims and included details of the time and place of accidents, their ages and jobs, and the type of accidents. Using functions, I got results of the places that witnessed most accidents, their time, type, vehicle type, and the type of injury or death.

2. The second Excel sheet used Google Earth to document satellite images, modifications, and lack of safety measures on the roads before its expansion and after development, to be used as evidence to prove the hypothesis.

3. Juxtapose JS: to display satellite images interchangeably to show the stages before and after development in one interactive image to highlight the size of the trees that were removed and the loss of the green color, and to clarify the absence of any safety measures on the roads for pedestrians.

4. Tableau: to convert some spreadsheets in PDF format to a database in Excel sheets, and I used it on a small scale, especially since there are no databases except for the old ones.

5. Florish: tool to turn the data into interactive graphics that highlight the rise in road and pedestrian accidents over the past and current years, as well as in other thermal graphics to see the timing of accidents in order to protect people from them. It is the areas where most accidents occurred.

6. Google Maps: to plot the roads with the most accidents, and I made a commuter car to document the lengths, widths and lack of safety for pedestrians (which I did on the ground on a real field tour).","- The hardest part of the investigation is the lack of official databases or statistics available from beginning to end, so I had to manually create databases and include them in Excel sheets and collect them myself from Facebook groups for the victims’ areas where they were writing and photographing each incident with video, photos, and data, So I compiled a case by case file of pedestrian accidents after making sure they were documented.
- I tried to update the database from local news sites, where I found a way to find the news of the victims using the keywords “in transit” in the news pieces of pedestrian accidents, which enabled me to update the databases.
- I also conducted a questionnaire to target the population in those areas and find out the extent of the damage and its spread, although this was a danger to me because I could have been tracked by the security forces, especially since some will consider this as a move to spread false news.
- I also had to do field work to confirm what I wrote about about 15 roads, and indeed I almost hit some pedestrians had it not been for the fact that we were driving slowly, and I also documented before and after pictures of the roads via satellite.
- Confrontation with the officials was inevitable but extremely dangerous. Every journalist who tries to criticize or question the achievements of the government and the state is prosecuted, and it is considered unpatriotic, and the officials try to evade answering. But in the end, I confronted them.
- Finally, I published the story under a pseudonym out of fear for my personal safety and out of fear of being stalked.","- Don't give up if there are no databases, you can build and analyze databases by yourself.
- Do not despair no matter how difficult the story is, but you have to document and prove it with more than one evidence and more than one method.
- You have to listen to the people and those affected, we write these stories for them.
- Your personal safety is more important than anything else, and you can write a story to get everyone's attention.
- You have to come up with your final story in an easy, convenient, interactive way that is backed up by all numbers","Arabic, English",https://arij.net/investigations/Cairo-Streets-en/,https://arij.net/investigations/Cairo-Streets/,,,,,,,Mustafa Mansour Mohamed,"An Egyptian investigative journalist, with over 10 years of experience in writing in-depth, data driven, and cross-border stories, as well as stories for television.

Hong Kong,South China Morning Post,Big,Participant,,Dancing and Singing Clusters Project,02/01/21,"Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Infographics, Health","D3.js, JQuery, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","The project was developed following the need to explain to the audience the reasons for the explosive expansion of Covid-19 among dancing clubs, in view of the fourth wave of infections and the subsequent imposition of restrictive measures for all the activities. 

The main goal was to show the movement of infected people among the dancing venues and its incidence over the spread of the new wave of cases. A secondary goal was to explain the reasons of this outbreak and the analysis of the data gathered to depict a frame of the population affected.","In late 2020 and early 2021, the dancing clubs were fully operational and receiving significant numbers of visitors every day.

In Hong Kong it is a tradition among people of all ages, especially among the population above 45 year-old, to attend private dance events, group singing and dancing lessons, where attendees tend to move from one venue to another. During the pandemic, the spread of the virus among these venues was significant and took only a few days to become a critical origin of new infections. 

Once the project was released, it was pretty active in social media, due to the relevancy of the subject and the noticeable consequences of the fourth wave in the city. The untraceable cases triggered a series of specific lockdowns and strict social distancing measures. The project had its print version explaining specifically the spread of the virus among the dancing clubs, enabling the infographic to reach a wider audience group.","The Hong Kong government has kept strict records on everyone who has been infected. The data includes: Number of infected (since the beginning of the pandemic), Gender, Age, Date of confirmation of contagion, Residential address and Status (resident-not resident).

The below part explains how did we manage to date back the time when those infected cases began to have symptoms before going to dance clubs (in total 28 places):

- It was determined that in 30 days there were 732 infections originating in the dancing clusters. With this database, it was possible to establish the relationship between the places and the infected visitors.
- The paths were determined to reconstruct the contagion pattern according to the recorded dates.
- Relationships were established between these clusters and other existing outbreaks in Hong Kong, relationships between infected people, their mobility in different venues and their places of residence.
- It was determined that 41% of infected women were people between 60 and 69 years old
- It was established that the sources of contagion came mainly from mainland China, despite the efforts of the government to control the borders, there were situations in which the vectors of contagion were dance instructors from China hired from Hong Kong who had crossed the border for illegal entries.

Once all the information was gathered, it was easy to find connections between the venues. 

The interactive animation of spreading infected cases, with an inset locator map, is created using javascript libraries such as jQuery, D3, GSAP and Scroll Magic. For the charts and illustrations, we used animated gifs and graphics generated in Adobe Illustrator and Maps generator to work with locations","The information gathered turned out to be multidimensional. Information includes places in Hong Kong to plot in a map or in a spatial reference, days covered, ages of infected people, genders, people's origins and immigration status, close contacts situation, symptoms and iteration of patterns.
In the beginning it was difficult to establish which factors should be the predominant ones to tell the story. Several flow diagrams were tested to explain the temporality and displacement effects.

We realized that the static solutions were not effective, that is why an interactive exploration formula was chosen so that the user could superficially or deeply analyze all the connections between the clusters.

Once that functionality was defined, the time was invested in the design of the tool. The interactivity worked well but the design of the visual elements represented an important challenge due to the limitations imposed by the desktop and mobile screen in particular. It is a story that must be displayed vertically without losing the whole context, it was chosen to use a small lateral navigator to guide the user within this network of cases. The curved lines, colors and the movement of the elements in the interaction are determined by the concept of dance, which is what was wanted to secure aesthetic to arrange the elements of the visual story.","The reporters had to collect a massive amount of data that was continually being updated. They also suggested multiple ways to visualize the problem because for them it was necessary to find patterns in the clusters and contagions in order to tell the story.

The coverage of this news was based from the beginning on the need to visualize the data instead of delivering raw data, due to the large number of variables. Both journalists and designers understood that there are various stories behind the data relationship that deserved to be told and related to the interests and daily life of a city, and they will always have a good reception among the audience. The series of graphs are explorative and allow users to draw conclusions that help understand human phenomena in the face of a pandemic.",English,https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3115971/hk-covid-cluster/index.html,https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/lonelyGraphics/202101A274.html,,,,,,,"Marcelo Duhalde, Senior Infographic designer;

Hong Kong,South China Morning Post,Big,Participant,,The mass arrest of Hong Kong’s opposition figures,12/07/21,"Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration, Infographics, Politics","D3.js, JQuery, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","After two years of protests in Hong Kong, the local bureau and graphics team of the South China Morning Post aimed to showcase all the relevant figures arrested by the Hong Kong government.","We published a digital standalone and a print version. Both were received with great interest by readers, particularly on how the information is presented in the digital version, which allows them to interact and discover who is among the detainees. The print version, even showing less detailed information, had a significant impact on social networks, perhaps because the size of the arrests is understood at a glance. More than 600,000 impressions were reached on Twitter alone.","For this investigation, all the data was collected manually through the reports of the SCMP, other Hong Kong media outlets and the Hong Kong Police.","We had photos of each affected person for the visual composition, and the story told by them. Still, each picture was of different sources, dimensions, colours, and resolutions, so using them in a project would remove some aesthetics from the narrative. For us, composition and design are essential. So we decided to illustrate the whole, making portraits of all the politicians and activists involved. In such a way, the plan would be more consistent. The main idea for the narration was to present it with some mystery and allow the reader to play and discover who is who, while hovering over the dark figures, with a spotlight illuminating the person involved and showing the relevant information. This visual solution tries to play metaphorically as the prison lights to monitor the arrested.

So the most significant technical problem was to carry out this visualization, which was solved using Javascript libraries such as JQuery and D3 and taking great care with the labelling of the illustrated plates with more than one hundred detainees.

We also made a print version for the paper edition. We used a simple colour code to show their situation and the name of each arrested.","For us, the exciting thing about this learning is that you can work on attractive and stimulating projects, even with a limited team in terms of technology.",English,https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/hong-kong/article/3140438/national-security-law-arrests/index.html,https://multimedia.scmp.com/culture/article/SCMP-printed-graphics-memory/lonelyGraphics/202107A288.html,,,,,,,"Adolfo Arranz, Deputy Creative director;

Australia,ABC News,Big,Shortlist,,Jackpot: How the gambling industry cashed in on political donations,14/10/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Business","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Australians squander more on gambling per capita than any other nation. 
Our series Hitting the Jackpot is the most comprehensive and detailed examination to date of the money flowing from Australia’s gambling industry into the political system.

Unlike most countries, Australia’s gambling industry extends far beyond lotteries and casinos. This is one of the reasons the industry’s political influence is so difficult to quantify.

Our project adopted a new approach to this problem, expanding on previous analyses to trace political payments from more than 370 gambling-related businesses and individuals over 22 years.","The project provided clear evidence of the monetary ties between the gambling industry and Australia’s political parties at a time of intense public scrutiny of the gambling sector’s links to money laundering and organised crime.

Using data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) Transparency Register – a public database of annual disclosures about the financial dealings of political parties, candidates and others involved in the federal electoral process – we uncovered for the first time at least $81,769,853 in political payments linked to entities with a stake in gambling. This is more than twice the amount previously identified.

A key reason for this difference was that our project encompassed hundreds of organisations and businesses with interests in gambling, compared to the dozens identified in previous analyses.

This new data was used to build an unprecedented searchable database which visualised the flow of money through an connected bubble chart. 

The series renewed calls for greater transparency and accountability of Australia’s federal political donations laws and provided impetus for the introduction of two separate bills to federal parliament.

These bills campaigned for, among other reforms:
* banning political donations from particular industries including gambling
* lowering the threshold for reporting political donations to $1,000
* capping donations and electoral spending
* requiring real-time disclosure of political payments.","We used a combination of Excel, Google sheets, OpenRefine and Tableau Prep to collect, share, catalogue, clean and join data. 

We used Tableau Desktop to analyse and explore the data, as well as draft and create proof-of-concept visualisations.

We built a custom tool to scrape the data from the AEC website. We chose to scrape rather than download the data because the scrape picked up metadata (such as client IDs) which we knew would be invaluable not only for cleaning and joining our data to other datasets but also for future use of our work.

The custom tool was designed to pull details of all payments to and from our list of gambling “clients” (first-tier clients), whether declared by the donor or recipient.
It also fetched payments to/from associated entities, enabling us to detect vast amounts of money paid indirectly to parties.

All the charts were created using the D3 framework.
 
In Part 1, the tree chart adapts to various screen sizes/shapes to solve the issue of readability on small screens. In Part 2, we used a series of bee swarms to demonstrate how the pattern and timing of specific payments reveals clues about their purpose.

In both parts, we used a step-by-step “scrollyteller” to to avoid overwhelming people with detail. This format allowed us to guide users through the visualisations and zoom in on specific data points while providing relevant background and context to particular payments and clients.

This format also allowed us to give a sense of the sheer scale and number of payments.

Lastly, the interactive connected bubble chart (adapted from a network chart) in Part 1 allowed the user to explore the data more thoroughly and see how each of the groups are connected.","The hardest part of the project was creating a unique dataset of payments specific to the gambling sector.

We began by negotiating with three separate groups – the Democracy For Sale project, Monash University and the Centre for Public Integrity – to obtain their political donations data (specifically, their lists of clients categorised by industry). 

We then compiled these three databases into a single “master dataset” of roughly 17,800 entities required weeks of cleaning because: 
1. the databases didn’t have shared fields or IDs which would allow a straightforward join; and 
2. donor and recipient names can have any number of variations (e.g. a single donor may be known as “Australian Hotels Association”, “Australian Hotels Association (NSW)”, Australian Hotels Association, NSW”, “AHA NSW”, etc.) making string matches difficult.

After compiling the master list we identified donors with gambling interests.This step was critical because previous analyses of political donations data have tended to categorise each donor by a single interest or industry However, this masks the true size and reach of Australia’s gambling industry, which penetrates into sectors far beyond casinos and lotteries, and includes individuals and businesses which may appear, at first glance, to have no obvious links to gambling.

It involved detailed research, including examining company records, annual reports, media archives, etc., and extensive consultation with researchers, gambling reform groups, and others with expertise in the topic.

We then forensically examined all payments connected to those entities, supplementing data scraped from the AEC website with data collected manually from hundreds of PDF forms. These contain key details – and in some cases, entire payments – missed or excluded from the Transparency Register’s online database.

The resulting dataset is the most comprehensive and detailed record to date of payments made by the gambling industry to Australia’s political parties.","This project demonstrates how journalism can build on previous work to develop new approaches and purpose-built datasets in response to the news of the day.

Our data-driven approach allowed us to not only create a new dataset from existing research, but to also generate new insights and break ground at a time of intense media focus on the gambling industry.

The series also shows that journalists can reveal important information even when the available data is incomplete, patchy or very messy. Australia has some of the weakest political donations laws in the developed world; multiple loopholes mean the source of more than a third of the money remains unknown. But detailed analysis of the available data reveals clues about how strongly Australia’s political parties and elected representatives are linked to the gambling industry.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-10-14/how-the-gambling-industry-cashed-in-on-political-donations/100509026,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-23/how-gambling-industrys-biggest-political-donors-influence-votes/100592068,,,,,,,"Inga Ting, Nathanael Scott, Alex Palmer, , Katia Shatoba, Michael Workman, Anna Freeland, Stephen Hutcheon","Inga Ting (data journalist), Alex Palmer (designer), Nathanael Scott (developer), Katia Shatoba (developer), Michael Workman (researcher) and Stephen Hutcheon (supervising producer) are part of ABC New’s Digital Story Innovations team.

Australia,ABC News,Big,Participant,,Anatomy of our battle against COVID-19,25/02/21,"Explainer, Long-form, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Health","D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","This article, published on the anniversary of Australia’s first documented cases of COVID-19, uses the ABC’s national dataset of every confirmed coronavirus case to tell the story of how Australia’s battle with the disease unfolded in its first year.
 
It combines one of Australia’s most comprehensive and detailed COVID datasets with expert commentary and testimony from ordinary people across the nation in a forensic examination of how the pandemic unfolded in Australia, how well our government succeeded in keeping Australians safe – and at what cost.","In a world saturated with daily news and data about the pandemic, this project was able to distill a year’s worth of data into a central narrative that threaded the pivotal moments in Australia’s battle with COVID with expert analysis to help Australians understand the cataclysmic events of the past year.
 
By using a data-driven approach, the project helped deepen public understanding of the successes and failures of  policy decisions taken over the previous year. It also underscored what Australians had helped to achieve through their cooperation with government and public health experts. By raising public awareness of these issues, the story also enabled richer debate about future public health decisions.
 
In addition, our detailed data analysis of infections in aged care forced the government to improve its own collection of aged care data, after our work revealed numerous errors in their records.
 
Hundreds of readers responded to a callout asking how they had been affected by the pandemic. Our team spent days compiling these responses into a public “diary” and we received dozens of messages thanking us for showing that despite many people feeling alone during the lockdowns, their experiences had been shared by others across the country..
 
An unusually large numerous requests were made (by individual members of the public and organisations researching the pandemic) for copies of the opening illustration, which we believe gives some indication of this particular visualisation.","We used a combination of Excel, Google sheets and Tableau Prep to collect, share, catalogue and clean data. 

We used Tableau Desktop to analyse and explore the data, as well as draft and create proof-of-concept visualisations. The density map of Melbourne cases was also created in Tableau Desktop.

The interactive charts, visualistions, and particle animation were created using the D3 framework. 

Static charts were created in Tableau Desktop and then designed and completed in Adobe Illustrator.

First-person stories were collected using the crowdsourcing tool Screendoor.","The hardest part of the project was collecting the data; a second challenge was working out how to cut through pandemic (and COVID data) fatigue.

Our team has led the ABC’s collection and analysis of domestic coronavirus statistics, maintaining a database that tracks key information about Australia’s fight against COVID-19.
Maintaining this database is not a straightforward exercise. The data is separately compiled by each of Australia’s eight state and territory health departments, plus the federal health department. Each uses its own definitions, protocols and processes. 

On top of that, the federal department “locks away” much of its data in charts, PDFs and powerpoint slides that change without notice, making it difficult to scrape. While it eventually began reporting daily figures on a webpage, the data is only available for 24 hours and the department refuses to share historical data with the public or media. 

Requests for clarification, further information or explanations for data anomalies are frequently ignored, making data processing, cleaning and reconciliation extremely difficult. 
Much of the details of each case, including source of infection, links to known clusters, and identities of deaths, were collected manually by our team by combing press releases, media reports, surveillance reports and other documents. 

Data tracking the daily progression of dozens of clusters also had to be pieced together by our team.

Combining all these figures into a national dataset that allows meaningful comparisons across the jurisdictions was a daily battle that required forensic interrogation of multiple disparate datasets and  intimate understanding of the methodology behind each one. To ensure the highest standards of data integrity we work closely with each of the nine health departments plus a network of researchers, physicians and public health experts.","This project shows how journalists can:
* Responsibly and meaningfully communicate government data to the public during a crisis. This helps to deepen trust between the public and the government/public institutions, reduce fear, and encourage wider debate about public policy
* Hold the government to account through the process of verifying/analysing (and questioning) government-reported data
* Create independent sources of data. These original datasets are indispensable for holding the government to account and shaping public policy. Citing our own sources of data has enabled us to pressure the government into improving its existing data or releasing new and more detailed data
* Link “cold, hard” numbers, often seen as objective and unemotional, with their meaning and impact in the real world, reminding the public that behind every covid statistic is a person.

The story also demonstrates journalism’s cathartic role in society. By giving the public an outlet to share their fear, joy, grief and other experiences, our story brought out a sense of community and helped Australians process these life-changing events.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-01-25/covid-19-spread-through-australia-over-year/13078574,,,,,,,,"Inga Ting, Nathanael Scott, Alex Palmer, Katia Shatoba, Michael Workman, Mark Doman and Stephen Hutcheon","Inga Ting (data journalist), Alex Palmer (designer), Nathanael Scott (developer), Katia Shatoba (developer), Michael Workman (data compilation), Mark Doman (digital journalist) and Stephen Hutcheon (supervising producer) are part of ABC New’s Digital Story Innovations team.",
Bosnia and Herzegovina,BIRN,Small,Participant,,Balkan Terrorism and Foreign Fighters Database,19/03/21,"Cross-border, Database, Open data, Video, Map, Crime, Terrorism","Json, Node.js","The Terrorism and Foreign Fighters Database, contains comprehensive information about court verdicts for domestic terrorism in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. It also includes verdicts from the trials of people accused of going abroad to fight for the so-called Islamic State and other militant groups in Syria and for pro-Russian separatist forces in the conflict in Ukraine. The database utilises BIRN’s experience of covering terrorism trials in the Western Balkans and includes photographs and videos as well as a resource centre that offers video explainers and PDF booklets on how to report on violent extremism and terrorism.","The project had several important impacts on different levels. Primarily, this was the first time a comprehensive database containing all court verdicts for terrorism and fighting on foreign battlefields was developed for the entire Western Balkan region. Thus its role in informing the public and stakeholders was valuable. Additionally, it revealed how differently countries in the region are tackling terrorism and fighting in Syria or Ukraine. The database revealed for example, how certain countries, in which Muslims were minority, such as Serbia, are taking a much harsher stance on prosecuting fighting in Syria compared to fighting in Ukraine. Thirdly, the database proves as a valuable tool to combat misinformation, as many right wing politicians in the region and even Western Europe, have used fake information to try and claim that the ""threat"" of Jihadism in the Western Balkans was larger than in fact data shows. Fourthly, the database also contains a resource centre which assists young journalists to learn how to use data in reporting about terrorism and fighting on foreign grounds. Finally, the database provides a platform for future research, as we have seen it quoted by experts who are comparing sentences in the region to that in other parts of the world.","The Terrorism and Foreign Fighters Database was built following the traditional 3-tier architectural pattern, including the front-end display tier (React/Next.js), application tier (Express.js and Node.js), and database tier (mySQL). The application tier exposes a CMS web application for entering data. Next.js was picked for it's server side rendering feature, which enables better SEO support as well as faster load times. Node.js allows for building fast, scalable network applications, and offers benefits in performance as well as faster development. MySQL is a widely used, fully featured, free-to-use, open source database. The entire system is running in a kubernetes cluster hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, which supports high availability and scaling.","There have been several problematic parts. Firstly, the database was developed in the pandemic, which in the Western Balkans, meant courts were not open or transparent and BIRN journalists had to spend significant time to gather all information necessary to develop the database. Secondly, it was important to make it comparable and easily manoeuvred which was not easy for such a large amount of data. Thirdly, much of the verdicts were delivered in PDF format and some were anonymised, which made them difficult to incorporate in the database, so BIRN journalists utilised their analytical knowledge of cases to insert all necessary data.","Other journalists can learn how to use raw data, like court verdicts, to develop a multilayered database, which actually informs the public and also assists in breaking down narratives of right wing politicians. Young journalists can use the resource centre to educate themselves on how to use data in reporting about violent extremism and terrorism and how to avoid traps of reporting in a sensationalist manner.","Bosnian, English",https://terorizam.detektor.ba,https://balkaninsight.com/2021/03/19/birn-launches-balkan-terrorism-and-foreign-fighters-database/,https://terorizam.detektor.ba/resource-center,,,,,,"BIRN team

The researchers came to the conclusion that the Russian-language media almost do not show the victim from a positive or even neutral side, do not note the gender nature of the problem. The media broadcast to men examples of women being murdered, but they do not assess these crimes negatively.","Since the topic is related to systemic changes, it is difficult to assess the impact immediately after publication. This is a unique study, the first in the Russian-speaking media space. When the conditions are right for change, our research will provide the basis for change in media work and crime prevention against women and girls.

The main goal of the project is to draw attention to the problem, to attract media and journalists to the work. This was because the authors conducted polls and interviews with journalists during the preparation of the study. When the publication came out, researchers shared the project with reporters and received feedback. There were good reviews from Violence.net, the authors spoke on the Dozhd TV channel, and the industrial publication sila.media also wrote about us https://sdelano.media/femicid/ Also, fellow researchers decided to conduct similar studies of the language of the media, we received requests from teams for help (for example, the authors of the publication consulted with an international team that deals with the topic of sexual violence against children in the media, as well as with a researcher on the topic of stigmatization of mental illness, etc.). The team believes that our methodology has helped other researchers explore other important social issues.","For the analysis, the researchers chose a time period from the beginning of 2019 to the beginning of October 2021. With the help of the Integrum library, which has an extensive collection of Russian-language media archives published in Russia and abroad, the researchers downloaded 20,000 texts. To search for them, they used certain phrases that can be found in texts about femicidal crimes, such as “killed a woman”, “hacked his wife,” etc. The sample was incomplete, since much more similar texts were written in Russian, including number in the media organized on social networks (for example, in news groups on the social network ""VKontakte""), which are not indexed by Integrum. Most of the uploaded texts - over 80% - turned out to be short news messages. To analyze texts, highlight the essence and the most frequently occurring words, the authors used the nltk library intended for the analysis of natural languages. She made it possible to understand which words are more often synonymous in texts about femicide. For example, the word ""woman"" is most often synonymous with the word ""victim"", and ""man"" is most often synonymous with the words ""murderer"" or ""cohabitant"", ""husband"". The researchers conducted a survey among Russian and foreign journalists writing in Russian through thematic communities on social networks and personal contacts with media editors. Also, the researchers used the method of content analysis of texts based on the methodology of researchers from Canada. https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/abhilash.kantamneni/viz/OntarioFemicideMediaAnalysis2020/Story1","This is a unique study, the first in the Russian-language Internet. The authors talk about a systemic problem, they involve different parties, and journalists, and a psychologist, and a language expert. Also, as a result of the research, the team offers options for solving and improving the situation.","In the study, the methodology was highlighted and detailed, and the team is ready to share all the best practices. Also, other journalists can find out what sources can help in obtaining journalistic texts, how the language of the media can be analyzed, how interviews with journalists can help in this, what experts can be involved in researching such topics. Also, the publication can help to learn more about what femicide is and what are its causes and factors that affect the murders of women and girls.",Russian,https://lr.7x7-journal.ru/femicid/,,,,,,,,"Leyla Eminova (Azerbaijan), Natalia Donskova (Russia), Maya Sagym (Kazakhstan),   Dada Lindell (Russia), Alisa Bulatova","Leila Eminova, Baku, Azerbaijan Student of Baku State University,Journalist, Winner of the German DAAD Scholarship Program

United Kingdom,NationalWorld,Small,Participant,,The Justice Gap,02/11/21,"Investigation, Podcast/radio, Women, Crime, Race","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","This investigation exposed a justice gap faced by victims from ethnic minorities when it comes to sexual and gendered violence. I submitted FOI Act requests to police forces across the UK to build a database of crime outcomes by victim ethnicity for rape, sexual assault and domestic abuse offences, and found police were more likely to bring charges in cases where a victim is white. 

Two articles were accompanied with a podcast episode.","The existence of data gaps was something that was conspicuously absent from a major government-commissioned report into racism in the UK earlier this year, of which policing and criminal justice was a core part. However, in a report on violence against women published in September, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabularies said there were “major data gaps” and inconsistencies when it comes to monitoring crime prevalaence and outcomes for victims by their ethnicity. Without this data, HMIC says proper oversight and accountability is impossible, preventing forces from “properly understanding how crimes affect women and girls with protected characteristics” and taking remedial action to address shortcomings.

My project was the first time that outcomes for sexual and domestic violence crimes have  been gathered and analysed. It therefore puts the impact of a lack of data on victim characteristics into sharp relief, and makes a strong argument for more robust data gathering in the criminal justice system. The Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales said it was “an important investigation” that helped the call for better data collection to further evidence the scale of discrimination against minority ethnic victims. 

It revealed the vast majority of police forces had lower charge rates for Black, Asian and mixed race victims than white across the three crimes examined. Ten forces did not bring a single charge over the rape of a black victim across a five-year period, despite recording 148 victims between them.
 
Data gathered from the Crown Prosecution Service through an FOI, and read within the context of ONS data on the relative rarity of mixed race relationships, also suggested white domestic abuse victims are more likely to see their attackers face justice in court.","I used Freedom of Information legislation to gather crime outcome data by victim ethnicity from UK police forces for between 2016 and 2020. The data required extensive cleaning and restructuring, which was undertaken over several months, to organise the crimes and outcomes into ethnic categories that were comparable and uniform across each police force. I then calculated charge rates for each ethnic group to compare the likelihoods of cases leading to a suspect being charged.

I further obtained data on the number of prosecutions undertaken and convictions secured by the Crown Prosecution Service in domestic abuse-flagged offences broken down by ethnicity of the suspect, again using Freedom of Information Act requests. I initially requested data based on victim ethnicity, but discovered this was not collected by the CPS. The data I received showed that white suspects were far more likely to be convicted than minority ethnic victims. When combined with data from the ONS on the prevalence of inter-ethnic relationships – which are relatively rare in the UK – I concluded that the lower conviction rates for minority ethnic perpetrators most likely in turn reflected minority ethnic victims being less likely to see their abusers brought to justice.

I also analysed Ministry of Justice open data on court outcomes to benchmark the domestic abuse figures. I found that while white people were more likely to be convicted across crime as a whole, the gap for domestic abuse offences was twice as wide as for all crime, strengthening my story","The data I gathered from each police force was extremely messy, with unruly structures that were difficult to clean and reorganise into an intelligible format that would make analysis possible. This required a lot of painstaking manual cleaning, sometimes pouring through data line by line to draw out the ethnicity, crime category, and type of outcome data.

Furthermore, different ethnic categories were in place across different police forces, with some individual forces using multiple ethnic group categorisations simultaneously. Some used. While some used categorisations consistent with ONS and Home Office statistics, breaking ethnicity down into distinct categories such as ‘White British’, ‘Asian Bangladeshi’ and ‘Black Caribbean’, others used broad, vague categories such as ‘North European’ and ‘South European’, often making no allowance for mixed-race people. This made it impossible to gain insights at a national level beyond the umbrella categories of white, black, Asian and mixed race, into which I moulded each force’s figures.","I think this project is a lesson in looking for the gaps in data, and what might be going untold. The Home Office publishes comprehensive police recorded crime data for England and Wales. 

The abduction and murder of Sarah Everard refocused attention on the issue of violence against women and girls and failings within the criminal justice system to tackle it. One aspect of this has been plummetting charge rates over rape offences, with victims very unlikely to see their rapists charged, alongside poor prosecution and conviction performances.

This project was in part inspired by this focus on sexualised and gendered violence, but also by a report published in 2020 by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities. The report caused a backlash because of bold conclusions it made about the system in the UK no longer being deliberately rigged against black and ethnic minority people. It included a large section on the criminal justice system, which almost entirely focused on situations where black and minority ethnic people are the antagonist to the criminal justice system – whether as suspects, or through stop and search – with very little attention on their experiences as victims. 

As a data journalist I am very conscious of how often public data does not contain ethnicity breakdowns. The phrase ‘data gap’ however does not appear once in the Commission's report. I therefore decided to plug a gap by replicating existing police recorded crime data but with ethnicity breakdowns, to find the disparities that are obscured by a homogenised approach. I had a hunch that black and ethnic minority victims would suffer even worse outcomes in sexual and domestic violence than white victims – and the data bore the suspicion out.",English,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/crime/police-more-likely-to-bring-charges-for-rape-sexual-assault-and-domestic-abuse-cases-when-victim-is-white-3441205,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/crime/black-and-asian-domestic-abuse-victims-less-likely-to-see-convictions-in-court-3442329,https://www.nationalworld.com/news/uk/how-we-exposed-the-ethnic-disparities-in-justice-for-victims-of-gendered-violence-uncovered-podcast-3443541,,,,,,"Harriet Clugston, NationalWorld data and investigations editor","Harriet is a data journalist based in Edinburgh and leads data and investigations projects for NationalWorld, a new national news brand from JPIMedia entirely be journalists outside of London.",

They are the result of decision-making processes linked to the legitimisation of the past, and to the construction of a collective historical memory.

Mapping Diversity visualises gender inequalities among people who have streets named after them in regional capitals in Italy. Thanks to the project, it is possible to see not only how many streets are dedicated to women, but also where they are located and who these personalities were.","Mapping Diversity enriches a wider discourse on gender inequalities in Italy. In fact, even if improvements were achieved in the last few years, Italy is still a country where men occupy the vast majority of top positions in the key areas of society.
Mapping Diversity raised a critical issue in the public debate in Italy. It was extensively mentioned by national newspapers (la Repubblica, il Post, Linkiesta) and magazines (Elle Decor, Cosmopolitan) to raise awareness on the recognition of female historical figures in Italian cities. After the publication we also started having intensive exchanges with national NGOs dealing with gender equity and female representation. 
The project also won the Italian Data Journalism award awarded by the Festival Glocal Varese.","The analysis has been carried out using R and Rstudio, specifically the tidyverse and osmdata library. For this project, an R library, ""tidywikidataR"" has been developed, in order to have a consistent approach to get data from wikidata in tidy formats.

The data was collected from open and crowdsourced sources. Street names were extracted from OpenStreetMap and then filtered, cleaned and matched with instances contained in Wikidata. Data collected automatically was then double-checked manually through an ad hoc interface developed for the purpose. The visual part was designed so as to let users explore the map of each city, with pop-ups showing a short profile of the women represented.

Though being currently centered on gender gap, we plan to cover more cities, European countries and topics. The established methodology can lead to further analysis, such as: which roles, segments of population and historical figures do we honour, and which ones do we ignore? To what an extent are foreigners, people of colour, etc. celebrated in our urban spaces? And to what an extent are problematic figures celebrated instead (e.g. people associated with racism, colonialism, dictatorships, etc.)?","The hardest part of this project has been dealing with the data. Being OpenStreetMaps and Wikidata crowdsources sources, matching toponyms and odonyms with wikidata entries has not always been smooth. Especially in cases where streets were named after local personalities with no Wikipedia pages to retrieve the data from.
This made it mandatory for us to manually check most of the associations manually in order to fine-tune our analysis. This has been highly tie consuming but ensured a quality that automatic data analysis could not have had.","What we learned themselves: that open data has great potential for culturally transformative projects. There are, of course, obstacles that hinder the use of this data.

Switzerland,Neue Zürcher Zeitung,Big,Participant,,The sea ice of the Arctic is melting rapidly. Snow is also to blame,27/07/21,"Explainer, Long-form, Documentary, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment","Animation, 3D modelling, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python, Node.js","The Arctic's dwindling sea ice is one of the most visible signs of climate change. In this story, we follow three scientists on a year-long expedition to the Arctic as they try to unravel what is at stake for this fragile ecosystem.

The article features novel animation and interaction techniques – optimized for a mobile reading experience – to bring the remote Arctic and complex climate processes closer to our readers. Infographics and data visualizations convey the newest scientific findings. All these elements are interwoven with anecdotes from the scientists who tell us how they witness and document a rapidly changing world.","The story was well-received by our readers. Many of them spent an above-average time on the article online. It was also printed in the newspaper and widely shared on social media. At the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ), the article served as a showcase for how science and visual journalists can successfully collaborate to present a data-driven story in the most engaging and informative way possible. The collaborative processes and technologies used are now being applied to other NZZ stories.","The story begins with a cinematic opening in which readers scroll through the Arctic landscape, following the research vessel to its anchor point. The video uses positional data, a 3D model of the ship, and scans of the Arctic sea ice to paint a realistic journey. We produced the animations in Blender and linked them to the reader’s scroll position with the JavaScript library GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform).

When the scientists arrive at the North Pole, winter has already begun. We show the darkness of those days in illustrations of the winter landscape and in spectacular photos shot by the scientists. 

When summer arrives, a second animation follows. It explains the complex “albedo effect” – a process that plays a significant role in arctic climate change. Step by step, our readers learn how the Arctic sea ice – and its reflective properties – change through the seasons as they scroll through the animation. To visualize this physical process in a captivating way, we relied on recordings that the protagonists had made during the expedition. We turned these into illustrations and animated them using Adobe After Effects. We used the open-source animation format “Lottie” to bring the animation into the browser and made it controllable with the JavaScript library GSAP.

As the expedition nears its end, we put the scientists’ findings on snow and sea ice loss into the global context of climate change. In scientific illustrations based on exclusive material, we show how the porousness of snow changes how it can reflect sunlight. We use data visualization to explain what the models are predicting about arctic sea ice loss. The visualizations were created with the Python library Pandas, the Javascript library D3.js, and Adobe Illustrator. Most models show that the arctic will have ice-free summers by 2050.","While working on this story, we encountered various challenges. First, we had to find a way to relate foundational research to our readers in a gripping manner. This meant we had to understand the science ourselves – a challenge that was not made easier by the fact that the researchers were still analyzing their data. These circumstances called for a close collaboration between our team and the scientists and between the science and the visual journalists. It also meant that we had to learn how to work with diverse, unusual source material such as computed tomography scans of the snow or lidar data of ice floes. 

The second major challenge was to bring together multiple storylines, different narrative formats, and diverse visual material. The journey served as our narrative thread along which we could tell the story of ground-breaking research and natural processes in the Arctic. In the text, explanatory and anecdotal sections alternate. We used a consistent visual style to hold all the elements together and help the reader settle into the story world. 

Finally, we also explored boundaries in terms of technical implementation. For example, with the ""Lottie"" animation format, we tried different ways of explaining an organic, natural process to our readers. Such a detailed and interactive animation of this process has never been built for the browser to our knowledge.

We believe that the story should be selected because it presents a new way of combining science, data, and visual journalism to create an impactful, enjoyable reading experience. The article shows how news can be data-driven but at the same time experiential rather than analytical. Our way of collaborating with scientists and our multi-disciplinary team of science journalists, visual journalists and coders provide an example of how journalism can be practiced as a collaborative undertaking.","We hope that this article inspires other journalists to tell more stories on climate change research in an engaging way. Our article is based on data, but the story is not an analytical one. Instead, we use data and visualization to guide the reader through a cinematic experience. As the web becomes more performant, animation and video offer a new chance to tell complex stories about our natural world. 

Various skills are needed to produce this kind of reading experience – data wrangling, data visualization, illustration, motion design, web programming, and science literacy, to name only a few. We hope to see more and more teams invest in these skills and the collaborative processes needed to bring these skills together. Our project – both the process and the outcome – can serve as a blueprint for these undertakings.",German,https://www.nzz.ch/visuals/das-ewige-eis-der-arktis-schrumpft-rasant-das-hat-auch-mit-schnee-zu-tun-eine-spurensuche-ld.1635974,,,,,,,,"Adina Renner, adina.renner@nzz.ch, project lead and animation

It contains original data analysis and field reporting tracking wildlife crime in 7 countries in East Africa before and after the pandemic. The project was produced in partnership with Code for Africa with funding from the Earth Journalism Network and JRS Biodiversity Foundation. The investigation, cross-published on media houses in East Africa, includes interactive maps, drone imagery, podcasts and videos to shed light on the impacts of Covid-19 on wildlife conservation in a critical region.","Pandemic Poachers was published widely with both an international and local reach, serving as a call to action to conserve nature in a time of crisis. The final digital project brings together 10 in-depth stories published by 11 major media houses in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan and internationally including online platforms, newspapers, TV stations and radio stations. The final digital project was also cross-published by three other media houses in the region.

The stories were reported by 9 East African journalists in the InfoNile network following a 5-week training by InfoNile in data journalism, solutions journalism and wildlife conservation reporting, conducted online during the lockdown. The journalists received individual mentorship, editing and data visualization support by InfoNile and Code for Africa. Some of the journalists also joined a follow-up 6-month data journalism training and mentorship program. According to before-and-after surveys, the journalists’ skills in Wildlife Reporting, Data Visualization, Solutions Journalism, and Data Journalism increased by 12%, 22%, 22% and 15% respectively.

Some journalists said their stories inspired their media houses to do more data and environmental journalism. Dorcas Wangira, of Citizen TV in Kenya, said “Not many people, even in the newsroom knew what pangolins were and didn’t see the value in telling this story. If I had not pitched this story to InfoNile, I wouldn’t have published it. Mentorship was extremely valuable. And having a focus group pursuing similar stories kept me going. This multimedia article is a first on our website - the data visualization helped add an aesthetic evidence-based quality. FAO added the story to their datalab, which shows the story has a global appeal. The engagement and dialogue we had from our audiences was very rich. I am now pursuing more stories on One Health, with more scientists reaching out after watching and reading my story.”","To produce the final investigation, we requested data from the Environmental Investigation Agency, which tracks wildlife crime from sources including Google searches, law enforcement agencies, court verdicts, intergovernmental agency reports, and other wildlife crime organizations. We received spreadsheets of all illegal wildlife seizures from 2010-2020 from 7 countries: Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Ethiopia. We then analyzed the data quantitatively by country and year by the number of incidents, number of species, total reported weight of illegal wildlife products, number of arrests, and number of each transport method, and qualitatively by the nature of specific cases that occurred after the onset of Covid-19. 
 
We also sourced local poaching data from governments in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, shapefiles on protected areas in East Africa, and statistics on the tourism industry in the three countries, which largely funds wildlife conservation and was heavily affected by Covid-19. 
 
From this data, with support from Code for Africa, we produced 12 interactive data visualizations and two interactive maps using the online tool Flourish. Data visualizations included column charts and stacked column charts, area charts and stacked area charts, line and bar charts, grids of charts, a moving symbol map and a chloropleth map.
Our field reporting by 13 journalists in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and South Sudan also used multimedia technologies. In the 10 local stories and the final project, we used podcasts, videos, animated data visualizations, drone video and images, mobile journalism, and illustrations. 

The structure and design of the final online project was uniquely developed for this story using Elementor Pro, a Wordpress website builder. 

We also produced a mobile magazine summary of the project using Canva and Photoshop, designed and shared uniquely on Whatsapp.","The project was conducted during the first year of Covid-19, with the training and most of the reporting conducted during strict lockdowns, where movement was prohibited. The journalists had to find new ways to seek out their information when sometimes they could not even travel to the field. One of the journalists who reported a story on the Maasai communities in Kenya, which operate wildlife conservancies, sent questionnaires and conducted interviews via Whatsapp, working with a local source who also helped translate responses. She also relied on sharing information with environmental journalists at other media houses, which shows the value of collaboration to provide quality information in difficult times.
 
It was also difficult to source credible data, analyze large quantities of data, and draw conclusions from sometimes contradicting data. Data collection was also limited by lockdown restrictions. For example, data from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), which mainly highlights large-scale international seizures, showed a 51 percent decrease in 2020 from 2019. However, government data, such as from Uganda, showed an increase in poaching during the lockdowns. Critically, we determined that although large-scale internationally trafficked seizures may have initially declined due to border closures and movement restrictions, the conditions that foster local poaching actually worsened during Covid-19. Analysis of the EIA data by the end of 2020 backed up this conclusion, showing that crime rates spiked again as countries reopened their economies.

Conducting cross-border reporting through collaborations with journalists from different media houses was also a challenge, as many journalists prefer to work alone. Additionally, it was sometimes difficult to interview communities that benefit from poaching, as they feared providing information would put them in danger. We mitigated this challenge by working with local journalists who speak local languages and have a greater trust with their communities of coverage.","Journalists can learn how to conduct data-driven reporting: sourcing for data and conducting analysis to determine trends over various periods of time, by learning from our comparison of 7 countries and analysis of wildlife trafficking trends across 11 years. Journalists can also learn how to integrate conclusions from data analysis alongside rigorous field reporting and information from scientists and experts. Thirdly, journalists can learn how to conduct cross-border and collaborative reporting to produce a bigger story with insights from reporters in multiple countries. An important part of collaborations is establishing partnerships between different media houses to cross-publish stories to reach a bigger audience. Also, translating and publishing stories in local languages is important to reach people who are affected by the issues presented.
 
Journalists can also learn how to merge solutions-based reporting with investigative and data-driven journalism. Although the project investigated concerning trends in how Covid-19 has affected wildlife conservation in East Africa, several of the stories in the project were solutions based, highlighting local models that have proven beneficial to conserving wildlife. Before Covid-19, the East African region was celebrating declines in wildlife trafficking. The solutions we highlighted included a story on the Ajai wildlife reserve in northern Uganda, which has seen increases in wildlife populations after the local communities signed MoUs to conserve wildlife while benefiting from beekeeping and agroforestry activities within the reserve. Another story looked at how the Giraffe Center in Nairobi has helped save an endangered species. Merging such solutions stories with critical analysis on the concerning impacts of the pandemic provides in-depth information on working models, as well as what is now needed in order to protect gains in wildlife conservation during this unique crisis.","English, Swahili",https://www.infonile.org/en/wildlife-conservation/,https://citizen.digital/lifestyle/pangolins-in-the-dock-is-the-mammal-really-guilty-as-charged-7368145/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfVodvwd9oY,https://www.infonile.org/en/2021/01/saving-the-rothschild-giraffe-in-kenya/,https://www.dw.com/sw/hofu-ya-kupotea-kwa-sokwe-mtu-tanzania/av-54974482?maca=sw-Whatsapp-sharing,https://www.talkafrica.co.ke/kenyan-conservancies-unable-to-pay-leased-land-amid-covid-19-linked-drop-in-tourism-revenue/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMc3HPkypUwBSE3wxtig22QXsvk1abBe/view?usp=sharing,,"Principal Investigators and Editors: Annika McGinnis and Fredrick Mugira

Dubbed the Arab Spring, the region saw the largest anti-​government protests across Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Libya, Yemen and Syria. 

Using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, citizen journalists were challenging the official government narrative spewed out by the state.

This massive shift to digital media brought with it another thing - an unedited digital trail for history to remember - word by word, tweet by tweet, video by video.

The Arab Spring Retweeted relives these events, not through anecdotes, but exactly as they unfolded, one tweet at a time - all 9,825 of them.","The Arab Spring Retweeted is the most comprehensive digital collection that documents Al Jazeera’s Twitter feeds to understand how the Arab Spring all began.

South Africa,"Viewfinder, GroundUp",Small,Participant,,Above The Law,11/05/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Documentary, Database, Open data, Infographics, Video, Corruption, Crime, Human rights","Animation, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL","In 2021, Viewfinder launched a Police Accountability Tracker. This dashboard made public the South African government’s database of tens of thousands of brutality complaints against the police. It also demonstrated the extent to which officers accused in violent crimes escape accountability. The tracker formed part of an ongoing, data-driven investigation titled “Above The Law” which - through a series of deeply reported exposés - uncovered the underpinnings of police brutality and non-accountability in South Africa. For instance, the investigation demonstrated how police management systemically exploited regulatory loopholes to protect colleagues accused of heinous crimes from consequence.","Published with some of SA’s biggest news titles, such as News24 and Carte Blanche, Viewfinder’s data analysis and investigative findings have precipitated steps within government to address the cover-up, whitewashing and manipulation inherent to police oversight and disciplinary processes. Parliamentarians cited Viewfinder’s findings in two meetings with the SAPS and IPID’s national management, leading police commissioner Khehla Sitole to admit that amendments to police discipline regulations were needed. The Civilian Secretariat for Police recently confirmed that it had started a review of discipline regulations with the intention of submitting recommendations to the Police Minister on how these need to be amended to address loopholes and vulnerabilities that Viewfinder’s launch exposé revealed. In October, the CSP confirmed that it had “completed” its analysis of police discipline regulations and had made a submission to the Police Minister, who must now take the matter further with the Safety and Security Sectoral Bargaining Council. In October, SAPS head office issued a circular warning police commanders throughout South Africa against using loopholes in the disciplinary system to cover for their violence accused colleagues. It is fair to surmise that Viewfinder’s findings and investigation was the direct inspiration behind this circular. In October, Viewfinder presented its findings at IPID’s national strategic planning meeting. During responses to this presentation, IPID’s director has committed to do more to ensure that the watchdog’s findings and disciplinary recommendations against police officers implicated in violent crimes take effect. She proposed to do this by advocating for more active participation by IPID in police disciplinary proceedings, which she acknowledges are bereft by “cronyism”. The discursive impact of the work is also evidenced by a few dozen TV and radio interviews on influential current affairs programs and extensive engagement with policy sector experts.","The data was cleaned and collated using Python and Jupyter notebooks. 
The Police Accountability Tracker dashboard was built using PHP, MySQL, JavaScript.
Data visualisations and animations were produced on Adobe Creative Suite.","The development of the Police Accountability Tracker, the project’s data-driven findings and the “Above the Law” journalism series has been a work in progress since late 2018, around which time Viewfinder first engaged whistleblowers and submitted records requests for the complaints data of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID). Since that time, Viewfinder has submitted many records requests, cultivated sources within the criminal justice system, investigated case studies and acquired dozens of further registers pertaining to complaints against the police and the progression of these cases through the police watchdog’s investigative pipeline. From the onset it was evident that these data represented a deep dysfunction within South Africa’s police oversight mechanisms, as evidenced by the high rates of killings and alleged violent crimes by police officers, contrasted with the low rates of criminal and disciplinary sanction in these cases.
In realising this project we experienced two big challenges. First, to ready the data for publication required the cleaning and collation of these dozens of registers into a single, coherent master database. This took an immense amount of time, finetuning, and problem-solving. Second, to render systems fuller understanding of the systems failure in police oversight, and to produce a coherent, popular narrative to communicate this to a broader audience the underpinnings and factors enabling the police brutality and impunity suggested by the data. Finally, investigating individual police officers - evidenced by the data as either repeat violent offenders or supervisors with a penchant for covering for their subordinates - carried with it tangible risks in a country where the lines between police and violent criminal enterprises are often blurred.","This project was foremost an exercise in investigative, impact-orientated, accountability journalism, though one inspired by- and contingent upon data.
The IPID complaints and case outcomes data provided Viewfinder with a tantalising indication of just how big a problem police brutality and police non-accountability had become in post-apartheid South Africa - one which we were able to quantify as stark whole numbers, ratios, proportions and trends. Yet, the facts and trends of police brutality and non-accountability held in the data was for us the premise of our investigation, not findings in and of themselves. Whenever we identified a trend or an anomaly arose from the data, conventional investigative methods took over and helped us learn and uncover the all-too human dysfunctions in the system which gave rise to these.
Also, our journalism recognised the immense human tragedy represented in the numbers. All the articles comprising this submission, foregrounded the pain, loss, injury and injustice experienced by poor, black and marginalised peoples in South Africa. The data demonstrated that these stories stood in as surrogates for tens of thousands of anonymous victims, and pressed home the public interest urgency of our project’s findings. In turn, we credit that urgency with the considerable impact that this project has had on the discursive and policy environment surrounding police brutality in South Africa.
As such, I believe that this project is an apt example of how data can integrate as a critical source into a much broader investigation and story-telling endeavour exposing systemic wrongdoing.",English,https://policeaccountabilitytracker.co.za,https://viewfinder.org.za/massive-database-of-killings-by-police-made-public/,https://viewfinder.org.za/how-saps-protects-the-killers-within-its-ranks/,https://viewfinder.org.za/did-saps-enable-a-brutal-murder-by-leaving-this-problem-cop-unpunished/,https://viewfinder.org.za/tapes-reveal-secret-workings-of-police-disciplinary-hearings-for-murder-and-brutality-cases/,https://youtu.be/HNGxMCizEiw,,,"Daneel Knoetze, Rachel Strate, Carolyn Dent","Daneel Knoetze is the editor and lead investigator at Viewfinder.

Desperate Indians turned to Twitter as the main platform for help as many were unable to rely on the healthcare system. This project took an in-depth look at the scale of suffering via social media data, revealing alarming trends in a host of Indian cities.",The story was shared widely on social media and garnered a large volume of traffic as we looked at the unfolding crisis.

Charts were created in javascript and fine tuned in Adobe Illustrator and then ported back out via AI2HTML to be embedded into the web page. 

We also built a custom scraper to track and collate oxygen data, revealing many hospitals were close to completely running out.","Because the nature of human language has nuances, it was initially hard to filter out words across the thousands of related tweets.

Social media played a pivotal role in the July riots, with people documenting roadblocks, raging warehouse fires and the devastation caused to businesses by looters. The Outlier team, with funding from the Henry Nxumalo Foundation, collected tens of thousands of social media posts from Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, YouTube and Facebook posted by ordinary people and media outlets to build a picture of what happened.","Most of the coverage on the July unrest before the publication of our project had focussed on identifying the instigators of the violence. However, we took a slightly different approach in which we used technology and open source investigative tools to plot how the events unfolded in a project that can be used by active citizens, policymakers and journalists for future research and potentially aid the South African Human Rights Commission which is currently investigating the unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.","To gather the initial data for this project, we used search terms to scour Google for posts from TikTok, Instagram and Facebook for the videos and photos of the July unrest, limiting our search from 8 to 16 July. We then used AFP Media Lab's tool InVid to scrape Twitter with a focus on the popular hashtags from the week of unrest: #FreeJacobZuma, #KZNShutdown, #ShutdownKZN, #GautengShutdown, #PhoenixMassacre, #RamaphosaMustFall. For the final visualisation of the project, we chose four of the hashtags.

Once we had cleaned our data, we began locating where the tweets took place. We reversed searched images to find locations. Then we used Google Maps, Google Earth and local knowledge to pinpoint the exact latitude and longitude, which we collected into a Google spreadsheet. We used Google Maps to explore the data before designing the map using d3.js and Svelte. 

In the completion of the project, we used tools such as Figma and Notion to brainstorm and map the posts and events that occurred concurrently with the looting and death of protestors.","One of the hardest aspects of the project was how to concisely portray what happened during the week of unrest in South Africa with nuance. By the time it came to putting the project together, we had so much information that we had to decide what our audience needed to know. Another challenging aspect was because of the wealth of data we had collected we had various visualisation options so we spent a considerable amount of time unpacking which way our visualisations would have the most impact.","I think journalists can firstly use this project for their future investigations on the July unrest. I also believe that our project can help connect Twitter accounts to potential instigators of the unrest based on our groundwork research and analysis. 

This project can also be used as a reminder of what happened in that week and how things unraveled online which can be used for future researchers, educators and policy makers.

This visceral piece looks at the language and legality of these threats across a variety of forms: audio, charts and maps as well as an interactive quiz component to enforce the nuances in determining what is prosecutable and what is considered protected speech. Evocative and disturbing, this story is an unparalleled look at a targeted campaign of fear against election workers.","Readers were shocked to see the grim realities faced by election workers since the election of 2020. A Washington Post column shared the piece as “ a horrifying examination” of what election workers dealt with. Rachel Maddow’s blog highlighted that we only found four people formally charged for their threats, despite identifying over 100 examples of direct threats to a person’s life or safety.","The page was built in HTML and styled with CSS. Javascript was used to make the charts, control the fade of text and enable the quiz functionality. The native javascript audio api was used and styled for the visualization and functionality of the audio.

While many would be familiar with the existence of these threats, the explicit content may be more than they were prepared for. We decided to lead in with audio, which allowed readers to choose to experience the full brunt of the content or pause at will, thus preparing readers for what was to come.

India,Reuters Graphics,Big,Participant,,"Young, Indian, Unvaccinated",11/06/21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Health","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV",Reuters analyzed how the ‘world’s largest vaccination campaign’ failed young Indians – leaving some 600 million people aged between 18 and 45 years scrambling to find COVID-19 shots – and delivered an in-depth data-rich but visually accessible piece that shed light on an important but under-examined facet of the ongoing pandemic.,"Reuters analysis was some of the most extensive available at the time into the inner failings of the vaccination rollout to young adults in India, cataloguing a host of failures to plan and quickly react that left the poorest in the country again most disadvantaged.","The project involved extensive data collection from multiple sources, analysis, data visualisation, web design and development. The vaccination datasets were scraped using Node.js scripts and automatically collected daily using GitHub Actions. Data analysis was mostly done using a mix of MS Excel and Observable notebooks, which allowed for quick visualisations and insight. The various visualisations were first drafted on paper and then laid out with the rest of the page design in Adobe Illustrator. The interactive, scroll-controlled charts were coded in D3.js, while the static ones were made using tools like RawGraphs and styled in Illustrator.","The most difficult part of the project was collecting data from the official CoWIN portal. There were three datasets –  the first two were doses administered weekly on national and district levels, by age groups and dose numbers. The national level data, along with the demographic data from the United Nations Population Division powers the streamgraph-bar chart combo. The district level data was used in another analysis of the inequity in vaccination rates among urban and rural districts. This information drove our attention to the “privilege gap” caused by vaccine shortages and prices.
 
The third dataset – availability of vaccination slots by age groups – was the crux of the project and the hardest to collect. The booking portal included a public API with details of district vaccination centres and booking availability by age group. The data was real-time; there was no record of the previous day or coming days, as slots would be made available for a small window during the day. This data had to be scraped at the end of each day.
 
More than 78,000 vaccination centres were found between May 15 and June 4, 2021, from 753 districts in 36 states and union territories in India. The scraper took hours to finish each day and had to be constantly monitored.
 
This dataset was reshaped in different ways in an Observable notebook, and the analysis of the vaccination booking slots and pricing of vaccines at private centres emerged. This work helped us tell an important story about the faltering vaccinations and a weak start to vaccinating the youth at a time when the second COVID-19 wave was raging though the nation.","Though Reuters started collecting the data in mid-May, it took weeks to understand nuances and required reaching out to a community of others working with India’s COVID-19 data to pool our experiences and insights.

Within the project, we chose some atypical dataviz techniques that we found to be better alternatives for the narrative we needed to tell. The chart comparing daily vaccinations among countries is a heatmap, where it would traditionally be a line chart. However, that format makes it easier to get an easy overview of how countries speed up or plateaued their vaccination rates. The streamgraph was chosen to walk the reader through the vaccination drive, how the pace varied in that time and leaves the reader with the column chart in the end that shows the outcome of the journey so far.",English,https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/INDIA-VACCINE/azgpoozqdpd/index.html,,,,,,,,"Prasanta Kumar Dutta, Manas Mishra","The Reuters graphics team publishes visual stories and data.

Romania,Panorama.ro,Small,Participant,,INTERACTIVE | The Political History of Romania,20/02/21,"Explainer, Database, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Economy","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, flourish.studio, Adobe After Effects","The project is an interactive visual representation of the past 30 years of post-communist political governance in Romania. A total of 16 governments and 9 legislatures are represented along with specific indicators. 
The indicators for each government are: term duration, public debt at the beginning and at the end of the term, the average monthly inflation rate, the average unemployment rate, and the main words from the governmental program.
Each legislature is represented according to the distribution of parliament members in chambers (Chamber of Deputies and Senate), and according to their political position (left, right, center) and sex (male, female).","The project is the first interactive visual representation made by a Romanian media publication that combines multiple data sets to define the specificity of government periods and legislatures. The project is a tool on its own both for readers and journalists because it allows correlations in various fields. 
For instance, it allows the visualization of the under-representation of women in the Romania Parliament during 30 years of democracy, it allows a better understanding of the evolution of political ideologies, as well as the evolution and comparison of macroeconomic indicators, and the areas on which each government focused on.
The project isn’t based on a certain conclusion, but instead, it allows the readers to draw their own conclusion, to make their own analysis and their own correlations, and to build the overall picture of 30 years of Romanian politics with the help of data.","The historical data for the each legislature was downloaded from the Romanian Parliament’s official website. The clusters were then built using third party data like the political position of every political party according to their programs. 
The government programs were downloaded from Romania’s Official Monitor. The sources of macroeconomic data are the National Institute of Statistics,  the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank.
Technologies used: Python, Scraping, Analysis in Python and Microsoft Excel, data visualization in Flourish.studio, interactive representation using Lottie and Adobe After Effects, graphic design in Affinity Designer","The project’s aim was to be a widely used tool, regardless of the reader’s previous experience with interactive stories, data journalism, and professional language. The project aimed to empower the reader to build his own reasoning and understanding based on clear, unaltered historical data, not on popular assumptions. 

Thus, the most difficult part of the project was selecting the relevant data to make this happen. How much is enough and what type of indicators should be used to provide as much insight as possible, but without losing the essence. So the constant question was: is this relevant to our readers? Why is this indicator important and not any other indicator? 
Only after analyzing the data and a whole lot of other indicators were we able to see if there is something relevant there that needed to be presented. 

For instance, the word clouds of government programs seem to be somehow similar. This is due to the fact that a large part of government programs looked pretty much the same no matter the government's political position. This is valuable insight when talking about governmental strategy because it shows us that regardless of ideology, there are no clear, significant differences between what governments have planed to do. 

This is the kind of insight the project brings in order to deconstruct popular assumptions like „all politicians are the same”, and build new ones based on data analysis. In this particular case, this piece of information shows that even though in Romania people vote based on ideological preferences (this is another piece of information presented in the project - the ideological distribution of the members of the Parliament), the government programs aren’t ideologically oriented.","There is tremendous potential in correlating social and political indicators to build a professional public tool that analyzes political evolution and efficiency, and thus, to hold politicians accountable.",Romanian,https://panorama.ro/istoria-politica-a-romaniei/,,,,,,,,Edit Gyenge,Edit Gyenge - information designer and entrepreneur.

This story uses elegant design and heartbreaking detail to humanize a tragedy of unimaginable scale. Each death was represented as one dot, forcing the reader to scroll through a timeline of loss. Throughout the story, readers learned details about individuals who had died and the lives they led.","The story resonated with readers, who shared it widely. Many praised the piece for its powerful representation of death. Nathan Yau featured it on his popular blog, Flowing Data, where he praised it for reflecting the true meaning behind such a tragedy.","Overall, the page was built in HTML and styled with CSS. The chart was made in Javascript. 

In order to render all 500,000 dots without crashing the browser, it used canvas lazy-loaded in chunks. It also used javascript’s native Intersection Observer for updating the date on scroll. The library D3 was used to create the miniature version of the chart in the upper right.","The story set out to show the true scale of COVID deaths in the United States, but doing that posed emotional, design and technical issues. In earlier drafts, a dot or square equaled a thousand deaths. This approach made for a simple chart, but it didn’t resonate with the team who worried it lacked humanity. 

The final approach, to include a dot for each person, required clever technical thinking in order to ensure the page loaded quickly and readers with any kind of connection could experience it. It forced the author to confront each death and identify opportunities to tell individual stories.  

This approach put the people behind each death in the spotlight without sacrificing a complete view.","When covering a massive tragedy, you don’t have to choose between showing the totality of its impact or highlighting the individuals.

We have created an original database with over 700 events, 3d models, and new analysis using machine learning techniques on social media posts to reveal the impacts of such practice.
MediaLab.UFRJ and Agência Autônoma have developed the project in partnership with grassroots organizations and local NGOs. The story was published by Documental.xyz, a platform for media and data-driven narratives and stories on human, territorial and environmental rights.","The research was used by legal claims in the local justice system. These lawsuits seek to implement harm reduction measures for law enforcement raids. The project was presented internationally at events such as RightsCon. Also, our story has been shortlisted by Prêmio Gabo and won a local journalistic award.","We applied several techniques such as open-source intelligence (OSINT), fieldwork, investigative journalism methods, 3d modeling, or natural language processing (NLP) to reveal territorial patterns and psychological impacts. There is a description below of essential techniques and tools:

1) OSINT: we used visual investigation methodologies, geolocation, and advanced web search strategies to contextualize evidence captured by local citizens. Video and photos collected in social media were fundamental to understanding our research topic better.

2) 3d modeling: Inspired by forensic architecture techniques and based on the visual materials gathered, we created 3d models to spatialize those videos and photos.

3) NLP: after collecting thousands of Twitter posts with specific keywords, we applied topic modeling algorithms to identify testimonials about shootings from police helicopters. This technique allowed us to clean our dataset and revealed hidden patterns such as sleeping disorders and psychological impacts caused by those raids.

4) Fieldwork: thanks to a partnership with a local NGO (Redes da Maré), we developed fieldwork strategies to geolocate critical evidence and acquire new materials about human rights violations at a local level.

5) Data analysis: we used traditional techniques and tools for tabular data, like spreadsheets or Python/R codes, to explore and describe the information we gathered, including unpublished governmental data about aircraft employment as shooting platforms.","Like other brazilian cities, the city of Rio de Janeiro has been going through a strong conservative wave, led mainly by government agencies. These institutions have been working to withdraw basic rights from the population, especially the poorest. Therefore, the most hardest part of this project was not to put at risk the residents of these territories, who helped in a significant way to carry out the research. When a slum dweller accuses the security forces of some violation of human rights, he or she can be threatened and suffer serious retaliation.","We obtained and structured critical governmental datasets to understand police operations in Rio de Janeiro. Now, it is organized in our Github repository [1] among dozens of scripts, other tables, geodata, and resources for data journalists. Exploring our materials can bring insights for data-driven journalists interested in human rights worldwide. For instance, we have created open Python notebooks for fact-checking our data-driven conclusions. 
The platform we used (documental.xyz) is innovative and allows data visualization to be easily understood by anyone despite any previous knowledge about the territory studied. Therefore, our methodology to contextualize visual evidence can set an important precedent for other local organizations. Our methodology also can inspire innovative uses of geodata, photos, videos, and 3d modeling to contextualize human rights violations.

This was fulfilled a year and a half into his presidency in 2018, with a $17-billion annual price tag on pensions in the next 20 years. In this story, Rappler unpacked the complex issues faced by the proponents of the military and uniformed personnel pension reform, and how much the government will save if these reforms are implemented.","Rappler has been covering congressional hearings on the proposed military pension reform, an important topic yet hardly given in-depth coverage by other news organizations. This story in April 2021 served as an explainer, armed with the analysis showing the urgent need for reforms. After the story was published, we continued reporting on new developments.

In July 2021, Duterte asked Congress to pass a law reforming the pension scheme.","Rappler went through budget documents and live streams of Senate committee hearings to get the necessary data. These were compiled on Google Sheets. To make the data more accessible, these were visualized on Datawrapper.

The succeeding challenge was how to make the data from the actuarial study easier to understand. Since there are a number of variables and combinations of those, we arrived at the realization that a dashboard might be the most effective way to present the data.

Sweden,Sveriges Radio,Big,Participant,,Long distances to job centres hit vulnerable groups hardest,27/12/21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Podcast/radio, Audio, Politics, Economy","QGIS, CSV, R, R Studio","Nearly a quarter of a million Swedes now have their nearest job centre over 40 kilometres away, our analysis found. This is seven times more than just three years ago, following extensive job centre closures. We also found that these long distances have hit those furthest from the job market hardest, such as immigrants with a language barrier or people with disabilities, groups that often struggle with the digital solutions meant to replace physical job centres.","The data analysis led to around 30 local and national stories, published over separate days. These were picked up by Swedish news agency TT, and were followed up by opinion pieces and stories in several other outlets, and politicians from several different parties reacted with criticism of how the closures had been handled.

An important impact for us was being able to bring the story to life by collaborating with Sveriges Radios local newsrooms. We shared our analysis with Sveriges Radio’s 25 local stations across Sweden, and reporters used this to produce local stories with voices from those most affected by the data. Having the opportunity to combine data analysis and local journalism in this way makes our data journalism more human, tangible, and impactful.","The distance analysis was done using a 1x1km population grid of Sweden from Statistics Sweden, calculating the distance from the centroid of each grid to the nearest job centre, before and after the closures. For national stories, the total population of those grids with a distance greater than 40 kilometres was summed. For local stories, we also worked out the population-weighted average distance to the nearest job centre, for each municipality in Sweden. 

Most of the data analysis was done in R, including geocoding existing and former job centres. Some additional analysis was done in QGIS, including distance matrix and drivetime. 

In addition to the more technical data analysis, we wanted to get a clear sense of what impact the increased distances had had, so a survey was sent out to employment departments of all municipalities that had lost at least one job centre, to gauge their opinions on the closures, and from this were able to uncover a huge discontent with the changes and the effect they had on many groups furthest from the job market. 

Finally, a locally relevant report for each of Sveriges Radios local stations was generated using R Markdown.","The main challenge was producing data analysis relevant not only for our national newsroom but also 25 local newsrooms around the country, and not least finding a good way to distribute the material to local reporters. 

We’re a new team and this was one of the first projects we’d ever done in such close collaboration with local newsrooms. We knew we wanted to steer clear of sharing intimidating Excel spreadsheets with them, and settled on producing 25 locally relevant reports programmatically in R Markdown. The benefit of these is that they contained not only locally relevant data in more easy-to-use tables and charts, but also all the additional text needed to understand the figures. 

Working together with Sveriges Radio's local newsrooms in order to leverage the power of data analysis combined with local journalism and human stories is a very important goal for our team, which means we have to juggle finding good methods for collaboration with producing high-quality journalism. 

Something which was important from the outset was to ensure the data analysis didn’t just result in dry numbers stories. By surveying local employment departments, as mentioned above, we learned what the biggest consequences of the closures were, and working with local reporters meant we could focus the news stories around the job seekers most affected by the change, creating impactful and human-focused data journalism.","One concrete thing journalists could be taught using this project as inspiration would be how to go about performing a distance analysis, and the many pitfalls, trials and tribulations we learned along the way, from geocoding addresses to accurately working out population-weighted average distances.

Also, the workflow developed could be used as a blueprint or inspiration for how a data team can work together with local newsrooms, in terms of finding the best way to distribute the data, by sharing locally relevant reports, but also by collaborating early on, and finding the best ways to communicate actively throughout the process, such as scheduling Q&A meetings early on and having an active Teams chat.",Swedish,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/langtidsarbetslosa-drabbas-nar-det-blir-langt-till-arbetsformedlingen,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/arbetslosa-eva-har-haft-8-handlaggare-pa-tva-ar-de-har-ingen-koll,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/fick-inte-svar-fran-arbetsformedlingen-pa-fyra-manader-forlorade-praktikplats,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/kent-man-tappar-gnistan-nar-de-inte-kan-arbetsmarknaden-har,,,,,Clara Guibourg,Clara Guibourg is a data journalist at Sveriges Radio’s new data team.

Working together with Sveriges Radio's local newsrooms in order to leverage the power of data analysis combined with local journalism and human stories is a very important goal for our data team, and therefore one of the most important impacts for us was that the collaboration with reporters from Sveriges Radios local stations worked so well. The local reporters were able to find case studies around Sweden that brought the data to life and showed the people behind the figures.","We joined open data on corona furlough support to a number of other data sources, in order to get unique figures, for instance data on dividends, revenue and bankruptcy. 

Our team used a combination of Python and R to scrape, download and clean all required data.

Preparing scripts in advance and thoroughly exploring additional data sources and potential angles in advance with local reporters meant we were able to share our first data analysis with all the reporters on the same morning data was released. 

The other challenge for us was how best to share a large quantity of data with reporters who weren’t used to working with data.

The benefit of these reports is that they contained not only locally relevant data in more easy-to-use tables and charts, but also all the additional text needed to understand the figures.","The most important thing that we ourselves feel we learned from this project was finding a good method for data journalists’ collaboration with local newsrooms, and finding the best way for us to distribute data to reporters not necessarily familiar with Excel or numbers. We think our learnings could serve as inspiration to other newsrooms in the same position, from using R Markdown to produce locally relevant reports on the data, to collaborating early on with many channels of communication, including several Q&A sessions and an active group chat with all reporters involved.

Another learning for us has been the value of preparing scripts in advance, in order to be able to cover a breaking news data story.

In addition to the data feeding our own page, Reuters partnered with Amazon developers to make the data available to Alexa users. In several markets including the United States and the United Kingdom, Alexa users could ask questions and be given answers about whether they were eligible to be vaccinated or when their local health jurisdiction planned for a particular group to be given access.","Vaccine eligibility data was entered into a spreadsheet by each priority group specified by each health jurisdiction rollout plan. At a set time each day, a node process was run in GitHub Actions to scrape the data, and then a series of checks was done to both make sure errors weren’t introduced and to also flag when data hadn’t been updated within 7 days for any priority group. That feedback was sent to a Microsoft Teams channel for clear visibility to a data collection team. Once all checks had passed, the data was published to an API that drove graphics and tables on the tracker page and which Amazon developers would in turn fetch into their own ETL pipelines for the Amazon Alexa skill.

The overall vaccination statistics were visualized via a draggable canvas-based globe, which made it easy to see the yawning gaps regionally between haves and have-nots and made for an intuitive interface to scan progress around the world.","Designing a database to catalogue the disparate vaccine rollout policies of 80 countries and 50 U.S. states was incredibly difficult. Reuters needed a schema that could correctly encode the progress of each campaign in a way that was comparable across countries, generalise categories of how groups were being prioritised, capture the vaccines each group was eligible to receive and track down the dates access was promised or finally granted. Maintaining that schema as those policies quickly changed was especially difficult, and in many cases we needed to reconcile the previous plans to the current ones through our own reporting.","We felt like the summary statistics of how many shots had gone into arms, while important to make larger comparisons of broad policy decisions and outcomes, was actually second to a more fundamental information need our readers had in the first months of the rollout: Answering when they can get a shot. That information was harder to get and standardise and ultimately didn’t lend itself to complex graphics, but we felt it was where we were best placed to fulfil an immediate public service need.

The pieces were based on original polling commissioned by Reuters. We worked closely with the polling firm Ipsos to develop questions and build a sample size large enough to meaningfully break down the party divides.","This novel approach revealed that there is far more nuance within the American political parties than is typically reported.

Our polling director worked closely with Ipsos to craft a poll that would yield almost anthropological results. 

Visualizing this extensively detailed cross-tab data was the next significant hurdle. We wanted to make differences easy to spot despite the complexity of the underlying data which did not naturally lend itself to simplified views. Using dot plots and animation, we achieved that clarity.

United States,MIT Technology Review,Small,Participant,,What the Data Tells Us About the Justice Department’s Efforts to Catch Chinese Economic Spies,03/12/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Chart, Politics, Immigration, Crime","Scraping, Google Sheets, Python, Airtable","MIT Technology Review conducted a months-long data investigation into the Justice Department’s China Initiative, a controversial effort to counter Chinese economic espionage, creating the first searchable database of cases. The initiative had been criticized for racial profiling, its chilling effects on science, and general ineffectiveness in catching economic spies. However, prior to our investigation, it had not been subjected to a data-driven analysis—partly because DOJ does not make the data easily available. We found that many cases have little connection to trade secret theft; an increasing number target academics; and nearly 90% of defendants charged are of Chinese heritage.","In the month since publication, our story has become the definitive source for data on China Initiative cases, filling a gap left by the Justice Department. Our investigation, or responses to it, has been cited in nearly every subsequent story on the initiative. On Jan. 10, for example, the Boston Globe editorial board called for the DOJ to end its targeting of scientists, citing extensively from our data and findings. 

Even before we published, our investigation prompted the Justice Department to update its public webpage of cases–the only repository for information related to the initiative– for the first time in five months.Two days after we approached the DOJ with questions, the department removed 17 cases and 39 defendants from its China Initiative page, added two cases, and updated others with sentencing and trial information, where available. 

According to lawmaker Judy Chu, a Democrat from California, our findings have answered questions that she has posed to law enforcement and intelligence officials—without luck. “Whenever we ask for data,” she told us when we briefed her on our initial findings, neither the FBI nor Justice Department officials “give it back to us. What you have are numbers, and it is startling to see what [they] are,” she said. 

Our database has also changed the minds of some of the officials involved in the China Initiative’s design. Andrew Lelling, the former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts that served on the steering committee which shaped the Initiative, shared our story in a LinkedIn post and called for the DOJ to “revamp, and shut down, parts of the program, to avoid needlessly chilling scientific and business collaborations with Chinese partners.” 

“MIT Technology Review did a great job breaking down the Initiative's record, three years in,"" he wrote.","We scraped the DOJ webpage on the China Initiative announcing arrests and indictments. We then added details based on a review of thousands of pages of federal court documents, DOJ public statements and Congressional testimony, and interviews with defense attorneys, family members, and others linked to the defendants, to build the first searchable database of China Initiative cases. Using AirTable, we initially built two linked datasets: one organized by case, and one organized by defendant, which allowed us to easily analyze how the Justice Department was carrying out these prosecutions while also examining the people impacted by the initiative. We then combined our two datasets to create a public, searchable database. We also used Google Sheets for data analysis. We cross-checked our dataset with other case data that has been collected privately by civil rights groups. We used Datawrapper to visualize some of our main findings. 

To track the change that the Justice Department made on its website, we used the Python library ""wayback"" to download all historical copies of the Department of Justice China Initiative press release index page from the Internet Archive. With snapshots of the page from February through June 2021 in hand, we compared these and logged changes to the press release index page over time. We used the Wayback Machine’s new changes tool to visualize the number of changes that the Justice Department made in response to our reporting.","The biggest challenge was deciding what to do with the limited—and changing—data available. Our main data source was the Department of Justice’s China Initiative webpage, which we knew to be an incomplete record. The Justice Department deleted and added press releases without explanation—and sometimes, after a case previously touted as a success story for the program had fallen apart. 

criteria for what data to include, especially since the main data source—the Department of Justice’s China Initiative webpage—would delete data (press releases) without explanation. Because the cases were quite different, we also put a lot of thought into how to come up with the most accurate categories and labels. To explain how we decided what to include, and why, we wrote an accompanying essay on methodology, the changes that the Justice Department made after we published, as well as our own disclosures of where there could be perceived conflicts.","Our biggest lesson learned is that even limited datasets can be useful, as long as limitations are clearly explained. In fact, the fact that there are data gaps can become key parts of the story. In our case, the fact that the Justice Department made such big changes in response to our questions further illustrated our point about the program’s troubling lack of transparency. Another lesson is that data investigations don’t always require very sophisticated tools or techniques to do a data investigation. Additionally, whenever possible, make the dataset itself available—and searchable—for increased utility and impact, and invite collaboration when possible. For us, that collaboration took the form of sharing and comparing notes with outside groups also conducting their own research, as well as including a way for readers to get in touch, which has led to submissions of new data (additional court cases) that we may include in a future version of the database.",English,https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/02/1040656/china-initative-us-justice-department/,https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/12/02/1039397/china-initiative-database-doj/,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/10/opinion/justice-department-should-back-off-researchers/,,,,,,"Eileen Guo, Karen Hao, Jess Aloe, Tate Ryan-Mosley, Bobbie Johnson, Patrick Howell O'Neill, Allissa Wickham, and John Emerson","Eileen Guo is the senior reporter for features and investigations at MIT Technology Review.

United States,NBC News Digital,Big,Participant,,Never-ending nightmare': The hospitals where the ICU occupancy stayed high,29/09/21,"Infographics, Chart, Health","D3.js, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python","Analyzing Covid-19 hospitalization data from the Department of Health and Human Services, we found which hospitals filled their intensive care units to capacity each week throughout the pandemic. Using that analysis, we created a list of the most stressed hospitals in the country and identified 20 hospitals that had been at or above capacity for more than a year.
We then spoke to doctors and nurses from those hospitals to hear what they’re experiencing and contextualized it with data and visuals that let the reader see which states and which hospitals never caught a break.","We illustrated the stress that health care professionals, especially those in overburdened hospitals were going through. While waves would come and go during the pandemic, these hospitals had no real reprieve and have been at near-constant capacity since the pandemic hit.
The story was published at a time when vaccine hesitancy was at a high and public sector unions were actively protesting vaccine mandates. The story illustrated the relationship between low-vaccinated areas and overpacked ICUs.","Using Python notebooks, we pulled hospitalization data from Health and Human Services and took the weekly average of staffed ICU bed occupancy and divided it by the weekly average of staffed ICU beds. That formula gave us a hospital-level utilization rate for reporting hospitals.

HHS did not include hospitals with fewer than 4 patients hospitalized in a reporting period that were not included in the data. We then aggregated the utilizations to county, then state level, which informed our reporting, but also was used in our visualizations.

State-level results were broken up by reporting week, then visualized as graphics using D3.
County-level results were aggregated by month, grouped by FIPS code, joined to shapefiles, then visualized on multiple D3 maps to illustrate the maxed out regions by season. Readers were able to see that even when waves came and went, some parts of the U.S. had consistently maxed ICUs.","One of the hardest things about this project was understanding the data. We talked to multiple experts to establish what is normal and what is not normal. Intensive care utilization is a bit abstract to the normal person and hearing from doctors, nurses and associations about how far out of normal constant capacity helped illustrate the urgency.

We’re subjected to near constant headlines about hospital capacities during the pandemic, and it can be easy to get numb to it as waves come and go. But finding the most stressed hospitals, calling them to verify what’s going on the ground puts people to the data.","We talked to staffers who handle HHS data to verify any pitfalls we’d encounter with our analysis as well as verifying the accuracy of the data itself. Since the pandemic it’s easy to pull data sources and turn them into dashboards, but verifying from the source as well as relying on documentation assembled by a consortium of experts helped a great deal.

With every hospital called, we ran the data analysis by them, and asked if that sounded accurate. Many of them said “yes,” and quite a few said their current ICU numbers were a little higher than that. 

The major takeaway that other journalists can learn is to verify your findings at any available avenue.",English,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/never-ending-nightmare-hospitals-where-icu-hospitalizations-stayed-high-n1280318,,,,,,,,"Elliott Ramos, Nigel Chiwaya","Elliott Ramos is a data journalist for NBCNews.com, and was previously at WBEZ Chicago as the station’s data editor.

United States,NBC News Digital,Big,Participant,,Plan Your Vaccine,11/02/21,"Solutions journalism, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Google Sheets, Python, Figma and JavaScript","Plan Your Vaccine was a personalized, interactive digital app that gave Americans trusted information about planning their Covid-19 vaccination for every state and U.S. territory in one place. A team of editors, developers, researchers and designers gathered firsthand information, from requirements by state to locations where the vaccine was being administered, and an option to sign up to receive alerts as changes to eligibility and more changed. After collecting users’ locations, essential groups and ages, the app provided customized information.","The page was built in English, Spanish and Mandarin to reach as many readers as possible with real-time information about how to get the vaccine at a time when messages from the government were confusing. At launch, our tool was the only national-scale site of its kind. More than 7 million people got their vaccine information from Plan Your Vaccine, with a reach of 1.6 Billion from broadcast segments. Through social media platforms, we reached 481 million people. More than 120 anchors, correspondents and talent from the larger NBC Universal group shared the tool in more than 10 languages to millions of viewers. 

Not only was Plan Your Vaccine prominent across digital platforms, but it could be seen on Sunday Night Football, on the Today Show plaza, Telemundo studios, at the Golden Globes, Indy500 and more. Additionally, we worked with the Comcast NBCUniversal Campus Ambassador Program to partner with college students across 52 campuses to post about the tool on social media. Nearly 60,000 people engaged with these organic posts. Media organizations from Bloomberg and Yahoo to People and AdWeek recognized the site for its maximized reach and quick updates. We received inquiries from Google and the White House about how we were able to organize all of the recent locations for our map portion of the tool and potential partnerships. 

The biggest impact, however, was the impact on everyday people who were struggling to get information about the vaccine for themselves, their parents and grandparents. We received emails and messages from people across the country telling us that by using Plan Your Vaccine they were able to find out exactly when they would be eligible, how to get an appointment and more.","We used figma to sketch out the initial design and later implemented the design with JavaScript. At the early stage of vaccine distribution, each group's eligibility was very different and policies varied from state to state. This created many different combinations of eligibility status. In addition to that, we thought first what the reader would want to know most about getting the vaccine. At the time, we were the “reader,” too. We didn’t wait for press releases to come out; we went straight to government officials and websites to maintain daily updates.

We processed the data in a Google sheet, which allowed researchers, editors, translators and developers to collaborate on the same doc. We built a data update pipeline with a combination of Google Sheets and custom-written sheets macros that leveraged JavaScript to easily maintain the information, in three languages (each of which had to be copyedited) during the nearly yearlong data update. We also wrote some customized script to compile the sheet and execute on the production side dynamically.

The vaccine locations were managed with a combination of Google Sheets, custom python scripts to download, parse, and generate custom map tilesets for the vaccination location map. A set of scrapers were written in Python, and another set of scrapers were written in JavaScript. When the partnership with VaccineFinder (later to become Vaccines.gov) was made, additional functionality was written to merge portions of their dataset with ours.","At the start of this project in January 2021, there was virtually no concrete data on a national scale about how to get the vaccine. We wanted to build a place where you could jump from all the information in your state that met your eligibility to another state (let’s say, your moms) without opening new tabs and searching on another state’s website which might have had outdated data. The CDC changed their eligibility guidelines dozens if not hundreds of times; pharmacies and local health centers changed the status of vaccine availability, and ultimately frontline, essential workers and other groups were irrelevant when we moved to age-based eligibility. This meant extreme flexibility and fluidity not just from an editorial standpoint but in building a data structure design that would respond to the continuously updated vaccination distribution plans. Because the tool was available in three languages, that also required a major effort to continuously translate hundreds of rows at a time as information changed.","From the development side, the editorial content and data structure needed to be considered at the start of the project; and in doing so, we found success in the long run when we needed to adjust how we were presenting the content. This project was ambitious; we were the first news organization out of the gate with a site. That happened because we made the calls, did the data collection and had strong editors move quickly to get accurate information. Working hand-in-hand with developers to build a responsive app was necessary from day 1. These two teams should never work in silos, especially when it comes to complicated projects. The relationships built will carry over to the next big project.","English, Spanish, Chinese",https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/,https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/planifica-tu-vacuna-language-spanish/index.html?language=spanish,,,,,,,"Anna Brand - Senior Editor, News Projects

United States,NBC News Digital,Big,Participant,,The new faces of Covid deaths,02/11/21,"Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Health","D3.js, Python","NBC News analyzed what changed from the first 100,000 Covid deaths in the U.S. to the 100,000 deaths from July to the end of October 2021.

This analysis showed key geographic and demographic (racial and age-related) shifts in the evolution of the pandemic, and that analysis coupled with stories of the dead and data visualizations painted a picture for readers of how deaths have changed. What we found: The people who died in the latter 100,000 were younger, whiter and from southern states.","This project was read and shared as you would expect a flagship data story such as this would be. These flagship stories aren’t something that you see competing news orgs pick up and re-report immediately — it’s not that easy. Instead, a month after publication, another leading national publication reported out and published their own version of the story, a testament to the value of this way of looking at Covid deaths.","-We wrote python code to crunch numbers and analyze Covid death data from the Department of Health and Human Services. Since this story took six weeks to put together, care was taken to make the code adaptable and repeatable as the most-recent 100,000 deaths dataset changed on a weekly basis. Multiple datasets were used, which meant multiple scripts to analyze each dataset.
-We leveraged “scrollytelling” code to narrate a complex portion of one of the visuals.
-Custom d3 code powered the multiple graphics on the page.","Journalistically, it was a challenge to figure out how to present this analysis in a way that still captured the human cost.

Technically, navigating changes in the scrollytelling portion so it worked on all devices was a challenge that required us enlisting additional technical help to solve.","In the face of a pandemic that’s filled to the brim with numbers, with the right eyes and enough work you can find new stories in the same old data.

United Kingdom,none,Small,Participant,,Inside England's mental health units,14/07/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Chart, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, R Studio, Flourish","The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated pressures on mental health services, with referrals and contacts at their highest. Due to this enhanced pressure, there is a need for scrutinization of mental health services. To fulfil this, I have analysed data, created visualisations and written stories and newsletters around mental illness with the aim to raise awareness and destigmatise mental illness. I achieved this through responsible reporting based on thorough research, involving case studies and professionals, and incorporating data and constructive journalism. The stories were based on exclusive data from FOI requests and official data releases, interviews with vulnerable sources, industry professionals and charities.","Through responsible reporting, I was able to raise awareness for issues around mental illness and challenge existing attitudes. I was also shining a light on often underreported topics most readers would never know about. 

Considering the sources’ vulnerability and the risk of mental illness stigma was crucial. Studies on media coverage of mental health and illness show that the reporting is often stigmatising and negative due to disproportionately focusing on factors such as danger, crime, and violence. This is why I involved people with mental illness in my news stories as this is one way to reduce stigma and to show individual stories behind the data. But at the same time this was one of the main challenges (see answer to other question). 

Scrutinising mental health service providers is important to uncover issues that are negatively impacting patients. Reporting on them raised awareness and highlighted the potential of improving the situation. Incorporating data and a range of voices made my reporting, although on negative issues, realistic, accurate, informative and balanced – attributes contributing to destigmatising mental illness.

To publish more positive and solution-focused stories, I incorporated constructive journalism to discuss possible solutions or promising aspects for a complex social problem. I asked service users and industry professionals about what solutions they think are needed to improve mental health services. 

In other articles, I included statements from trusts that were positively responding to a situation or featured a charity that was functioning as a role model in transforming mental health wards. The latter illustrating an approach to positively impact mental health wards instead of simply highlighting their bad state.","I used the Freedom of Information Act to gather exclusive data. In total I sent six different requests to NHS mental health trusts in England. I used my organisational and project management skills to keep track of the requests. 

After obtaining data, I analysed the data using R and Google Sheets. Using a programming language such as R allowed me to quickly perform analyses and thereby save time. 

Interactive and engaging data visualisations offer the chance for users to participate in the narrative. I visualised the data using Flourish and a range of their templates. 

I used scrollytelling to update charts and highlight bars by scrolling. Thereby, I was able to capture the audience’s attention and point them to what is important. 

Due to its characteristics, scrollytelling can also be used to communicate uncertainty by highlighting shortfalls in the data and focusing the readers’ attention on this aspect. This was relevant when reporting on hospital leave data obtained through FOI. Due to trusts recording the patients’ leave differently, there were inaccuracies. To give a correct impression of the characteristics of the data, I communicated the uncertainty using colours in combination with text in the scrolly section and text in an about-the-data-box.

To heighten the understanding of the visualisations, I used annotations to explicitly emphasize key takeaways and included definitions of specialist terms. Further, I made sure to give the readers access to the data so that they can judge its uncertainty themselves. 

I believe that data stories can be effective across different channels and platforms. Therefore, I distributed content across different channels: through a newsletter, on Instagram and Twitter,  on a website, and in audio two-ways.","Obtaining newsworthy information through FOIs was difficult due to long time limits and administrative silence. Trusts were often storing the data differently or not adhering to deadlines. This meant that obtaining the requested information often took substantially longer than the legally prescribed 20 working days. Some trusts did not reply at all or cited exemptions. Although I requested internal reviews, the time it takes to get a reply can make it incompatible with a tight deadline.

It was important to me to have the experiences of service users in my articles as I believe people should be at the centre of data stories. However, finding case studies was difficult. 
Many were hesitant about coming forward or wanted to stay anonymous as they were worried that speaking up about the care they received from NHS trusts would negatively impact the care they were still receiving. 

I incorporated constructive journalism to discuss possible solutions or promising aspects. However, when reporting on the accessibility of mental health services, it was difficult to frame the story with a solution-oriented focus. While mental health professionals had ideas to improve services, they were greatly dependent on funding. I still included them in the article as they functioned as possible solutions to an inherently negative event.","From this project, other journalists can learn how to report on mental illness responsibly and without being stigmatising. Especially that service users should always be contacted to inform the reporting and to contribute to non-stigmatising reporting. 

Reporting on mental health and mental illness is (most of the time) not something you quickly do. It requires time to get the right data, find case studies and build up trust with them. It also needs research and adhering to guidelines from charities. But, when done right, it can have a great positive impact. 

Therefore I believe, from my reporting, other journalists can learn about the importance of reporting on mental health issues, especially scrutinising NHS mental health services. 

When I was talking to service users and professionals, I often heard from them that things are unlikely to change and that the situation won’t improve. 

This is why I believe we need to raise more awareness and report about possible solutions and ideas from industry professionals and service users. 

There is a need for mental health reporting, especially considering the upcoming changes to the Mental Health Act, proposed funding, and the pandemic’s impact. Bringing in data is essential and can differentiate the reporting from others. For my research I have  looked at a random sample of mental health articles. It showed that just over a third (35%) contained original data analysis and only one in ten (11%) had some form of data visualisation.   

I believe that if there was more high-quality mental health reporting, we could decrease the stigma which in turn would lead to more people coming forward telling their stories. This in turn would have a bigger impact and improve mental health services in England - which is greatly  needed.",English,https://vfillis.github.io/mental-health-stories/index.html,https://us7.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=30cc536cf240dd3c2b255962a&id=3a81e3a12f,https://vanessa-fillis.medium.com/i-have-sent-385-freedom-of-information-requests-here-is-what-i-learned-762ef521a654,https://github.com/vfillis/mental-health-stories,https://vfillis.github.io/html/mental-health-and-housing.html,https://github.com/vfillis/mental-health-housing-support,https://www.instagram.com/vanessafillis.journalism/,,Vanessa Fillis,"My name is Vanessa Fillis.

They were some of Energy Monitor's most-read stories of the year, receiving thousands of views and a significant impact across social media.","The data was meticulously collected by a team of analysts at analytics company GlobalData, which gave Energy Monitor exclusive access to its database.

The graphics were built using Svelte and Layercake (d3.js). The text — including links and formatting — was written in Google Docs, converted to markdown, and then parsed using archieML to create an output script that could be revised externally by editors and sub-editors without having to edit the final HTML markup.","This trio of scrollable stories was the first time the team has created a reusable scrolly format. The format is often labour intensive, as the animated transitions are often not re-used from project to project, so the only reusable code is the step trigger itself. With the dataset we had available, it was soon clear we could create three stories split up geographically, whilst preserving large sections of the logic and layout.

Processing the dataset with tens of thousands of datapoints also has its challenges, particularly as there are uncertainties around what can be constituted as a 'pipeline'. We had to check in with analysts and cross-references with other market research.","The project allows other journalists to contextualise their work in the energy space with the broader global energy transition. By regularly contextualising what we were showing within the International Energy Agency's net-zero models in the write-ups, we ensured the trackers were relevant to other analysts' work on the energy transition.

United Kingdom,The New Statesman,Big,Participant,,British citizenships under jeopardy,01/12/21,"Investigation, Breaking news, Open data, Fact-checking, Politics, Immigration, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, R Studio","This project examined the consequences of clause nine of the British government's proposed Nationality and Borders Bill, which would allow the Home Secretary to strip British nationals of their citizenship without notification under broad conditions. We estimated the number of people who would be affected by clause nine and the relative impact on different ethnicities. This exclusive data analysis was followed up by an in-depth explainer piece, and two further data analyses shedding light on the number of deprivation appeals and the strength of the UK's deprivation powers compared to other G20 countries.","The estimate of the number of people affected by clause nine went viral on social media, receiving hundreds of thousands of page views. A follow-up YouTube video on the analysis has received over 100,000 views. The analysis has been cited four times in Parliament and extensively by protesters, as well as by Al Jazeera, the Independent, openDemocracy, Al Araby and the Herald. The overall figure of six million people potentially eligible for deprivation of citizenship was widely cited, as were the figures demonstrating the racially unequal impact — we estimated the clause would affect two in five people from a non-white ethnic minority and half of all British Asians, compared to one in twenty white people.","The estimate for the number of people potentially eligible for deprivation of citizenship was based largely on data from the 2011 census. It also required building a database of citizenship laws for 33 countries and how the law has changed in each country since 1945. This was necessary to determine the number of individuals potentially eligible for citizenship in each of the countries, based on their place and year of birth. The analysis was performed in R, which allowed for the rapid and retraceable merging of datasets.

A follow-up explainer piece was based on legal briefings by the House of Commons library and UNHCR. A follow-up piece revealing that appeals against deprivation had reached record highs in recent years was possible thanks to an FOI request submitted months earlier and made use of Datawrapper for visualisation purposes. Another follow-up article revealed that the British government's powers of deprivation are the most wide-reaching of any G20 country, based on an analysis of a database of all countries' citizenship laws.","The hardest part of the project was analysing the legislation in depth, building a custom database of the nationality laws of 33 countries since 1945, collating the relevant statistics from the 2011 census and combining it all. It was also challenging to communicate the methodology clearly and to ensure that our readers understood the meaning of the legislation.

The latter challenge was further addressed by a follow-up article explaining, in detail, the implications of the bill for our readers (https://www.newstatesman.com/the-explainer/2021/12/what-does-the-nationality-and-borders-bill-mean-for-you) and through interactions on social media with our readers in which one of the authors answered questions and corrected misunderstandings. We also had to deal with rebuttals from the Home Office that contained false information, potentially confusing our readers. One of the authors engaged extensively with the Home Office on this matter, eventually convincing them to retract one of their false claims (the claim that the Home Secretary's powers cannot leave anyone stateless).","This project illustrates the potential for data stories to have a significant impact on the public conversation. The reasons it did so were its favourable timing, coming just before a debate on the Bill in the House of Commons, and its simple and easily quotable headline findings. Being clear about the methodology and data sources was also important, as evidenced by the fact that many citations of our analysis referenced that it was an analysis of ONS data. The project also benefitted from multiple follow-up stories, which took advantage of a wave of interest in the issue to promote both further engagement and a more in-depth understanding among our readers.

Our unique model recognises that the UK doesn’t often vote or swing as one, and that there are people in some constituencies who are more susceptible to changing their vote than those living elsewhere.",Britain Predicts now sits as one of the UK's most popular election calculators.,"The model was written from scratch based on the documentation of the Strong Transition Model from Electoral Calculus (electoralcalculus.co.uk) and other work from The New Statesman done in previous elections. The calculator was written in JavaScript so it could be sent across to the client allowing for a more tactile approach as opposed to sending the data across to a server to calculate and return a result.

The graphical control was built with a sense of play in mind, with a big circular slider component that is designed to encourage repeat usage. This also removed the issues we had in previous election projects, where each slider affects the other sliders (to sum up to 100%). The slider makes it clear how modifying one party impacts the others.

The project was built with Svelte and Layercake (d3.js), and the data is updated using an AWS Lambda scraper that polls a Google Spreadsheet, so the default poll values can be updated daily without having to redeploy the project.","Like any other model, our model has limitations and assumptions. We had to make some tough calls, such as the decision not to link the Reform Party to its predecessor, the Brexit Party, which can lead to some unusual results such as Reform gaining seats in Scotland if they are given a high enough share. We also had to split the model up to treat Scotland and Wales separately, as they have single-nation parties (the SNP and Plaid Cymru).","The project builds on previous work to improve our collective understanding of how people vote in elections and how we can predict the results of those elections. It also highlights the uneven distribution of seats in parliament, with some parties being over-represented while others get fewer seats.

To contextualise changes in polling figures, journalists can also use the interactive part of their calculator to input their voting scenarios and see how many seats each party would get.",English,https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2021/12/britain-predicts,,,,,,,,"Ben Walker, Michael Goodier and Josh Rayman","Ben Walker is a data journalist at the New Statesman.

ZEIT ONLINE has compiled detailed data from ten major German cities for the first time. They show that the coronavirus affects socially disadvantaged people the most.","Since Germany lacks detailed Covid data, our analysis showed for the first time: Where many people share an apartment, the Covid rates tend to be higher. This is plausible, since infected people are very likely to infect other people living in the same household. In wealthy neighborhoods, case numbers are comparatively low. Well-paid jobs often take place at a desk and can easily be transferred to the home office, where the risk of infection is low. Unemployment also plays a role: in those neighborhoods where a particularly large number of people do not have a job, there is thus an increased incidence of corona infections.","1) Reproject with GDAL

ZEIT ONLINE asked the 15 largest German cities for Corona case figures at the district level. Ten cities provided complete data. In addition to these figures, sociodemographic data were also collected and made available for download (https://interactive.zeit.de/2021/corona-stadtteile/rohdaten-corona-stadtteile-zeit-online.csv) for everyone. This allowed for further analysis by other journalists and researchers.","We tested the statistical correlations presented for significance. We used multilinear regression models to check the influence of further factors. However, it is not easy to draw the right conclusions from statistical correlations. To take one of the examples from the article: Neighborhoods with high unemployment have more Corona infections. The data say nothing about whether high unemployment is the cause of more infections. And whether the unemployed are more likely to be infected. It's worth looking more closely at these two conceivable fallacies.

First, correlation does not equal causation. In principle, it may be pure coincidence that high unemployment and high incidence occur in the same neighborhoods. However, since the pattern occurs in all but a few of the cities studied, this is unlikely.

Second, it is important to note that such analyses do not look at individuals but at groups of people, in this case the residents of a neighborhood. No conclusions about individuals can be drawn from this. 

Statistically, not only is incidence related to various social characteristics - the characteristics also correlate with each other. A high unemployment rate pushes income statistics down, and those with little money cannot afford a large apartment. People with a migration background are more likely than average to be affected by unemployment and poverty. In short, a lot is connected to a lot. This is also what makes it so difficult to distinguish what is cause, what is effect and what is merely coincidence.

For this reason, we compared the results from our data analysis with the current state of studies, which come to similar conclusions.",German,https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2021-05/soziale-ungleichheit-corona-infektionen-aermere-stadtteile-datenanalyse-soziale-brennpunkte,,,,,,,,"Christian Endt, Linda Fischer, Carla Grefe-Huge, Moritz Klack, Julius Troeger","Christian Endt: Data Journalist, Linda Fischer: Journalist, Carla Grefe-Huge: Data Journalist, Moritz Klack: Developer, Julius Troeger: Cartographer",

United Kingdom,BBC News,Big,Participant,,Mapping the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan,09/07/21,"Explainer, Breaking news, Infographics, Map, Politics","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV","The BBC Afghan Service gathered original data on the Taliban advance across Afghanistan and the Visual Journalism team mapped it on an almost daily basis from 9 July - 16 August, showing how districts and cities fell to the insurgents. The maps were widely used on the BBC's UK and world news channels, news online, social media output, and about 40 World Service language sites and services.","The maps we made with original data enabled us to tell the unfolding story of the Taliban advance in a visual and timely way, across a range of platforms, providing maximum value for our audience. We used the maps to tell the story of the how districts and provinces initially flipped back and forth between government and Taliban forces in July and then, as momentum built, the relentless advance of the Taliban in the second week of August. The last map we did was on 16 August - the day after Kabul fell and President Ghani had fled - by this time the only area left free of Taliban control was a small part of the Panjshir valley. The maps were used widely in news stories, features and live pages on the website over a six week period, as well as by the BBC’s World and UK News channel and the main TV bulletins on BBC One - the Six and the Ten. We published many of the maps together in our regularly updated Mapping the Taliban feature, which got several million page views. They also featured on social media and nearly all 40 World Service Languages used at least one version of the maps in their coverage.","In Afghanistan group of journalists from the BBC Afghan Service took on the job of keeping across all the 398 districts and verifying reports of fighting and battles for control. The data was collated and input by a senior journalist in Kabul. The Afghan service set out the criteria for each control category . A district was classified as either Taliban or Government depending on who controlled the administrative centre, police headquarters and other government institutions. Regional reporters sent information, and that was supplemented with additional info from Taliban and government contacts, as well as a variety of local sources. In the UK we set up the spreadsheet for our Kabul colleagues, which they could update using agreed protocols, so we would know when changes had been made to each district. A CSV downloaded from the spreadsheet and was used to create a map in QGIS using a 2005 Afghanistan government boundaries shapefile that divided Afghanistan into 398 districts. The svg we output from QGIS was then passed to a designer to style and output the final png file in English and multiple other languages for publication online or use on TV output. This happened each time an update was needed. We used the data to create single maps, side by side comparisons, zoomed in maps to show change detail and an animated sequence to show change over time. We shared files with TV and language service colleagues.","When we considered how to tell the story of Afghanistan in early July - as the US and Nato forces left and the Taliban immediately started to take over parts of the country - we wanted a reliable and timely source for mapping control because it was a crucial part of the story. The challenge we faced was that other sources which were widely used by other news orgs, were updated less frequently than we would wish. The head of the BBC Afghan service was also keen for her team to give an accurate picture of the changing state of control using their expertise and journalism. By far the hardest aspect was the fact that our colleagues working in Afghanistan were gathering and verifying data under incredibly difficult circumstances. They continued to work despite the huge political and social upheavals taking place in their country. By early August only one extremely dedicated Afghan colleague remained on the project – and he sent us updates at all hours, sometimes several times a day, right up until the day after Kabul – the city he was living in – was invaded by the Taliban. This is an effective and successful mapping project but it also deserves recognition because of the professionalism and commitment to original journalism from our colleagues in Afghanistan.","Great projects can emerge from collaborations! We are so lucky at the BBC to have colleagues who work around the globe and bring unique skills and experience. But it really can be effective to reach out and work with different teams both inside and outside your organisation to accomplish projects you could never do as a single team. Simple tools can create very useful and effective assets but do consider how sustainable your workflow might be. The maps we made were produced manually each time and we didn’t script the production of them, because at the outset we did not anticipate the story moving so quickly. In the event, the way we produced the maps meant that they were easier for the BBC’s World Service websites to translate into up to 40 languages, but if the project has been sustained over a longer time then we might have found a more automated workflow.","English, Spanish, Turkish, Urdu, Russian, Indonesian, Arabic, Bengali, Hausa, Persian, Pashto",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-57933979,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-asia-58219963?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=6118d82927b37217d37d4fc5%26Mapping%20the%20Taliban%20advance%262021-08-15T09%3A55%3A56.858Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:0a831d83-2096-4c87-97d6-dda92c5db3a0&pinned_post_asset_id=6118d82927b37217d37d4fc5,https://www.instagram.com/p/CSrtJFmIp2D/,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=360987218819205,https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-internacional-58208591,https://www.bbc.com/urdu/regional-57987172,https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Mapping-the-Taliban-advance--BZ8ejtJQOWZTa23e9UqET5O~AQ-OyiwfuvyeRH5u2VUaaeew,,"Sayed Abdullah Nizami, Meena Baktash, Ismael Sadaat, Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, David Brown, Johannes Dell, Roberto Belo Rovella, Ana Lucia Gonzalez, Sean Willmott, Gerry Fletcher, Mark Bryson, Bella Hurrell.","The BBC Afghan Service broadcasts in Pashto and Dari for audiences in Afghanistan and Pakistan on television, radio and online.

We exposed their companies, family businesses, state contracts, their networks, and private interests to improve citizens’ decision-making. Indi$cregram: the indiscreet Instagram of power in Colombia. Inspired by the social network, this app informs citizens about really whom they voted for in Congress ahead of the 2022 elections. This tool is based on a methodology to collect, analyze and cross information from 40 public information sources in Colombia and abroad to consolidate around 3500 entities.","Due to Juan Diego Gómez’ investigation published on Indi$cregram, the current president of the Senate, sued Claudia Báez and Diana Salinas, co-founders of Cuestión Pública criminally in the Attorney General's Office, alleging slander. Two judges have previously ruled in our favor in two legal actions undertaken by the senator. Cuestión Pública was judicially harassed by two of the congress members under investigation, and we got many reactions by them regarding our revelations on social media. 
Mainstream medias taken our investigations and put them on the public agenda, also local media republished them regarding their representatives. Three Congress members were forced to launched press released after publication (S1,S2), one of them is a recognized presidential candidate (Petro). 

Also, 48 people paid membership during publication time (1S), and we increased the membership rate to 10% during the second season. 

#Indi$cregram is our most visited page in CP history with 261.336 unique pageviews.
The project was presented as one of the benchmarks in data journalism at NICAR21, the continent's most important data and research conference organized by IRE in the United States. Indi$cregram was taken as a model to explain what data teams in the U.S. and Europe can learn to do inclusive data journalism.

We sent more than 198 (FOIA) to Congress members (two seasons). Thanks to our work to access information (started 2018), at the end of 2019 Colombian Government finally passed a law requiring public officials - Congress members-  to publish their income tax returns, asset declarations, and private interests form. We feel it as our own achievement. 
Thanks to our work and the law we opened, so far, 122 asset declarations, 109 income tax returns, and 76 records of interests of Congress members.","Cuestión Pública scraped open government databases, through R and Python scripts, for the massive extraction of contracting information, campaigns funding, and  laws to then cross-reference this information and identify connections on suspected relationships between congressional representatives in its networks and findings on looting public procurement and other irregularities. All the data were consolidated in Google Sheets for easy information visualization and integration with the web platform.
""We know what you did last legislature period"" databases were built in Google Sheets files which connect with a test environment page where we made all the changes and updates before migrated it to the public web app page. This is possible thanks to a script written within Google Apps Script environment that works like a custom API  for the data.  Also, we created an application ‘made to order’ to cross our list of references with procurement Colombian system API. 
The ""We know what you did last legislature"" application was created with  HTML, CSS, Javascript and Nuxt  framework to recreate Instagram network. An UX designer worked for four months to make the design and improve the user experience of the platform, the Design process progress were followed up in Sketch application. 
As we were under a pandemic crisis all the communications and team operation were managed trough Slack platform, and we shared files also and resources in Google Drive There we consolidated huge databases in order to improve investigation journalism operation processes.","The hardest part to carry out this project was to handle the judicial harassment during publication from the Congress members and its network. Due to reveals that linked Congress members with criminal networks, 'narcos', clientelism and nepotism practices, we received a lot of letters, amendment requests and agressive tweets regarding our publication, our legal team responded accordingly. 
Due to the high harassment received, we make our methodology stronger in the fact-checking process to avoid unjustified replies to our work. Today, our fact-checking method reach high international standards.
In the other side, the learning curve to acquire our innovative investigation methodology takes time, because we investigate each Congress member under the same methodology through eight approaches: 1) ownership of real state assets, 2) family business, 3) business partners, 4) campaign contributors and family members which contract with the State, 5) Court electronic records, 6) conflict of interest in legislative activity, 7) Congress member network, and 8) transparency. 
Due to the huge numbers of technical tools, digital investigation shortcuts, cross-reference databases that we use, and the time constraint to the release, training new journalists in digital forensics techniques, investigation, and data journalism made the project getting longer to finish its first season.
Also, as we are a small newsroom, we had to deal with a large interdisciplinary team composed by employees part-time and full time due to a narrow budget assigned to it. Coordinating those schedules was hard to match heading to date of publication.
Finally, it is a challenge to release such a huge bunch of data and facts,  using understandable language, safeguarding the investigation from a legal point of view, and showing citizens how political power works in Colombia.","The project succeeded in standardizing Cuestión Pública's investigative and data-journalism production processes. In this investigative series, investigative journalism could be measured, analyzed, optimized, and improved in workflows, investigative processes, editorial, legal, design, and development processes. Each Congress member who has been entered to the Indi$cregram application passed through an investigative, a fact-checking, an editorial, and a legal editing protocol measured.

We have created a user-centric web application - which makes investigative journalism 'sexy'.  It was designed for a mobile experience that would inform citizens who they voted for in Congress ahead of the 2022 elections. Indi$cregram app hacked consume habits of the audience (scroll down on Social Media) and replace the content with public interest information. The hashtag was #SabemosLoQueHiciste and our slogan was “Stalk your Congress member and discover whom you really voted for”.
The Indi$cregram considered several stages of publication: 1) journalistic research with data collection through open-source, reporting, data journalism techniques, and digital forensic journalism; 2) information verification to shield investigation with evidence; 3) editorial stage; 4) legal editing and proofreading. 
Cuestión Pública (CP) managed to standardize the investigation processes and create a unique, sophisticated, evolving, replicable, measurable, scalable, and deep methodology.

Until now, when economists wanted to answer this question, they usually looked at the income of a household. For the interactive calculator ""How wealthy are you?"" we teamed up with scientists. and built a class calculator that enables every reader to assign himself or herself to a social situation. Two results are central: The gap between the lower and upper social classes has grown significantly in Germany since the 1980s. And: The climb from the bottom to the top is becoming increasingly difficult.","We believe we have succeeded in making a new contribution to the poverty and wealth debate in Germany with the class calculator and with the focus. From readers' reactions, we realize that our interactive tool, as well as the reports and interviews, have set in motion a discussion that is just beginning: How is the Corona pandemic shifting social boundaries? What new factors of well-being are already determining who finds it well and healthy through the pandemic? And: What are the consequences if - also due to Corona - social strata harden and become even more impermeable?","Javascript, React, D3","How can we tell the story of rich and poor in times of the Corona pandemic? How do we address the emerging debate about ""classism,"" i.e., discrimination based on social origin? These were the questions we asked ourselves at the beginning of the research. 

We decided to establish new relevance through data and empirical findings. We wanted to find study data that would enable readers to take another look at society and their own economic position. Our interactive calculator does two things: It provides a broader understanding of how wealth is distributed in Germany and on which factors this distribution depends. And it makes it immediately possible to understand one's own place in this structure.","The calculator and the accompanying data story were part of a larger focus on the topic of ""class"" entitled: ""The Lay of the Nation.""

Taking the empirical findings as a starting point, we have also found stories that bring the growing gap between rich and poor to life. We tell of the rise of a man who was the only one in his family to escape poverty and show what that meant for him and the family. We tell of the happiness and the burden of being at the top - and never being able to get down because a well-stretched safety net catches you.

United States,Reuters,Big,Participant,,Campaign of Fear,11/06/21,Investigation,"Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","In a series of agenda-setting investigations, Reuters chronicles the campaign of intimidation carried out by supporters of former President Donald Trump against U.S. election workers, stressing the foundation of American democracy.","Federal legislators have drafted new legislation to protect election workers, while lawmakers in Vermont are crafting similar changes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened two investigations directly tied to our reports, according to federal law enforcement sources: one into Gjurgi Juncaj, who threatened a Nevada state election official featured in our September story, and another into the anonymous man spotlighted in November who threatened Vermont officials. Later, staff of the U.S. Senate Rules Committee said our coverage helped prompt its leaders to urge the Federal Election Assistance Commission on Nov. 22 to assist election officials around the U.S. in tapping federal money to strengthen security. ""Reuters' ongoing reporting on this issue has helped expose the extent and nature of threats against election workers and officials,"" a senior Rules Committee staffer said.","Through scores of public records requests, nearly 100 interviews and a review of thousands of social media posts, Reuters reporters meticulously documented more than 850 threatening, harassing and menacing messages directed against election workers and officials in 16 states.
  
We built an original database of hundreds of threats to election workers and officials. We divided the threats into two main categories. The first was threats that, while menacing, are protected as free speech by the First Amendment of the Constitution. A second category consisted of threats that were serious enough to be prosecutable as a criminal threat. We used spreadsheets to track responses to our records requests, record responses to surveys of election officials, and build timelines that helped us link threatening messages to specific events or media coverage

Some states and counties failed to respond to our records requests; others declined to provide the requested documents based on privacy concerns or potential interference with ongoing investigations. In cases where records were unavailable or insufficient, Reuters overcame those hurdles by persuading election officials and staff to divulge the information.

Much of the data also required extensive work before the information could be added to our database. Audio files needed to be transcribed for threats that were left as voice messages for election workers. Personal information needed to be redacted before publication. Some threats arrived in unique forms, including postcards or notes left on doors.","In their reporting for the Nov. 9 story, two Reuters reporters -- Linda So and Jason Szep -- faced weeks of violent threats from one of the subjects of the story. “We are going to have to go f------ medieval on you c---------s,” the suspect said in one of several voicemails he left the reporters. “You are all done. You are all going to f------ burn.” Over 30 days, he texted them 137 times. On Oct. 17, he threatened that the reporters and election staffers in the Vermont Secretary of State’s office would all get “popped.” The threats didn’t stop their reporting. The two journalists also overcame significant hurdles tracking down other people who made threats, many of whom launched their attacks anonymously. In what were often tense and hostile interviews, the reporters convinced the harassers to open up and do so on the record. In several cases, the reporters got the individuals to admit to threats so severe that they could be criminally prosecuted. The project presented some other notable reporting challenges. Many of the local officials were not used to dealing with the news media and reluctant to share the threats they’d received, fearing it would expose them to further attacks. It required reporting finesse and, in some cases, months of trust-building to get those people to share their experiences with us.","We hope to inspire journalists to press on with their reporting in the face of threats. We hope our coverage can be seen as a model for carefully assessing risks and staying focused on exposing people who believe they will remain anonymous while intimidating the workers who help run elections. We hope journalists will learn from our unrelenting effort to uncover the motivations of people who make threats. On a practical level, we hope other journalists can learn from our dogged pursuit of records -- from internal government emails that revealed the impact of threats on election workers to the various records held by local officials and law enforcement that helped us document hundreds of threatening communications inspired by former President Donald Trump’s false assertions of a rigged American election. 

Our project also demonstrates the importance of collecting raw data -- in our case threats -- and parsing that information carefully to build findings that reveal the full scale of a problem in ways that have impact. After our stories, federal legislators drafted new legislation to protect election workers, while lawmakers in Vermont are crafting similar changes. The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened two investigations directly tied to our reports, according to federal law enforcement sources. Staff of the U.S. Senate Rules Committee said the Reuters coverage helped prompt its leaders to urge the Federal Election Assistance Commission on Nov. 22 to assist election officials around the country in tapping federal money to strengthen security. The stories have also stoked a national discussion. Opinion and analysis columns in The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, and Vox, among others, cited the Reuters findings.

Germany,Zeit Online,Big,Participant,,Covid Dashboard,22/11/21,"News application, Chart, Map, Health, Covid","D3.js, CSV, Node.js, React","For almost two years, millions of readers have been informing themselves daily about the current Corona situation directly on the front page of ZEIT ONLINE. They don't need to specific articles, but get all the information from local Covid cases to international vaccination rights at first glance in one tool.","2020 and 2021 are the years in which data journalism became systemically relevant. Never have numbers and their presentation been as important as during the Corona pandemic, never have decisions with such great social relevance been made on the basis of key figures, data and maps. ZEIT ONLINE has found 

Also ZEIT ONLINE is not content with data at the end of the reporting chain. Since delays, sometimes lasting several days, occur from the health offices via the federal states to the RKI, a team collects the latest figures directly from the websites of the districts. The team provides near-institutional services in the process - and in the process has become a primary source of Covid data.","We store the now almost unmanageable amount of data, from confirmed cases to global vaccination rates, in a so-called Postgres database, which enables very short loading times and more flexible work for data analyses, for example, via a GraphQL interface. In addition to manual input, so-called web scrapers automatically read in figures from various websites and merge them into the database. We program these scrapers in Javascript and Python and execute them by so-called cronjobs every minute. We process geo data such as the map of Germany with the open source software QGIS. We analyze data with the statistical software R or Jupyter Notebook. We develop the designs together with the software Figma, often we build the first version of our graphics with the tool Datawrapper. The interactive graphics on the website consist of the Javascript library D3 and React components. To keep the overview we organize ourselves with the browser tool Trello and communicate via Slack and Zoom.

The Dashboard started on February 26nd 2020. But it got its latest major relaunch on on November 22nd 2021.","The pandemic has gone through various phases during this time, which is why our Covid dashboard has also changed again and again. What started as a basic map with some figures has become a comprehensive dashboard with all the key figures on the pandemic, from seven-day incidence to vaccination rates. 

In the background, our team collects data almost around the clock. The figures from the national health department and the federal states are now supplied automatically by software. 

In addition, we visit hundreds of websites of the district offices several times a day. The reason: In the reporting chain from the health offices via the federal states to the RKI, there are sometimes delays of several days. In order to be able to show the most up-to-date figures possible, a team of therefore visits the websites of the federal states every day. The team that manages the dashboard has been working entirely from their home office for almost a year - in shifts from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., during the week and on weekends.","Our readers are a great support in this process. Never before have we received so much and such regular feedback for a project as for the Corona data. Over the course of the years, thousands of comments were posted concerning the Dashboard.

Canada,"CBC News, Radio-Canada",Big,Participant,,White men make up a third of Canada's population but a majority of MPs — here's why,26/08/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, Infographics, Video, Elections, Politics, Women, Race","D3.js, Three.js, Google Sheets, CSV, R, JavaScript","Our exclusive data analysis was published during Canada’s last federal election campaign and was the first news story to put concrete numbers on inequalities between political candidates based on their race and gender. We found that, while all parties recruited more diverse candidates than ever, white men who ran for office still received more money from parties and ran in ridings that were easier to win than racialized and Indigenous candidates. Beyond challenges related to funding and ridings, former and current candidates also shared experiences of racist attacks and discrimination on the campaign trail that discouraged them from running.","Our story was addressed by Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau while on the campaign trail the day it aired. At the time, Trudeau acknowledged that his party could do more to promote and protect candidates who weren’t white. The diversity of the House of Commons in Canada is an important topic that comes up at each election cycle, especially the aspect of race. Before our data analysis and stories were published, that topic was mostly discussed through profiles of candidates or calls to action from various citizen groups, but it wasn’t backed up with hard data. There was also a gap in academic literature and many were looking for a way to maintain accountability on the topic in a credible way every election. Our coverage became a point of reference for groups promoting diversity in all levels of politics. Our analysis and methodology was also noted by many Canadian researchers as an example of what credible data analysis could tell us on diversity in our country. We were even contacted by political science researchers who had read our stories and now had new ideas on how to push this analysis further, including by adding new variables like diving into the professions of political candidates before they ran for office. Lastly, our coverage also shined a light on our own possible shortcomings as media members: many federal candidates gave us concrete examples of times where they felt typecast by news coverage because of their race or were asked biased questions a white candidate would never have to answer by reporters. We shared this feedback with newsroom leaders, which gave us a chance to openly discuss ways to fight our own potential biases and offer better coverage for the 2021 elections.","For our data analysis, we used the computer language R. For the digital story, we coded an interactive project, with the main data visualization made in 3D with Three.js and the others charts with d3.js. To analyze the gender and race of candidates, we used the dataset on the demographics of Canadian Federal Election Candidates (2008-2019) compiled by four Canadian academics with funding from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the first one in the country to match candidates with their race and gender. To identify party strongholds, we used election results from 2004 to 2019 published by the Library of Parliament. We consulted with several political scientists before deciding that, for the purposes of our analysis, a stronghold would be a district won two times in a row by a party during federal elections with at least a 10 percent margin. To calculate how much each candidate had received from political parties, we scraped the reviewed financial filings submitted by candidates made available by Elections Canada and matched each candidate with their electoral results, electoral funding, gender and race. To compare the weight of political candidates with their representation in Canada’s population, we used the breakdown of individuals who self-identify as white, racialized or Indigenous in the Canadian population from Statistics Canada's 2016 Census, the most recent census available at the time of publication.","The biggest technical hurdle for our team was to merge data for more than 4,000 candidates running federally. The information was scattered in various datasets from different sources. By combining them together, we were able to produce this exhaustive and exclusive analysis, which includes race, gender, electoral results, political strongholds, funding and the likelihood of being elected for the first time in Canadian politics. After the analysis, we decided on a step by step data visualization that would follow the audience as they scrolled down the piece the way electors follow their candidates along the campaign trail all the way to Parliament. On the reporting front, finding former or current political candidates who were willing to share sensitive stories of racist attacks in the middle of a political campaign, especially to two white reporters, was no small feat. By sharing their stories publicly, they could alienate political parties and ruin their chances of ever running again and expose themselves to becoming targets once more. It was key for our team to navigate those concerns with our journalistic responsibility for balance, while working as hard as we could to give each of Canada’s main five political parties a space in our story. Our team did research on each one of the 299 diverse candidates who ran in our last federal election in 2019 and reached out to about 50 while staying mindful of balancing male and female candidates with equal numbers for each political party. We ended up interviewing a half-dozen individuals who trusted us enough to relive recent and sometimes painful memories of microaggressions and racist attacks on the campaign trail. Those characters carried the story and helped us reveal yet another challenge for diverse candidates, which we couldn’t see in the data alone.","We think this project demonstrates how valuable merging data from various sources can be to tell new and important stories. It’s tedious but rewarding work and having the ability to spot how datasets can talk to each other will often lead to exclusive findings. We hope other reporters will develop that skill, especially if they are covering topics like social justice and racial or gender inequities. On the reporting side, our advice would be to step away from the often dazzling data and code and to really take the time to connect with potential interviewees on a human level, without referring to the data at first. Our coverage would never have had the impact or the depth it did without the honesty and emotions shared in our interviews and that did not come from numbers. Another valuable lesson for us was that you can’t be married to your data or your findings if another key element of the story is revealing itself. What interviewees were sharing often didn’t have anything to do with data or funding or their likelihood of winning a riding. Many times there were harrowing anecdotes about racist attacks they’d suffered while on the campaign trail and sometimes the lack of support they received from their own parties. They also often felt that media coverage on their campaign focused solely on their race and that reporters rarely asked them about their views on policies the way they did white candidates. That never appeared in our data and it became an essential element of our coverage with good reason. A last point to keep in mind: you can make beautiful and engaging broadcast coverage (TV/Radio) with data analysis too!

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,,The pandemic’s true death toll,15/05/21,"Explainer, Open data, News application, Chart, Map, Health, Covid-19","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, R","In May 2021, The Economist became the first and only organisation in the world to publish an estimate of the pandemic’s true death toll, as well as estimates of excess deaths for every country in the world. These are, as far as we are aware, the only estimates of excess deaths—the best metric of pandemic mortality, with no dependency on testing—available at the global level. 

The wider project included a cover “briefing” and a leader calling for more equitable distribution of vaccines, as well as multiple follow-up pieces, an online methodology, and daily-updated interactive tracker.","As SARS-CoV-2 spread across the world, it was quickly apparent that some places were better at detecting it than others. Be it in infections or deaths, the biggest difference has always been this: victims in richer countries are more likely to be tested, and therefore more likely to be counted. 

This matters, because for important questions, such as where to allocate aid or vaccines, or even where to accept travellers from, one needs an accurate picture of the pandemic globally. Such a picture is also important to identify which regions remain vulnerable, and to identify and acknowledge the pandemic’s devastation beyond the rich world. If one relies on official covid-19 death counts, the result is predictable: most victims in poor countries will not be counted, and these countries will not receive help.

Our project aims to estimate and show a more accurate representation of the pandemic’s true death toll. The effort has been widely praised by international organisations, such as the WHO, who called it ‘heroic’; the UN who called it “exemplary”; and it has been used as the basis for analysis by the World Bank, as well as being acknowledged the Global Fund, one of the largest distributors of pandemic aid. Researchers at the University of Oxford call it: “the most comprehensive and rigorous attempt to understand how mortality has changed during the pandemic at the global level.” 

The project’s estimates have been widely used, and have even become part of Our World in Data's covid-19 “data dashboard”. We know that at least one of the world’s largest aid organisations has used our findings in discussions about how to allocate pandemic aid. They are also being used by the WHO and our journalists are regularly advising the WHO on related questions upon request.","For the modelling powering the effort, we relied on cutting-edge statistical procedures and implementations. Specifically, the modelling begins with a massive script collecting data on more than 100 statistical indicators, ranging from cell-phone data to researchers’ categorisations of countries into democracies and non-democracies to the share of covid-19 tests that are reported as positive. 
 
This information is then fed into a relatively new implementation of gradient-boosted trees, a flexible machine learning algorithm, not one, or two, but 201 times. This enables the formation of 201 models, of which 200 are there to accurately produce confidence intervals, showing where the models are uncertain, and giving ranges rather than implausible precise numbers. 

Every morning, the data are updated automatically on Github, predictions are generated from all 201 models, and these are then passed to a series of tests. If all tests are passed, all interactive elements on our pages are updated with the new data, and updated spreadsheets are posted to Github. To learn more, please see the separate methodology article, or take a look at the code, models, and data, which is 100% open-source. (Feel free to suggest improvements too!)","The hardest part of this project was the modelling. Estimating how many excess deaths there have been in every country for every day since January 1st 2020 is, to be frank, very difficult. Second hardest has been communicating the uncertainty of the estimates in a good way. 

To take a few examples. The modelling goes beyond just collecting data and feeding them to a model. For instance, data on seroprevalence (the % of people with covid-19 antibodies) in different countries were collected from academic papers. While collections of these exist, whether such surveys were representative had to be decided manually, which involved skimming hundreds of academic articles and government web pages. Lots of countries also had missing data: many countries, for instance, only report updated vaccination counts on irregular intervals. That means that in order for the main models to use vaccination data well, the underlying vaccination data need to be modelled too: a model within a model.    

Communicating uncertainty in a good way has been hard too. For all estimates, we have an upper value and lower value (forming a range of plausible values), and a central estimate within that range. For many countries, good data mean a narrow range. That is easy enough to communicate, and if people just use the central estimate within that range, it does not make much difference. In contrast, for other countries we can only give very broad ranges due to limited data. In such cases, just using one number would give a misleading sense of precision. This meant many careful choices in how we write and present our work visually. For instance, we only provide the range in our summary tables - not the central estimate.","We think that other journalists may get good ideas for how they can use new statistical tools (such as machine learning) in their work, and the importance of providing such information. We have tried to make learning from this project as easy as possible, and keep all our data, code and methods open-source to enable that. Moreover, we have tried to share what we think we have learned from it around the world: university lectures in America, the closing keynote on the use of Machine Learning in Data Journalism at Code.br, the largest data journalism conference in Latin America, and talks to the WHO, Global Fund, and Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.",English,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/05/15/there-have-been-7m-13m-excess-deaths-worldwide-during-the-pandemic?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/15/ten-million-reasons-to-vaccinate-the-world?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/05/13/how-we-estimated-the-true-death-toll-of-the-pandemic?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-the-economist-global-excess-deaths-model,,,,"Sondre Ulvund Solstad, Martín González Gómez","Sondre Ulvund Solstad is The Economist’s Senior data journalist.

Several scientists from Brazil and abroad were contacted and asked to produce a preliminary script in which the illustrated material would be later based on. The project was a partnership with Instituto Serrapilheira, an institution with the objective of funding research and science communication initiatives.","Illustrated History of Knowledge had a very good reception with our readers. We received emails congratulating the initiative, and the average time of reading for each timeline, which measures the retention rate, was almost the double than usual. 

The project also opened new possibilities for the team to explore the idea of elaborating on the biography of something, not someone, a concept that was later used in other materials (such as the “Biography of Vaccine Producers”, the institutes that produces covid-19 vaccines in Brazil).","Each timeline was developed under a methodology that optimized the process. The first step was to aid the researcher in writing a script for the story on Google Docs, a process that usually took from 14 to 21 days. Following that, the text is edited to work better with the illustrations, along with the production of raw graphics related to the topic (using R and QGIS), a step that took from 5 to 7 days. Subsequently, the research for reference pictures as well as the production of the illustrations on Adobe Illustrator took from 10 to 14 days. Coming next, the technical review of the edited text and illustrations took from 3 to 6 days, and the final reviews frequently took 2 days to finish.","The major challenge in this project was to create a methodology that allowed the production of ten timelines not to interfere with other demands of the team. This certain degree of standardization also facilitated the unification of both visual and written languages, even when dealing with unrelated topics. Another difficult task was to condense stories that trace back millennia into a fast, easily readable material.","In a field many times known for working overtime, the development of an efficient method to produce each timeline allowed each deadline to be reached within two to three days in advance, without anyone needing to do any extra hour. Structuring the project as a step-by-step process allowed the team to rationalize the time required for each phase. It is a valuable lesson on the importance of planning, using a method strict enough for the team to have a “down to earth” perspective on deadlines, but flexible enough to handle unexpected circumstances.

Satellite images show protected rainforest on fire,18/05/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Documentary, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Environment, Corruption, Economy","Animation, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV","Palm oil is considered one of the healthiest and most affordable vegetable oils. There's a catch, though: its production comes at the expense of valuable ecosystems. Eco-labels are supposed to help make palm oil more sustainable. But do they deliver what they promise? Our visual investigation finds: only partially. Satellite images and data from Indonesia show that even on certified plantations, illegal clearing techniques and deforestation occur time and again.

The online article presents the investigation using maps, graphics, and text. It is accompanied by a short video. The story also appeared in print and on social media.","At the beginning of 2021, palm oil became a widely debated topic in Switzerland. The reason for this was the upcoming vote on the free trade agreement with Indonesia. Part of the agreement: Only palm oil with specific sustainability labels should benefit from lower import prices. The vote was approved on March 7. 

The Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) was the only media organization that fact-checked the promises made by the sustainability labels in such a detailed analysis. In doing so, we made an essential contribution to the transparency of promises from democratically elected politicians.

The story was widely read and well-received by our subscribers. Many of them spent an above-average time on the article online. On social media, the story is still shared on a weekly basis in activist circles to point out the greenwashing issues of the palm oil industry. Internally at Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the article is considered a showcase for using satellite imagery as visual evidence and for investigative research with public data.","Our story focuses on one of the largest eco-labels for palm oil, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RPSO). We examine three of their most important rules:
1. Fires are not allowed to be used to clear land.
2. The clearing of virgin rainforest is prohibited.
3. New plantations may not be planted on peat.

Examining various publicly available data sources, we gained new insights into how their members adhere to these rules. First, we used data from Global Forest Watch to grasp the extent of palm oil plantations and the accompanying destruction of the tropical forest. We then overlaid fire hotspots measured by NASA with concession boundaries to reveal where fires occur on certified palm oil plantations. Next, we searched and analyzed publicly available infrared imagery from satellites to track where these fires start. Finally, we demonstrate how valuable tropical forests and peatlands are cleared for plantations using land cover data and true-color satellite imagery.
 
Documents from the palm oil industry also served as important sources. These include various reports from palm oil companies available to the NZZ and the rulebook of RSPO. Using the visual analysis process described above, we could either confirm or refute these documents. 
 
The article presents the entire visual investigation in graphics, maps, and texts. Where high temporal and spatial resolution is available, we use map animations to show developments over time. Satellite images are annotated and presented in chronological order. Readers can also hide and show different data layers on top of the satellite images to view the evidence at their own pace. Finally, the text embeds the visual elements into the story, explains the complex world of sustainability labels to our readers, and guides them through the often opaque data.","The challenges of this story lay in the research and in presenting the complex data to our readers.
 
Most of the data and documents were public. But often, they were not easy to find and difficult to understand. Many of the documents were only found using Google search operators; other confidential documents were obtained through NGOs. The data on palm oil concessions was also incomplete and poorly documented. Some of RSPO's data had to be downloaded from a hidden section of their website.
 
Satellite imagery posed further challenges: Dense cloud cover often hangs over Indonesia, making it challenging to find suitable images. In addition, we had to learn how to read the images with the help of experts, for example, to recognize typical traces of peat fire.
 
Once we had the data, we had to determine which of the hundreds of RSPO-certified palm oil plantations in Indonesia were breaking sustainability rules. To do this, we had to fully understand the RSPO rulebook, which proved complicated: the rulebook uses a very technical language, is full of sub-clauses, and keeps changing over the years. Many of the palm oil companies operate in the legal gray area. So it was also necessary to distinguish whether clearing and fires were actually breaches of the rules or whether they were environmentally harmful but nonetheless legal practices.
 
The final challenge was to convey our research to the reader: We processed satellite images so that events shown in them could be recognized even by laypersons. We visualized small-scale geographic developments in such a way that they were readable on desktop as well as on mobile screens. And in the text, we tell the story of the complex RSPO-rules and the opaque data in a compelling yet straightforward manner.","Consumerism in countries in the Western hemisphere often comes with an environmental and human cost for countries of the Global South. Political decisions on responsible consumerism often involve some form of greenwashing. As journalists in Switzerland, we can contribute to a more sustainable production cycle by fact-checking promises made by politicians and sustainability labels. We hope that our project can serve as an example for this kind of work. Furthermore, we hope that our article inspires journalists to make use not only of open, structured data, but of the wide variety of open-source material, such as satellite images, satellite data, and documents.","English, German",https://www.nzz.ch/english/palm-oil-boom-threatens-protected-rainforest-in-indonesia-ld.1625490,https://www.nzz.ch/international/nachhaltiges-palmoel-bedroht-regenwald-indonesien-ld.1610359,https://www.nzz.ch/international/gibt-es-nachhaltiges-palmoel-aus-indonesien-daten-zeigen-braende-gibt-es-auch-auf-zertifizierten-plantagen-ld.1603919,https://www.instagram.com/p/COucMesLL4q/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link,https://epaper.nzz.ch/read/6/6/2021-05-11/7?signature=58bc235b33bad5007daab17e61852cdc39db6565d7e5004da74c23bba946d572,,,,"Barnaby Skinner, Conradin Zellweger, Adina Renner","The NZZ Visuals department uses data and visualization to tell stories that range from breaking news to in-depth backgrounds.

Germany,Zeit Online,Big,Shortlist,,Is This How the Pandemic Comes to an End?,24/06/21,"Explainer, Coronavirus","Animation, Simulation, JavaScript React","Is This How the Pandemic Comes to an End? is an interactive explainer on the topic of herd immunity. The piece consists of a calculator, an illustrated scrollytelling element and a simulator. They aim to explain the concept and limitations of herd immunity and answer the question: Can the pandemic be stopped by vaccinating enough people?","Back when the project was launched, there was a lot of talk about herd immunity: Would it be possible to stop the spread of the coronavirus just by vaccinating enough people? At the same time however, the new and more contagious delta variant evolved – and rendered the idea of herd immunity virtually impossible. Our calculator and simulator are based on a simple formula that epidemiologists use to estimate how many people would have to be immune in order to stop the spread – and they showed that delta, most likely, had come to stay. 

The article improved public understanding of a complex but highly relevant topic. It was read and shared widely. Subsequently, the project was translated into English and adapted as a video.","Both the calculator and the simulator are built in JavaScript React. The calculator is based on the formula for the herd immunity threshold: (1 - 1 / R0) / e where R0 is the baseline reproduction number R0 - i.e., the average number of people an infected person infects if no countermeasures are put in place – and e is the vaccination protection against transmission of the virus.

The simulation is based on a SIR model, a model that is used in epidemiology to model the spread of a virus. 

The scrollytelling is based on a custom embed in our content management system. For higher resolution, we exported the illustrations using Ai2html.","The simulator was quite an ambitious project to build - both mathematically and technically speaking. Note that our article shows an actual mathematical simulation: Every time the webpage is loaded, new random dots are generated and a randomized infection process is started.","The entire project was a great team effort. We designed all the elements collaboratively in figma. The simulator and calculator were built in pair programming sessions. We also worked closely with several scientists (special thanks go to Benjamin Maier of the Humboldt-Universität Berlin, who revised our code and calculations up until the night before publication.)","English, German",https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2021-06/herd-immunity-calculator-covid-end-of-pandemic,https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2021-06/herdenimmunitaet-corona-infektionsgeschehen-impfung-neuinfektionen-simulation,https://www.zeit.de/video/2021-07/6263516755001/corona-kann-die-herdenimmunitaet-noch-erreicht-werden,,,,,,"Annick Ehmann, Elena Erdmann, Christopher Pietsch and Julius Tröger","We are a team of journalists, designers and developers who collaborated on this project:Annick Ehmannis a designer and illustrator, Christopher Pietsch is a developer,Julius Trögerheads the interactive team at Zeit Online and Elena Erdmann is a science and data journalist.

The report praised the professionalism of the work, especially as it sheds light on a phenomenon that affects the youth group. Noting that the youth category suffers from a high unemployment rate in Gaza that exceeds 50% in light of the lack of job opportunities and the closing of the horizon for young people.
There are many crises experienced by young people in the Gaza Strip as a result of several factors, most notably the restrictions of the Israeli siege and the negative effects of the internal Palestinian division, which contributed to the low rates of employment and their absence from political participation, the high costs of marriage and the difficulty of education and transportation to and from the Gaza Strip.","In preparing the report, I relied on interviews through face-to-face talks with stories and cases, and used audio and photography techniques in preparing the written report.

Anytime someone uses the tool, a machine learning model running in the cloud is used to generate a prediction. This tool, and the data used to construct it, was also the basis of an investigation into covid-19 illness.","Beyond the related publications and the hundreds of thousands who have used the online tool, the project is currently used by academic researchers at Brown, Harvard, New York and other universities, as well as the American Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Researchers at NYU Langone are currently, together with one of our journalists, using the tool to explore how to optimise the allocation of booster doses of vaccine. They have also checked it against their internal data with good results. These researchers turn to us because, as far as they know, no better tool is available.","The tools used were: 

1. The Covid-19 Research Database, an online repository of medical information created by American healthcare companies
2. Python implementations of xgboost, numpy, and other libraries
3. Cloud services, as well as graphics and code to interactively present the information","The hardest parts were first getting access to the data, which were incredibly secure, and second, presenting them in a fair way that would not be misinterpreted. 

To give an example of the former: copying anything, including text, into the server containing the data was impossible. That meant manually typing in all code, character by character, except python itself and the xgboost, pandas, and numpy libraries, which fortunately were uploaded to the server in advance. Exporting models was a weeks-long process. 

With regards to presentation, we wanted to be careful. We therefore reached out to a range of academics on how to best use and present the data, who provided tips and guidelines on how we should present them. Their advice was very useful, but getting it all right required being very meticulous.

Designing the interface was challenging. We had to be mindful of numerous implementation details (for example if a query includes hyperlipidemia we include metabolic conditions) and present risk in a way that was clear to the general public.","We think other journalists may learn that it is possible to run ambitious machine learning models on-demand in the cloud, and that even personal medical data can be used journalistically, provided appropriate steps are taken and the data handled with care. Setting up the infrastructure to generate predictions for billions of different combinations of conditions, age, and gender was hard but we have created what we think is a valuable journalistic product on a par with the best research.",English,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/13/our-covid-19-model-estimates-odds-of-hospitalisation-and-death?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/covid-pandemic-mortality-risk-estimator?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/03/11/how-we-built-our-covid-19-risk-estimator?fsrc=core-app-economist,,,,,,"Sondre Ulvund Solstad, Martín González Gómez","Sondre Ulvund Solstad is The Economist’s Senior data journalist.

The end of the country is portrayed throughout the article by charts and maps that chronologically guide readers in the socio-economic impacts on the former Soviet Republics after the dissolution.,"Since it was published in the middle of December, our view over the impact is still preliminary. In general, the project was well received by our audience and had good Analytics metrics compared to our average, considering time of reading, unique views and retention.","The first step in this project was data research. For this, the following sources were used: Maddington Project Database 2020, the UN (United Nations) and the article ""Recent trends of the population in the Soviet Union (1990)"" by S. Kono. Then, Flourish, Google Sheets and R were used to tabulate the data and generate the graphs. The next step was made using Google Docs and, with the collaboration of the team, the content was organized and structured. Subsequently, in Adobe Illustrator, some images were generated and the graphics were stylized. In addition, there was the production of the map representing the Soviet Union and the most populous cities with the help of QGIS and Natural Earth. Finally, the front-end programming part of the page was prototyped and executed. HTML and CSS were used to structure, customize, and make the page design responsive.

United States,The New York Times,Big,Winner,"The Tulsa massacre, the New York Times has noted, has gone from “virtually unknown to emblematic with impressive speed.” Its own film critics have suggested watching all three new documentaries about the day in 1921 when the entire Black community was burned to the ground by rioting white Tulsa residents, with as many as 300 people killed. The New York Times has now contributed its own groundbreaking work on the massacre, which brings the reader/viewer into the community through a 3D virtual tour. The journalists combed through archival records, interviewed descendants of the families from the community and wrote software to bring the world back to life in a virtual representation. The stunning work is immersive, exhaustive and so impressive and haunting that words fail. By all means, watch all the documentaries on the massacre, but immerse yourself in the Times’ portrait. None of this could have been possible without the expertise of computational journalist with vision.",What the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre Destroyed,24/05/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Map","Animation, 3D modelling, AI/Machine learning, Scraping, QGIS, Canvas, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, PostGIS, OpenStreetMap, Python, Node.js","With the 100th year anniversary of the Tulsa Race Massacre approaching, we wanted to help readers understand the full scope of what was lost when an angry white mob destroyed a thriving Black neighborhood in Tulsa, Okla. We spent months reconstructing the historic neighborhood of Greenwood and created a detailed 3-D model of the area as it was before the massacre. This allowed readers to fully experience the level of success and entrepreneurship accomplished by Greenwood’s Black citizens just six decades out of enslavement.","The story of the Tulsa massacre was buried in history for many decades. It is an important piece of American history that we wanted our readers to understand. While historians have pieced together details of the massacre, we wanted to create a fully immersive experience that allowed readers to gain a comprehensive look into the tremendous loss of life, property and generational wealth from the events of May 31 and June 1, 1921.

The piece was well received by readers, academics and other media organizations. Hundreds of Times readers not only lauded the project, but for some, it was the first time they had even heard of the massacre. 

The three lead authors of the project were invited to a number of conferences to speak about the project and how the project came together. Several teachers have reached out to say that the project is being incorporated into their curriculums. And the project has been cited in several academic journals. 

We also released all of the data files associated with the story to the public so that others could build on the work that we published.","We created the 3-D model of the Greenwood neighborhood using a series of computerized and manual steps that transformed historical material into digital data. A process called georeferencing was used to take images from archival Sanborn insurance maps and align them to modern geography. We wrote a computer program to extract the building outlines from those maps using a technique called machine learning. We also created an application to input the height information for each building from the Sanborn maps.

We used a combination of optical character recognition and manual data entry to digitize the Polk-Hoffhine Tulsa City Directory from 1921. This data was used to analyze and map businesses in Greenwood. 

To create maps of the occupations of African-American residents in Greenwood, we analyzed 1920 U.S. census data from Ancestry.com for residents for which occupation data was recorded. The analysis included residents who the census classified as Black or mulatto. Homes of thousands of those residents were mapped using the 1920 Sanborn maps.

Street maps from 1921 and Sanborn maps from 1939 were also used to help map addresses. The addresses of landmarks and other buildings were used to determine the order of house numbers on a block. In some cases, Open Street Maps was used to locate addresses where the numbering system had not changed.","One of the most difficult parts of the project was finding reliable source material about a place that was completely destroyed a century ago. The project required many hours of manual work to research and pore over old photographs, newspaper clippings and other archival material to verify addresses of businesses, locate business owners and gather the level of detail and precision needed to reconstruct each building in the community as accurately as possible. 
 
The project also required creative technical feats, like bringing entire blocks of a neighborhood to life from historical, two-dimensional insurance maps. 
 
The scale of this ambitious project was challenging to pull off as the department balanced other news priorities, like Covid-19, the fallout from the Capitol riot and a new presidential administration.","It’s important for newsrooms to maximize talent from across the newsroom. For this project, we collaborated with nearly two dozen people from different teams, allowing us to achieve high standards in both visual and technical storytelling techniques as well as sophisticated reporting and writing.

The project also allowed us to combine a wide range of reporting skills. This included on-the-ground reporting, in talking to descendants of the massacre. But it also included hours and hours of combing through archival material, reviewing numerous relevant photographs, newspaper clippings and published documents to track down whether an awning did indeed exist on a building during the time of the massacre or whether an address had changed before or after the event. We had to be creative and resourceful in how we tracked down some of these details, and that involved a combination of manual work as well as help from custom software.",English,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/24/us/tulsa-race-massacre.html,https://github.com/nytimes/tulsa-1921-data,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/30/insider/greenwood-tulsa-massacre-3d.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/learning/teaching-about-the-tulsa-race-massacre-with-the-new-york-times.html,,,,,"Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Anjali Singhvi, Audra D.S.

Canada,"Radio-Canada, CBC",Big,Participant,,Domestic flights: when provinces infect each other,13/05/21,"Investigation, Database, Map, Covid 19, Pandemic","Animation, 3D modelling, D3.js, Three.js, R","At the start of the pandemic, international flights have been the area of concern in Canada. But this exclusive analysis demonstrated how tens of thousands of people, some of whom are carriers of the virus that causes COVID-19, travelled across the country every week without testing or quarantine, at time of publication.","In Canada, airports are under federal jurisdiction. During the first half of 2021, many provinces tried to stop travellers from entering their territory. However, their powers were limited. They could stop cars at their borders, but they had no control over the planes. At the time, several regions had established curfews or stay-at-home orders. Still, people could take a plane, travel thousands of kilometres in a few hours and land in a restricted area (or leave a restricted area) without being tested and without quarantine upon arrival. Meanwhile, international travellers had to respect stringent rules. Canada was very focused on foreigners, even if there was evidence of inter-provincial contaminations.
This exclusive story was among the reports that shifted the focus from international flights to domestic flights. Several provincial prime ministers asked the federal government to close airports or control domestic flights at least. In the end, with the vaccination campaign going on in 2021, the federal government required proof of vaccination to take a plane in Canada.","I analyzed the data with the programming language R. The data comes from flightradar24.com. For the main interactive data visualization, I decided to create a 3D globe with the JavaScript library ThreeJS. I coded a custom WebGL shader for optimal performance to move the many planes along their trajectory. I coded the other charts using the d3.js library. Everything is adapted for both desktop and mobile screens. I also did the research, the interviews and wrote the story","At first, I intended to analyze the international air traffic in Canada. But while working on the data, I noticed how the domestic air traffic bounced back after the spring of 2020. And I pivoted my complete analysis. It wasn’t an easy decision. With 3.6 million flights in the database, it involved redoing a big part of the analysis and the research. But this critical shift helped publish an essential story that wasn’t told at the time.
For the data visualization, I was looking for a representation that would respect the spherical shape of the earth. Therefore, I went for a 3D globe. This approach works very well for long-distance trajectories and big countries like Canada. However, it was a technical challenge to translate latitude and longitude of the planes (coordinates in 2D space) to coordinates in a 3D space. We did a lot of work on the design as well (stars in the background, for example) to create a unique and immersive experience for the reader.","First, I hope other journalists will be aware of FlightRadar24’s data. It’s an excellent source of information, and their team is always happy to help reporters. All of the analysis in R code is public, and anyone could dig into it for their own reporting. On the data visualization aspect of the project, I hope that 3D visualizations like this one will be more common in the future. Open-source JavaScript libraries like ThreeJs are amazing and could even be used for augmented and virtual reality projects. With this kind of approach, the engagement from the readers is incredible and very rewarding.

Here are the stories behind the numbers.,15/04/21,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Women, Health","D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Node.js","Nearly 9,000 Texas nursing home residents have died of COVID-19. This is what the last year of chaos and isolation was like for nursing homes residents and the employees who care for them.","For the first weeks of the pandemic, Texas did not release data on cases in nursing homes — even when it became clear that the virus was especially deadly for residents. With this accountability story, we sought to revisit the lack of transparency, uncertainty and complexity of that period. We used data and people’s stories to show what happened inside nursing homes during the pandemic’s first year. 
Finding nursing home residents willing (and able) to be interviewed was the biggest reporting challenge. Reporter Karen Brooks Harper spent weeks culling respondents from our COVID-19 callout, reaching out to families and nursing home administrators until she found Lynda Langford, a nursing home resident who became one of the project’s central characters.
This story, which gave readers a layer of insight they hadn’t seen before, received positive reception from readers and other news outlets across the state, with data reporter Carla Astudillo appearing on Texas Standard, a statewide public radio program, to tell the story of what we found in the data.","This story is based on public data. Carla works on the Tribune’s data visuals team, which publishes a daily case tracker measuring coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, deaths and vaccine doses in Texas. We also scraped data on daily cases and deaths in nursing homes provided by two different state agencies. Carla became an expert on nursing home data early in the pandemic, reporting on infection disease inspections and sharing numbers before the state began publishing them. For this story, she fact-checked months worth of the state’s data with federal reports and designed the charts that introduce the narrative.

United States,"The Investigative Reporting Workshop built TAP, but has worked with several other organizations (including the Center for Public Integrity) to gather and report on the data.",Small,Participant,,The Accountability Project,01/01/21,"Database, Open data, News application","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, R Studio, PostgreSQL, Node.js","Public data is everywhere, collected by government agencies, advocacy groups, news organizations and an ever-expanding set of specialty sites. But that data is online in too many different locations to easily search. The Accountability Project cuts across these data silos and give journalists and the public a simple way to search huge volumes of public data about people and organizations. So far, we’ve acquired, standardized and uploaded hundreds of databases, accounting for more than 1.4 billion records.  The data has been used by journalists across the country to identify patterns and draw connections between people and organizations.","The goal of TAP was to provide research data to newsrooms and researchers that might otherwise not have access to such data.  We have worked with several nonprofit newsrooms to help them with investigations using TAP data, including stories about dark money, nonprofits and health care.

We have nearly 20,000 unique users with more than 400 sign-ups for the data that requires a logon.  Because the site is free, it is difficult for us to track how individual searches generate stories, but anecdotally, users say it is an valuable resource.","TAP is built on Amazon cloud technologies: an EC2 web server, a hefty Postgres Amazon RDS database, as well as an Elasticsearch account with elastic.co.  Our data is stored as a data lake, with only a subset of fields as native Postgres columns. The full data is kept in JSONB. 
The website itself is built with Django, and an administrative site lets our data fellows pull in datasets from S3 and tag the columns containing names, addresses, dates, and other key fields. The search pages are built using Svelte.js.
The data is split into names and addresses, which are searched in Elasticsearch and transactions are stored in PostgresSQL. A transaction might be an expenditure or a registration. 
We then load data into a staging site, so that we can check that search results work as intended before publishing to the live site. 
Many of the TAP’s databases required filing open-records requests or extracting data from documents. Reviewing hundreds of data sets with a scrappy crew of fellows and data journalists has meant a lot of hard work to gather, check, and add the data to the site. To help keep things organized and on track, we keep a log of every database from request to upload, including the name of the person responsible for it. We’re software agnostic, as long as users can create a reproducible workflow or script, but most of the data processing is done in R. 
To allow users to query some data directly, we employed Datasette, along with query templates, so users could write their own SQL to run against TAP data.","At the outset, we took on what seemed like an impossible task. 

Every stage of this project offered unique challenges. At the onset, we needed to develop a shared vision for The Accountability Project among our team, mapping out an ambitious but manageable path for what we could realistically build with our resources and timeline. This involved identifying parts of our original plan that weren’t reasonable (e.g. how much data we could reasonably wrangle), managing our own expectations, and creating a clear plan for the specific datasets we wanted to make available and searchable in our database.
Our main challenge going forward is getting folks using the site regularly and using it as a resource for accountability stories. We’re thinking of new opportunities and partnerships that could help expose more journalists to The Accountability Project and establish it as a go-to tool for reporters. 
At the same time, we plan to add new features to the site, including geographical searches and the ability for users to run their own data against what is on the site. We’re also planning to conduct more user experience research to get a better understanding of how people use the site and how we can improve its functionality.","We learned a lot through this process. For anyone else looking to take on similar projects and build new resources and tools for journalists, we have a few points of advice.
• Research what else is available. What does your project do that is unique? Find people and organizations that you can partner with instead of recreating the wheel.
• Understand and communicate your shared vision from the outset. We had several key personnel changes with our project, so maintaining consistency and making sure everyone had the same idea of what to expect was challenging.
• Set agreed-upon standards and structures to keep everyone’s work consistent with the end goal of the project.
• Plan for the long, long term. If you want your project to live for a long time, make sure you have a sustainability plan to keep it going. It likely will take longer than you anticipate to launch. We’ve watched plenty of well-intentioned search projects die a slow death from lack of funding because it’s hard to find long-term support. We’re working to lower our operating costs, but also taking steps to make sure the data we’ve gathered helps others.",English,https://www.publicaccountability.org/,https://publicaccountability.org/about/stories/,,,,,,,"Project team: Jacob Fenton, developer; Jennifer LaFleur, project manager and data editor; Megan Gayle Crigger, designer; Cole Goins, engagement lead; Kiernan Nicholls, Dariya Tsyrenzhapova and Yanqi Xu, data reporters.

This project is an interactive exploration of the players from the Negro Leagues. The piece displays characteristics and skills from all NLB players and provides contextual comparisons to modern/active MLB players to help readers learn about them.","With the inclusion of Negro League statistics in the overall statistical world of Major League Baseball, we wanted to tell the stories of these players and their impact on the game. The goal was to put them in context of the players MLB has long-touted and help readers understand that they should have known these incredible Black players all along. We wanted to give these statistics to our stats-minded audience but also make sure that the players were understood as more than just their statistics. This piece was featured far and wide including across ABC News properties, ESPN, The Ringer and NPR.","We utilized both Excel and R for analysis of the data. Design for the interactive was done in Sketch and we used HTML, CSS, Javascript and D3.js to build the page.","After the announcement of MLB's decision to add NLB players to the official stats, we immediately began to develop a new metric to contextualize this data for the modern baseball fan.

Square meters that are too expensive, because according to the rental law rooms belong to the social rental sector. A points system has been designed for this, which determines the maximum rent.
Argos built a scraper. We analyzed all rooms on Kamernet, the largest provider in the Netherlands. Many landlords appear to be flouting the law. We discovered that 8 of 10 rooms are (much) too expansive.","This story has been picked up by more 100 news outlets in The Netherlands. Not only did almost every major newspaper and news website publish the news, but because the results were presented per city, many local media have written their own story from it.

RTL News, one of the largest broadcasters in The Netherlands, broadcasted a TV item on their 18.00 hours news program.

A tv documentary has also been made from it

Parliamentary questions have been asked to the minister of Home Affairs.

We made an English translation of our project, we will send this to your organisation via e-mail tomorrow. In case you have any question, you can e-mail us at r.tromp@vpro.nl","The method I have chosen is to scrape all rental ads in the period from September 1 to October 11 from the largest room provider in the Netherlands: Kamernet. And then calculate the legal price of these rooms using the points system and compare it with the asking price.

For the scraper I have used the Scrapy framework and for the calculation I wrote a script in in python. 
For visualisation, Flourish has been used.
Git and Github for version control and collaboration.
Code editor: Spyder.","The hardest part of this project was the combination of pure computer programming together with making a story for radio, tv and the website. Calculating the prices for each room was based on a fysical policy book that I have made computational, with many exceptions. For coders: that means a hell lot of 'if, else statements'... But pure the numbers on itself don't give a good story. Next to it, cases had to be found. Flesh and blood. So apart from coding I went to housing protests to record audio and find persons who were weighed down by the abuses on the housing market.

I think this story should be selected because it combinates hard numbers based on data together with intimate stories of common people who face the intimidation that can be caused by the lack of control on the Dutch housing market.","That evidence to proof large failures of the system can be hidden in data that is out in the open, if you ask the right questions. Protest against high rents were already ongoing in the Netherlands, but no other journalist had the idea to proof that this was even against the Dutch law.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Participant,,Forecasting the German election,14/07/21,"Video, Map, Elections, Politics","D3.js, R, Stan","We built an election forecasting model to assess the uncertainty in political polling and project the outcome of Germany’s parliamentary election, and followed the election through to its ultimate result.","The model helped us frame the election and put its swings and surges in context. Our readers could follow not only the polls but also how they were likely to change as the election neared, and get a preview of the inevitable coalition discussions that followed the vote.

Germany’s multi-party system is complex, and the model was able to cut through some of its complexity. It could reveal, for example, which parties were likely to gain or lose at others’ expense. In this way, it helped inform the rest of our coverage, giving our reporters a real-time sense of how the dynamics of the election changed as the campaign progressed.","The election model is a dynamic Bayesian polling model which combines economic and political “fundamentals” with polling data to assess the strength of each party and predict election results. The model was trained on elections from 1953 to 2017 and programmed in the R and Stan programming languages. We ran the model every day to incorporate new polling data as they came out. 

The model used past election results to come up with a Bayesian “prior” of how the election may turn out. These predictions were not only point-predictions; The Economist’s data team tries to pay extra attention to uncertainty, so we allowed the model to have fat tails and explore many more outcomes than traditional handicapping allows. The model also used various techniques from machine learning and optimisation-based data science to calibrate our polling averages such that they were neither over- nor under-fit to the historical polling data; we did not want to give a false impression of movement just to drive clicks to the site.

We used D3 and Svelte to generate the charts, and used a workflow with Google Docs and ArchieML to keep the text of the interactives easy for our journalists to edit.

We pioneered a new chart type (for The Economist, at least) for these data, including our “fuzzy bars”, which serve the function of a histogram but in a fraction of the space. We’re expecting to reuse this in other forecasting models.

In a first for the Economist, we published the forecast page in both English and German.","From a design perspective, correctly communicating the uncertainty in the model was key—historically, readers often read too much into prediction models and we wanted to take pains to correct that. The fuzzy bars mentioned above let us show a range of probabilities without putting too much emphasis on a central prediction that readers might take as an emphatic projection. We also refrained from giving exact probabilities for various outcomes, instead giving vaguer, but still accurate, estimates like “about a one in three chance”, that were less likely to be over-interpreted.","Predictive models can add to and deepen readers’ and journalists’ understanding of an election, so long as care is taken to ensure they don’t give the impression of overconfidence. Embedding models and data analysis into reporting teams results in better coverage of data-heavy topics like elections, and results in better data-led interactives and graphics.","English, German",https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/wer-kommt-nach-angela-merkel?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/german-election-results-2021?fsrc=core-app-economist,,,,,,"G.

Polarizing content is favored, micro-targeting makes it possible to send messages to categories of the population, and party spending has exploded, particularly so in our country Belgium. 
Our project is based on data from the Facebook ads library and on crowdsourced data from users. We have treated the data in a way that allows the public to understand the issues at stake, and to tell a story based on numerous sources, including top politicians. Additionally, a newsgame allows the reader to put him/herself in the shoes of a political community manager.","When the size of political spending on Facebook was revealed, compared to other EU countries, thanks to the work of the Ad-Lens collective which we are a part of, it created a bit of a shock, and an important debate has taken place in Belgium, mostly on social media. The political parties involved are avoiding the debate, because they have an interest in the status quo. However, a hearing was organized in the national parliament on the issue.","Most and foremost, with the help of the Ad-Lens collective, we have worked on data from the Facebook Ads Library 
* analysis of the amounts spent by politicians on political ads on Facebook, both at Belgian and European level from August 2019 until the end of October 2021.
* Collection and sorting of thousands of spending data
* Qualitative analysis of the biggest campaigns run by Belgian parties (at party level but also at the level of political figures)
* Highlighting of gender targeting and gender bias of the algorithms

Since the library does not allow to obtain information on targeting, we have launched an open survey, which resulted in nearly 80 detailed responses from the public. Those allowed us to understand some of the targeting used by parties, especially those that they would relunctantly admit they were using.
We have also published the full details of a standard questionnaire that was send to political parties, so as to allow the public to read the answers in full, as well as the written answers from Facebook.
An important part of this work was the creation of a newsgame : on the Medor website, the reader was offered a scenario in which he/she could work as the community manager of a political party, and explore, from the inside, the reasons that pushed political parties to spend so much in Facebook ads.","The amount of data made available on the Facebook ads library was a bit daunting, especially as we had to compare political spending all across Europe to confirm our intuition that Belgium was leading the way. So there was a lot of time invested in gathering, sorting, checking the data, and also to publish it in a way that would make most sense for the public debate. Admittedly, datavisualization in our article is mainly just charts, but we believe they tell an important story.","What we are most proud to have achieved is to get a story based on a large amount of data that is also highly readable. Our intention was never to show off with the most beautiful charts (altough we are applying here now), but to expose a problematic trend for the public debate, in a way that is understandable and enjoyable to read.",French,https://medor.coop/magazines/medor-n25-hiver-2021-2022/les-ecuries-du-like-facebook-granularite-ciblage-politique-elections-propagande-tiktok-democratie-dsa/,https://medor.coop/nos-coups/facebook-les-politiques-a-fond-sur-la-pub-ciblage/toi-aussi-gere-la-page-facebook-dun-parti-belge-hedebouw-ptb-bouchez-mr-politique-facebook-tiktok-genre-democratie/,https://medor.coop/nos-coups/facebook-les-politiques-a-fond-sur-la-pub-ciblage/questionnaire-pourquoi-et-comment-les-politiques-belges-nous-ciblent-sur-facebook-granularite/,,,,,,"Jehanne Berge, Guillaume Derclaye, Eric Walravens","The Ad-Lens collective, which we are a part of, was created in order to gather data on online political party spending.

Malta,"The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, The Guardian, Dossier Center, The Shift News, Times of Malta, The Malta Independent, Malta Today, Lovin Malta",Big,Participant,,Passport Papers - a joint investigation into the sale of passports as a legalised transaction,21/04/21,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Politics, Business, passport sales","Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Node.js, Kubernetes","The investigation into the sale of passports as a legalised transaction exposes what happens when applicants attempt to purchase their way into EU citizenship through Malta’s passport sales scheme:
• the ‘genuine links’ requirement (a physical residency workaround) is a box-ticking exercise;
• the residency loophole enables buyers to obtain citizenship without spending any significant time in the country;
• applicants are typically from particular jurisdictions and categories and include an MP,
oligarchs, royalty, and fugitives;
• select applicants received special treatment, including privileged access to former PM Joseph Muscat;
• Henley & Partners had written agreements with Cambridge Analytica and its CEO, Alexander Nix.","The Passport Papers showed that the sale of citizenship has a real and direct impact on
European states and their citizens. The story was picked up by mainstream news media and specialist media across the US, Europe, and Asia. It prompted a reaction by an EC spokesperson (“EU values are not for sale...granting EU citizenship without a genuine link violates EU law”), and fed into the EP plenary debate on the rule of law in Malta (“Parliament is deeply concerned about the harmful impact of citizenship and residence schemes on the integrity of EU citizenship, and reiterates its call on the Maltese government to assure transparency and terminate its schemes”), leading to EP resolution 2021/2611(RSP) calling “on the Maltese authorities to assure transparency and terminate its investor citizenship and residence schemes rather than modify them.”

In Malta, the Passport Papers provoked a defensive reaction from the government and public outrage on social media. Aditus, an NGO that assists undocumented migrants and asylum seekers, said the “The exposé on the ""genuine link"" requirement and how this is established, flies in the face of the difficulties faced by non-Maltese who apply for citizenship by naturalization.” Repubblika, a rule of law NGO, issued a 43- page position paper calling for the passport sales scheme to be scrapped, and for wide-ranging reforms in the administration of citizenship.

Henley&Partners responded with legal letters accusing the Foundation of retaining “stolen data” in a “criminal database” and - unsuccessfully - demanding its deletion.

The Passport Papers investigation is ongoing.","The large amount of core data needed collaborative investigation. To make it available to all partners, we used Aleph, an application created by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). We run Aleph on Kubernetes, a Google technology that allows us to scale according to demand. We invested in new hardware as Aleph needs more power than an average desktop computer can provide. This helps avoid the high cost of cloud hosting, allowing us to spend more on actual journalism.

Using Python, we developed improvements to Aleph and submitted them to the Aleph project (they were accepted). We scraped the Malta company registry using a program we built with Node.js. We added the scraped data (stored in JSON format) and the company documents in PDF to our core data in Aleph. To exchange tabular data, we used CSV.

The Foundation team analysed how the passport application process worked chronologically, from when applicants began their relationship with Henley & Partners to submission of their citizenship applications to Identity Malta. We started the investigation from scratch, reviewing every application, letting the data drive potential leads and used Google Sheets to log and analyse key data items on a collaborative spreadsheet: nationality, residency agreements, proof of a criminal record check and any police reports, residency data, properties applicants rented or purchased in Malta, how much they had paid and any interest (or lack thereof) they showed in visiting their property. Our main research question was what “genuine links” applicants had to Malta.

Our team then extracted the data on significant applicants and any notable trends to share with our investigative partners in our collaborative forum. The forum quickly filled with documents, links to data, email chains, business registries, and investigative leads, as journalists pieced together the stories that became the Passport Papers.","The challenges the Foundation faced were immense. The whistleblower who provided the core data we investigated first came to Daphne Caruana Galizia years ago, when she was the only journalist in Malta whom people like Sonja - the pseudonym we gave the whistleblower - felt they could trust.

Tracking Sonja down again in the months after Daphne's assassination was difficult. Daphne’s family knew of Sonja's existence, but had no name and no contact details. When they finally resurfaced, they were willing to share evidence that, according to them, Malta’s passports-for-cash scheme, created and managed by Henley & Partners in partnership with former prime minister Joseph Muscat, is replete with problems.

The investigation into the data and documents provided by the whistleblower was delayed first by the pressures of Daphne's murder investigation, which is still ongoing, then by the cost of what the Foundation knew would be months of research into the scheme.

In 2020 the Foundation received a round of funding from Digital Defenders, a TK-based organisation. That went into the IT infrastructure that the Foundation needed to process the data provided by the whistleblower. The funders knew little about the material to which the Foundation had access: only that the Foundation was committed to setting up the Malta Investigative Journalism Centre to drive collaborative investigations involving all independent media organisations in Malta. A second round of funding, from IJ4EU, enabled the Foundation's core team to spend four months focussed on investigating the data.","Tech tools and automation facilitate data processing but the human element remains essential. Manually sifting through the data was crucial to understanding the passport application process and to identifying significant details that would have been missed by automated processing.

Small, dedicated teams with limited resources can produce high quality investigative journalism with significant impact. 

Collaboration among competition is possible. The Passport Papers was the first time Malta’s independent newsrooms collaborated on an investigative journalism project.

Tech expertise is an essential component of a project core team. Having a project leader trained in journalism and technology smoothed the Passport Papers work flow in the build-up to the publication launch, and proved critical in the final hours.

Portugal went to the polls in September to elect 308 mayors. At Público we wanted to answer a simple question: is it possible to have a future here? We used data to find the municipality that was more affected by these issues - even though they were simply representative of a national problem. Then, a team of reporters went to these places to understand the local reality, and how it is affecting people's lives. And what the different candidates were proposing to solve it?","The three articles all began with a close-up on the data available in Portugal, highlighting the region of the country that has a deeper problem - and thus begins the reporting there. We decided that using scrollytelling we were able to write a “story before the story” - explaining that the issue is being felt all over the country, but that some regions are being affected way more than others. Every piece also included a small news app that allowed people to explore the data to their local municipality, showing them how close the place they live is similar to that place.

That was the most praised thing by our readers: suddenly, a local story became way more interesting to the whole country because 1) we were showing that the country, as a whole, was being affected by it and 2) that the place where the reader had the same problem, but probably in a smaller scale.","For the data, we used R to collect and analyze the data and do some quick charts to discuss with the team why that specific municipality was the one being chosen. This programming language was also used to publish that data into JSON files that were used on the data visualizations We then used flourish and some custom data visualizations to develop the scroller and the custom news applications inside the stories. The web development was done by the data journalist in charge of all three stories and it was built using archieml to parse the text from the Google Docs where the reporters were writing the stories and Svelte.","Finding the municipality was the most changeling thing about it because it meant scrapping, searching, and often doing the good old call to a lot of public institutions to find the right place where reporters would be doing some ground reporting. It was also a challenge coordinating a team with so many reporters.","When faced with so many potential stories, pick the outlier that you believe is representative of the population. It is a task that we, data journalists, tend to find hard: because numbers seem more robust when they describe a trend with multiple data points. And even though that is important, it’s always way more efficient to pick a specific data point and explain to your reader: even though this happens in way more places, we picked the place where the problem affects way more people/lives.

Brazil,Agência Pública,Small,Shortlist,,Brazil has twice as many white people vaccinated as black people,15/03/21,"Investigation, Database, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Health, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, R Studio","Agência Pública analyzed data from more than 8.5 million people that had been vaccinated in Brazil up to that moment and found out that the number of white people that had gotten the vaccine was double that of black people. This inequality remained when looking at the vaccination rate inside each ethnic group: less than 2 out of 100 black people had received their first covid shot, while more than 3 out of 100 white people had gotten their first jab. At the same time, data revealed that proportionally there were 10% more deaths from Covid-19 among black people.","After the article was published, our team was invited to present the report at a meeting of the National Health Council that discussed Brazil's vaccination plans. Afterward, the National Health Council published a document calling for the adoption of anti-racist actions regarding access to health care by the Ministry of Health, state and municipal health secretariats and councils.

The article was among the finalists for the 2021 Brazilian Conference on Data Journalism, Coda Awards. It was also republished by 33 websites and media outlets, in Portuguese and Spanish. Moreover, we have registered through the BuzzSumo platform more than 90 citations and backlinks of the story in national and international websites and media organizations, including The World, Newsweek and RTP (Rádio e Televisão de Portugal).","Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome data and data from the National Vaccination Campaign against Covid-19 were exported from the OpenDataSUS website (government platform for data regarding public health) on 22 February and 15 March, respectively. We filtered the SARS data classified as Covid-19-related and counted the notifications, ICU admissions, and deaths of patients who declared their color/race as white, parda (brown), or preta (black) - the last two were added together as negra (black) in the analyses, in accordance with the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics' (IBGE) convention. The script used for the data cleansing, the clean data and the analysis were included in the report. The vaccination database was initially filtered by the field describing which dose had been administered. We only analyzed the data for the 1st dose. Next, we checked the numbers of vaccinated people according to race/color, age and priority groups. The conducted analyzes are described in the article's methodology section.","Dealing with a database that had more than 10 million entries demanded a lot of work and time. It was also difficult to establish methodological criteria for filtering and cleaning the base in order to avoid errors due to possible problems in the filling of the data. The lack of government support to answer our questions was also another obstacle. The project should be selected for having circumvented all these challenges and still having revealed unprecedented information in a country of continental proportions such as Brazil, as well as of great relevance to millions of people in the midst of the largest pandemic ever experienced in the country. The report served as a warning on the impacts of structural racism in Brazil at a time of apparent equality in vaccine distribution and it even reached the highest instances responsible for analyzing the vaccination campaign.","Other journalists can access, replicate, and redo all the steps of our report, since we have published the complete methodology and the databases we used, including databases that are no longer available in public platforms due to the federal government's lack of transparency. The piece can serve as a reference for more journalists to investigate health data and reveal structural inequalities in Brazil and in other countries which have a direct impact on peoples' lives.

Pressed flowers are shown throughout to represent lives lost.","Every day from April 2020 to May 2021, the Texas Tribune’s data visuals team published a coronavirus case tracker. As the numbers grew, we realized we were feeling numb to the scale of the tragedy. This project about the people who died was an effort to bring humanity back into those statistics. After publishing this, we heard from readers who had lost a relative to coronavirus — they deeply appreciated how much care we took in telling this story. This is the best feedback we’ve ever received on a project, and we believe it’s because the story came from a place of deep empathy for its subjects.","People have a hard time understanding very large numbers. Our brains can’t quite process the scope and magnitude of a mass casualty event like the slow-motion pandemic that we have lived through. As the Tribune’s five-person data visuals team updated our case tracker data each day, we also felt that we were becoming numb to the scale of the tragedy, even though many of the Texans who died are our neighbors and friends. We told this story to try to bring humanity back into those statistics. The design is innovative — we used a statistical formula to spread pressed flowers out proportionally based on the number of people who died each week. A greater abundance of flowers represents a period where more people died. Flowers are a symbol of mourning, and at the moments in the story where the flowers are thickest, more Texans were mourning their loved ones.","The reporting for this story was fairly straightforward — we gathered this data from the state every day for over a year, and the narrative is built around stories that our colleagues told along the way. We did have to overcome great obstacles in visualizing the data and designing the story. We did not want the visualization to trivialize the lives of those who died or cause trauma to their loved ones. They were people, not statistics. Once we chose a pressed flower motif, we had to solve the technical puzzle of how to add more than 2,300 images of flowers to the page and still have it load on phones. Above all, we sought to tell a story with empathy and poignancy.","Early collaboration between data reporters, designers and editors is key to telling a story like this fairly and empathetically. Sometimes the simplest approach is best, but this project is also deceptively simple — the technical lift to make it load seamlessly took a lot of effort from our team.

We decided to create a unique 3D project to explain the results to our readers who would check the news in the morning.,"Many readers wrote to us saying how much they enjoyed their experience. It's difficult to propose something different than usual for topics that keep recurring. Some expectations need to be fulfilled, especially for events of importance like elections. For these projects, the space to innovate is narrow. But based on the readers' feedback, we succeeded in presenting electoral results on a map in a new and engaging manner with this project.","To analyze the electoral results, I coded a R notebook. For the 3D map, I used the JavaScript library ThreeJS.","First, I needed to code as much as possible in advance in a general and flexible manner to focus on content and writing during election night. And it is always a challenge to do so because you don’t know what the results will be! For example, I coded an R notebook in advance with fake data. I was able to run this notebook during the night with actual results to guide me through my writing. Performance-wise, there were many considerations for the data visualization. We knew that most of our readers would read the story on their mobile phones after waking up. For older phones with weaker graphic cards, I disabled some options (shadows, for example) to ensure the best performance. On the design and content side, transforming the geographical data of electoral districts into 3D polygons in JavaScript and finding ways for the readers to interact with them were also interesting challenges. Lastly, election night was a very long work day (from 3 pm to 7 am the following day). But it was necessary to publish this innovative project before the readers started their day.","In many countries, some electoral districts are huge while others are very small. I scale them to the same size in this project to count how many were won by each party. I think it's an interesting approach, a little bit similar to cartograms, that could inspire other reporters. I'll be revisiting this approach for sure for the next electoral cycle. I also hope this project will inspire other developers and journalists to play with 3D data visualizations. With JavaScript libraries like ThreeJS, it's possible to create very engaging experiences for the readers, even in augmented and virtual reality. Many rules need to be written for 3D data visualization since it's an emerging field, but it's imperative to experiment. A big part of our digital lives will be in 3D in the near future, and journalism needs to be ready for it.","English, French",https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2021/elections-federales/resultats-cartes-vainqueur-perdant-partis-circonscriptions/en,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2021/elections-federales/resultats-cartes-vainqueur-perdant-partis-circonscriptions/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/codesource/code-ouvert/2021/elections/resultats/analysis.nb.html,,,,,,"Nael Shiab, Melanie Julien, Francis Lamontagne, Mathieu St-Laurent, Martine Roy",Nael Shiab is a data journalist for CBC/Radio-Canada.

- Several state lawmakers shared it, noting how helpful it was
- A Reddit reader thanked us for all the work we've done on this topic","Redistricting is a story about data — legislators use detailed census counts to draw maps with surgical precision. Here’s how the Tribune built a data analysis process to support our work. 
First, data reporters, editors and reporters developed a framework to evaluate each proposed map when it came out. To save time, we set up a Klaxon bot to alert us when a new map was released for analysis. We built a parser in Python to get the state’s strangely formatted files into a more legible format. This means we could get data into user-friendly, easy-to-compare spreadsheets for reporters within minutes, and use these files to answer their questions on how the districts changed over time. All this work enabled us to write fast, analysis-packed stories like this one as soon as the new maps were released.
All this led to our district lookup page. This is a very reader-focused tool: We assume almost no one knows their state House, Senate or congressional district numbers, but everyone knows their address. The tool is powered by an address-to-district conversion API that we previously used for election results pages. The lookup also has all of the demographic data that we analyzed earlier — in simple HTML charts, because not all geographic data needs to be mapped. The maps in the project were created with Mapbox.",The hardest part of this project was the deadline — the Legislature compressed the normally five-month-long map-drawing process into a one-month special session. We also worked with Mapbox to adapt our maps to work within the technical constraints of their static map API and make sure the page worked seamlessly on mobile.,"This page was designed first and foremost for average Texans, people who will vote in a dramatically different political landscape for the next decade. We used technology to make it easy for them to find the information that they need. Every state should have a resource like this, and we welcome copycats. With permission, encouragement and advice, SpotlightPA published a very similar redistricting comparison tool for Pennsylvania’s new legislative districts a few months after ours came out. 
The entire redistricting project required very careful planning and coordination across teams. We worked with politics editors and reporters to plan every part of this project, from the original analysis questions to the final presentation. Our audience team was invaluable for sharing the resource far and wide, and our engineering team helped debug the more technical aspects of the lookup page.

Romania,Panorama.ro,Small,Participant,,How much the din the pandemic cost us,05/08/21,"Explainer, Database, Infographics, Chart, Economy","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, flourish.studio","Paradoxically, the costs of the global medical system fell during the Covid period: the redistribution of funds to counteract the pandemic and the reluctance of people to go to the hospital for other medical conditions meant less money spent in hospitals.

However, the real costs of this phenomenon will be seen in the coming years, health experts point out. Then all the undiagnosed conditions due to the pandemic will suffocate the medical system. 
The article aims to map out the medical budgets of every EU member state by the source of origin and destination and explain the situation on a national level.","Analyzing and combining the country level data and representing it in one single chart helps us understand that:

There are huge differences in allocations between European countries. In absolute terms, Germany has advanced the highest funds to fight the pandemic (34.6 billion euros). At the other end of the spectrum is Croatia, which has officially allocated an additional € 53 million.


The highest additional per capita allocations was in Austria (EUR 3,111 per capita) and the lowest in Croatia (EUR 12.5 per capita).


Austria also ranks first if we interpret the additional allocations as a percentage of the usual health budget, with 70%. At the bottom of the rankings, France increased its budget by only 0.75% of its pre-pandemic budget. However, Paris plans to invest heavily in the health care system, but so far the allocations have not been included in the 2020 and 2021 budget years, so they cannot be taken into account in this analysis.


Romania and Bulgaria are the last countries in the additional per capita allocations, with 42 and 33 euros, respectively. The same two countries are among the ""leaders"" in the mortality rate among patients infected with Covid-19, being surpassed only by Italy, where the pandemic profile was atypical compared to the rest of Europe in the context of the aging population.","Technologies: Microsoft Excel, Flourish.studio, Affinity Designer","The only preliminary centralization of pandemic spending in the EU has been achieved through a joint effort by the European Health Observatory, the European Commission, and the European Representation of the World Health Organization. It is by no means exhaustive. In addition, many public contracts have been signed on their own account by local public authorities or institutions with specific activities.

For the time being, in order to have a unit of measurement in relation to the other EU member states, Panorama reviewed the additional allocations from the state budgets to combat the Covid-19 pandemic and lists the main acquisitions financed in this way.

To understand these expenditures, we have collected additional allocations since the outbreak of the pandemic (2020 in full and partial data available for 2021). However, these absolute values do not provide a clear x-ray of the amounts spent by governments to cover the medical costs of the pandemic: we cannot compare allocations in a country with 80 million inhabitants and trillion-euro GDP (such as Germany) with systematically underfunded budgets from poorer EU countries (where Romania also falls).

So we interpreted these absolute values based on a few fixed benchmarks. First: how much was the additional per capita allocation in each European state.

We then calculated the amount of these additional allocations from the health budget before the pandemic broke out. The benchmark for this criterion is 2018 - the most recent year for which we have final official statistics from Eurostat, which also include subsequent budget corrections at the EU level.","This data cannot be interpreted without context. 

We looked at the statistics by which the extent of the pandemic in each country can be measured: the number of cases confirmed by Covid-19, the mortality rate among those infected, the total number of tests settled by each state, and the vaccination rate. of the population.",Romanian,https://panorama.ro/cat-ne-a-costat-pandemia/,,,,,,,,"Elena Dumitru, Edit Gyenge","Elena Dumitru has been working as a journalist for 11 years and has covered two major fields: economic journalism and investigative journalism.

The initiative is part of Agência Pública's commitment to the pursuit of transparency and accountability of all branches of government and public authorities. The tool also features the requests sorted by topic. Bolsonaro's poor handling of the health crisis during the pandemic and the government's delay in buying the covid-19 vaccines are among the most recurrent topics.","Agência Pública has been monitoring all impeachment requests filed with the Chamber of Deputies and making them publicly accessible on the tool. Although the project was created in the second semester of 2020, most of its content is from 2021, when there were 82 new requests. By gathering these documents in a single platform, we promote transparency, making it easy for any citizen to have direct access to the information. We also translate legal terms into less formal language in the abstracts of each request and publish interviews with the plaintiffs.The impeachment tool is a pioneering initiative, both in the field of journalism and public transparency. It is an important historical record, serving as a data source for journalists and researchers. Through the BuzzSumo platform, we have so far registered more than 140 citations or backlinks to the tool in national and international websites, such as Reporters sans frontières, and major media outlets such as the New York Times, Bloomberg and Foreign Policy. The tool was also cited in ""How to remove a president: Theory, history, and practice of impeachment in Brazil"", a book by researcher and professor at the University of São Paulo Rafael Mafei. With this project, we were able to determine that Bolsonaro is the president who has accumulated the most impeachment requests in Brazil's history - already more than 140 requests. We were also able to analyze the range of accusations on which the petitions are based. More than 1550 people and more than 500 organizations have signed the petitions. Agência Pública's impeachment tool is also an instrument of citizenship. Using the tool, our readers have already sent 16.697 emails demanding a follow-up to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, who has so far ignored the documents.","The Access to Information Law (LAI), Brazil's equivalent to the Freedom of Information Act, is one of the main tools used for this project. It is this instrument that allows our team to access the full impeachment requests filed with the Chamber of Deputies. To simplify the access to the content, the impeachment tool was built in microsite format, where the impeachment requests are sorted by number and by topics. There is also an interactive menu that can direct the reader to different sections with explanations about the impeachment process in Brazil, the role of the institutions involved, impeachable offenses, history of impeachment requests and processes in other governments, and information on how our team keeps count of the impeachment requests. In addition, through the platform it is possible to send an email to the Chamber of Deputies (Brazil's House of Representatives), demanding follow-up on the impeachment proposals.","Keeping the tool always up to date is certainly the biggest challenge of this project. It is an effort we've been undertaking for almost two years now, with a team dedicated to searching, reading, and summarizing all impeachment petitions that reach the House of Representatives. Weekly updates are made, both via LAI and by monitoring the media for new announcements of requests. Our team often has to resort to investigative tools to locate request authors, as contact information is not provided by the House of Representatives and there are many requests that were filled by ordinary citizens. This is, therefore, a pioneering project that involves many fronts, such as data, transparency, journalistic investigation, and historical record.","As we've mentioned earlier, this tool is an important data source that has been used by journalists, both from Agência Pública and other media organizations. It is a platform designed to supply the general public with data and information in a way that is easier to access. We believe that, as a journalistic initiative, this project provides a good example of how to work with data and use the Access to Information Act (LAI), as well as the importance of journalism for historic record and collective memory.

We believe that this level of personalization was the key to its success. The article received more than 800 interactions on Facebook and was shared by pages like the Lisbon Tenants Association, meaning that people being affected by the problem were able to understand it better.

This toxic synergy was the object of an unprecedented data analysis carried out by a multidisciplinary team of journalists, geographers, statisticians and scientists. We analysed satellite data to determine which locations were most affected by air pollution during the 2020 wildfires and how it impacted the health of amazonians. Smoke was related to an 18% increase in severe cases of Covid and 24% increase in hospitalizations for respiratory syndromes in the 5 most affected states.","The relevance of this project is to show the relationship between two seemingly disconnected events (fire and Covid), highlighting how environmental and public health issues are closely linked.

The data reveals how the pollution from the Amazon fires has a perverse effect on the population that is explained by a specific geography of fire - the most affected municipalities, in different states, indicate the expansion of the arc of deforestation. 

Through extensive data analysis, the project was able to quantify the impact of fire-attributable pollution on the worsening of Covid cases, providing subsidies both for the reader to understand the gravity of the environmental crisis and for the government to make decisions based on the data. 

The importance of a project like this in 2021 is similar to a large-scale post-mortem examination, bringing evidence and proof of the devastation of the Amazon and how this affects its citizens, even those in urban areas far from where the environmental crimes occur.

To tell the stories that the data was revealing, we assembled a team of local reporters, distributed throughout the most impacted states according to our analysis. 

Five reports were published and  gained nationwide attention, driven also by a publishing partnership with the largest national daily newspaper in Brazil and with the two institutions that were partners in the analyses, the Ufac and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), the federal institution of science and technology. 

The articles were republished in local newspapers and by research institutes that had been a reference for our project. We have participated in several meetings and interviews to talk about the results, an academic article with Fiocruz is being written based on our data, and a technical note from the Acre Public Ministry also refers to our data to stress the importance of monitoring air quality.","As a primarily data-driven journalism project, data investigation was the core and starting point of the project. Given the absence of regional air quality data (no Amazonian city had fixed air quality monitoring stations), we processed satellite information to calculate air pollution in the region, generating open data (accessible and documented) for all municipalities in the Legal Amazon. 

This data was then, through statistical analysis, cross-checked with the respiratory illness hospitalization (SARS) database, and specifically the hospitalization cases classified as Covid-19, and we were able to prove the hypothesis that particulate matter from smoke aggravated Covid cases in the 2020 burning season. 

The work with the data was extensive but can be summarized in two main steps: geoprocessing and statistical modeling. The InfoAmazonia analysis processed the various estimates per day from CAMS to arrive at the daily average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) for all municipalities in the Legal Amazon. 

The statistical model built specially for the analysis tested several scenarios - including wildfires, deforestation alerts, population, and precipitation - and found significance mainly between cumulative pollution and official numbers of hospitalizations for both SARS and Covid-19. 

Most of the code used to download, tidy and analyze the data was written in R, besides QGis and Google Earth Engine for geoprocessing.

Besides this, the main characteristic of the work was to join data with locally told stories. 

To support the stories, a project was developed that combines Editorial Design and Information Design, combining visual impact with data visualization. It helped to tell the story of Inhaling Smoke with interactive graphics, visual effects, colors, and typographical choices that contributed to the reader's immersion in the special.","The hardest part of the project was to work with the satellite data and defining which pollution air databases would most fit our purposes.

The immediate data cross-referencing of Covid cases and fire hotspots soon showed that the relationship with health was not the fire itself, but the pollution that it generates. We then looked at air quality datasets and realized there were a multitude of variables and models, and that it required a lot of processing to get the data we needed to analyze the impact of fires on human health. 

An initial survey, through interviews with experts, scientists consulting and documentation of academic studies, was done to identify the key air pollution datasets that would be of interest to the project. At this stage, we understood that fine Particulate Matter (PM 2.5, up to 2.5 micrometers in diameter) would be the main variable to be.

Still at this stage, we also understood that PM 2.5 cannot be observed directly from satellites, and therefore there is a need to translate it from the observed Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). This can be done in several ways and with different models. A series of comparative tests were done with the main datasets (as explained in this documentation), and we decided to use the near real time estimates of CAMS-NRT, from the European Centre for Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). This remote sensing data processed by the InfoAmazonia team was validated with the data measured on the ground by air pollution sensors in Acre.

Working with Covid-19 data was also not easy, because we were working with data from a pandemic still ongoing, so a totally dynamic knowledge about the disease, in addition to the high underreporting of Covid-19 cases (43% of SARS admissions had undefined causes).","Knowing the health impact of air pollution related to fires gives you important knowledge to tell stories of the deforestation fires that affect not only the rural area where the fires are emitted but also the urban population hundreds kilometers away, helping to show the public, and possibly decision-makers, how the environmental and public health issues are closely related.

The difficulty of obtaining regional data on air pollution (none of the Brazilian Amazonian cities have permanent monitoring stations, for instance) can be overcome using global satellite images which, despite showing the plumes of pollution from burning and providing a good research alternative, do not allow for detailed analysis at the more local level. 

For the stories we're telling it is then interesting to confront the data observed through remote sensing with more granular information that reflects local complexity and helps to validate the results obtained in numbers with real stories. In addition to the local population affected by the problem, it is important to listen to local health authorities, doctors, and frontline professionals who can tell us if what we observed from space was really felt on the ground.","English, Portuguese",https://infoamazonia.org/project/engolindo-fumaca/,https://infoamazonia.org/en/project/inhaling-smoke/,https://infoamazonia.org/en/2021/08/23/invisible-enemies-smoke-from-burnings-worsens-covid-19-in-the-amazon/,https://infoamazonia.org/en/2021/08/23/the-victims-of-the-geography-of-fire/,https://infoamazonia.org/en/2021/08/23/social-and-environmental-crises-come-together-in-mato-grosso-in-a-year-of-record-burning-in-the-pantanal/,,,,"Juliana Mori, Renata Hirota, Eduardo Geraque, Felipe Barros, Sonaira Silva, Tatiane Moraes, Guilherme Guerreiro Neto, Juliana Arini, Leandro Chaves, Camilo Estevam, Rebeca Navarro, Lucas Lobo, Leandro Amorim, André Hanauer, Erlan De Almeida Carvalho, Erico Rosa, Guilherme Lobo, Robson Klein Ramon Aquim, Dell Pinheiro, Laiza Lopes, Laura Sanchez, Tony Gross","Juliana Mori is a journalist specialized in audiovisual productions and visualization of geospatial data.

Are these contracts legal? Police agreements with private companies are legal as an organic law states that the institution can provide ""rented services of a particular nature."" Yet a recent ruling recognizes that these contracts can be perceived as a loss of objectivity"", and indicates that the Police should only provide security to companies that demonstrate that they cannot obtain that service from private security companies.","The Minister of Interior, Avelino Guillén, acknowledged the findings of this investigation and said that he would evaluate the information with his advisory cabinet. 

This is the first time a journalistic investigation in Peru has looked into the relationship between large mining and oil companies and the Peruvian Police. The findings of this report have shown that the Peruvian Police might have a biased behavior during social conflicts in mining regions, instead of providing protection to local communities.","The Minister of Interior, Avelino Guillén, acknowledged the findings of this investigation and said that he would evaluate the information with his advisory cabinet. 

This is the first time a journalistic investigation in Peru has looked into the relationship between large mining and oil companies and the Peruvian Police. The findings of this report have shown that the Peruvian Police might have a biased behavior during social conflicts in mining regions, instead of providing protection to local communities.","Building the database was the hardest part of this project because of the different types of contracts and the non-native PDF scanned files of the information given to us. The differences found were of all kinds, from the description of the contract, the commitments of the signing parties, the amounts and payment periods, among others that resulted in a 75-column data table.

This is an original investigation as it’s the first time that journalism in Peru is addressing a sensitive topic—an analysis of the contracts signed between the National Police and oil and mining companies for the protection of the later—that could show that the security forces of the Peruvian state protect large companies’ operation sites, which it’s detrimental for local communities that protest against bad business practices and environmental pollution. 

The investigation acquired greater relevance thanks to the crossing of the data obtained from the registry of social conflicts from the Ombudsman's Office, which allowed us to identify that during the socio-environmental conflicts, the Peruvian Police signed private security contracts with companies that were protagonists of these conflicts that even resulted in the deaths of protesters from the impact of firearm projectiles.","Journalists from Latin American countries and from other continents–in which their economies depend heavily on investment from extractive industries and where there are levels of complaints about environmental contamination due to these activities– can have in this report an important example on how to verify if their public security forces are actually at the service of these big companies.

As a result of an interview in The Guardian with the Spanish Minister of Consumer Affairs at the beginning of 2022 where he criticized the Spanish model of macro-farms, our work has once again become viral, since different political parties and associations have spread hoaxes and disinformation about the reality of the agriculture and intensive farming in Spain.","This report uses the possibilities of multimedia narration in the form of scrollytelling to weave maps, text, videos, infographics and make the story more understandable from all angles.

United States,The Pudding,Small,Shortlist,,Following the Science,31/03/21,"Explainer, Documentary, Open data, Science Communication","Animation, Scraping, D3.js, Three.js, CSV, Python","The Covid-19 pandemic tossed 2020 into disarray. But while cities and countries around the globe were shutting down, scientists and researchers from nearly every country embarked on an unprecedented effort to study, understand, and contain a virus that no one had ever seen before. By exploring the 90,000+ Covid-related research articles that emerged in 2020, this project celebrated the achievements and effort of the global science and research community, while also providing the public a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the scientific process more generally, and an appreciation for the resources that it requires.","The goal of the project was two-fold: 1) to call attention to the scale and enormity of the collaborative, worldwide research effort to combat the Covid-19 pandemic; and 2) , to emphasize to the public the normal workings of the scientific process and, impart an appreciation for the work that is required and the inevitable uncertainty that ensues along the way. Unlike a project advocating for a particular policy change, for example, it is hard to know whether a project like this has achieved its intended impact or not, particularly with regard to the second goal of promoting greater public awareness of the scientific process.  However, the extent to which this story was picked up and highlighted by science, research, and journalism outlets perhaps offers some indication of its wider impact. Throughout 2020, this project was featured by, among others, The World Federation of Science Journalists, The University of Wisconsin's Scout Report on STEM and humanities, DataJournalism.com's year-end ""12 brilliant data journalism projects of 2021"", and was selected for presentation during the Science Communication panel at the 2021 Information+ Conference.","This primary dataset of Covid-related research articles was obtained from PubMed, the online repository for biomedical and life sciences research articles maintained by the National Institute of Health in the US. Using PubMed's public-facing API, I used Python and Jupyter Notebooks to download metadata on 90,000+ Covid-related research articles that came out in 2021. The libpostal library, in combination with the Google Geolocation API, was used to parse the author information from each article and geolocate to a particular city. In order to map the citation network across key research articles, additional PubMed APIs were used to scrape 2-way citation information (articles cited in current article; subsequent articles citing current article) for each article. 

The website was built using React. The visualizations within the site were built using combinations of Three.js, D3.js, P5.js, Deck.gl, and Greensock Animation library.","The biggest challenge in this project was in figuring out how to take this massive dataset of over 90,000 research articles and present it in a way that would be quickly digestible without abstracting away the individual contributions of all of the participating researchers and scientists. Focusing on the collaborations among researchers emerged as a way to do that. Moreover, featuring these collaborations on a map of the world, and allowing viewers to watch as these collaborations unfold over the course of the year, offered a chance to emphasize the truly global nature of the research community’s response to the pandemic (particularly at a time when most of the rest of the news was focusing on how countries, cities, and businesses were all shutting down). 

However, getting this data presented the biggest technical challenge of the project. Each of the 90,000+ articles included metadata on the author names and affiliations (e.g. a particular department at a particular university). The names and affiliations were returned as unstructured strings, which meant that many hours were spent fine-tuning algorithms to attempt to parse the relevant information from the string. The parsed string was then ultimately used to geolocate each author to a specific city around the world. In the end, this analysis allowed for a novel and compelling look at the global network of scientific collaborators working collectively on the Covid-19 pandemic.","It is my hope that other journalists, particularly science reporters, will see this project and be inspired to include greater emphasis on the scientific process, rather than focusing exclusively on the results, in their own reporting. By definition, science deals with the unknown, and researchers are accustomed to dealing with uncertainty. In contrast, the pandemic has underscored just how poorly the public deals with that same uncertainty, particularly around evolving public safety guidelines as new information about the virus is learned. Part of that, I suspect, has to do with how science is communicated, often presenting results as complete and definitive as opposed to placing the results in the context of ""given what we know now…"".  Recent polls from Pew Research Center show that individuals (Americans, at least) are more likely to trust scientific results when they perceive the process as open and transparent (""Trust and Mistrust in Americans' Views of Scientific Experts."" Pew Research Center, Jan 2019). To improve trust, therefore, we can do a better job of inviting the public into the scientific process through our reporting.",English,https://pudding.cool/2021/03/covid-science/,https://www.jeffmacinnes.com/projects/following-the-science,https://vimeo.com/594730939,,,,,,Jeff MacInnes,"Jeff MacInnes PhD, is a data journalist and visual storyteller based out of Seattle WA (USA).

United States,FiveThirtyEight,Big,Participant,,What Redistricting Looks Like In Every State,09/08/21,"Database, News application, Map, Elections, Politics","D3.js, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python",Our on-going redistricting interactive follows the drawing of district lines that will help shape who holds political power in the U.S. for the next 10 years. The project tracks proposed congressional maps — and whether they might benefit Democrats or Republicans in the 2022 midterms and beyond.,"This project pulls back the curtain on the decennial redistricting process – a process that affects how much of a voice every voter in the U.S. has in our political discourse yet is so sprawling and complex that it verges on opaqueness. By measuring the fairness and competitiveness of every proposed map in every state, as well as how each would change the racial and ethnic makeup of districts, it gives voters a clear, simplified view of how the playing field of U.S. politics is being tilted by the parties.

This project has already received more than 25 million page views – evidence that people are using it to track and understand this crucial part of America’s political system. Moreover, we’ve seen many state and local reporters use the data and maps generated in this project in their own coverage of redistricting.","We used Python to maintain our data pipeline: pulling in data from various sources, analyzing it and exporting it for use online. We used PostGIS, an extension to PostgreSQL, to store and analyze geographic data. The project’s interactivity is built using JavaScript, including the D3 library.","This is a story where both the forest and the trees are important, and there are a lot of trees. Many people are interested only in how the redistricting process will affect the chances that Democrats or Republicans control the U.S. House. But below that topline, nearly every voter in the nation is affected by this process, and we wanted to arm both voters and local reporters with the data and information they need to understand how their part of the political playing field would be changing. Covering this process with both audiences in mind, and designing the tracker to serve everyone, was and is extremely difficult. As local news outlets have disappeared, national news outlets need to find ways to serve local audiences while still telling national stories. We feel like we found a way here.","Sometimes building a tool for your audience is more powerful than telling them a story. We put a lot of effort into building a tool for users that would help them understand the redistricting process – all of it or a particular part of it. Putting that tool in their hands, we’ve seen users tell their own stories with it.

United States,EdWeek Market Brief,Small,Participant,,"Education Companies' Role in Supporting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion",01/12/21,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Business, Education","Adobe Creative Suite, Survey Building and Delivery Tools","EdWeek Market Brief is a business publication that covers the education market and the universe of companies doing business in schools. In December of 2021, we published a special report titled ""What's the Role of Education Companies in Supporting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion?"" The report seeks to help education companies in the U.S. and internationally understand what school districts need from them in promoting racial/ethnic inclusivity efforts -- a huge area of interest within school communities.","This project offers a first-of-its kind, research-based roadmap for private companies operating in the multi-billion dollar education marketplace to change their products and behavior so that they better reflect the racially and ethnically diverse student populations and school communities they serve.

Over the past year and a half, many of the United States' school districts have rethought their policies and practices on race and equity, in an effort to respond to the demands from parents and communities. Much has been written about these efforts. In this special report, EdWeek Market Brief broke new ground by looking at diversity, equity, and inclusion from a completely different perspective: We examined the critical role that education companies need to play in helping school systems make progress on DEI. The report is based on a nationally representative survey by EdWeek Market Brief of K-12 officials, who were asked about the kinds of specific products and features – and leadership – they expect from businesses delivering curriculum, assessment, professional development, and other essential products. The special report combines deep reporting with original research to provide education businesses with a guide for making the kinds of changes to their products and practices that are often talked about, but rarely brought to the finish line. The report was delivered to EdWeek Market Brief's base of subscribers -- who include some of the biggest education-focused businesses in the world, as well as startups, research institutions and others. It has the potential to shape the work of education companies in the market on DEI for years to come.","The research in the report was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center, which is directed by Holly Kurtz. The core research is based on a nationally representative, online survey of 931 district administrators, school principals, and classroom teachers, conducted in August of 2021. In addition, the report includes the results of two separate surveys of education company officials, conducted in 2020 and 2021, on their perspectives on DEI issues. Not only were the top-line survey results analyzed; the results were then cross-tabulated according a number of factors, including school district size, district poverty level, and the diversity of the student populations within districts.","The most challenging part of this project was conceiving and then completing a project that -- to the best of our knowledge -- has never been undertaken before in education journalism, and thus had no template to guide the work. We went into the project knowing that A) diversity, equity, and inclusion is of great importance to many school districts, and B) many education companies say they have an interest in supporting DEI, because the school districts they serve have diverse student populations and want those students' backgrounds reflected in their academic resources.

But we did not know whether it was realistic for us to collect survey information from school district officials on issues associated with racial/ethnic inclusion, or to present this data to a business audience in a way was likely to influence their behavior. We had to formulate survey questions of school district officials that they were capable of answering about product preferences and company behavior related to DEI. We then had to determine what information from the survey data would be most instructive for a business audience. And finally, we had to figure out how to present the data journalistically so that it was digestible and impactful for our audience.","Journalists can learn about the power of conducting independent survey research and using it to provide insights to a business audience that would otherwise not have access to that information -- and perhaps not be inclined to seek it out.

EdWeek Market Brief regularly conducts survey research of school district officials, and delivers it to education companies -- though rarely on a scale approaching what was offered through our DEI report. One of the advantages of a journalistic outlet doing this original survey research is that we can credibly ask uncomfortable questions of school officials that companies themselves might be reluctant to ask. Journalism has the ability to influence private sector behavior through watchdog reporting, and through traditional beat coverage. This project demonstrates the potential to shape the work of businesses through research that companies regard as impartial, yet also essential to making their work more responsive to schools.",English,https://www.clearslide.com/view/new/mail?iID=BmnRc5ZqLWWNZkDgHGc4,,,,,,,,"Maurice Bakley, Sean Cavanagh, David Saleh Rauf, Emma Kate Fittes, Holly Kurtz, Sterling Lloyd, Alex Harwin, Laura Baker, Liz Yap.",EdWeek Market Brief's special report was a collaboration among a team of editorial and research staff members.,
United States,Tampa Bay Times,Big,Participant,,Arrest and Eviction: Tampa police called for hundreds to be evicted. Entire families lost their homes.,15/09/21,"Investigation, Map, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, R Studio, OpenStreetMap, OpenRefine, Tabula","For eight years, the Tampa Police Department used the threat of eviction as a tactic to reduce crime in some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods, urging landlords to evict tenants based solely on arrests.

Officers gave landlords legal cover to evict anyone found to be involved in criminal activity, then sent landlords arrest notices and called on them to take action.

The program went under the radar until a Tampa Bay Times investigation showed that entire families were evicted based on the arrest of a single member and that 90 percent of those reported to their landlords were Black.","When the Times first contacted the Tampa Police Department regarding the program in 2017, they immediately changed some aspects of the program. The department removed wording from the notifications of arrests that stated that landlords were “required to take immediate actions through notice to cure, notice to vacate, or eviction.”. The department also sent out fewer letters in years following that first contact.

Civil rights groups — including the NAACP and ACLU — sent a letter calling for the city to “immediately end” the Crime-Free Multi Housing Program. The letter, sent two days after our first story published, cited our reporting and noted that “the Program compounds the over-policing of people of color in Tampa and causes catastrophic consequences for people of color.” On the same day, local state and city representatives called on the mayor to suspend the program for re-evaluation.

The next day Tampa mayor Jane Castor announced reforms to the program, adding police oversight and restricting the type and location of arrests that would be reported to landlords. In December 2021, the city scrapped the program and announced that it would no longer send reports to landlords detailing the arrests of their tenants.

Within a month after our story first published, the Orlando Police Department and Orange County Sheriff’s Office announced that they planned to end their own programs similar to the Crime-Free Multi Housing Program.","Our primary challenge in this project was cleaning and consolidating data from various data sources. We primarily relied on R for data cleaning and consolidation tasks.

Many of the documents provided by the Tampa Police Department existed only in PDF form. We used R’ to scrape, clean and consolidate information from the irregularly formatted PDF forms.

The datasets provided by TPD contained variations and misspellings of names, addresses, and other identifying characteristics. We used string distance tools in R and OpenRefine to clean and correct misspellings and variations.

Our next challenge was to determine whether the TPD was primarily targeting Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Tampa. We used OpenStreetMap and various R mapping packages to locate participating buildings and pull in census data from the surrounding census block. 

We found that participating buildings were in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. The vast majority of residents evicted under the TPD program were also Black.

Finally, we used R to create a map of participating buildings compared to the surrounding demographics, which was printed alongside the story.","Tampa police used different versions of the notices they sent to landlords and also used an offender database to record arrests and evictions making it a challenge to automate the collation of more than 1,000 interactions with landlords. 

Our first challenge was simply combining the various spreadsheets and filings into a once usable database of arrests and evictions. Cleaning the various formatting changes, duplicates, errors and typos took weeks of careful work.

Once we had a working database, we needed to match the names of those reported to landlords with court records and eviction cases mostly in the name of the leaseholder. This was an arduous task that took hundreds of hours to complete.

Locating and reaching out to victims proved to be a logistical challenge. Many evicted individuals remained housing insecure for years following their eviction.",Other newsrooms have written about similar programs in their communities but stopped short of doing a detailed analysis the Times undertook. That enabled us to report with authority rather than relying on anecdotal examples. We were able to definitely state how many tenants had been reported to their landlord for misdemeanor arrests or those that happened far from their landlord’s property. We were able to show how police targeted this initiative in mostly minority neighborhoods.,English,https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/09/15/tampa-police-called-for-hundreds-to-be-evicted-entire-families-lost-their-homes/,https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/09/17/civil-rights-groups-call-for-halt-to-tampa-police-crime-free-housing-program/,https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/09/18/tampa-announces-reforms-to-crime-free-housing-program/,https://www.tampabay.com/news/tampa/2021/09/23/tampa-city-council-asks-police-for-roadmap-for-future-role-in-eviction-program/,https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2021/10/06/orlando-and-orange-county-scrap-crime-free-housing-programs/,,,,"Ian Hodgson, Christopher O'Donnell, Nathaniel Lash","Christopher O'Donnell is a Health and Medicine reporter at the Tampa Bay Times.

The analysis of the data made possible to see in which areas of the country the vaccination protocol was being breached the most or which political parties were taking the most doses unnecessarily.

Maldita.es was the first media to provide this information, and then others began to do same. It's the only media that has continued to review, update and to monitor what has become of those politicians who jumped the line a year after vaccination began.","The impact of the first report in which Maldita.es compiled all the cases from its own database of politicians who skipped the vaccination queue had a brutal impact in Spain.

Many media started to cover the data we collected about these cases and many others created similar pieces, although most of them were gradually abandoned. 

In addition, many politicians took up Maldita.es's maps and graphics in person to denounce opponents who were skipping the vaccination queue. There were spokespersons of political parties in Spain who showed the Maldita.es map of vaccinated politicians printed in large size in the Congress and in electoral debates on prime time television. A large number of politicians from different parties (especially the parties with the fewest cases) have also shared this information on social networks and on their websites. This information has undoubtedly been one of Maldita.es's most impactful in 2021.

We then looked at what had become of the politicians who jumped the vaccination line in a new report in December: just one year after the start of vaccination. The impact was also very big. No other media was tracking and reviewing what had become of them in order to be able to audit their work and be able to tell the public about.

We were also able to reveal in December after obtaining via FOIA the vaccination data from the Health Department of the Region of Murcia (one of the states in Spain) and analysing it that 75% of its non-health care workers were vaccinated before their turn. Almost 400 workers. Vaccination in Murcia was a scandal because different politicians jumped the line.

To accumulate all the data and cases that are already public is an exercise that provides perspective and context and allows us to really quantify and see how serious a problem is, as in this case, to jump the vaccination line.

That data journalism must go hand in hand with traditional journalism: calling, contacting, asking questions, following up on cases...

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,,Lower grades and preference for the Humanities. Who are the poorer students in Portugal?,21/05/21,"Infographics, Chart, Education","Microsoft Excel, R, R Studio, flourish","For the first time, the Portuguese Education Ministry gave access to an anonymized database with the grades of the students from 11.º e 12.º years in public schools. The database contained information such as if a student had “escalão A” - a subsidy given to poorer students. The data allowed us to conclude that poorer students have lower marks in every subject, but also that they tend to choose Humanities rather than STEM.","The story allowed everyone to understand how the Portuguese public school is not yet able to end with the differences between students from poorer and richer families. Even though the national exam's data already allowed us to check that students from poorer backgrounds tend to have lower marks on those exams, the data on this database was way more comprehensive. Apart from the already mentioned trend observed that students from poorer families tend to avoid STEM, we were already able to observe a bigger gap in subjects like Geometry and English rather than, for example, Sociology. Those trends need a more comprehensive database (including several school years, something that was not provided by the Portuguese authorities), but might give public authorities some clues about what could be done to close the gap between poorer and richer students.","R programming language was used to analyze the database. Using ggplot2 we were able to do some draft charts. Choosing the right visualization was a challenge since we were not sure about the best way to show our findings.

We used flourish to make the final visualizations and Scrollama.js to build the scroller.","Since the original database included information for 102.947 students - and their marks on every subject - it was a massive database that provided some challenges. Also, since it included so much information, it was a challenge to find what could be the real story there. The database also included some problems (for example, the unique ids that the anonymized database included were not so unique after all…). That meant that the analysis involved asking several questions to the authorities that provided it.

The second challenge was to determine if some of those conclusions could just be noise in the data. The lack of a database from previous years meant that it was impossible to know if that was a trend observed only on those 102.947 students. Those students were also studying during a pandemic - and we were not able to evaluate how much that affected the results of our analysis.",That data journalism can contribute to the public debate but also give some clues about further academic research.,Portuguese,https://www.publico.pt/ranking-escolas-2020/notas-mais-baixas-preferencia-humanidades-quem-sao-alunos-escalao-a-portugal,,,,,,,,"Rui Barros, José Alves","Rui Barros is a data journalist/ journocoder/ news nerd currently working at PÚBLICO, a daily newspaper in Portugal.",

A trail of documents reveals a decades-old chemical-trading network controlled by Ukrainians, hidden behind a veil of proxies and shell firms.","The investigation was well-received. Aljazeera English interviewed the OCCRP lead project editor. Jadeed TV in Lebanon interviewed the reporter & the senior MENA editor. OCCRP’s local media partner, Daraj,com, reported 20,000+ read the investigation. Several TV stations debated the findings & organized political talk shows. Two local media groups contacted OCCRP for help in setting up investigative units that publish stories of interest to the public & that holds power to account. Lebanese lawyers, led by Camille Abousleiman, are suing Savaro in the U.K. on behalf of the blast victims — 218 dead, 7,000 injured, 300,000+ homeless — arguing that the company bears significant responsibility.

We are trying to integrate the OCCRP investigation into our case.” The Ukrainian company has denied any involvement & laid the blame on Lebanese authorities.

Global interest soon died off, and official investigations in Lebanon and elsewhere stalled due to political interference, a lack of international cooperation, or a lack of will. In such a situation, investigative journalists were some of the only people left with the time and interest to diligently work through this story. This story is a great demonstration of just how effectively journalists can work together when they form truly global, collegiate teams, and work together effectively using the right data tools. More than a year after the explosion, the owners of the cargo onboard the Rhosus thought no one had figured out who they were. They had covered up their tracks online and through shell companies, and could reasonably expect to put this story behind them. But that's not how it worked out for them. The lesson for journalists is an important one: very few things are truly hidden. There are enough scraps of information scattered around the world. The key is building the right time, devoting the right amount of time, and working together in an open, trustful way so as to effectively share your work.","English, Arabic, Russian, Georgian, Ukrainian",https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/ownership-of-chemicals-that-exploded-at-beirut-port-traces-back-to-ukraine,,,,,,,,"Aubrey Belford OCCRP Aubrey@occrp.org, editor, coordinator

Thanks to the analysis of open data we were able to see that after the premiere of a documentary on television there had been the largest month-on-month increase in history.

After that, via FOIA, we obtained more detailed data and thanks to this we were able to go further and count, among other things, how November 25 is the day that this number is historically called the most.","The impact of the reports on the effect of Rocío Carrasco's documentary was very great. The documentary program itself and its television network (Telecinco, one of the most watched in Spain) echoed the data investigation carried out by Maldita.es.

In addition, many other media echoed and we were really able to show this effect for the first time with data that was not known.

At Público, we developed a news application that allowed our readers to understand exactly how much they have been impacted by the fuel crisis.","The news application provided a personalized story about how much the fuel crisis was costing the reader, but also gave it some tips about where fuel was cheaper. We believe that the personalization it allowed was the key to its success, becoming a piece that keeps getting new visitors every day - making us believe that some people even bookmarked the page and use it regularly.","The data was being published on a government page.

Malaysia,Malaysiakini,Big,Participant,,The Hong Kong infowar in Malaysia,11/08/21,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Open data, Fact-checking, Chart, Politics","JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","Focussing on the 2019-2020 anti-extradition law protests in Hong Kong, this is the first media investigation in Malaysia to map how foreign online disinformation campaigns made its way to Malaysian shores and spread within local online communities.

In this eight-month-long investigation, we were able to identify disinformation surrounding the protests that have reached Malaysian audiences. We traced the origins of false information on the protests, followed their distribution paths and uncovered the main players that ‘imported’ them into Malaysian cyberspace. China’s state media, local Chinese-language media, local community-based Facebook pages and the Chinese embassy in Malaysia were among the distributors.","As Southeast Asia becomes a hotbed of strategic rivalry between China and the United States, pro- and anti-Beijing propaganda targeting Chinese diaspora in Malaysia has intensified over the last few years causing worsening polarization among Malaysians especially Chinese-speaking communities. It is a well known phenomena in Malaysia but nobody has attempted to quantify and analyze it. This investigation is a local showcase of how investigation of mis- and disinformation can be done.

In this country where Beijing exerts enormous influence both financially and politically, most politicians, media outlets, think tanks and academics avoid making public censure or criticism against China or Chinese Communist Party (CCP). However, the investigation, published in both English and Chinese, received 3,128 interactions on Facebook including 941 shares according to data from Crowdtangle, a rare achievement for a long-form and heavy story critical of CCP and its affiliates.

After it was published, the project lead (Kuek Ser Kuang Keng) was invited to present the investigation findings at various journalism conferences including the Trusted Media Summit 2021 (recording https://vimeo.com/641757048) by Google News Initiatives (sharing the same panel with ProPublica, AFP, Digital Forensic Research Lab, EU Disinfo Lab and Australian Strategic Policy Institute), APAC Information Operation Roundtable by DoubleThink Lab, and an upcoming forum on disinformation by Asia Fact-checkers’ Network.","To understand how such disinformation infiltrated the Malaysian online public sphere, who were the main creators and 'importers' of such information, and to gauge its reach, we collected 11,482 posts published on 384 public Malaysian Facebook pages in three major languages spoken in Malaysia (English, Bahasa Malaysia and Chinese) between June 2019 (when the protests began to peak) and March 2020 that contained keywords related to the protests using social media listening tool Zanroo. The dataset includes details of each post including the number of engagements, date and time of posting, links and media shared, as well as the number of followers of each page.

Our team then manually inspected posts in the dataset that had received a minimum of 20 engagements. We scrutinised each post for misinformation or other relevant information. For posts that contain false and misleading information, we traced their origins and distribution paths through different fact-checking techniques and social media tracking analytics tools like Crowdtangle, Google search and Baidu search. We also used spreadsheets to identify Facebook pages that functioned as a network by sharing the same posts to amplify disinformation. We used Perma.cc (https://perma.cc/), an online archival tool developed by the Harvard Law School Library, to archive the Facebook posts containing misinformation.

As this is the first such investigation in Malaysia, we also made our dataset public on Github (https://github.com/kininewslab/Hk_misinfo) to allow other journalists and researchers to use it.","As this is a first-of-its-kind investigation in both Malaysia and our newsroom Malaysiakini, the team started the project by researching various methodologies used by other journalists in online information investigation. To design our methodology, the 5-person team compiled and analyzed major stories on the topic, spoke to journalists and experts in this field, went through dozens of tutorials of online investigation tools and techniques, and tested several of those tools. We invited the Crowdtangle team to give us training on how to use it for misinformation investigation. It is not just a journalistic investigation but a capacity building project.

The most laborious process in the investigation is to identify false and misleading information in the posts that we have collected. Misinformation investigations usually start with specific pieces of misinformation that are found from previous fact-checking efforts or existing fact-checking databases. However, there were no local fact-checking efforts on foreign misinformation when we started the project. Hence we decided to manually read all the posts 11,482 that we’ve collected to pick out the ones with misinformation. We soon realized that it was humanly impossible. We then limited our scope to posts with a minimum of 20 engagements. This reduced the number of posts to 6,248. Most of the posts were in Chinese and only 2 team members read Chinese. Together with a part-time research assistant, we spent hundreds of hours to go through each of the 6,248 posts and even fact-check them if there’s information that has not been verified.

This investigation began in December 2019. The Covid-19 pandemic exploded in Asia the next month. Our progress was severely disrupted and the completion of the investigation was delayed by 12 months. Its publication is a miracle created by the team’s dedication and perseverance towards quality journalism.","1. The methodology of this investigation, which was stated at the bottom of the story, is highly replicable. In fact, we developed our methodology by replicating and adjusting the methodologies of previous investigations done by other journalists.

2. There are issues that can’t be solved by technology. We attempted to use AI and machine learning to identify misinformation in Facebook posts but failed to find any solution. Eventually hundreds of man hours were spent to solve the problem but the outcomes were rewarding. 

3. Launching an investigation that requires new skills and tools might seem daunting but it is one of the best ways to upgrade the skill set and toolbox of a newsroom. It is an investment that is worth taking. 

4. If you hit a wall during your investigation, seek help from other journalists or experts. Many are willing to help. There are plenty of online self-learning resources for journalists too. Journalism conferences like GIJN are a good place to identify specialists or experienced journalists in the topics that you are investigating.

5. Having a clear plan and knowing your milestones is key to completing a long-term investigation even in the event of a major disruptor like Covid-19.","English, Chinese",https://pages.malaysiakini.com/hk-misinfo/en/,https://pages.malaysiakini.com/hk-misinfo/zh/,https://github.com/kininewslab/Hk_misinfo,,,,,,"Kuek Ser Kuang Keng, Ng Xiang Yi, Zikri Kamarulzaman, Ramieza Wahid, Darshini Kandasamy, Hazman Hazwan, Foong Chee Wai","The project is presented by Kini News Lab in Malaysiakini, one of the most-read news portals in Malaysia.

United States,The Philadelphia Inquirer,Big,Participant,,Philly remains one of the most racially segregated cities in America,19/10/21,"Explainer, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Economy, Human rights, Census, Demographics, Inequality","D3.js, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","This story measures the level of racial segregation in Philadelphia over time, and compares it to other cities. We found that Philly remains one of the most segregated cities and metros in the nation, and that the rate of desegregation has been slowing.

We used data from the 6 most recent Censuses to derive the ""dissimilarity index"" (a common segregation measure) for Philadelphia and peer cities over time. With static and dynamic visualizations, we illustrated the racial distribution of Philadelphia's residents, how Philly's score compares, and the intuition behind how the dissimilarity index works.","Our article galvanized a conversation around this ever-present but seemingly eternal issue. We saw widespread attention from policymakers, elected officials (including two US congress members), academics, and citizens around our area. Our internal analytics showed that ordinary readers were also highly engaged with this project, and that it generated a disproportionate number of letters and new subscribers.","The first task was to work with experts to find the right quantitative measures of segregation: while we primarily discussed the dissimilarity index, we calculated and mentioned two others. Calculating those values required us to collect census data, which we analyzed using Python/ Pandas given the many hundreds of thousands of individual data points (census tracts by year) that were involved. We also undertook exploratory geographic visualization using QGIS.

Having done the analysis and determined the arc of the story, we collaborated with on-staff artists to create maps of racial distributions across Philadelphia and with our interactive designer to make the maps interactive (and to explain the logic behind the dissimilarity score) using react.js and d3.js. Finally, we created static charts and tables in Datawrapper to illustrate distributions and trends over time.","There were two types of challenges with this story: technical and editorial.

The chief technical challenge was obtaining and munging the census data. While the census bureau makes obtaining the most recent census tract data fairly simple, earlier years' data required finding data pre-processed from a third party source (NHGIS). The raw census data required significant pre-processing, and we did extensive exploratory analysis before we knew what the story was.

The second challenge involved the interplay between editorial and technical decisions. How should we categorize racial/ ethnic groups? Which indices of segregation should we focus on, and what should we make of different scores across indices? Which ethnic groups should best be compared against each other. What was the right level of geographic resolution (city? county? metro area?), and for which types of questions? These questions had to be answered iteratively as we performed exploratory analysis, because they informed a programmatic approach to structuring and analyzing the data.

And of course, having done our analysis, we had to decide which insights were most worth sharing. Not only did they have to drive the point home (namely, that Philadelphia is highly segregated across multiple measures and over time), but we also had to contextualize the significance of our findings. We relied on experts to make the case that segregation matters not intrinsically, but because it is correlated with various other social ills, and therefore represents a kind of structural racism.","Above all, we hope that this story provides an example of how journalists might tell a timely story about ever-present problems, even if they are not grounded in breaking news. Many worthy stories, after all, are about entrenched rather than emergent problems. Segregation and its concomitant ills are not new, but drawing attention to them in a new light helped spark conversations about it nonetheless.

Relatedly, we also think we succeeded in making abstruse social science research more accessible. While and index of segregation may make sense at a high level, we're proud that we also tried to explain the intuition behind how it was calculated, and why that is a valid way of thinking about the geography of race. That involved developing relationships with academics and translating their research into plain language and visuals.

Finally, we hope other journalists can learn from our use of census data at scale.",English,https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/inq2/philadelphia-racial-segregation-remains-high-census-analysis-20211019.html,,,,,,,,"Aseem Shukla, Michaelle Bond, Sam Morris, John Duchneskie, Dominique DeMoe, Jonathan Lai, Cindy Henry, Dan Hirschhorn","The two main reporters are Aseem Shukla and Michaelle Bond:
