Ecuador,"Unidad de Investigación Tierra de Nadie, CONNECTAS",Small,Winner,"Teranexus Duran is a brilliant example of data journalism strategies successfully applied to a very dangerous and extremely necessary story. The reporters managed to document and expose how criminals are buying, piece by piece, the land beneath the feet of the Ecuadorians living in the coastal city of Duran. This is a local story that should be replicated all over the world where the housing crisis, violence and unrest are on the rise because of the accumulation of land and all classes of property by organized criminal groups.",Terranexus Durán.

Este reportaje combinó análisis de datos, registros catastrales, cartografía, documentos oficiales y testimonios para evidenciar cómo el tráfico de predios se ha convertido en el eje de operaciones ilegales. El trabajo expuso la complicidad entre funcionarios locales y líderes del narcotráfico, mostrando el impacto sobre miles de habitantes, así como las complejas dinámicas de corrupción y violencia en Durán.","Este reportaje expuso las conexiones entre el poder político y el crimen organizado en Durán, evidenciando cómo grupos ligados al narcotráfico instauraron su propio sistema de gobernanza criminal en una ciudad estratégica para el bodegaje de droga rumbo a Europa y Estados Unidos. La investigación, iniciada en 2021 y concluida en septiembre de 2024 con la publicación de Terranexus, presentó material inédito —data catastral, fotografías y testimonios— que mostraba la coordinación entre criminales y autoridades locales.  Tras la difusión de Terranexus, Inteligencia Militar solicitó nuestra colaboración para intervenciones en zonas de alto riesgo, mientras que la UNODC y el Observatorio del Crimen Organizado de PADF aprovecharon los hallazgos en nuevos estudios. Universidades como Amherst College, University of Massachusetts y la Universidad San Francisco de Quito invitaron a nuestro equipo a analizar el impacto de estas dinámicas en políticas de seguridad nacional, y el Lincoln Institute of Land Policy abrió un debate  sobre su incidencia en el ordenamiento territorial.  Las revelaciones motivaron operativos en Durán, incautaciones de droga y armas, y la captura de líderes clave, incluido el exalcalde Dalton Narváez. El reportaje llegó al shorlist del True Story Award 2025 y fue replicado en Ecuador por otros 10 medios digitales.","Durán era una ciudad invisible pese a estar junto al principal puerto marítimo del Ecuador, en Guayaquil. Un 80% de la ciudad no tiene agua potable y la mitad del territorio son asentamientos irregulares. Obtener información estadística era un reto. Las autoridades locales negaron casi todo acceso a la información pública, y la ciudad se mantenía como un desierto informativo a pesar de ser una de las más violentas del país. Los homicidios y la presencia de bandas narcodelictivas impedían que cualquier medio investigara con profundidad. Nuestro medio, Tierra de Nadie, realmente carece de financiamiento estable y afrontó el proyecto con recursos muy limitados y bajo amenazas directas, incluso intentos de intimidación desde criminales y autoridades locales. La falta de registros públicos y la existencia de documentos falsificados obstaculizaron el acceso a datos veraces. Para desenredar este entramado, recurrimos a cruces intensivos de bases oficiales, expedientes judiciales y testimonios de víctimas y exfuncionarios, combinando mapeo y análisis forense de documentos. Así trazamos redes de corrupción y minimizamos riesgos de la reportería en campo. Aun con presiones de actores políticos y criminales, conseguimos romper el silencio y abrir un debate público inédito sobre Durán.","Para reconstruir el esquema del tráfico ilegal de tierras y la infiltración criminal en Durán, combinamos reportería tradicional con diversas herramientas digitales. Empleamos Google Earth y sistemas de georreferenciación para ubicar con precisión los asentamientos irregulares, superponiendo capas de mapas digitales con registros catastrales. Este cruce de datos permitió detectar patrones de ocupación y zonas bajo influencia de bandas vinculadas al narcotráfico. También utilizamos hojas de cálculo como Excel y Google Sheets, para procesar y organizar grandes volúmenes de información, desde nombres y fechas hasta direcciones y referencias catastrales. Además, aplicamos técnicas de OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) para rastrear vínculos de funcionarios y criminales, consultando redes sociales y archivos públicos en línea. Esta combinación nos sirvió para correlacionar datos, confirmar identidades y exponer redes de corrupción política. En cada fase, contrastamos los hallazgos digitales con al menos 50 entrevistas y documentación oficial, verificando la autenticidad de actas municipales, expedientes judiciales y registros empresariales. Así, pudimos revelar cómo estos esquemas de corrupción y crimen organizado operan de forma encubierta, aprovechando las brechas de información y los vacíos de control institucional.","Nuetar  mayor lección es la relación entre la planificación urbana (o su ausencia) y el control territorial que ejercen los grupos criminales. Resulta fundamental entender el ordenamiento territorial de la ciudad desde sus orígenes, y comparar los mapas oficiales con la realidad de campo. Las brechas entre lo plasmado en el papel y la realidad suelen revelar irregularidades o espacios sin autoridad que son aprovechados por organizaciones delictivas.  Segundo, el cruce de datos catastrales con indicadores de violencia —como altos índices de homicidios— nos da una idea de dónde se concentran estas redes. El mapeo georreferenciado muestra cómo se asientan en zonas estratégicas, cercanas a rutas de transporte de drogas, entidades oficiales estratégicas o sitios para almacenar sustancias ilegales.  Tercero, es invenitable investigar la burocracia tras la planificación urbana. Esto implica revisar quién legaliza el suelo, otorga permisos de construcción, quién firma divisiones de terrenos y qué vacíos legales facilitan que los grupos criminales manipulen el sistema. Por último, establecer lazos con fuentes locales —líderes comunitarios o funcionarios— aporta testimonios directos para entender cómo se consolida ese poder paralelo.

Key forces on Russia’s side were inmates recruited by Yevgeny Prigozhin’s Wagner PMC. Prigozhin created an image of Wagner as an effective and ruthless organisation that accomplishes its objectives at any cost. Behind this facade lie thousands killed in “meat assaults.” Mediazona and BBC News Russian obtained documents about Wagner’s posthumous payments. Our analysis of these documents provides an account of how the battle unfolded, losses suffered by Wagner, their methods and locations for recruiting prisoners, and money paid to relatives of KIA fighters.","“The Price of Bakhmut” became one of the most popular features produced by Mediazona in 2024: with tens of thousands of views on the site, it also gained the attention of hundreds of thousands of viewers on YouTube (over a million, if our own and BBC’s videos are combined).

Although pro-war participants of Wagner-related chatrooms did criticize our work, after the release of the article, various people wrote in, asking if particular people were in our list.","Any honest account of the war with Ukraine can become grounds for criminal prosecution in modern Russia. Authorities made sure it was possible in the first weeks of the war, adopting new laws against spreading “fake news” and “discrediting” the Russian military. “Treason” and “espionage” are also used to fight dissent. This is why we are protecting the identity of our source and some of the members of our team.","In the Bakhmut project, we used all possible instruments to work with tables, including Python scripts that searched for duplicates and mistakes in the original document input. We used smart scraping that allowed us to bypass limitations of search to access data in the Probate Registry for additional verification of the Wagner list. We used d3.js along with leaflet.js for the visualization, animation and maps of inmate recruitment and the Battle of Bakhmut. Turf.js was used for the visualization of captured territories. We also benefited greatly from Mediazona’s own extensive database of court records. Once we were able to decipher the principle behind inmate dog-tag numbers (most had the format of Kxxx-xxx, where K signifies an inmate recruit, the first number is the penal colony and the second is the person’s own number), we used this data, along with messages of Wagner fighters’ relatives in group chats, to identify over 350 prisons where recruitment took place. This showed us the geography and extent of Wagner’s efforts in this field.","One of the challenges for our data team was to verify the authenticity of leaked documents. Luckily, we had a range of tools and data to do that at our disposal: * Since the start of the war, we’ve been maintaining a name-by-name tally of [Russian army losses](https://en.zona.media/article/2022/05/11/casualties_eng) based on open-source data. Our database already contained 6,800 last names matching those in the Wagner PMC database. * We cross-referenced the database of recruited prisoners with the Probate Registry and found an overlap of more than 2,400 full names and dates of death. The overall number also matched our estimate of Russia’s casualties based [inheritance cases](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/24/75k) with Meduza. * We reviewed chat rooms used by relatives of Wagner fighters and found that everyone mentioned in those chats is listed in our table. * In December 2023, the New York Times [published](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/world/europe/russia-prison-wagner-ukraine.html) an investigation into recruitment at IK6 in Kopeisk, Chelyabinsk region. The journalists obtained a list of 197 recruited prisoners and identified 48 who had died. Our table matched. The use of these four methods gave us a deeper understanding of Wagner recruitment.

The most recent reporting data is the original data that Datadista accessed, processed and shared with all partners. The quality of this reporting can vary significantly depending on the member state. France is part of the few fortunate countries benefiting from a platform with public data available. However, this portal is very outdated, hard to navigate, and impossible to understand without proper scientific knowledge. We worked with some of the best groundwater experts (ENS, BRGM, IGRAC...) to navigate through this data, identify and categorize pollutants of interest, and compare them to legal thresholds. This ”expert-reviewed journalism” is an innovative methodological cooperation between journalists and scientists, inspired from the [Forever Pollution Project](https://foreverpollution.eu/).

The list of techniques is generally known, but not all of them are relevant to the modern context in Ukraine.  Therefore, we trained the model in such a way that it better understands the Ukrainian context and does not trigger on those messages that are not relevant to us. For example, for the ”Appeal to Fear” technique: the ChatGPT in most cases will mark this type of manipulation even on a factual message like ”New attack. Launch of missiles in the direction of Kyiv”. For Ukrainian reality, such a message in 2024 is not manipulation, but everyday reality. In total, we worked on the project for about 6 months. We created a training data set, then a test set. First, we tested it on ChatGPT - it had a rather low accuracy (up to 76%), and our model as a result - 86%. To visualize results on individual channels, we used circles with manipulation techniques strung on them.","We analyzed Telegram channels with the most significant number of subscribers in the News and Media category and Politics category. Each post (if it contained more than 100 characters) was checked for the presence of at least one of the following ten manipulation techniques: loaded language; glittering generalities; euphoria; appeal to fear; fear, uncertainty, and doubt etc. We relied on Ukrainian expertise on the techniques used by Russian propaganda. Also, we held a focus group with Ukrainian journalists, editors, and analysts who are familiar with manipulation and journalistic standards to clarify controversial issues.  A team of 14 annotators covered the data labeling process. They underwent specialized training and annotated 9,512 Telegram posts. To ensure the high quality of the data, we formed a group of five reviewers from our editorial team who checked the annotations and provided feedback to the annotators. Using an annotated dataset of 7,604 samples, we fine-tuned the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model to detect manipulative content on Telegram. The model’s performance was evaluated on a separate test dataset comprising 1,908 examples. During the process, we carried out multiple training iterations to enhance its performance. Our final model distinguishes between manipulative and nonmanipulative content with an accuracy of 86%.","We did not analyze the content of the posts. We analyzed the structure of the language and determined the techniques that make the text more emotional, thus diverting attention from facts and evidence.

Additionally, the platform reached 41,000 visits from more than 15,000 users.  Our data analysis and outreach work has made significant contributions to the analysis of political-criminal violence. As a result, we formed partnerships with Animal Político, one of the most important independent media in Mexico, to publish a series of reports featuring local stories of politicians confronting organized crime.  Additionally, we have collaborated with international organizations to contribute to the analysis of the political violence context in Mexico and the region. For example, the NDI in Ecuador and ACLED in the United States.  Ahead of the 2024 elections, we met with over 50 journalists, researchers, public officials, journalists, and students to present our database and its key findings. In these discussions, proposals for collaboration emerged to address political violence in the states.","Over nearly two decades, organized crime has diversified and intensified its strategies to influence local Mexican politics. The lack of reliable data or methodologies to document this type of violence, and even the availability of data through private consultancies, has limited the discussion and investigation of an issue that is becoming increasingly deep-rooted in our democracy.  At Data Cívica, along with expert researchers on the topic, we developed a clear methodology and built a technological tool to automate the process of searching for news about political-criminal violence events, and then record them in a database. This has allowed us to maintain a record of political-criminal violence events and understand the main characteristics of the victims, the distribution of attacks across Mexican territory, and the timing of these events. It is important to highlight that the database is fully public and free. Furthermore, it is the only systematic database that exists in Mexico on this issue.  In addition to the database, we built a website where we present an interactive map, graphs, analysis documents, and field reports on the political violence situation in Mexico, particularly during the 2023-2024 electoral period.","We developed a Python code to automate the search for news about political-criminal violence on the internet. Using a series of relevant keywords, we perform web scraping to analyze a larger volume of data in less time.After automation, we manually clean the databases to verify if the event is indeed a case of political-criminal violence reported by at least two news sources.  We then create a fully systematized database ready for download and analysis. By streamlining information collection, we process the data in R to generate visualizations and diagnostics on violence patterns, geographical distribution, and trends in electoral contexts.  Through monthly reports, we provide updated information to journalists, organizations, and academic institutions for their analysis and publications.","With this project, we have trained journalists from various states in Mexico on what political-criminal violence is and how to use our database. In these courses, we taught them how to create graphs and maps using simple technological tools like Datawrapper, so they can make basic visualizations without needing to code. Additionally, the visualizations and interactive maps on our platform have helped journalists identify locations where they can conduct reports on this issue.  For example, through our outreach newsletters, we revealed that 2024 was the most violent year for politics in Mexico since 2018, with 656 events of violence, mainly in states like Guerrero, Guanajuato, and Puebla",Spanish,https://votar-entre-balas.datacivica.org/,https://votar-entre-balas.datacivica.org/datos-votar-entre-balas,https://votar-entre-balas.datacivica.org/homeassets/REPORTEANALITICO-VOTARENTREBALAS2024.pdf,https://youtu.be/ic9bhZNA04E,"Mónica Meltis, Itzel Soto, Sandra Ley, Amalia Pulido, Oscar Elton, Jorge Ruiz, Monserrat Pérez, Georgina Jiménez, Paola Berenzón, Basem Hamza, Diana Cruz, Brenda Muñoz, Itxaro Arteta, Nora Hinojo, Ernesto Núñez Albarrán and Manu Ureste.","Data Cívica is a feminist organization that uses data and technology as tools for the defense of human rights in Mexico.

Mother Jones (large) published the stories after Public Integrity (small) laid off its staff.",Big,Winner,This is a phenomenal use of machine learning tools to uncover historically hidden truths and to create a public search repository that can generate hundreds more stories about policies that protect the ancestral rights and resources of a community. It represents the enterprising and resourceful application of technology to historical documents/data to deliver a great public interest journalism project.,40 Acres and a Lie,2024-06-15,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Podcast/radio, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, QGIS, Google Sheets, Python","This project is a rare example of using new technologies to uncover important historical facts, especially as some U.S. officials try to rewrite history. Forty Acres and a Mule remains the United States’ most famous attempt at reparations for slavery and is largely remembered as a broken promise. But this project revealed that the U.S. government issued hundreds, perhaps thousands, of titles to land, where freed people built homes, established local governments, and grew crops. After President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, his successor stripped property from freed Blacks across the South and returned it to their past enslavers.","For the first time, many Black Americans were made aware that land had been given to and then taken away from their ancestors.  Our hope is that families are able to learn more about their histories through the materials we have made public. Hollis Gentry, who oversees the Smithsonian Institution’s Freedmen’s Bureau Digital Records Project, said the project accomplished what she long dreamed was possible with these records: “This is a Godsend for genealogists, historians, and other researchers,” she wrote in an email, adding that the series left her speechless and in tears. “Your project has laid a foundation which I hope will expand immeasurably in other fields of research, to mine the data of the Reconstruction Era, and begin to tell new stories that have been buried in the archives for more than 150 years.”  The project’s findings were covered by dozens of media outlets, including CNN, PBS NewsHour, and WHYY’s Fresh Air. We provided the data to other newsrooms to continue reporting.  The U.S. National Park Service asked to display the names we uncovered at the General Grant National Memorial in New York City for its Black History Month exhibit.","This project is particularly important now. Cuts to the U.S. federal workforce could put our historical record at risk. This project preserves some of that information. Reporters spent hundreds of hours peering through old census records and squinting at 19th-century handwriting. Many freedmen who got land titles didn’t appear in any public records. In other cases, too many people had the same name. And the freedmen and women we did find in the records often had their names misspelled or listed different birth years, a reminder that enslaved people didn’t have birth certificates. Public Integrity journalists ultimately created at least 100 family trees and identified 41 living descendants, several of whom were interviewed for this project. Some had no idea their ancestors had received land under 40 Acres and a Mule.  This project took 2.5 years to complete. Reporters were often working on other projects as well, but Public Integrity was committed to completing these important stories. Meanwhile, facing financial difficulties, Public Integrity laid off its editorial staff, including all the journalists on the team. But these journalists continued working part-time to make sure the project would be published, thanks to funding secured by the Center for Investigative Reporting.","Public Integrity built a database of 1,250 land title recipients. Reporters spent hundreds of hours combing through historic records, from tracing family histories to finding living descendants of the recipients.   Of the nearly 2 million documents digitized by the National Archives, only about 500,000 had been transcribed by Smithsonian volunteers. We needed a way to mine the nearly 1.5 million documents that had not been transcribed. Several recent developments in machine-learning allowed us to “search” both the transcribed and non-transcribed documents.   The cursive handwriting and vocabulary used in the documents made it challenging to perform traditional OCR. So we built a workflow that compared machine-generated transcriptions to those by Smithsonian volunteers, allowing us to represent both untranscribed and transcribed documents in the same “vector space.” These “vectors” captured both the visual appearance and content of the documents, allowing us to search by visual similarity, semantic search, document structure, and document clusters.   Finally, we made the search available on a public-facing tool.  We spent several months using GIS tools to georeference the maps from the 1800s against current maps to approximate locations of plantations where the freedmen and women received their plots of land.","Powerful, impactful stories are hidden in historical archives and can now be mined using machine learning and other new technologies. The tools and methodologies developed in the reporting of this project could be applied to many other topics.   The document tool publicly released with this project allows users to search a vast trove of documents about the United States immediately following the emancipation of slaves at the end of the U.S. Civil War. The documents are from The Freedmen’s Bureau, an agency formed to provide assistance to formerly enslaved people and impoverished white people. We hope journalists, researchers and others will continue to use this collection to inform a vast array of subjects, such as education, violence, labor and more. At a time when the U.S. government is literally erasing history by removing and altering information, preserving that information has never been more important.  Seeking the help of topic experts can be critical to any project. We consulted with genealogy experts to develop methodologies for this project. They warned us that it would be difficult, but possible. We believed in the possible.

Con la construcción de una base de datos de 118.012 envíos de oro en 10 años y el reporteo en territorio, un equipo de 18 periodistas revela que, entre 2014 y 2023, cinco países andino amazónicos exportaron más de 3.000 toneladas de oro de alta pureza de origen desconocido.   También se identificó que 15 compañías vinculadas con la minería ilegal y el lavado de activos han sido proveedoras de empresas de India y Emiratos Árabes.","Esta serie investigativa, publicada en Brasil, Perú, Colombia, Bolivia y Ecuador, ofrece evidencias no solo a la opinión pública, sino a autoridades fiscales y Policía sobre proveedores, destinos, y enclaves de la minería ilegal. Las historias se han difundido en español, inglés y portugués.  Uno de los impactos más emblemáticos ocurrió con el reportaje sobre la minería ilegal en el río Nanay, fuente de agua de la ciudad más grande de la amazonía peruana: Iquitos (Loreto).   Luego de que la investigación revelara que el Instituto Geológico, Minero y Metalúrgico (Ingemmet) otorgó una concesión minera sobre  dicho río hubo movilizaciones multitudinarias. Además, el Congreso de la República del Perú citó a funcionarios del Ingemmet y solicitó explicaciones sobre la concesión minera en ese río.  En paralelo, el Gobierno  —a través del Ministerio de Energía y Minas— emitió un decreto supremo que suspende la admisión de petitorios mineros en la cuenca del río Nanay.  Hasta junio de 2024 se interpusieron cinco acciones administrativas y judiciales para cancelar la concesión, entre ellas una denuncia penal contra el hoy viceministro de Minas.   La demanda de amparo fue declarada fundada por el Poder Judicial y dispuso la nulidad de la concesión otorgada por Ingemmet.","Los países incluidos en la investigación enfrentan problemáticas similares para transparentar las rutas del oro: vacíos legales, falta de recursos para desarticular organizaciones criminales y datos descentralizados e incompletos. Esto informó nuestro proceso de reporteo y metodología.  En Perú, por ejemplo, el Registro de Formalización Minera (Reinfo) protege de acciones legales a quienes obtienen el permiso, aunque sus concesiones no estén certificadas formalmente. Fue una medida temporal, pero el Congreso peruano lo ha extendido por casi una década, generando un vacío legal que facilita la extracción con poca fiscalización. Es decir, aunque esta minería no es explícitamente ilegal, el Reinfo no garantiza que el oro exportado sea de origen legal. Este contexto es clave para entender la importancia de la debida diligencia de las empresas de oro.  Por otra parte, la discrepancia entre producción y exportación de oro en Brasil no pudo aplicarse a la metodología final, ya que el gobierno calcula la producción de manera que casi no hay diferencia entre ambos datos. Además, Bolivia y Brasil han bloqueado o dejado de reportar las empresas involucradas en la importación y exportación de oro. Aunque esto limitó la fiscalización, nuestro equipo profundizó en la información mediante carpetas fiscales y fuentes.","La serie Las rutas del oro sucio —realizada durante siete meses y que recorrió siete enclaves de la minería y el lavado de activos en la Amazonía— utilizó métodos mixtos de investigación: construcción y análisis de una base de datos global de 118.012 envíos de oro en 10 años de exportaciones, reporteo tradicional de cinco equipo periodísticos en territorios amazónicos, revisión de documentos fiscales y policiales, y más de 40 pedidos de acceso a información pública a entidades de Brasil, Perú, Colombia, Bolivia y Ecuador.   A partir de la recolección de datos a través de técnicas OSINT y solicitudes de información en distintos países, se centralizó la información en Google Sheets para facilitar su llenado y actualización por parte del equipo de 18 periodistas de la región.  Dado que los datos obtenidos presentaban distintos formatos y estructuras, se utilizó R para su procesamiento y limpieza, asegurando la estandarización y calidad de la información. Además, se empleó Python para explorar visualizaciones interactivas que permitieran un mejor análisis de los hallazgos.

Durante siete meses, el equipo se reunió por videollamadas, planificó viajes de campo, comparó informes sobre empresas implicadas, investigó organizaciones criminales e identificó discrepancias en la recopilación de datos oficiales en cada país. Partimos de la premisa de que la Amazonía es un territorio único que requiere fiscalización unificada, pese a las diferencias en filosofías políticas, recursos y prioridades de cada país.  El periodismo transfronterizo demanda recursos significativos. Sin embargo, en un mundo cada vez más globalizado, nuestro proyecto aporta información valiosa al récord público, expone el papel de  empresas globales en la destrucción de la Amazonía y muestra el alto costo humano y ambiental de la falta de recursos destinados a la fiscalización ambiental.

Spain,"Lighthouse Reports, The Washington Post, El Universal",Big,Shortlist,,Drownings and Deterrence in the Rio Grande,2024-12-08,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, OSINT, Map, Satellite images, Immigration","QGIS, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Python, Pinpoint, Git, Google Earth, Datawrapper","In collaboration with The Washington Post and El Universal, Lighthouse Reports led a cross-border, data-driven investigation that uncovered over 1,100 migrant drownings in the Rio Grande from 2017 to 2023, greatly surpassing official counts. By systematically compiling death records from agencies in Mexico and the United States, alongside extensive on-the-ground reporting, the project built an unprecedented dataset.  Focusing on Texas’ Operation Lone Star - which ushered in the fast-tracked militarization of the border - the investigation highlighted migrants’ fatal risks under intensified enforcement. It also exposed critical gaps in government data, underscoring the urgent need for accountability and transparency.","The Missing Migrants Project of the IOM invited our team to present at the inaugural session of the Network of the Americas on Missing Migrants this April, reflecting early recognition of this investigation’s relevance to global migration discourse.  Meanwhile, the methodology drew interest from academic circles and there are ongoing discussions with both The Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin and Texas State University about publishing the dataset, opening paths for broader policy-focused research.  In addition, our findings appeared in recent reports by the International Refugee Assistance Project and the National Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. Several other organizations on both sides of the border - including the Washington Office on Latin America, el Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez and RAICES - reshared our findings, underscoring how incomplete data practices can obscure humanitarian crises.  Our investigation received coverage beyond the original partners, appearing in U.S., Mexican and international outlets, most importantly in places like Venezuela where many of the migrants come from.   Though longer-term effects remain to be seen, the project has sparked fresh dialogue on accountability, data transparency, and the urgent need to mitigate risks for migrants.","Until now, a full accounting of drownings in the Rio Grande has never been documented. No agency on either side of the river is comprehensively counting all deaths. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) does maintain a database, but a 2022 Government Accountability Office report showed it undercounts by failing to record all incidents as required by law.  The CBP only publishes aggregated figures, greatly limiting potential analysis by researchers and humanitarian groups  seeking to gain insights into the dynamics and evolution of the border. Meanwhile, authorities in Mexico do not systematically track migration-related drowning deaths.  This meant that we could not rely on any single authority to provide comprehensive data for their area, so we had to assemble and deduplicate data from multiple official sources.  Beyond fragmented records, our team faced refusals and prohibitive fees, which made  acquiring data particularly challenging, requiring in-person visits to the offices of authorities along the border to manually retrieve documents.  It’s also worth noting that this project also unfolded amid a highly charged political context. Under intensifying border militarization, reporting on migrants’ challenges became increasingly tense.","For this investigation we relied on a multi-layer approach - mixing on-the-ground reporting, large-scale data collection, geospatial analysis, OSINT, and advanced statistical modeling - to unmask hidden patterns when official records are incomplete.  We filed over 160 Freedom of Information requests with authorities in the U.S. and Mexico, collecting disparate coroner and law enforcement data. A custom Python pipeline standardized and deduplicated thousands of entries, systematically removing overlaps while retaining each record’s provenance for verification. Simultaneously, we identified physical border infrastructure by analyzing satellite imagery and official press releases, then performed spatial analysis in QGIS to compare barrier locations with incident data.  For a deeper look at cause-effect relationships, we ran Granger causality tests and difference-in-differences estimators to examine whether newly erected barriers correlated with surges in drownings.  Finally, we wove our findings into an accessible narrative - mapping the data, clarifying the statistical results in a published methodology, and connecting the data to real-life stories. This integrated methodology ensured both rigor and humanity, spotlighting how policy decisions affect the most vulnerable in tangible ways.","Above all, this investigation demonstrates the power of blending multiple methods - as described in the previous answer - to create a technical dialogue that deepens a newsroom’s editorial objectives and illuminates hidden patterns, particularly when official records are sparse.  As such, this project can also serve as an example of what can be done when data is missing or incomplete. Hopefully providing inspiration to journalists not to perceive this as a roadblock to their investigations but as a realisation that they have the opportunity to compile what authorities will not track. Asking oneself how deliberate gaps can be a powerful means for decision-makers to evade scrutiny, undermining both public awareness and policy debate, making not collecting data one of the the most insidious and little-understood sources of power public bodies have.  Journalists tackling similarly underreported issues can adapt these techniques - especially bridging data voids - to produce rigorous, multi-layered reporting that prompts both public engagement and serious policy reconsideration. By making absent data visible, we can help ensure that the people most affected by governance decisions are no longer overlooked.","English, Spanish",https://www.lighthousereports.com/investigation/drownings-and-deterrence-in-the-rio-grande/,https://www.lighthousereports.com/methodology/rio-grande/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/12/08/border-drownings-immigration-texas-rio-grande/,https://interactivos.eluniversal.com.mx/2024/migrar-unico-camino/rio-bravo.html,"Melissa del Bosque, Monica Camacho, Charles Boutaud, Jack Sapoch, Charlotte Alfred, Ariadne Papagapitos, Sarah Cahlan, Arelis R.

The report reveals that over 5,000 mining applications have been submitted by 807 companies in the region, impacting Indigenous Lands and Conservation Units. The material presents exclusive data on the requested mining activities, highlights conflicts with traditional communities, and discusses the challenges of ensuring sustainable development amid the increasing global demand for clean energy.","The report generated significant public discussion by exposing the contradictions of the energy transition, highlighting the socio-environmental impacts of mining in the Amazon. The investigation revealed how major corporations, including Vale, Anglo American, Nexa, and Bemisa, have sought to exploit minerals essential for clean energy while disregarding the rights of local communities. One of the most alarming cases is Vale’s nickel mining operations near the Xikrin do Cateté Indigenous Land. The Onça Puma mine, a key nickel production site, has faced repeated suspensions due to environmental violations and accusations from Indigenous leaders that it has polluted the Cateté River, drastically affecting the community’s health, diet, and cultural traditions. Despite ongoing legal battles, the company continues to seek expansion in the area. Last week, the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) filed a lawsuit against Vale over the contamination of the Xikrin do Cateté Indigenous community due to the Onça Puma project.  Similarly, Anglo American, after facing Indigenous protests, withdrew some of its applications but left openings for future projects in conservation units such as Jamanxim National Forest. The material was widely shared and used by environmentalists, journalists, and academics to support discussions on the risks of this resource rush.","The investigation was conducted in a context of intense political and economic pressure to expand mineral exploration in the Amazon, driven by the increasing demand for strategic minerals such as copper, lithium, and nickel. The project faced challenges in accessing data due to a lack of transparency in regulatory and corporate processes. Additionally, it addressed legal issues, such as the constitutional ban on mining in Indigenous Lands, and highlighted how large companies circumvent this restriction by establishing projects near these territories. The investigation also leveraged technological innovations, including geospatial data analysis and interactive maps, to present complex information in an accessible and impactful way.","This project relied on a combination of data analysis, geospatial mapping, and investigative journalism techniques.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Shortlist,,Unpacking right-wing rhetoric: what data reveals about Milei’s discourse,2024-12-10,"Explainer, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Politics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Vue.js, Svelte","To analyze Javier Milei’s first year in office, we turned to his most distinctive weapon: words. At LA NACION we conducted an in-depth analysis of 142 speeches and interviews from his first year as president—equivalent to 89 hours of audio and 739,961 words. This quantitative and qualitative research reveals the disruptive logic he employs to reshape Argentina.  With an interdisciplinary team (data-journalists, developers, designers) and using natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs), we enriched our analysis to uncover key insights, such as religious references, hyperboles, insults and criticisms of the public institutions.","We went beyond traditional political analysis by incorporating data and technology into our scope to examine the country’s top leader’s speech. That week, we successfully set the topic on the public agenda,  as opinion leaders, politicians, and journalists echoed our work.  It had a significant impact on several television and radio programs, where it was praised for its originality and for providing an innovative and in-depth analysis of Milei’s first year in office.  For the presidential anniversary, we presented an interactive piece that combined technology, artificial intelligence, quantitative data, and design to create impactful storytelling. This special production had a special impact in our readers community: it reached 50,000 pageviews on LA NACION’s website and stood out particularly among subscribers. The average reading time, offering different levels of depth for exploration, exceeded two minutes. The article also led to two new subscriptions.","Javier Milei assumed office without a political party, stable allies, or a solid team. He entered the presidency with a parliamentary minority and no prior government experience. Yet, his disruptive and incendiary rhetoric, wielded as a weapon against his rivals, has been a key tool in consolidating his position. This narrative has allowed him to frame a drastic austerity program as an almost heroic endeavor.  The president doesn’t have a good relationship with the press. In fact, he openly criticizes and insults journalists almost daily. Throughout his first year in office, he did not hold a single press conference open to questions or granted any interviews to LA NACION. This forced us to explore alternative ways to analyze his speech.  At LA NACION Data, we are always looking for new ways to tell stories. For this project, we leveraged data and emerging technologies to enhance and expand our news coverage. However, one of the recurring challenges we face when experimenting is that most language models are designed for English and do not perform as well in Spanish. This forces us to build our own models and continuously iterate on them.","For nearly a year, we meticulously stored every speech by Milei in a Google Cloud Storage bucket and transcribed them using Whisper. Additionally, we applied LLMs for automatic correction, improving transcription accuracy and speaker identification through a JSON-based structural validation system that preserved contextual integrity across segments.  With this material, we built a database in SQLite. Once this step was completed, we conducted a content analysis using a system that integrates NLP models and LLMs. We implemented custom NLP processing pipelines to identify and categorize high-frequency terms across different topics (economic, political, social), leveraging advanced tokenization, lemmatization, and n-gram analysis specifically adapted to political discourse.  At every stage, a team of journalists and developers supervised the AI-generated results, ensuring quality control and continuously refining the models.  For internal use, we developed a dashboard using Python’s Streamlit, enabling multidimensional exploration of the speeches and facilitating navigation through the dataset.  The interactive visualizations were created using Svelte, and the front-end was developed in Vue.js.","-We strongly believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and teamwork, and this is one of the key lessons we love to highlight year after year.  -We have learned to keep people at the center of AI-driven processes. While AI is a powerful tool, rigorous human verification by journalists is imperative to ensure accuracy and prevent errors and biases in the information.  -Be open to experiment with different tools. While many AI models appear to serve the same function, each produces distinct outputs. Therefore, it is essential to remain open-minded, avoiding reliance on a single tool or company, and instead choosing the best option based on the specific objective or focus of each task.  -Be meticulous and document workflows. This has been critical not only for streamlining our work but also for enabling content auditing when needed.  -From a technical standpoint: test various tools and understand their strengths. For example, when analyzing content, we found that LLMs were more powerful than traditional NLP libraries for understanding situations and context. However, for counting terms and entities, NLP libraries performed better—they were faster, more efficient, and less expensive than LLMs.",español,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/asi-nos-hablo-milei-nueve-trucos-del-relato-libertario-para-construir-un-nuevo-sentido-comun-nid10122024/#/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1htosAcDuxDcZcsjtD3788Z97G3kGxMXP1v1SVGAxxt8&titulo=Unpacking+right-wing+rhetoric:+what+data+reveals+about+Milei%E2%80%99s+discourse&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/asi-nos-hablo-milei-nueve-trucos-del-relato-libertario-para-construir-un-nuevo-sentido-comun-nid10122024/#/,https://youtu.be/HQQilyX4D-4,"Martín Rodríguez Yebra, Martín Pascua, Florencia Rodríguez Altube, Pablo Loscri, Alejandra Bliffeld, Florencia Abd, María Rodríguez Alcobendas, Natalia Louzau, Gabriela Bouret, Gastón de la Llana, Nicolás Cassese, Natalia Sarramone, Julieta Bollini, Matías Boela.","This project was developed by LA NACION Data, the Digital Narratives team, the Video team, and the Politics section.

With its ritzy beach clubs, high-end shopping, and ultramodern skyline, the Gulf city is known as a playground for the world’s rich and famous. But slippery regulations have also turned its property market into a magnet for another class of global elites: alleged criminals, fugitives, political figures, and sanctioned individuals seeking to stash their money abroad. A collaboration involving more than 70 media outlets, Dubai Unlocked identified scores of individuals who used Dubai to hide illicit wealth.","The Dubai Unlocked investigation exposed how Dubai’s lax financial regulations enable money laundering, corruption, and sanctions evasion. The revelations triggered political and regulatory scrutiny. European lawmakers, including members of the European Parliament, publicly questioned the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) decision to remove the UAE from its “grey list” of countries at risk for money laundering. They cited Dubai Unlocked as evidence that Dubai remains a hub for illicit financial activity and called for stricter oversight. Discussions within the European Commission also highlighted the need for stronger real estate regulations to prevent financial crime.  Beyond policymaking, the series reached a wide audience through media coverage in outlets like The Guardian, Le Monde, and Süddeutsche Zeitung. It raised public awareness about Dubai’s role in facilitating global corruption and illicit finance, prompting calls for accountability. Dubai Unlocked exemplifies the power of collaborative investigative reporting  to expose wrongdoing and influence meaningful policy discussions on a global scale.","The Dubai Unlocked investigation was conducted under significant political, legal, and security constraints. Dubai is known for its restrictive press environment, pervasive surveillance, and harsh penalties for investigative reporting.   Access to data was another major challenge. The investigation was built on leaked property records from the Dubai Land Department and public utilities—datasets that are otherwise inaccessible due to the UAE’s strict financial secrecy laws. Cross-referencing this data with official records and other leaks required meticulous verification and innovative investigative techniques.  Given the complexity of the data—over 4 million data points—reporters leveraged advanced data analysis tools, machine learning, and collaborative platforms to identify ownership structures and track illicit financial flows. The scale of the collaboration, involving over 70 media partners, required coordination across different legal jurisdictions, languages, and technical capabilities.  Despite these challenges, Dubai Unlocked exemplifies the power of cross-border investigative journalism, exposing financial crime in one of the world’s most opaque markets. It demonstrates the critical role of data-driven reporting in holding power to account, even in environments designed to suppress scrutiny.","The Dubai Unlocked investigation required sophisticated data techniques and technologies to analyze over 4 million records from a leaked dataset of Dubai property ownership. Given the UAE’s secrecy around property ownership, journalists built a SQL database combining leaked data with official sources like the Dubai Land Department’s Open Data website. This allowed verification of ownership records through government tools.  Challenges included inconsistent data, missing property numbers, and incomplete nationality information. The team resolved these through advanced merging techniques, cross-referencing identifiers like phone numbers and emails, and inferring nationalities via domain endings and country codes. To extract hidden ownership details, a scraping tool was developed for service charge invoices found in the backend of an official site, shared via Google Colab.  To ensure efficient collaboration, data was segmented and distributed via Datasette, making anonymized sales and rental records from Bayut’s API searchable. Additional scraping efforts by partners, such as E24 and Le Monde, helped retrieve rental contract data. OCCRP also leveraged C4ADS Seamless Horizons for secure data sharing.  Through this combination of automated processes, manual verification, and international collaboration, Dubai Unlocked exposed illicit financial flows and provided unprecedented insight into one of the world’s most secretive property markets.","Dubai Unlocked demonstrates how journalists can overcome data access barriers, collaborate across borders, and use innovative techniques to investigate financial secrecy. One key lesson is the power of structured data analysis. By merging, cleaning, and verifying millions of records, the investigative team transformed messy leaked data into usable, searchable information—an approach applicable to many investigative projects dealing with incomplete or inconsistent datasets.  Another lesson is leveraging official sources creatively. Despite the UAE’s opacity, journalists cross-referenced leaks with publicly available transaction databases, government tools, and even hidden service charge invoices found on official websites. This highlights the importance of persistence and technical skills, such as scraping and API usage, to uncover hidden connections.  Collaboration was critical to success. The project involved journalists and data experts across multiple countries, sharing methodologies and findings through tools like Datasette and Google Colab. This model shows how large investigations can be decentralized while maintaining rigorous verification processes.  Finally, Dubai Unlocked underscores the growing role of technology in investigative reporting. From SQL databases to scraping tools, journalists need to develop or collaborate with experts in data science to analyze vast amounts of information effectively. These strategies can help reporters worldwide tackle complex, opaque financial systems.","English, French, Russian",https://www.occrp.org/en/project/dubai-unlocked,https://cdn.occrp.org/projects/dubai-unlocked/en/,https://www.occrp.org/en/project/dubai-unlocked/singapore-money-laundering-suspects-invested-huge-sums-in-dubai-property,https://www.occrp.org/en/project/dubai-unlocked/top-crypto-scammers-managed-to-sell-dubai-properties-after-being-charged,Please follow this link for full project team: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wtN-obdpyMkWZqOjZ1MuKDSRB1zJo8Vjf9tna3bXxbU/edit?tab=t.0,The Dubai Unlocked project is a collaborative effort involving over 70 media outlets located across the globe.

Data centre emissions are normally opaque and closely guarded by the companies that own them. Our cross-border investigation lifts the lid on these emissions, shining a light on a typically under-reported aspect of these power-hungry goliaths.  Our project also highlights how some planned data centres intend to be powered by natural gas, undermining efforts by large data centre operators to portray their installations as being powered by clean energy.","Our groundbreaking investigation had a significant impact on the data centre debate in Ireland, exposing flaws in the Irish government’s policy of continuing to attract data centre investment.  The [main article](https://www.thejournal.ie/investigates-data-centres-6554698-Nov2024/) in ‘Data Crunch’ received a high number of online views (over 40k) and there was coverage of the investigation across local and national media outlets in Ireland, including radio and online news, in the days following publication.  There was further coverage of our investigation on Irish national radio two months later as part of a debate on data centres, highlighting how our investigation contributed significantly to the public debate.   It also received widespread coverage on social media, with local, national and European Parliament politicians sharing our findings.  Environmental NGOs and advocacy groups also shared our work, including university professors, Irish Doctors for the Environment, Friends of the Earth and Extinction Rebellion Global.  Our findings were replicated in [academic research](https://www.thejournal.ie/data-centre-growth-research-electricity-fossil-fuels-6567066-Dec2024/) published by University College Cork the following week, which received widespread media coverage.  A number of readers also got in contact, praising the investigation, calling it “fantastic work” and saying our team was “providing a vital service to the nation”.","Ireland has been described as the ’data centre capital of Europe’ with many big tech companies, such as Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, operating multiple data centres in the country.   However, in recent years the amount of energy these power-hungry data centres consume has come under the microscope. Electricity consumption from data centres has grown significantly in recent years, with it now surpassing urban residential consumption. The rise of AI has also fuelled further data centre growth.  In response to growing concerns over capacity of the national electrical grid, Ireland’s electric power transmission operator, EirGrid, imposed a de facto moratorium on connecting new data centres in 2022. This has, as the investigation reveals, pushed data centre operators to shift towards using natural gas to power their operations, a move that will have significant environmental consequences.  Information on data centres in Ireland can be opaque and difficult to obtain. For this project, reporter Conor O’Carroll spent a great deal of time researching, obtaining and analysing CO2 emissions data as well as planning records in order to build a clearer picture of the true scale of the data centre industry for Irish readers.","A large aspect of this investigation was sourcing emissions data for these data centres. As companies don’t reliably report this information, this EU database was used to identify emissions from backup and emergency generators attached to data centres. This provided a glimpse into just how polluting these installations can be.  Our cross-border partner Pablo Jiménez Arandia added a European context to this in an [article revealing](https://www.thejournal.ie/investigates-data-centres-spain-6576135-Dec2024/) how some data centre operators are choosing to move to Spain, with potential environmental consequences there also. In order to do this, he travelled to the Aragon region to visit, photograph and map the data centres there.  O’Carroll also trawled through 20 years worth of planning records to build a list of data centres that had been granted planning permission in Ireland. This list was then cross-referenced with satellite imagery from Google Maps, Google StreetView and other web sources to determine whether the data centre had been built and was still operational. This was also used to determine who owned the data centre as it was not always immediately clear.  The emissions data and data centre locations were then put into Datawrapper to create visualisations.","Other journalists can learn that even when there isn’t direct or complete data on something that needs investigating, there are other methods of approaching the story.   By using the data reported to the EU Emissions Trading System database from generators, our investigation highlighted a different aspect of how these large, power-hungry installations can have a detrimental impact on the environment.  It also shows the value of making use of official databases, like planning records, to identify details of projects that are often not widely advertised. O’Carroll utilised this to build a list of data centres in operation in Ireland, something that was not readily available.   Initially, we asked Irish State body EirGrid for a list of data centre connections through a Freedom of Information request but were refused citing corporate confidentiality. Pivoting to using planning records to build a similar list highlights how journalists can overcome obstacles by using information already in the public domain.",English,https://www.thejournal.ie/investigates-data-centres-6554698-Nov2024/,https://www.thejournal.ie/investigates-data-centres-spain-6576135-Dec2024/,https://www.thejournal.ie/data-centre-growth-research-electricity-fossil-fuels-6567066-Dec2024/,,Conor O’Carroll & Pablo Jiménez Arandia,"Data Crunch, an investigation into the environmental cost of data centres, is by Conor O’Carroll from The Journal Investigates in Ireland and independent journalist Pablo Jiménez Arandia in Spain.

Our team uncovere, for the first time, how the ”Mundipharma” group aggressively marketed dangerous opioids as less addictive and we calculated the amount of money flowing from Europe into the Sackler family’s pockets. We conducted numerous interviews, reviewed thousands of pages of exclusive internal documents, and analyzed leaked photos and videos that provide exclusive evidence of a connection that the Sackler family continues to deny.","After publication, prosecutors from the United States came forward to us and wanted to include the figures we had calculated in the US court proceedings against Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family. Moreover, our research was discussed in specialist medical publications such as the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  Most importantly, however, we have reached out to those affected. In numerous letters to the editors following publication, as well as in the comment columns below the individual articles, personal experiences with opioid medication are described and the lack of information lamented. People report losing loved ones to prescription opioid addiction. These are people who still fall through the cracks when it comes to statistics on drug-related deaths in Germany and other European countries.","The challenges encountered in this investigation presented themselves on four levels:  The Sackler Family: Using a team of PR professionals and lawyers, the Sackler family applied pressure on our team and international partners even before publication.  The Numbers: International opioid research is also heavily influenced by Mundipharma—reliable and independent studies are rare. The research team painstakingly compiled data from various sources, for instance through FOIA requests. Policymakers do not yet sufficiently acknowledge the abuse problem due to a lack of data, but we were on site: at addiction treatment centers where an increasing number of people, addicted via prescriptions, end up—here, doctors are sounding the alarm.  The Employees: For months, we contacted hundreds of former employees of Mundipharma. Some shared very detailed internal information. An insider provided us with documents from the US legal proceedings against Purdue Pharma. In the end we had hundreds of pages of documents, including email correspondences and corporate presentations.  The Opioid Business: Documenting how much money the Sacklers make from the opioid business in Europe was hard work due to the opaque corporate structure. Together Finance Uncovered, we analyzed the globally networked business and how the money flows through various trust funds and tax havens.","For our investigation, we built our own dataset from scratch using leaked court documents, whistleblower information, and public webpages.

Netherlands,"Follow the Money, De Tijd",Big,Shortlist,,Almost 200 Russian ships suspected of spying in the North Sea,2024-06-20,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Map","Scraping, QGIS, PostgreSQL, Python, DuckDB","Our investigation examined Russian vessels in the North Sea suspected of surveillance or sabotage activities targeting subsea infrastructure. Through comprehensive analysis of geospatial data tracking both infrastructure locations and vessel movements, we identified nearly 200 Russian vessels exhibiting suspicious behavior patterns near critical underwater assets. Our methodology involved cross-referencing position data with known infrastructure coordinates and analyzing deviation from standard maritime routes. The significance of our findings was later validated when journalists from multiple European media outlets independently corroborated our conclusions through their own investigations, confirming the concerning pattern of Russian maritime activities in these sensitive areas.","Our investigation into suspicious Russian vessel activities in the North Sea generated significant real-world impact across multiple domains. Following publication in the Netherlands and Belgium, the story gained substantial traction, being widely circulated by international media outlets and reaching global audiences concerned about maritime security threats.  Most notably, the findings prompted concrete governmental action. Both the Dutch and Belgian authorities responded by enhancing their maritime surveillance protocols specifically targeting the vessels we identified, demonstrating the investigation’s direct influence on national security measures.  Beyond the immediate response, our work established a foundation for expanded journalistic inquiry across Europe. The data collection methodology and analytical framework we developed proved invaluable for subsequent investigations into the Russian shadow fleet (The Shadow Fleet Secrets). This technical foundation enabled journalists to produce follow-up reports exploring broader security implications, including potential espionage operations, infrastructure sabotage capabilities, and environmental threats posed by these vessels.  By creating reusable data analysis tools and sharing our approach with other media organizations, we fostered collaborative cross-border journalism addressing critical security vulnerabilities. This ripple effect of continued investigations based on our initial work has maintained public and governmental attention on maritime security concerns in European waters.","This investigation navigated a particularly complex and evolving topic, with the geopolitical landscape constantly shifting due to new sanctions against Russia and diplomatic ambiguities surrounding maritime activities. This required continuous adaptation of our methodology to account for emerging patterns and changing vessel behaviors.  A significant challenge was the disparity between multiple data sources. Maritime tracking systems, infrastructure maps, and vessel registries each presented varying degrees of completeness, accuracy, and update frequency. Reconciling these inconsistencies demanded sophisticated data cleaning and cross-validation techniques to create a reliable analytical foundation.  Importantly, while commercial maritime data solutions exist, their prohibitive costs would have made this investigation impossible for many newsrooms. Instead, we developed methods utilizing primarily open data sources, including AIS tracking information, publicly available infrastructure maps, and open maritime registries. This approach democratizes investigative capabilities, allowing newsrooms with limited resources to conduct similar investigations.  By prioritizing open-source tools and transparent methodologies, we’ve created a replicable framework for maritime investigations that doesn’t require substantial financial investment. This approach ensures that crucial security journalism remains accessible to diverse media organizations regardless of their financial resources.","Our investigation relied on a robust geospatial data analysis framework centered on Python programming. We extensively utilized specialized libraries like GeoPandas for spatial operations, enabling us to process and analyze vessel movements in relation to infrastructure coordinates.  The foundation of our analysis was Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, which presented significant methodological challenges. AIS transmissions can be manipulated, contain gaps, or suffer from technical limitations. Therefore, we did lots of extra research in geospatial application of AIS data to make sure our methodology was sound.  For data processing efficiency, we employed a dual-database approach. PostgreSQL with PostGIS extensions handled complex spatial queries across large datasets, while DuckDB provided rapid in-memory analysis capabilities for iterative investigation of suspicious movement patterns.  Throughout the investigation, we maintained ongoing consultation with maritime security experts and industry analysts who helped validate our methodological approach and interpret unusual vessel behaviors within proper operational contexts. This collaboration was crucial for distinguishing between normal maritime operations and genuinely suspicious activities.  By combining programming expertise with domain knowledge, we created a systematic approach to identify vessels exhibiting behaviors consistent with infrastructure surveillance, including extended loitering, unusual course changes near critical assets, and pattern-of-life deviations.","This investigation demonstrates how newsrooms can leverage open-source technologies to tackle complex geopolitical stories, even with limited resources. Perhaps most significantly, we completed this sophisticated data investigation with just one data journalist, proving that impactful investigative journalism doesn’t require large specialized teams.  Our project offers a practical blueprint for implementing geospatial analysis in journalistic work. By utilizing Python’s geospatial libraries and spatial database capabilities, we transformed raw tracking data into actionable intelligence about vessel behaviors. This technical approach can be adapted to various investigative scenarios involving movement patterns, from monitoring environmental threats to tracking illegal activities.  We prioritized transparency and reproducibility by publishing our complete methodology, code repositories, and data sources on GitHub. This open-science approach not only strengthens the credibility of our findings but creates a foundation for collaborative journalism across organizations. Other newsrooms have already built upon our work, extending the investigation’s impact.  The project exemplifies how data-driven journalism can function effectively even when commercial data solutions are financially out of reach. By creatively combining accessible data sources and open-source tools, we’ve created a model for resource-constrained newsrooms to conduct sophisticated investigations that can directly influence public policy and national security decisions.","English, Dutch",https://www.ftm.eu/articles/north-sea-1-suspicious-russian-ships-in-european-waters-and-havens?share=rz%2BTtRL/cJO2O9Wbr2FpUDrXHpVOQJrkOPHKyHQ7EFpuYSbkNB0iq/lDZzZVGWE%3D,https://github.com/followthemoney/russian_vessels,,,"Dimitri Tokmetzis, Birte Schohaus, Lars Bové, Stephanie De Smedt",full list of biographies available upon request

For 70 years after the war, rapid growth took the spotlight, while those left behind were ignored.  Furthermore, elderly poverty is often reduced to income, but money alone fails to capture its full reality—housing changes, daily struggles, and life trajectories remain unseen.  This project analyzes big data on movement patterns to reveal how impoverished elderly individuals live compared to others.  By accessing vast mobile phone movement data, we move beyond financial metrics to offer a deeper, more nuanced understanding of aging in poverty and its impact on daily life.","Until now, big data on movement patterns had never been used to analyze elderly poverty. This project went beyond tracking movement; it identified impoverished seniors by leveraging ”fare discount” data, which telecom companies provide to those eligible for government welfare. This was a groundbreaking discovery—an entirely new method for studying elderly poverty.  By analyzing this data, we found an anomaly: Seolleung Station, a major business district, had unexpectedly become a hub for impoverished seniors.  Curious about this, we conducted on-site research and discovered a thriving multi-level marketing industry targeting impoverished elderly individuals. With so many lacking financial security in retirement, businesses exploiting their vulnerability were flourishing.  By creatively integrating movement data with residential patterns, we provided unprecedented insights into their lives. This interdisciplinary reporting extended beyond video documentaries, incorporating in-depth text analysis and advanced visualizations like contour mapping to expose the realities of elderly poverty.  Had sparking widespread public awareness. Over 1 million people watched the documentary on YouTube, amplifying the issue and raising social consciousness.  Most notably, it won the ”Data-Driven Investigative Reporting of the Year” award from the Korea Data Journalism Awards. It also received the ”Specialized Reporting of the Year” award from the Broadcast Journalists Club (BJC).","Various forms of data analysis not included in the broadcast were introduced through online text articles. A link to the Korean site is provided for reference. Even with Google Translate and the visuals, readers can uncover fascinating insights—so we highly encourage exploration.  Notably, KT, one of South Korea’s largest telecom companies, had never before provided such vast data for analyzing elderly poverty. The company’s bold decision, crucial to this project, was not prominently highlighted in the broadcast.  Equally important—but not fully acknowledged—was the work of data analysts who transformed raw data into GIS-based insights.  Data Processing and Methodology KT’s mobile base station data was cleaned and processed to remove signal noise. From this, we estimated nighttime (residential) and daytime (activity) locations, adjusting for market share and other factors to approximate the full population.  Since elderly data was crucial, we did not use pre-existing datasets. Instead, we refined data processing specifically for the elderly population to ensure greater accuracy.  From the resulting dataset, we filtered individuals aged 60 and above, then classified them based on discounted (low-income) vs. standard mobile plans for analysis.  Technologies Data Processing & Analysis: Spark, Hive, R Data Visualization: Deck.gl, Turf.js, QGIS","Using KT’s mobile base station data, we cleaned it by removing signal noise and estimated nighttime and daytime locations, adjusting for market share.  Instead of pre-existing datasets, we refined the process for elderly data to ensure accuracy.  The mobility data includes 928,837,274 records from May 2021 to May 2024, estimating hourly population. We added discount plan data to distinguish low-income individuals.  Attributes included timestamp, age group, grid location, residential district, discount status, weekday/weekend, and population count.  ==Data Collection/Analysis - Mobility Data We filtered individuals aged 60+ and separated discounted vs. standard mobile plans for analysis.  Movement Visualization We visualized departure and arrival counts for each grid. Using ”return” data, we excluded locations with more than 50% return-related movement. Yellow circles highlighted areas with high movement outside residential zones.  ==Contour Mapping We recalculated movement per grid, adjusting values for discounted and standard plans. The resulting grid values created a contour map showing areas with high positive values in blue. We observed patterns of low-income elderly gathering on weekends and weekdays.  ==Technologies Used Data Processing & Analysis: Spark, Hive, R Data Visualization: Deck.gl, Turf.js, QGIS","To see truly eye-opening insights, one must approach data with a fresh perspective, striving to uncover what might otherwise go unnoticed. The value of data lies in the scenes it reveals—scenes that could never have been known or imagined without it. When reporting with data, the effort should focus on finding that ”something new.” The use of data in bringing the hidden issue of Seolleung Station to light is a prime example of this.  Other journalists can learn several key lessons from this project. First, through dense on-the-ground reporting, it clearly illustrated where government policies should be directed. By linking data with real-life situations, it revealed the characteristics of housing poverty and highlighted areas where elderly pyramid schemes are concentrated.  Second, it made clear that South Korea’s elderly poverty problem cannot be attributed to personal failings such as laziness, negligence, or foolishness. Instead, it is a structural issue that needs to be addressed.  Third, it demonstrated the power of big data to identify problems in real time.

Peru,"Mongabay Latam, Earth Genome, Pulitzer Center.",Big,Shortlist,,Death flights: indigenous leaders murdered in a territory invaded by 67  drug trafficking routes,2024-11-12,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Illustration, Video, Map, Satellite images, Audio, Environment, Gun violence, Human rights","Animation, AI/Machine learning, Sensor, QGIS, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Python","After a year of investigation, Mongabay Latam managed to detect 67 clandestine airstrips linked to drug trafficking in the Amazonian regions of Ucayali, Huánuco and Pasco in Peru. Thirty of these airstrips are located within and 26 around indigenous territories. The existence of these routes explains the growing violence in the area, which has led to the murder of at least 15 indigenous leaders who were fighting against illegal economies.  The team spoke with more than 60 sources in the field, visited communities invaded by drug traffickers and corroborated hundreds of data and satellite information with official sources.","The investigation managed to reveal the extent of the presence of drug trafficking in the Peruvian Amazon, an issue that is little covered by the country’s media.  The findings attracted media attention, prompting a broad public debate on the issue and the government’s lack of action. In fact, the stories were republished 25 times by media outlets in Latin America and seven times in Peru — some of them, the most important in the country.   They also managed to reach decision makers and experts from civil society. Former Prime Minister Alberto Otárola and Congresswoman Ruth Luque, who is a member of the Commission of Afro-Peruvian Amazonian Andean Peoples, Environment and Ecology, both spoke out on the issue.  On the other hand, the use of an AI tool such as that used by Mongabay Latam journalists opens up a field for new investigations in the Amazon that allow for an understanding of the complexity of organized crime in these territories and its impact on indigenous peoples. In fact, two media outlets highlighted the methodology used as “revolutionary.”  The special was also chosen among the 10 best investigations of the year in Spanish by the Global Investigative Journalism Network.","Peru is the world’s second largest producer of coca. However, little is known about the effects of the presence of drug trafficking in the Amazon. In the face of increasing violence, one of our main concerns was security. In Huánuco, Pasco and Ucayali, not only have 15 indigenous leaders been murdered since 2020. In addition, 28 more are threatened. Unfortunately, the necessary conditions to protect the lives of our sources do not exist in the country, which required meticulous work to confirm the facts without endangering their safety. In the field, we spoke with more than 60 people. On the other hand, most of these sources live in locations without internet or telephone access, which complicated reporting. We were also very careful to establish which locations could or could not appear with their names on the maps. For example, the names of two indigenous communities that registered 15 clandestine airstrips were concealed. Sources indicated that the departure of drug flights could be heard daily in that area.  We used rigorous security protocols for our reporters’ visit. Finally, when the investigation was over, we continued to monitor the safety of our interviewees.","In the first stage of the investigation, databases were analyzed with information from tracks identified by Open Street Map, official tracks reported by the Peruvian Ministry of Transport and Communications, and samples of drug routes identified by the Anti-Drug Directorate of the National Police and the Regional Government of Ucayali. This data was gathered by Mongabay Latam through requests for public information and contacts with sources. With this data, Earth Genome created a search tool with artificial intelligence to detect deforestation patterns similar to the clues we had located before. In the space of four months, the tool detected around 128 possible clues in six Amazonian regions of Peru: Loreto, Ucayali, Huánuco, Pasco, Cusco and Madre de Dios. In a second stage, a team from Mongabay Latam began the process of verifying each of the leads detected. The use of free satellite search platforms such as Global Forest Watch was key to checking the coordinates detected by Earth Genome and then seeing the closest point where verification was possible. We managed to speak to at least 60 sources to corroborate the use of each of the leads.","We highlight two lessons learned. Firstly, the use of AI tools to monitor large and difficult-to-access areas such as the Amazon opens up a way to detect and report the advance of organized crime in these territories. This methodology makes it possible to report on the situation of vulnerable populations, such as indigenous peoples, surrounded by violence and continually ignored by the government and society.  Secondly, we highlight the learning process of establishing safety protocols during reporting, fieldwork and after publication. In many cases, the names of sources were omitted, as was the exact location of several communities that the reporters reached. The protocol for journalists traveling to these locations was also tightened. For the publication, after consultation with the entire team, the credits for the entire team were also omitted.

Using publicly available and FOIAed data, Grist located millions of acres of land taken from hundreds of Indigenous nations, land that provides revenue to land-grant universities, K-12 schools, hospitals, prisons, and other beneficiaries, through fossil fuel exploration, mining, timber harvesting, and other extractive industries. Our series, Misplaced Trust, explores how stolen wealth continues to transform public institutions and provides insight into the relationship between colonialism, higher education, and climate change in the Western United States.","As a result of our reporting, the main character in our primary story, Alina Sierra, saw her student debt to the University of Arizona and the federal government completely forgiven. Since publication, our data and stories have inspired localized reporting in Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming; coverage at the PBS Newshour; and spawned countless media appearances. It also continues to be a resource for academics and journalists into 2025, with even more reporting scheduled.   This past summer, international scholars met in Bådåddo, Norway, to discuss the series and call for additional scholarship culminating in two upcoming events: In February, students at Colorado State University held a hackathon to create a “landback index” for Indigenous nations to identify unused, low-performing, or border-adjacent acreage that could be reacquired by tribes; and this spring, the University of California Davis will hold a symposium specifically focused on land-grant universities and our reporting.  We have seen a slow but steady move toward action, and remain heartened by the American Indian Graduate Center’s Rick Williams’ words that had our reporting been available 50 years ago “it would have changed the history of Indian Education in the United States.”","Our two-year trust lands investigation navigated significant data fragmentation challenges across state systems. Some states lacked digitized records or could only offer unmapped parcels, creating technical barriers that would have made this project impossible just five years ago.  We pioneered a collaborative model by integrating Indigenous scholars (Amanda Tachine, An Garagiola, and Audrianna Goodwin) as active partners rather than mere sources, creating a hybrid academic-journalistic approach that significantly strengthened the reporting’s depth and cultural sensitivity.  The historical record presented inherent biases, representing U.S. legal perspectives rather than Indigenous epistemologies. Without a centralized database connecting state trust lands to their origins and ongoing institutional funding, we built this resource from scratch by combining state repositories, federal cession records, and financial data.  Our methodology integrated GIS techniques with historical research, requiring sophisticated spatial joins, clipping, and deduplication processes to connect contemporary land parcels with historical treaties. We also calculated inflation-adjusted payments Indigenous nations received, navigating discrepancies in financial records.  The project required addressing politically sensitive historical injustices while maintaining journalistic rigor. We prioritized transparency by making all materials publicly available, acknowledging data limitations while creating a framework that can be expanded through continued collaboration with Indigenous communities and researchers.","We employed extensive GIS analysis to reconstruct connections between 8.2 million acres of state trust lands and their Indigenous origins. This effort required:  **Software tools:** QGIS for surveying and planning spatial operations, custom Python scripts using GeoPandas, Shapely, and Rtree for spatial joins and indexing. We created interactive visualizations with MapLibre, D3.js, and SvelteKit, using PMTiles for efficient rendering of large datasets, optimized for areas with limited connectivity, including reservations.  **Data integration techniques:** We combined fragmented datasets from state repositories, historical treaties, and Bureau of Indian Affairs records through spatial joins, R-tree indexing, and geometric deduplication. When states provided incomplete data, we developed custom cleaning scripts and queried state spatial servers to reconstruct boundaries.  **Methodological innovations:** We calculated inflation-adjusted payments to Indigenous nations and built the first centralized database connecting trust lands to their origins and funding. All datasets and documentation are publicly available on GitHub, and we remain committed to an open-source ethos.  **Collaborative approach:** We integrated Indigenous scholars as active research partners rather than sources, creating a hybrid academic-journalistic methodology that strengthened reporting while centering Indigenous perspectives. Prior to publication, we embargoed data for outlets and held virtual training sessions for reporting partners.","Our investigation into state trust lands offers specific insights for journalists tackling complex, data-heavy topics with historical dimensions:  First, fragmented data systems require creative technical solutions. We developed custom scripts to standardize inconsistent state records and employed R-tree indexing to efficiently process spatial relationships between parcels, demonstrating how to build cohesive datasets from scattered public records.  Second, create multiple entry points to your reporting. Our three-tiered approach—narrative text, interactive visualizations with toggle options for Indigenous and non-Indigenous users, and open GitHub repositories—meets audiences where they are while maximizing impact.  Third, integrate subject-matter experts directly into your reporting process. Rather than treating Indigenous scholars as mere sources, we incorporated them as collaborators, leading to discoveries like our main character, identified through Amanda Tachine’s research on Indigenous erasure in college settings.  Fourth, design technical elements for all audiences. Our visualizations using MapLibre and PMTiles were optimized for areas with limited connectivity, ensuring accessibility for the communities most affected by our reporting.  Finally, successful open-source journalism continues beyond publication.

Using nearly 100 Instagram accounts to test multiple types of censorship on the platform, The Markup’s investigation found that Instagram was 8.5 times more likely to suppress nongraphic photos of war than other types of posts. We also found thatInstagram deleted captions and hid comments without notification, suppressed hashtags, and limited users’ ability to appeal moderation decisions.","Our first-of-its-kind methodology has become an important resource for anyone trying to measure shadowbanning, ranging from researchers at Princeton to journalists in the Netherlands. After publication, The Markup met with researchers to lend expertise. Nieuwsuur, a Dutch current affairs show, cited the investigation as the “most extensive research into this specific topic done so far,” and replicated our results with its [own experiments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCR-Ngz35Yk).

Automated Censorship resonated deeply with readers and the Instagram community. The series had some of the highest engagement since The Markup started publishing online. Several community members said they had been waiting years for an investigation like this one.  One of our sources had a “one-year strike” placed on his account for “supporting violence,” When we asked Meta to explain the strike, they restored his access.   Over 160 news outlets, newsletters, and resource guides have republished or featured the investigation.","Shortly after Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel and the beginning of Israel’s retaliatory war on Gaza, people accused Instagram of censoring their posts supporting Palestine. They said Instagram was shadowbanning them: deliberately limiting the reach of their content without notice, and failing to offer them any way to appeal.  In the context of Israel’s war on Gaza, social media has been the only way for many people to share lifesaving information, document the war, and bring awareness to human rights abuses. If these posts were being shadowbanned, The Markup wanted to investigate.  Through our own testing, The Markup found Instagram heavily demoting nongraphic images of war, shadowbanning comments, deleting captions without notification, erratically suppressing hashtags, and denying users the option to appeal when Instagram deleted their comments as spam.  Along with the main investigation, Markup reporters published an [extensive methodology](https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/02/25/how-we-investigated-shadowbanning-on-instagram) to facilitate further research into online censorship. The Markup also released [a guide on what to do](https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/02/25/what-to-do-if-you-think-youve-been-shadowbanned-on-instagram) if you think you’re shadowbanned on Instagram (co-published with USA Today), an [explainer](https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/03/01/how-automated-content-moderation-works-even-when-it-doesnt-work) on how content moderation works at large social media platforms, and an [Arabic translation](https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/03/21/instagram-shadowban-investigation-arabic) of the investigation.","To pull off this investigation, Markup reporters Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett and Tomas Apodaca reviewed hundreds of screenshots and videos sent by sources, analyzed metadata scraped from thousands of accounts and posts, spoke with content moderation experts and current and former employees of the largest social media companies, and interviewed affected users. The information gathered was used to design what is, to our knowledge, the first field audit of Instagram’s content moderation algorithms.   Markup reporters published a [methodology](https://themarkup.org/automated-censorship/2024/02/25/how-we-investigated-shadowbanning-on-instagram) to facilitate further research into online censorship, a guide on what to do if you think you are shadowbanned on Instagram (co-published with USA Today), an explainer on how content moderation works, and an Arabic translation of the investigation.","Other journalists can learn valuable lessons from this project about investigating opaque systems like social media algorithms. The Markup’s approach demonstrates how to overcome barriers to data access through creative, rigorous experimentation. By designing a field audit using nearly 100 Instagram accounts, we were able to move beyond anecdotal claims and uncover measurable patterns of censorship.  This project highlights the importance of iterative testing, persistent troubleshooting, and maintaining ethical standards when navigating platform restrictions. Importantly, the investigation didn’t stop at publication. We shared our methodology, created a user guide on identifying shadowbanning, and published our findings in Palestinian Arabic to ensure accessibility for affected communities.

France,"ARTE.tv , Youtube Arte Available in English, French, German, Italian, Polish and Spanish.",Big,Shortlist,,Migrant Pushbacks by Greek Coastguards,2024-10-30,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Immigration, Human rights","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap","Since 2020, thousands of migrants have been pushed back into the sea after arriving in Greece. Sources investigates these illegal ”pushbacks,” which violate European and international law. On February 23, 2024, a group of migrants shared a TikTok video in which they claimed to be stranded on the Greek island of Farmakonisi. Hours later, they were seen drifting on a life-raft in footage shot by the Turkish coastguard. Sources uncovers the origin of these life-rafts, notably produced by the brand Lalizas. While Greece tries to cover up the scale, this investigation reveals Frontex’s complicity and questions the European Commission’s responsibility.","This investigation was featured in Télérama (a French cultural magazine), where it received a 3T rating. It was shared on social media by several migrant rights organizations and included in their newsletters. The journalist behind the investigation was personally contacted by some of these organizations, who expressed gratitude for the in-depth exploration of the origin of life rafts—equipment typically reserved for sea rescues.","This investigation exposes the systematic use of life rafts in illegal migrant pushbacks by Greek authorities, a practice that has been repeatedly denied by the Greek government despite overwhelming evidence. Since 2020, Greece has been accused of pushing back migrants attempting to reach the EU, but Greek officials have dismissed these accusations as ’fake news’, often claiming that images and reports have been manipulated. The Sources team carefully reviewed more than 1,200 reports from the Turkish coastguard and cross-referenced them with photos, videos and data from organisations such as Forensic Architecture and Aegean Boat Report.  For the first time, this research sheds light on the misuse of life-rafts - equipment intended for rescue operations - by the Greek coastguard to forcibly push migrants back into the sea. These rafts, typically used in life-saving operations, have been turned into tools of repression, exacerbating the risks migrants already face. Despite the Greek government’s continued denials, this investigation reveals the disturbing reality of human rights abuses at Europe’s borders and draws attention to the responsibilities of both national and European institutions.","For this investigation, we used a range of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) techniques and investigative tools to verify and cross-check information about migrant pushbacks in the Aegean Sea. We began by scraping and analysing over 1,200 Turkish Coast Guard reports documenting both rescue operations and pushbacks. Each report included photos, videos and operation sheets detailing the location, number of migrants rescued and the condition of the life-rafts. By reviewing these reports, we were able to ensure that no duplicate cases were included. We also worked with a database from Forensic Architecture, a research group specialising in geospatial and imagery analysis. They categorised pushback cases as ’verified’ or ’documented’ based on additional sources such as migrant footage, NGO reports and journalistic investigations. We worked with Aegean Boat Report (ABR), an NGO that tracks migrant movements, which provided real-time GPS data and images of pushbacks. We cross-referenced this data with Turkish Coast Guard reports to verify locations and times. Lastly, we traced the origins of the life rafts used in the pushbacks by reviewing tenders and conducting interviews with experts, ultimately identifying the manufacturers involved in the production of these rafts.","This investigation highlights the need to examine the systems and tools that facilitate human rights abuses. A key lesson is the importance of cross-checking multiple sources of data - such as government reports, NGO data and direct testimony - to ensure accuracy and prevent misinformation. The use of images, video and GPS coordinates to verify the location of migrants in real time shows how technology can be used to strengthen journalistic work. In addition, working with specialised organisations such as Forensic Architecture and Aegean Boat Report proved crucial in confirming the details of each case and accessing data not readily available to the public.This investigation also demonstrates the importance of continuing to investigate border violence in Europe. While the problem of pushbacks in Greece is well known, it is less understood that these pushbacks are often carried out with equipment typically intended for sea rescue and funded by the European Union. Investigating public tenders and questioning the companies supplying this equipment is another way of establishing responsibility and getting answers to human rights violations that have been going on for years and to which both Greece and the European Union appear to be turning a blind eye.","français, anglais, allemand, arabe, grec",https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/117240-006-A/data-sources/,https://www.arte.tv/fr/articles/la-methode-2,,,Directed by:  Maëva Poulet  Editor-in-Chief:  Sylvain Pak Producer:  Alexandra Jousset,"Maëva Poulet is an investigative journalist specialising in digital investigations.

Brazil,"O Joio e O Trigo, agência Fiquem Sabendo",Small,Shortlist,,Série de reportagens Lobby na Comida -- agrotóxicos,2024-07-29,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Chart, Politics, Environment, Agriculture, Human rights","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R","The investigative series includes three in-depth reports and a visual story summarizing key findings. It analyzes public officials’ agendas, collected by Fiquem Sabendo alongside insider information obtained by O Joio e O Trigo, exposing the influence of the pesticide lobby on the federal government. Between 2022 and 2024, we recorded at least 752 meetings between lobbyists, associations, and industry companies and federal executive authorities—an average of one every 4 hours and 48 minutes. Lobbyists met with the Ministry of Finance during tax reform discussions and increased meetings while presidential vetoes on the new pesticide law were under review.","The reports exposed inconsistencies and a lack of transparency in Brazil’s pesticide regulation. The cross-referenced data has been used by civil society activists for political advocacy and to drive public debate. On our website, the four-part series amassed over 12,700 views, while social media posts promoting the investigation generated tens of thousands of interactions. The first report revealed how the Ministry of Finance ignored recommendations from presidential advisory councils to remove tax breaks and impose higher taxes on pesticides. The second report uncovered how the Ministry of Agriculture deliberately undermined the pesticide reduction program for a decade, highlighting the persistent lobbying within the ministry. The third report exposed inconsistencies in the Ministry of Agriculture’s stance on regulating the new pesticide law. Within a single week, two official responses to our inquiries contradicted each other. The ministry has since centralized the pesticide registration process, which was previously shared with Anvisa and Ibama. As a result, these agencies remain uncertain about their responsibilities under the new law. The series was republished by both mainstream and independent media, expanding its reach. The most popular Reels from the campaign had 75,715 views, reaching both followers and new audiences.","The investigation began in July 2024, seven months after the approval of the New Pesticide Law, which weakened regulations on these substances. The ruralist caucus holds significant influence in Congress, which debated the bill, and has consistently worked to dismantle environmental legislation. In addition to agribusiness interests, the chemical industry also played a role. The situation was further shaped by strong resistance from environmentalists and public health sectors, as well as disputes within the Executive over how to regulate the new law. International pressure was also a key factor, particularly from European markets discussing restrictions on certain pesticides and demanding stricter environmental standards from Brazil. Despite this, the ruralist caucus has continued to push its agenda forward. Data collection from the Executive’s public agenda was made possible by Agenda Transparente, a civic technology tool developed by Fiquem Sabendo. This platform scrapes and stores government website data, as official sites only provide recent meeting records. These records highlight the “revolving door” phenomenon, where public officials transition into lobbying roles for specific industries – an issue experts identify as a serious conflict of interest threatening democratic integrity. Many interview requests for meetings, documents, and government proposals were ignored or denied.","Our methodology combines both quantitative and qualitative approaches. We used Agenda Transparente, a tool developed by Fiquem Sabendo that scrapes and stores data from official government agendas. We also submitted information requests under Brazil’s Access to Information Law (LAI), equivalent to the FOIA in the U.S., interviewed public health and environmental experts, and analyzed primary sources such as official documents and reports. Based on scientific literature and media coverage, we identified key lobbyists and companies most actively defending pesticides. We also selected keywords related to these substances to investigate meetings between industry representatives and Executive branch officials. We searched for these names and terms in Agenda Transparente and analyzed the results according to our report themes: tax reform, delays in the pesticide reduction program, and the regulation of the new pesticide law. We examined the frequency, timing, topics, and composition of these meetings, cross-referencing them with other public data, such as the government’s submission of the tax reform proposal to Congress and the presidential veto review process for the new law. From this, we built timelines revealing that meetings between government officials, lobbyists, and chemical companies often occurred just days or weeks before major Executive and Legislative decisions.","This project offers key lessons for investigative journalism: - The Executive’s public agenda is a valuable source of stories. While it does not disclose meeting content, the list of participants helps identify who is influencing public policies and whose interests are being served, helping journalists and society as a whole to monitor public and private agents. - Cross-referencing data with political events enhances understanding of lobbying. Analyzing scattered records and correlating them with decisions in Congress and ministries helps reveal patterns of influence over government policies. - Strategic use of the Access to Information Law (LAI) is essential. When official sources ignore interview or document requests, persistence in obtaining public records can uncover important behind-the-scenes details. - Such investigations require resilience and methodological rigor. The process involved institutional resistance, difficulties accessing data, and interview refusals. Still, meticulous document analysis and data cross-referencing enabled the construction of a solid narrative about lobbying’s impact on the government. - Exposing transparency gaps creates social pressure: Journalism plays a vital role in revealing government accountability failures. This pressure pushes authorities toward greater transparency, especially when economic interests influence political decisions without civil society participation, directly affecting areas like public health, as seen in this investigation.",português,https://ojoioeotrigo.com.br/2024/07/agrotoxico-o-assunto-ignorado-pela-reforma-tributaria/,https://ojoioeotrigo.com.br/2024/08/ministerio-da-agricultura-boicota-programa-de-reducao-de-agrotoxicos-ha-dez-anos/,https://ojoioeotrigo.com.br/2024/08/nova-lei-de-agrotoxicos-como-funciona-ninguem-sabe/,https://ojoioeotrigo.com.br/2024/08/sete-fatos-sobre-o-lobby-dos-agrotoxicos/,"Flávia Schiochet, repórter O Joio e O Trigo Maíra Mathias, editora O Joio e O Trigo Luana Brasil, pesquisa Fiquem Sabendo Taís Seibt, supervisão e edição Fiquem Sabendo Igor Laltuf, análise de dados Fiquem Sabendo","Flávia Schiochet é jornalista e cobre alimentação e gastronomia desde 2013.

This story, done in collaboration with Visualizing Palestine, presents the devastating impact of the ongoing genocide on Palestinian cultural life and heritage, and the systematic methods of erasure employed by the Israeli state since 1948.   Told in three chapters, this story showcases how the act of genocide entails not just physical attacks, but attacks on the cultural survival of a people with a distinct history, identity, and story.","Firstly, the impact connected us to fellow journalists, researchers, artists and data analysts in service of Palestinian liberation. It was a project that brought together people of many disciplines, building upon the vast research that has already been done on Palestine’s history and the ongoing occupation.   Our use of digital tatreez patterns to create the interactive data visualisations in Chapter 1 and 3 were praised for their symbolism and creativity. Feedback included recognition of the meticulous work that went into researching details of each village depopulated in 1948, and manual data gathering of culture sites destroyed in the 2023 genocide.   The story has been widely read and well-received. In particular, readers in Singapore were moved by our coverage of a topic that receives considerable reporting bias in the national newspaper. Artists in Singapore also shared our story alongside their work amplifying the Palestinian cause.  As of February 25, the story received 23,539 views on our website. Our main post on Instagram received 6.1K likes and 2.4K shares, with 85% of views and interactions coming from non-followers. Our second post received 4K likes and 801 shares. There was also feedback that the story made its rounds within Palestinian and Lebanese circles.","It was the first time we were actively writing and collecting data during a genocide. Relentless attacks on Gaza’s infrastructure and harrowing humanitarian conditions made it difficult for us to update the data on cultural sites as they were being destroyed, and keep in touch with our Palestinian interviewees in Gaza. We were unable to maintain contact and follow up with further questions. Since many of the sites were also personal to the artists, such as a backyard, primary school, or spot by the beach, it was challenging to sometimes locate and source references for these places.   Despite these difficulties, we managed to illustrate snapshots of cultural life in Gaza by tapping into diverse resources such as Google maps, and the rich repository of Palestinian digital archives. We also got permissin from the grandson of Armenian-Palestinian photographer Kegham Djeghalian to use a photo of Kegham Photo Studio, now destroyed.  Although the genocide was widely covered by international media outlets, reporting on the occupation and Palestinian resistance in such a comprehensive manner, with clear moral impetus, is unprecedented in Singapore. Despite public apathy and Singaporean government’s political neutrality, the story received a lot of support from local readers.","In Chapter 1: Cultural Genocide in Gaza’s landscape of destruction map, we used Mapbox GL JS to show the locations of the destroyed cultural sites in Gaza as of October 2023. We layered UI like tabbed buttons and tooltips to encourage users to explore the data in the map.   In Chapter 1 and 3 tatreez visualisations, we borrowed tatreez motifs from a digital archive and used a grid designer application to determine the placement of each data point. We then translated this over to google sheets using the cells. We exported this as Json to further clean this data, and used JS to make it interactive for the web.   In Chapter 2, we used a compilation of photos, Google Maps user uploads, and Mapbox as references to create illustrative maps and photo collages with Adobe Photoshop.","The colonisation and violent oppression experienced by Palestinians in Gaza and beyond is not new. This, coupled with bias, has led to the dehumanisation of Palestinians in the media and desensitisation to their struggle. As such, we had to be mindful of the language we used to tell this story, and aware of our position as journalists reporting on a community that we are essentially outsiders to. Working with Palestinian researchers and other data visualisation experts helped us through this, showing the importance of collaboration and fact-checking.   Because we were also covering an issue that is highly politicised, with a long and complex history and competing claims to truth, we also had to ensure that our research was airtight. We relied on expert sources and fact-checked work, with awareness of who, why, how these resources were gathered and published. We also had to be aware that we could not cover all aspects of Palestine and Israel’s history, and produce a story that was digestible, focused and backed by strong evidence.",English,https://gazalives.kontinentalist.com/,,,,"Writer/ Zafirah Zein  Code / Siti Aishah Site design / Munirah Mansoor Illustrations and asset management / Griselda Gabriele Data visualisation design / Siti Aishah, Munirah Mansoor Editors / Loh Pei Ying, Nabilah Said, Gwyneth Cheng, Jessica Anderson, Aline Batarseh Research and data collection / Visualizing Palestine, Zafirah Zein, Mariyam Haider","Kontinentalist creates work in service of a more equitable world, building upon connections between Asia’s sources of knowledge.

Beyond the offer to connect oceans through railroads, Mexico offers a nearshoring model in territories inhabited by Indigenous communities.  Despite the government’s claims, Indigenous people have been excluded from the project that is transforming their territory, increasing pollution, driving land dispossession, and enhancing the violence in Oaxaca and Veracruz. In addition, authorities resorted to trumped-up charges to make activists give up on the defense of their territory.","1. The Interoceanic Corridor journalistic initiative is the first effort to report in-depth on the megaproject’s hidden effects through official documents and interactive data. Just the documentary reached more than 134,000 views.  2. After we published the story ”The People of the Isthmus Are in the Oblivion Station,” in which we reported on those who were evicted from their houses because they occupied the right of way, the Mexican government reviewed the housing program. In some cases, families received a new home.  3. Local non-governmental organizations such as Servicios para una Educación Alternativa, A.C. (EDUCA), which works with Indigenous and marginalized communities in Oaxaca, republished the investigation, amplifying the incidence among rural communities. 4. Some NGO sources used the documentation we revealed to build strategies for defending the territory, as they told us.  5. After we demonstrated how indigenous consultations were rigged, indigenous communities began to reject new consultations on commercial developments in the Isthmus. They demand proper mechanisms, including their right to free choice or rejection of projects. 6. The publication helped the community of San Mateo del Mar, Oaxaca to bring the attention of international organizations. ACNUR visited the territory to talk about the environmental impact.","This project was built using the right of public information access, nevertheless obtaining data was not easy. Originally, the government refused to deliver the documents requested, so we had to defend the audience’s right to have novel information about this megaproject through the National Institute for Transparency, Access to Information, and Protection of Personal Data (INAI). The INAI ordered the government to give the fundamental records to prove the violations against Indigenous communities and the environment.  This is the first investigative journalistic project on this mega-project to be published in Mexico. Despite the magnitude and expected damage, the Interoceanic Corridor had not gained local and international attention, compared to a similar project, the Mayan Train. Therefore, another challenge was to provide a complete picture of this industrial project and to define how to explain the information using technological tools to make the information understandable to all audiences. A multidisciplinary team planned the development of a microsite, a scrolling map, and interactive visualizations spread throughout the project. In addition, the team chose to develop a documentary film and an incisive social media strategy to amplify the impact of the information.","To develop the microsite, program the visualizations that make up the project, and generate maps with the essential elements for understanding the implications of the Interoceanic Corridor, the team used HTML, CSS, and JS, specifically D3js, as well as Qgis, Json, and Carto.js.  These tools were used to create the opening map that shows the Interoceanic Corridor railway lines, the industrial parks, the indigenous population that resides on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and the water available in the territory, among other relevant information. Twelve visualizations were also produced divided into five reports that show the main findings of the investigation, including the simulation of indigenous consultations and the falsification of signatures to consolidate the sale of land for the development of an industrial park.   Twenty-one open data sources were used for this work, including data on municipal crime incidence, hydrological regions, and poverty. Six in-house databases were also created in Excel and Google Sheets, which made it possible to analyze the issues addressed and interactively display the findings. Data management was carried out with Python.","This project integrates photographs and videos with interactive visual elements that facilitate the understanding of the findings and are combined into a cohesive and immersive narrative. In addition, the web design is optimized for various devices resulting in a simple user experience. In this sense, this work can serve as an example of how to combine visual and technological narratives with a rigorous journalistic methodology to address complex issues understandably and attractively. It is furthermore an example of how a journalist can work with a multidisciplinary team to draw attention to a topic of international relevance.  It is equally useful to promote in-depth approaches to issues that have escaped the public agenda, despite their magnitude, and also to encourage the use of investigative tools to verify that the complaints and denunciations of the affected population are substantiated. This project is helpful to remember not to give up in the face of governmental opacity and the concealment of information that proves that industrial development brings with it social and environmental damage.","Spanish, English",https://interactivos.eluniversal.com.mx/2024/corredor-interoceanico-imposicion-despojo-violencia/en/,https://interactivos.eluniversal.com.mx/2024/corredor-interoceanico-imposicion-despojo-violencia/corredor-interoceanico-asi-lo-avalaron/en/,https://interactivos.eluniversal.com.mx/2024/corredor-interoceanico-imposicion-despojo-violencia/corredor-interoceanico-selvas-bosques-industria/en/,https://interactivos.eluniversal.com.mx/2024/corredor-interoceanico-imposicion-despojo-violencia/corredor-interoceanico-defender-la-tierra-el-delito/en/,"Alejandra Crail (Project research and coordination), Silber Meza (Edition), Valente Rosas (Photography), Diego Prado (video), Omar T.

United States of America,The Center for Collaborative Journalism,Big,Shortlist,,‘Without justice’ – How Eswatini’s system is failing victims of gender-based violence,2024-10-24,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Chart, Politics, Women, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Google Pinpoint, Amazon Textract","This investigative project exposes systemic failures in Eswatini’s justice system regarding gender-based violence (GBV). Through data scraping, AI-powered text analysis, and legal review, we examined over 4,600 High Court cases, identifying more than 330 linked to gender-based violence. The findings reveal patterns of dismissed cases, legal misapplications, and victim intimidation, highlighting gaps in enforcing the Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence (SODV) Act. Combining in-depth interviews, data visualization, and rigorous methodology, this investigation offers a rare, evidence-based look at widespread impunity, empowering advocacy groups and policymakers with data-driven insights to push for meaningful reform.","This investigation sparked responses from numerous non-profits and legal organizations, many of whom requested access to the findings for their advocacy efforts. Several described it as the first time such a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of GBV cases in Eswatini had been conducted. The investigation provided concrete evidence of how the justice system routinely fails victims, reinforcing long-held concerns from activists and legal experts.  The government of Eswatini acknowledged a lack of resources in the judiciary, recognizing that systemic issues were contributing to delayed justice. This admission added momentum to ongoing discussions about judicial reform and enforcement of the SODV Act.  Beyond Eswatini, the investigation’s methodology gained international recognition. [GIJN](https://gijn.org/stories/10-steps-data-expose-gender-violence-eswatini/) featured it as a case study, helping other journalists apply AI and data techniques to analyze legal documents. We presented at conferences in both [Africa](https://whova.com/embedded/speaker_session_detail/F2U%40hQz2kYBZ8l6GblflC88d-m3Nlr74tmKMidaLc68%3D/4106886/) and [Europe](https://imeddforum.azurewebsites.net/en/journalism-forum-2024/day-3/from-anecdote-to-investigation-techniques-for-covering-gender-based-violence/), sharing insights on how this approach can be replicated in other countries.  Locally, survivors and advocacy groups used the findings to push for judicial reforms, while social workers cited the investigation to highlight gaps in victim support. The project laid bare the systemic failures of Eswatini’s justice system, producing hard data that authorities could not dismiss and strengthening investigative journalism’s role in demanding accountability.","Eswatini, Africa’s last absolute monarchy, presents significant challenges for investigative journalism, particularly on issues of GBV. The country’s judiciary operates under extreme resource constraints, with a backlog of cases, poor enforcement of laws, and widespread impunity for perpetrators. Despite the 2018 SODV Act, systemic failures prevent many cases from reaching conviction, and survivors often face social stigma, police inaction, or corruption that derails justice.  Access to legal data was a major hurdle. While High Court judgments were technically publicly available, they were scattered across thousands of scanned PDFs with no structured database or easy way to analyze them. To overcome this, our team scraped and processed over 4,600 court cases, using a combination of AI-powered text analysis, optical character recognition (OCR), and manual verification to classify and analyze GBV-related cases.  Legal threats and government resistance were also concerns. Authorities have historically silenced dissenting voices, and journalists in Eswatini face the risk of intimidation, censorship, or retaliation. By grounding the investigation in hard legal data, we minimized opportunities for government pushback.  This project was not just about exposing failures but demonstrating how data and AI can be leveraged to hold powerful institutions accountable, even in restrictive and hostile environments.","Our investigation combined web scraping, AI-powered text analysis, and manual verification to analyze over 4,600 High Court cases from Eswatini.  To collect legal data, we used Python (BeautifulSoup) to scrape publicly available court records from [eswatinilii.org](https://eswatinilii.org/). Since many of the documents were stored as scanned PDFs, we applied OCR using Google Pinpoint and Amazon Textract to extract text, ensuring that even image-based files could be analyzed.  For processing and categorization, we used Apache Tika to extract structured text from the PDFs and ChatGPT-4 to assist in tagging and classifying cases based on keywords such as ”rape,” ”sexual assault,” and ”domestic violence.” However, recognizing that keyword searches alone could lead to false positives, we implemented contextual natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine whether GBV was a central issue in each case.  Since many court judgments were poorly documented or incomplete, our team conducted manual verification in collaboration with legal experts and advocacy organizations to cross-check findings.  For data structuring and visualization, we used Google Sheets and Observable Notebooks to analyze trends, identify systemic failures, and present findings in a clear, accessible format. This blend of automation, AI, and human review ensured accuracy while handling a vast dataset efficiently.","This project demonstrates how investigative journalists, even in small newsrooms, can use data, AI, and automation to expose systemic failures in legal and law enforcement systems, especially in places where information is fragmented.  One key takeaway is that legal and government records contain powerful insights, but extracting them often requires scraping, structuring, and analyzing large datasets. In this investigation, we used Python for web scraping, OCR tools like Google Pinpoint and Amazon Textract for text extraction, and AI-assisted classification with ChatGPT-4 to efficiently process thousands of court documents that would have been impossible to analyze manually.  Another lesson is the importance of verifying AI-driven analysis with human expertise. Natural language processing techniques helped categorize cases, but manual review by our team and legal experts was essential to ensuring accuracy and reducing misinterpretations.  This methodology was successfully replicated in another CCIJ investigation on sex workers and police persecution in Zimbabwe. We scraped and processed 7,948 High Court judgments from zimlii.org, identifying  patterns of police harassment, bribery, and abuse targeting sex workers.  By grounding investigations in structured legal data, we minimized opportunities for government pushback, reinforced journalistic credibility, and provided hard evidence that authorities could not dismiss.",English,https://veza.news/article/2024/10/24/without-justice-how-eswatinis-system-is-failing-victims-of-gender-based-violence/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBYlux1itxrf5GGa8vy8O7T7_A8fN4b-x7zAvH0tk7g/edit?usp=sharing,https://gijn.org/stories/10-steps-data-expose-gender-violence-eswatini/,https://veza.news/article/2024/10/31/its-haunting-me-how-alleged-police-persecution-of-sex-workers-is-crippling-their-way-of-life/,"Thobeka Manyathela, Mfanukhona Nkambule, Jodi Windvogel, Carolyn Thompson, Ajibola Amzat, Norah Catlin, Sotiris Sideris, Yuxi Wang, Kirsty Card, Pupul Chatterjee, Nic Bothma, Jillian Dudziak, Scott Lewis, Sarah Baum, Betsy Ring","CCIJ is a global nonprofit newsroom uniting investigative reporters, data experts, and visual storytellers to expose systemic injustices through data-driven journalism.

United States of America,Bloomberg News,Big,Shortlist,,Crowdsourcing Rideshare Driver Lockouts,2024-10-10,"Investigation, News application, Crowdsourcing, Mobile App, Infographics, Business","Scraping, D3.js, Google Sheets, Python, flask docker twillio whatsapp","This past summer, Uber and Lyft drivers found themselves “locked out” of work without notice. Rideshare companies used lockouts to manipulate the city’s minimum wage law, undermining the gig economy’s core promise of flexibility.  Drivers were despondent, but there was no publicly-available data on the scale of lockouts. So Bloomberg crowdsourced screenshots from 896 drivers, monitored surge pricing and ran financial models to reveal the harms of this unprecedented labor practice:  * Lockouts occurred practically every hour of every day. * Lockouts occurred in surge zones. Prices increased half of the time. * Companies withheld tens of millions in pay, estimates show.","Our investigation was cited by New York City’s comptroller and by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Uber and Lyft’s business practices.   In December, the city’s taxi regulator proposed policy changes intended to deter Uber and Lyft from using  lockouts to artificially restrict wages.   In January 2025, the FTC opened an antitrust probe on Uber and Lyft for illegally coordinating to limit driver pay in the city.  Uber stopped lockouts in early September 2024, and Lyft stopped lockouts recently as well.  Reporters wrote a “how we did it” article for the Global Investigative Journalist Network to share our tips and tools for crowdsourcing using a custom WhatsApp bot.","The only parties who know when a lockout occurs are the rideshare company and the driver. In order to conduct this investigation, Bloomberg reporters had to create a dataset of reported lockouts from screenshots of the Uber or Lyft app taken by drivers.    Bloomberg chose to collect the screenshots via a WhatsApp chatbot in order to meet sources where they are, as many drivers were already using the messaging service.   Over the course of three days, Yin developed a prototype for an automated WhatsApp tipline using Twilio – an API for SMS and WhatsApp chatbots.   We worked with a small focus group of drivers to iron out the kinks in the application, and distributed it to all drivers after one week. A team of six Bloomberg reporters reviewed the approximately 8,000 screenshots to verify a lockout occurred and log the app, time, date, and, if possible, approximate location","We built a WhatsApp bot using Twilio, Flask, and Docker. The application accepts screenshots from drivers and asks them an optional 3-question intake survey.   To maximize participation, we designed a simple user interface where all questions were answerable by pressing buttons. We wanted to be considerate of drivers’ time and standardize the data as much as possible. Additionally, we reciprocated submissions with statistics about how many reports we received in the past hour.  We designed several commands including “TALK,” which connects a driver with a reporter. Reporters spoke with 119 drivers directed to us through the tipline.  To prevent drivers or reporters from wasting time by geocoding each screenshot, we designated 83 fixed locations to monitor surge pricing using the rideshare aggregator Obi. The addresses were picked to maximize coverage and minimize the strain on API requests from Obi. Using these monitoring stations, we could see if a lockout occurred in the proximity of a surge zone within 10 minutes.   We used six months of ride history and the city’s minimum payment formula to estimate costs for each company. We consulted with the two economists who designed the formula.","Our investigation utilized crowdsourcing of screenshots to systematically collect evidence of a labor practice that companies didn’t want records of.  We met sources where they were to maximize participation (sample size) and designed an easy way to submit data and speak with reporters. We also found crowdsourcing to be an effective method of lead generation. Super users sent us additional data and shared personal experiences, which is typically the most time-consuming process in data-driven investigations. These super users became the main characters of our story. We used one source’s voice memos and ride receipts for our lede graphic of a ”day in the life” of a driver.  We combined crowdsourced data with third-party data to answer the question of how lockouts impact consumers. Crowdsourcing data can serve as a starting place for further analysis, and isn’t necessarily a goal in and of itself.  Lastly, we supplement our analysis using public data and the city’s pay formula to estimate costs for companies. This last component answered the “why” of  the story. Our estimates were cited by regulators when they opened a case against Uber and Lyft.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-uber-lyft-nyc-drivers-pay-lockouts/,,,,"Leon Yin, Denise Lu, Aaron Gordon, Natalie Lung,",Leon Yin is an investigative data reporter at Bloomberg News.

Malaysia,Macaranga Media,Small,Shortlist,,The Climate-friendly Virgin in Terengganu,2024-09-11,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Video, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Agriculture","Drone, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Canva, Google Pinpoint","This is a multimedia and interactive story that examines the climate impact of a government-supported private venture that wants to convert a virgin peat swamp forest into oil palm plantation in Malaysia. The story combined data analyses, field reporting, literature review, satellite imagery, and dynamic illustrations. Climate impact data was extracted from the project’s environmental impact assessment report, then under review by the Department of Environment, and complemented with data from scientific articles. The story links the project’s global warming effect and local risks of flood and drought, and provides alternative ways to monetise the forests without clearing it.","Within 2 weeks of our story, the Department of Environment revealed that it had rejected the project’s EIA report. Although we cannot confirm that the rejection was caused by our story (or the several [social media ](https://www.instagram.com/p/C_zd2TTvcy_/?hl=en&img_index=1) posts we ran weeks before our story), ours was one of only two newsrooms reporting on the project. The story was widely praised and shared among journalists and environmental groups. Since publication, we have been invited to talk about the story on radio shows, seminars, and private sharing sessions with industry professionals. Journalists and researchers alike said they benefited from the description of numbers in the story, which used familiar local analogies that they could visualise and relate to. One social scientist said: “I have always blamed peat soil for the haze, until I read your story then I knew that we were to blame for releasing the carbon.” Our use of synthetic aperture radar satellite images to illustrate yearly floods has been featured by data journalism trainers in seminars. And, just recently, I met for the first time the consultant who wrote the EIA report. Although our story contributed to the criticism of his work, he said our story was “fair”.","I produced the story alone, within a month. It gave voice to a community that had felt helpless against the continued deforestation around them. The area is located miles from any popular towns and the main trunk road. The only other newsroom that reported on this plantation project neither visited nor interviewed them. The locals, many of them planters, harboured mixed feelings towards further forest loss. Unlike urbanites, the locals didn’t know of global warming, but were rather fearful of floods and wildlife conflict. I spent days in the area, meeting locals and explaining the science and data of peat soil to them. I conveyed their nuanced responses in the story. This story carried notable risk of legal and top-down repercussions. The plantation company is majority owned by the brother of the state’s Sultan. The project was also approved by the state government.  While reporting in Terengganu (which was 5 hours drive from my home), I had sought out government libraries and agencies for detailed maps of peat. While the officers spoke with me off-record, they eventually refused my request. That was an entire day of effort in vain, which otherwise would have added a bigger picture to the story.","Accurate and granular forest reserve statistics is a pain to acquire in Malaysia, but we have been doing this for years. Statistics on forest reserve changes were extracted from years of government gazetted in PDFs. We used Google Pinpoint to OCR the PDFs and searched for specific keywords that indicate forest reserve changes, and recorded those changes in Excel. All data analyses were done in Excel with formulas and pivot tables. Satellite images were acquiredfrom Sentinel Hub, Planet Labs, and Google Earth Pro. Maps from the EIA report were georeferenced in QGIS. We used QGIS to calculate areas of peat swamp forests, overlaps between logging and peat swamp forests, and to draw maps for storytelling. For graph visualisation, we used Flourish. For the animated story layout, we learned and used GSAP Javascript libraries. We used Canva to draw illustrations. This was only the 3rd time Macaranga used drone footages in our stories, and the first time we manned it ourselves. I practiced flying the drone once before I used it in the field. The aerial footages helped me appreciate the landscape and showed readers the state of the forests too.","This story demonstrates how storytelling – even that of a remote community -- can be augmented with a proper mix of traditional narrative, multimedia, and data reporting.   On one hand, this story has a simple message: peat swamp are precious carbon stores and we should protect them.   But complexity quickly kicks in. The calculations of carbon emissions are varied; critical baseline assumptions are often lacking on a local scale.   And there is the nuanced attitudes of the locals towards their forests and plantations. They have both profited from plantations and suffered the aftermath of forest loss. I wanted to convey their voices, especially for our urban readers to appreciate the local context.  Our urban readers also would struggle to appreciate the magnitude of carbon emissions. Nobody sees CO2 or knows how large 2000 ha is. I need to help them feel for these numbers.  Our solution is to focus on human voices, and make the numbers count in small but effective parts. Throughout the story, humans are the actors. When describing data, I use human-focused analogies (baby’s age) and local examples.  For transparency, we published at the end of the story our calculations and assumptions for most of the derived figures.",English,https://www.macaranga.org/embed/peat/peatforest.html,,,,"Yao-Hua Law (author), Siew Lyn Wong (editor)","Yao-Hua Law is a co-founder of Macaranga Media, Malaysia’s environmental journalism outfit.

Can we really see gas cars disappear in the near future? Their sale will be banned as early as 2035, but, at the current rate, there is still a long way to go to electrify the entire car fleet. Our goal was to show the obstacles on the road ahead with data and data visualisation.","The interactive piece « Parcourez les obstacles de l’électrification des transports » has a unique proposition : climb aboard our vehicles and explore the challenges and the concerns facing motorists when swapping gasoline for electricity. Readers can choose between five cars (3 battery electric and 2 plug-in hybrid) and four itineraries in Quebec, Ontario or in the United States. We then use data linked to every car and itinerary coming from various sources to explain, with each scenario, the major obstacles to electrification : car price, autonomy and charging stations. Tthree other articles also gave more content on all these angles. With four articles, we leave no stone unturned about electric cars and with the challenges that await us to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050.","With « Y a-t-il assez de bornes de recharge au Québec? » (July 3, 2024), we answer a simple question : Are there enough charging stations in Quebec? Yes, considering the number of electric vehicles on the roads. But there is still a long way to go – and stations to install – to hope to power more than 4 million vehicles by 2035. We show it on a map, with the exact position of every charging station in the province and an analysis by type, regions and ownership. It also allowed us to compare Quebec to other provinces and even the United States. We also got two freedom of information requests to quantity, on a map, the use of charging stations, fast or slow, across the province as a way to evaluate if there are enough or not. In the article « Ventes records pour les véhicules électriques au Québec. Et maintenant? » (September 9, 2024), we rely on data coming from Statistics Canada and the Roulez vert program to show how Quebec is doing on electrification. A record number of zero-emission cars has been registered last year, but experts fear, however, that the abandonment of the program will slow electrification of the fleet.","The combination of illustrations, scrollytelling and personified experience in every article made it a fun way for readers to understand every obstacle. The design mandate for this project was to create a playful interface that simplifies the subject of electric transportation for the user. The artistic direction was crafted to be flexible and easily adaptable across multiple articles. The goal was to deliver clear and effective information while maintaining a visually appealing and engaging experience. We developed numerous interactive graphics to create a cohesive flow of information and make the experience more dynamic. We used the appropriate technologies based on the context: GSAP, Lottie, or CSS, depending on the needs. Three designers with diverse skills collaborated on this project: an illustrator designer, a data visualization illustrator, and a UI designer.","The goal of our project was to deal with a subject widely covered in an original way. All topics, simple or complex, can be made into an interactive experience increasing the engagement of Internet users. They can even draw their own conclusions, making it a customizable experience. It is a fun and rewarding way to visualize data, but also to allow less familiar Internet users to navigate into complex databases. We even explore a different angle with the fourth article « Même les véhicules électriques contribuent à l’embonpoint du parc automobile » (August 16, 2024). Quebec might be a champion, but, at the same time, the vehicle fleet continues to grow and becomes heavier, indicators that lead experts to say that we may be heading in the wrong direction. Maybe we should also focus on public transportation rather than only on electrification. Even if the idea was to cover electrification, sometimes you need to go beyond the original subject to tackle every angle.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2024/voitures-electriques/trajets-voyages-vehicules-quebec/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2024/voitures-electriques/reseau-public-bornes-recharge-quebec/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2024/voitures-electriques/vehicules-electriques-quebec-subventions-roulez-vert/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2024/voitures-electriques/automobile-quebec-vehicule-electrique-poids-vus/,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier data journalist, Sara Barrière-Brunet desk-editor, Louis-Philippe Bouvier and Francis Lamontagne designers, Josselin Pfeuffer illustrator, André Guimaraes and Mathieu St-Laurent developers","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Paiporta, una localidad de 30.000 habitantes, fue la zona cero de la tragedia. Fuimos a esta localidad a medir la altura de más de 140 marcas del agua en fachadas, portales y garajes para, a través de un algoritmo, estimar la magnitud de la riada en el municipio, en una reconstrucción 3D de la inundación y todos los edificios y construcciones de la ciudad.","El artículo tuvo cerca de 100.000 mil páginas vistas. En redes sociales su impacto fue importante. El hilo de uno de los autores tuvo 950.000 impresiones y más de 27.000 interacciones, algunas de académicos especializados o responsables políticos de la zona.   El análisis realizado, junto con la reconstrucción en 3D de la inundación, ha proporcionado una perspectiva inédita del desastre. Los resultados muestran que Paiporta se convirtió en una inmensa balsa de agua con más de tres metros de altura en algunos puntos.  Otro aspecto relevante del artículo es la representación de las viviendas en planta baja o garajes subterráneos. Estos espacios fueron determinantes en la catástrofe: la mitad de las víctimas fallecieron en ellos, atrapadas por la riada.  El artículo también analiza un elemento crucial que aporta claridad al debate sobre la gestión de la emergencia. Las autoridades emitieron una alerta a la población a las 20:11 horas. Sin embargo, numerosos testimonios coinciden en que, para entonces, en varias calles el agua superaba los dos metros. Los datos confirman esta percepción: el análisis de los móviles que dejaron de emitir señal aquella tarde revela que muchas desconexiones ocurrieron antes del envío del aviso. La alerta llegó demasiado tarde.","Uno de los principales retos del trabajo fue la obtención de unos datos que, hasta el momento, no habían sido publicados por ninguna entidad pública. Esta recolección se realizó además con las complicaciones de comunicación y transporte de una zona aun devastada por la inundación.   Respecto al uso de tecnologías, en este proyecto se realizó por primera vez una recreación masiva en 3D, modelando a partir de datos abiertos y a mano los centenares de edificios, calles, árboles o farolas de una localidad de más de 30.000 habitantes. También fue uno de los primeros proyectos en los que el uso de la inteligencia artificial fue constante en todo el proceso: desde la definición de los lugares donde tomar las medidas y la decisión sobre qué algoritmos usar para interpolar la lámina de la inundación a la definición de la mejor infraestructura posible para el renderizado de las imágenes 3D.","* Para la reconstrucción 3D de la ciudad y de la magnitud de la inundación hemos usado el software de modelado Blender.  * Para componer el scrolling de la pieza hemos usado AfterEffects, además de Javascript, Svelte y ffmpeg para la compresión de vídeos.  * Para el tratamiento de datos geográficos empleamos QGIS y R, con los que calculamos geometrías y alturas de edificios.   * El resto de análisis, como la evaluación del número de bajos, garajes y dispositivos móviles, se ha realizado en R.  * En todo el proceso se ha usado Inteligencia Artificial, tanto en la aplicación de ChatGPT como a través del entorno de desarrollo Cursor.","Uno de los principales aprendizajes de este trabajo es la importancia de los datos —tanto abiertos como privados— para representar con precisión la magnitud de una catástrofe natural. El análisis de los datos de teléfonos móviles ha permitido evidenciar la rapidez del fenómeno meteorológico y la demora de las administraciones en alertar a la población. El estudio de las tipologías de construcción en las zonas afectadas ha puesto de manifiesto uno de los factores que agravaron la tragedia. Además, la reconstrucción en 3D, basada en datos públicos, ha facilitado una representación clara y accesible de la magnitud real de la inundación para cualquier lector.  Este trabajo pone de relieve la importancia de la recopilación de datos propios en este tipo de análisis. En este caso, las mediciones in situ han sido imprescindibles para desarrollar con precisión la reconstrucción de la inundación y dimensionar con exactitud su impacto real.

The series investigates bias and representation in Norway’s criminal justice system, which despite international praise has escaped scrutiny from journalists. Our reporting is based on an unprecedented dataset containing thousands of verdicts, defendants and judges. We found that even in one of the world’s most equal societies, who you are — and who your judge is — can determine the sentence you receive. The first article was published 02.01.2024, while the two other was published 01.02.2025. The articles is in Norwegian, so use Google Translate.","The project has attracted significant attention in Norway. Total page views for the project has surpassed 1 million, and a similar number for radio and TV audiences. Several members of Parliament have written to the Minister of Justice, demanding that she follow up on the findings of NRK and Lighthouse Reports. The Anti-Discrimination Ombud has called the findings ”serious” and demands better judge training and legal assistance for those with limited financial resources. He even cited our methodology in a debate with the Judges’ Association to show that we have accounted for several of the most common explanations for differences in the judiciary. The Bar Association is demanding a better composition of lay judges to represent the people they are appointed to judge. The Courts Administration has promised to incorporate the findings into the training of new judges and has requested a meeting with NRK to learn more. They have also apologized that only half of the judgments was published on their press pages and promise to do a better job. This means significantly better access for journalists to investigate how the judiciary performs its duties. Additionally, the response from readers has been enormous, with many sharing their own experiences.","European journalism has struggled to reproduce the defining, data-driven criminal justice system produced by Latin America and the United States. Reporters in Europe face significant difficulties in obtaining data about criminal cases that allow for rigorous analysis. Many countries do not have centralised databases of verdicts from first instance courts. Even the verdicts that are publicly available are often anonymised, making it difficult to analyse differential treatment of certain demographic groups. Overcoming this required building our own custom dataset.  Proving judicial bias in Norway required clearing a large hurdle. Norway’s criminal justice system consistently ranks in the top three in the world. Norwegian citizens trust the judiciary and there is a widespread perception that the criminal justice system is colorblind and impartial. But this made investigating judicial bias all the more important  We knew our results and methods would be under a high degree of scrutiny. We therefore conducted rigorous statistical analysis that was reviewed by six leading academics. We published an extensive methodology explaining our analysis and the underlying code to GitHub.","We used custom techniques to extract information from more than 9,000 district court verdicts in PDF format. We then cross-referenced with Norway’s population register and national tax list to get demographic information and income data. The result was a dataset that contained key case data, as well as data on defendants and judges. All was kept on a local hard drive for security.  Verdicts outline charges and convictions in a standardised format. Yet the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of a crime, which also affect the sentence, do not appear in a standardized way. We used GPT-4 to extract these aggravating circumstances and benchmarked the results using a manually labeled random sample.  A challenge of data-driven criminal justice reporting is that no two verdicts are exactly the same. Proving judicial bias requires finding patterns across cases that account for other possible explanations, such as the severity of crimes committed. We made extensive use of regression analysis that controlled for demographic factors, sections of the criminal code, as well as mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Upon review by academics, we ran additional series of advanced statistical robustness checks including negative binomial regression models, formal sensitivity checks for omitted variable bias, and multi-collinearity tests.","Journalists should not be afraid of using state-of-the-art statistics — in fact, it may be necessary if we want to confidently show systemic relationships and injustices. Creating transparent and reproducible methodologies enables academics to meaningfully engage with our work and bulletproof it.  Yet using more robust methods need not complicate a story: all our pieces are accessible to a general audience, contain few numbers, and not a single graph. We believe that our approach to first stress test our hypotheses with the most robust statistics available and then report only findings that pass all tests could be adopted by a wide range of investigations. We hope that our reporting and methodology encourages more journalists across Europe to take on criminal justice reporting within their communities.","Norwegian, English",https://www.nrk.no/norge/xl/de-rikeste-far-oftere-lavere-straffer-enn-de-fattigste-i-norske-rettssaler-1.17178868,https://www.nrk.no/ostfold/xl/kvinner-far-kortere-fengselsstraffer-enn-menn-1.17176807,https://www.nrk.no/ostfold/meddommerne-i-norge-er-eldre_-rikere-og-_norskere_-_-det-pavirker-straffene-1.16649247,https://www.lighthousereports.com/methodology/norway-criminal-justice/,"Christian Nicolai Bjørke (investigative/data reporter NRK), Per Øyvind Fange (investigative reporter NRK), Henrik Bøe (data reporter NRK), Gabriel Geiger (investigative reporter LR), Justin-Casimir Braun (data reporter LR), Elena deBre (investigative reporter LR), Rina Therese Blekkerud (editor NRK), Anne Vinding (editor NRK), Eva Constantaras (data editor LR), Tahmeed Shafiq (data fellow LR)","NRK Graveredaksjonen Sørøst is a regional investigative group in the public service broadcaster in Norway.

Al organizar la información contenida en los cientos de documentos, fue posible identificar a los funcionarios con los patrimonios más altos, algunos de ellos multimillonarios, lo que generó gran revuelo en un país tan pequeño como la República Dominicana.  La exposición de estos funcionarios a través de la organización de los documentos públicos generó descontento en algunos sectores. Un senador incluso solicitó en una sesión del Senado que se prohibiera la publicación de las declaraciones juradas de los funcionarios, argumentando que se debía proteger su privacidad, pues temía que su seguridad personal se viera comprometida al hacer públicos sus patrimonios en la prensa.","Es la primera vez que un medio de comunicación organiza las cientos de declaraciones juradas de patrimonio de los funcionarios de manera accesible para la audiencia, permitiendo conocer, de forma clara y ordenada, la riqueza de quienes dirigen el Estado y el origen de su patrimonio, que incluye bienes cuestionables.

The aim was twofold: to provide a Gaza-wide look at the quantifiable extent of damage that satellites could pick up, then combine that with detailed reporting on neighbourhoods and what the damage meant for residents’ daily lives. As the reader scrolls, they are guided through the damage across the entire Gaza Strip, and then walked through the detail that we identified in three neighbourhoods. They also see evidence of what the rubble was before.","The UN special rapporteur on the right to adequate housing described the evidence compiled by the Guardian as “important”, highlighting its impact. The damage analysis compiled by the Guardian prompted multiple experts to describe what is happening in Gaza as “domicide”, defined as the widespread, deliberate destruction of the home to make it uninhabitable. Also, the findings for this investigation were used as evidence by the Global Legal Action Network, a legal group that seeks accountability in conflict, as part of their case against the UK government at the High Court to suspend arms sales to Israel. Audience metrics, in particular the average engagement time, indicated that readers were taking time to explore and interact with the story. The article contained a lot of information – with almost 100 damaged sites and dozens of multimedia assets highlighting them. We had initial concerns that this amount of information could be overwhelming for readers and cause an increased bounce rate. To mitigate this we put a lot of time into thinking about the user interactions. In the end, editors were very pleased by the size of the engaged audience in the piece.","The article contained lots of information, with almost 100 damaged sites and dozens of multimedia assets. Even this was a small sample of the damage. Innovating with OSINT practices and scrollytelling helped feed this information in chunks to readers, building understanding but also not overwhelming. It was important to show, rather than tell, such an emotive story. The reader can dig around and see for themselves the damage the team verified. We committed to this process – which took a lot of time from multiple desks – because of the public interest value. We conducted an interactive investigation using OSINT practices. It’s innovative both in its reporting, but also in its technical application. It relied on visual forensics to find the evidence, understand its validity and then deliver this story to our audience. From a visual point of view, there were several storytelling techniques implemented. There is the non-vertical panning across a large image, walking the reader through the entirety of the strip. There is the mobile-only holding functionality to allow readers to view what neighbourhoods looked like before . There are videos that pop up as the reader scrolls. These are all now components that we can reuse to tell future stories.","The project is a javascript application built with Svelte. We obtained the before and after satellite imagery from Planet, and the building damage vector data from researchers Jamon Van Den Hoek and Corey Scher. The spatial data was then colour-corrected using Qgis, converted into tileset with Qgis and the tippecanoe library, and hosted on AWS S3.  The individual building damage analysis was conducted in Qgis by crossreferencing UNOSAT damage assessment datasets with a combination of commercial and open-source online mapping services, as well as social media posts. Each shapefile was drawn by hand in Qgis.","Visual, video and investigations teams can unite under these kinds of OSINT-orientated projects to deliver strong stories – both in terms of their news line but also in terms of the visual power of the way in which the story is delivered. These pieces take a lot of time investment, from a variety of teams which are balancing different priorities on a daily basis. But if newsrooms can find the time and space for these journalists to collaborate, there is a lot of potential for visual investigations that uncover solid stories in the public interest.  The other thing that journalists could learn is about the various visual techniques implemented in this piece to communicate a vast amount of complex and challenging information. In particular, the way in which the focus pans across a large image non-vertically, to be able to focus on part of the picture without losing the wider context; as well as the holding functionality on mobile, which is something we are keen to use more to present similar kind of before/ after effects.",English,https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2024/jan/30/how-war-destroyed-gazas-neighbourhoods-visual-investigation,,,,"Niels de Hoog, Antonio Voce, Elena Morresi, Manisha Ganguly and Ashley Kirk","The investigation was conducted by five journalists: by Niels de Hoog, interactive journalist; Antonio Voce, interactive journalist, Elena Morresi, video journalist Manisha Ganguly, investigations correspondent and Ashley Kirk, visuals editor."
United States of America,Army Times,Small,Shortlist,,Broken Track,2024-03-11,"Investigation, Long-form, Health","Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Google Pinpoint, Datawrapper","“Broken Track,” a three-part project published in March 2024, revealed how unsustainable amounts of deployments and training contributed to increased suicide rates in Army armor units. Between 2019 and 2021, tank brigades experienced a suicide rate twice as high as the rest of the active duty Army. Enlisted tank crew members were three times as likely to die by suicide than other soldiers during the same period. The main story followed 1st Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, whose plight was but one of many tragedies during this time.","BROKEN TRACK immediately roiled the military and veteran communities, who witnessed the armor community’s unraveling but never had the data to quantify the phenomenon. It far exceeded our usual pageviews, and short-form videos discussing the findings exceeded 1 million views across all platforms.  The story had a significant policy impact as well. Shortly after we published, the Army announced changes to tank brigades’ deployment model, with a stated goal of reducing their time away from home. A bipartisan group of House and Senate members asked Army officials about Broken Track’s findings in hearings and demanded related policy changes/compliance from the Pentagon. The Army also unveiled a new pay allowance in September 2024 that provides additional cash to soldiers deployed away from home for more than 30 days.","I overcame technical and institutional challenges while reporting Broken Track.  Extracting usable information from more than 1,200 forms proved an unusually difficult challenge. Each FOIA official applied redactions in different patterns, and some of them scanned the documents as image-based PDFs — approximately 40% lacked a machine-readable text layer.  I researched and attempted optical character recognition techniques and text extraction methods that ranged from Python parsers to Tabula. Accuracy was poor until he gained access to Google Pinpoint’s beta form extraction tool. He cleaned the data and created additional fields that allowed analysis of deaths by unit type or career field.  The institutional challenge arose while interfacing with the Army — the service was reluctant to engage on a story that painted its policies as a potential cause of high suicide rates. Its suicide prevention program is neither structured or incentivized to assess systematic suicide risk factors of this type.   Service officials initially disputed the accuracy of a crucial finding, claiming that fewer tank crew members died by suicide than my database showed. He responded with a by-name list of the dead. The Army, after re-reviewing its data, admitted that my finding was accurate and blamed a misconfigured system for the confusion.","I used Python to transform the PDF forms and split them into single page files. I used Google Pinpoint’s structured data extraction tool to extract the data from the PDF forms. Then I used Google Sheets and regular expression to clean the data. I used Microsoft Excel for significance testing. For sharing findings with readers, I used Datawrapper to create tables.",I hope that journalists can learn that some data stories aren’t about the numbers. I am extremely proud that the main story had only a handful of paragraphs devoted to the data; the rest of the piece was able to center the experience of the survivors of these suicide clusters.,English,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2024/03/11/broken-track-suicides-suffering-in-armys-exhausted-armor-community/,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2024/03/11/broken-track-how-army-times-discovered-high-tank-unit-suicide-rates/,https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2024/03/12/broken-track-why-the-iron-knights-chose-to-speak-out-about-suicides/,,Davis Winkie,"Davis Winkie is a reporter covering the White House and the Pentagon for USA Today.

Armenia,Harbinger’s newsroom,Small,,,Bangladesh’s prime minister resigns and flees the country after violent protests,2024-09-12,Human rights,Google Sheets,"This article details the student protests that led to the resignation of Bangladesh’s longest-serving prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, after violent clashes with security forces. The protests began over a controversial job quota system but quickly expanded into a larger movement demanding political reform and greater freedoms. The piece covers the causes of the protests, the role of student activism, and the potential future for Bangladesh after Hasina’s departure.","The project brought global attention to the role of student activism in shaping Bangladesh’s political landscape. It highlighted the widespread corruption and political repression that fueled the protests, drawing attention to the personal stories such as of Faizan Yameen Ahmed, whose voice gave a human face to the movement. The article informed international audiences about a critical moment in Bangladesh’s history, documenting the heavy toll of the unrest, which left over 440 dead and many more injured. By linking the protests to deeper societal issues, the story underscored the importance of the struggle for freedom and justice.","As a 17-year-old writing my first article, I faced several challenges in reporting on the student protests in Bangladesh. One of the biggest obstacles was gathering reliable information from a country where it’s difficult to access data, especially since I didn’t have a big network to rely on. To get a clearer picture, I interviewed a close friend whose family and friends were directly involved in the protests. This personal connection gave me valuable insight into the situation and helped me understand it from a more human perspective. Since I was working alone with no professional resources, I had to rely on social media to track the protests and gather real-time updates. Despite these challenges, I was able to create a comprehensive story by combining interviews, social media data, and personal research, highlighting the role of youth activism in the fight for change.","Social Media Platforms (Twitter, Facebook): Since the government controlled the media and made it difficult for journalists to report, social media was a crucial tool. I tracked updates and followed real-time developments using Twitter and Facebook. These platforms helped me understand the scale of the protests, how they spread, and what people were saying about them. Interviews: I conducted an interview with a close friend whose family and friends were directly involved in the protests in Bangladesh. This personal connection gave me valuable, first-hand insight into the situation, which helped make my article more authentic and grounded. Online Research: I did a lot of research using credible online sources, including news articles and academic papers, to fill in gaps and provide context about the political situation in Bangladesh. This helped me back up the information I gathered from social media and interviews.","From this project, other journalists—especially those just starting out—can learn how to navigate challenges with limited resources. As a 17-year-old working on my first article, I realized how important it is to be resourceful and creative. In an environment where accessing direct information was difficult, I relied on social media to track updates and understand public sentiment. I also learned the value of personal connections: by interviewing a friend whose family was involved in the protests, I gained an inside perspective that was both personal and invaluable.  This project taught me how to use digital tools, not just for research, but to build a clearer picture of events happening far away. It showed me that even without a big team or on-the-ground access, a journalist can still tell a powerful, accurate story if they use the right tools and connect with people who are directly impacted. The key takeaway: start small, be adaptable, and never underestimate the power of human connections in journalism.",English,https://hrbmagazine.com/articles/bangladeshs-prime-minister-resigns-and-flees-the-country-after-violent-protests-by-nare-arushanyan/,,,,Nare Arushanyan - Contributor Maria Mitko - Human Rights Section Editor 2024,"Nare Arushanyan was displaced to Armenia in the autumn of 2023 and is now studying in Khoren and Shoushanig Avedisian School, Yerevan with plans to study journalism.

Kenya,Africa Uncensored Africa Data Hub,Small,,,Silencing Women: Tracking Femicide in Kenya,2024-01-27,"Infographics, Chart, Crime","Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Flourish","Femicide in Kenya is a silent crisis, with many cases going undocumented or unreported. ”Silencing Women” is a living database that tracks femicide cases in Kenya from 2016 to the present. Using open-source data collection techniques, and collaboration with grassroots organizations, the project has exposed the scale of gender-based killings and provided a crucial record for advocacy, legal action, and policy change. The database is updated continuously, ensuring the matter is left alive and trends monitored. Referenced by courts, media, and activists, it has shaped national conversations on gender justice and the role of data in holding institutions accountable.","Silencing Women” has transformed the discourse on femicide in Kenya by providing hard evidence and humanizing the statistics. The database shows that more than 500 women lost their lives between 2016 and 2023—with 75% killed by husbands or boyfriends—and exposes that, on average, it takes five years to resolve a murder case.   This robust evidence has directly influenced high-stakes arenas: it has been cited in a [High Court](https://youtu.be/LXw2VP51t6o?t=3278) ruling and parliamentary debates, contributing to tangible reforms such as the establishment of special SGBV courts and the introduction of a toll-free hotline by the Directorate of Criminal Investigation  Media outlets and justice activists have used the project to counter prevailing myths and challenge victim-blaming attitudes. By producing videos that have garnered over 500,000 views and hosting an interactive dashboard with a “Names and Faces” section, the project has energized online and offline justice movements.","In Kenya, femicide has been an underreported crisis compounded by fragmented official statistics, societal silence and a victim blaming attitudes. Traditional data from police summaries and UN estimates have failed to capture the full scope of the problem, leaving a void filled by rumors and sporadic social media posts. “Silencing Women” emerged from the urgent need to create a comprehensive, verifiable record amid these challenges. The project navigated a data-void environment and used open-source techniques to compell an existing database and understand the big picture of the crisis.","The success of “Silencing Women” is built on a blend of robust open-source research methods and collaborative verification. The team used an advanced Google search for certain keny words normally used when reporting femicide.  All retrieved results were collated in a Google spreadsheet for systematic cleaning and analysis. Each news item was manually reviewed and categorized using UNODC’s criteria, ensuring only verified cases were included. Data visualization played a crucial role: interactive dashboards and “Names and Faces” sections were created using Flourish, while accompanying videos (totaling over 500,000 views) enriched the narrative. The project’s workflow was enhanced by real-time collaboration with grassroots organizations and investigative partners like Africa Uncensored, which provided on-the-ground insights and validation.","Silencing Women” offers tangible lessons for investigative journalists confronting data gaps in challenging environments. First, the project proves that journalists can construct authoritative datasets from scratch—demonstrated by compiling over 500 verified femicide cases despite limited official records. Second, it highlights the power of open-source tools: using advanced Google searches with specific queries enabled the team to unearth critical cases from scattered news reports, a method that many traditional sources overlook. Third, the initiative underscores the value of collaboration. Working with partners such as Africa Uncensored, Africa Data Hub, and grassroots organizations provided essential validation, deeper context, and expanded reach.   By openly sharing its methodology—detailing each step from data extraction to visualization—the project empowers other journalists to replicate and adapt these techniques for their own investigations. This transparency is essential in building trust and encouraging a collective effort to hold power to account, proving that accurate, well-presented data is key to driving social change",English,https://femicide.africauncensored.online/,https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2l4Jn-IsxK/,,,"Felix Kiprono, Patricia Andago, Lilian Mutinda, Odanga Madung, John-Allan Namu","Felix Kiprono Felix, as the Media Unit Lead at Odipo Dev, finds joy in immersing himself in data analysis.

A investigação revelou que 71% dos sítios arqueológicos em florestas na Amazônia Legal já estão sob áreas desmatadas, incluindo 12% localizados em Unidades de Conservação, Territórios Indígenas e Quilombolas. Esses dados foram obtidos ao cruzar registros públicos do Instituto do Patrimônio Histórico e Artístico Nacional (IPHAN) com as taxas anuais de desmatamento monitoradas pelo Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), através do Projeto de Monitoramento do Desmatamento na Amazônia Legal por Satélite (PRODES).","Publicada no InfoAmazônia, veículo independente focado em reportagens geolocalizadas sobre a maior floresta tropical contínua do planeta e que colabora com jornalistas e veículos locais e internacionais, a reportagem alcançou ampla visibilidade. Destacou-se no Top 10 semanal da GIJN em fevereiro de 2024 e recebeu menção honrosa na categoria Investigação do Prêmio Cláudio Weber Abramo, o maior prêmio de jornalismo de dados do Brasil. Estes reconhecimentos enfatizam o impacto significativo do trabalho, que foi além de premiações, sendo republicado em jornais locais de menor abrangência e compartilhado entre pesquisadores especializados na área e região.  Os resultados evidenciaram problemas críticos, revelando a crescente pressão da degradação ambiental sobre esse patrimônio biocultural. A análise dos dados também destacou um aspecto subexplorado do debate sobre a destruição da Amazônia: a relação entre a degradação ambiental e o patrimônio arqueológico, que, protegido por lei, pode atuar como uma camada adicional de proteção para a floresta e as comunidades locais. Entrevistas com um arqueólogo indígena e líderes comunitários ajudaram a conectar o tema à realidade das populações que vivem nessas áreas, fornecendo uma perspectiva centrada no protagonismo local sobre a importância da arqueologia na defesa do território e da cultura das comunidades amazônicas contemporâneas.","Minha reportagem enfrentou desafios consideráveis devido ao processamento de dados extensos (série histórica do desmatamento de 1988 a 2022) e à dificuldade de acesso a informações públicas consistentes. A sensibilidade política da região e a pressão de grupos, como garimpeiros e ruralistas, intensificaram as dificuldades para entrevistas, especialmente em áreas como a reserva indígena do Xingu, onde representantes aceitavam ser entrevistados, mas não apareciam no horário combinado e sequer retornavam contato. Tentativas de meses para entrevistar representantes públicos do IPHAN, órgão responsável pela fiscalização e registro dos sítios arqueológicos, também foram infrutíferas. Houve o emprego de tecnologias de data science e análise geoespacial não apenas para conduzir a investigação, mas também para oferecer uma representação visual do impacto, destacando a urgência de proteger esses espaços vitais e promover políticas de conservação eficazes diante das ameaças atuais.","Para analisar o impacto do desmatamento em sítios arqueológicos na Amazônia Legal, empreguei uma abordagem multidisciplinar combinando análise de dados geoespaciais e jornalismo investigativo. Utilizei o software QGIS para integrar e analisar diversas camadas de dados espaciais, incluindo geolocalização de sítios arqueológicos (IPHAN), áreas de polígonos do desmatamento (Prodes), e outras camadas como Unidades de Conservação, Territórios Indígenas e quilombolas, limites federais, estaduais e municipais, disponíveis em plataformas públicas. Essa análise foi crucial para identificar quantitativamente, obter insights e visualizar sobreposições entre as áreas analisadas.   Também utilizei Excel e Python para manipulação de dados mais complexos e plataformas como Datawrapper, Flourish e Mapbox - Mapbox Tiling Service (MTS) - para criar visualizações e mapas que ilustram visualmente os dados e reforçam a mensagem da reportagem. Essas ferramentas não apenas facilitaram uma análise rigorosa dos dados, mas também ajudaram a comunicar os resultados de forma mais eficaz.  Além da análise técnica, a reportagem incorporou entrevistas com um arqueólogo indígena, além de representantes de comunidades locais, integrando perspectivas fundamentais para contextualizar o impacto humano e cultural da degradação ambiental na região. Tanta a metodologia, quanto os dados analisados foram disponibilizados conjuntamente em publicação anexa à reportagem para promover maior transparência e replicabilidade do trabalho.","Este projeto demonstra como a combinação de dados de áreas distintas, como arqueologia e desmatamento, pode nos permitir descobrir narrativas únicas, encorajando jornalistas a procurarem conexões mais interdisciplinares para enriquecer suas histórias. O uso de ferramentas tecnológicas também demonstra a potencialidade não apenas de análises mais profundas, mas também para auxiliar a tornar informações complexas mais compreensíveis para o público. A reportagem também ilustra como a conexão entre ciência, cultura e questões socioambientais pode proporcionar uma cobertura mais completa e envolvente, demonstrando como histórias podem ser contextualizadas em um quadro maior, mantendo sua relevância e impacto.  Além disso, a reportagem se destaca como um catalisador para ação e mudança, abordando de forma ética e cuidadosa assuntos que impactam diretamente comunidades e patrimônios.

Com base em dados do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Inpe), identificamos 8.164 focos de calor em territórios indígenas, um aumento de 314% em relação ao ano anterior. A investigação também destaca a concentração de queimadas próximas a rodovias e por onde  avançam sobre unidades de conservação, demonstrando o impacto da degradação ambiental na população indígena e no meio ambiente.","Com uma análise inédita, a reportagem trouxe à tona dados alarmantes sobre o aumento das queimadas na Amazônia e sua relação com a exploração ilegal de recursos naturais, como no caso do garimpo ilegal. Após a publicação —e não necessariamente somente por causa da reportagem—, o governo federal anunciou uma contratação histórica de brigadistas para o combate ao fogo na temporada de 2025 que se avizinha. A reportagem também trouxe novas informações para as discussões sobre a reabertura da BR-319 que corta uma grande área de floresta protegida e sobre os impactos que a BR-163 também provoca, com avanço de queimadas em áreas protegidas a partir destas duas rodovias.","A reportagem foi realizada em um contexto de forte demonstração do governo brasileiro em conter a crise climática e o avanço de atividades ilegais na Amazônia. No entanto, fatores como a seca histórica de 2024, e um eventual aumento do uso do fogo pelos infratores —estratégia para driblar a fiscalização que está mais rígida— agravaram os os registros de queimadas na Amazônia. Poucas semanas antes desta publicação,  tínhamos revelado que boa parte das fazendas que queimaram em 2024 receberam incentivos fiscais do governo e que em muitos casos o fogo que começou em fazendas invadiu áreas protegidas. Nós sobrevoamos a região à convite da organização Greenpeace e em campo conseguimos mapear essa ilegalidades com auxílio de GPS e o registro visual em fotos e vídeos. O impacto do fogo concentrado em terras indígenas, que históricamente são os territórios que mais protegem a floresta, também denunciam onde os infratores têm agido.","A investigação utilizou imagens de satélite do Planet Labs e dados do Programa Queimadas do governo brasileiro  para identificar padrões de incêndios.

O mecanismo legislativo do maior estado da Amazônia concentrou as atividades na causa animal, em matérias de cunho popular.",Houve reprodução em veículos de mídia independente e repostagem no LinkeDin em autoridades municipais de prefeituras de municípios da região Sudeste do país.,"As verbas de publicidade distribuídas pelos entes Executivo, Legislativo e Municipal do Amazonas ao veículos de comunicação servem como moeda de troca para o silenciamento diante de questões evidentes que não são noticiadas no cenário local. A narrativa predominante é a do poder político local. Discursos, releases e demais materiais publicitários produzidos e reproduzidos pelos veículos jornalísticos contrastam com o cenário de gravidade que reflete a falta de políticas públicas em curso. O impacto da mídia especializada e independente no cenário local é pequeno, por conta desse domínio do capital. Procuramos insistentemente as autoridades para se manifestarem, que não responderam e até ignoraram ligações pessoais, o que demonstra o conforto e a certeza de que pouco fará efeito nos eleitores que estão na bolha de influência dos mesmos. A falta de transparência na divulgação dos dados e na protelação para o fornecimento de pedidos via LAI também dificultam o processo.","Diante da falta de dados abertos e da transparência de informações, optamos por usar a filtrarem do Sistema de Apoio ao Processo Legislativo (SAPL), presente em todos os poderes legislativos do país, responsávela pela automatização das atividades da Aleam, como a tramitação das proposições, ordem do dia, entre outroas, por exemplo.

Com uso de dados de satélite, registros públicos e entrevistas, a matéria revela como decisões políticas e a fiscalização falha facilitaram essa expansão. O projeto combina jornalismo investigativo e de dados para evidenciar impactos ambientais e sociais, destacando a relação entre políticas estaduais e a degradação de áreas protegidas na Amazônia.","A reportagem é um dos principais e mais completos conteúdos sobre o desmatamento na Resex Jaci-Paraná, abordando detalhadamente a expansão da agropecuária ilegal e suas consequências ambientais e sociais. Após sua publicação, portais repercutiram a denúncia, ampliando a visibilidade do problema.  Além disso, a investigação provavelmente contribuiu para mudanças na região. Poucos meses depois, a Justiça de Rondônia condenou um invasor a pagar R$ 21,5 milhões por desmatamento na reserva, frigoríficos foram responsabilizados por comprarem gado ilegal e ações de recomposição da vegetação começaram a ser implementadas. Esses desdobramentos reforçam a importância do jornalismo investigativo e de dados na fiscalização ambiental.","A reportagem foi produzida em um contexto desafiador, marcado por riscos e barreiras ao acesso à informação. Rondônia tem um histórico de flexibilização ambiental e omissão diante da devastação da Resex Jaci-Paraná. A comunicação com o governo não ofereceu respostas, dificultando a obtenção de dados oficiais.  Para contornar isso, foi necessário cruzar imagens de satélite, registros fundiários, autuações ambientais e documentos judiciais, além de entrevistar especialistas e lideranças locais. O uso de tecnologia geoespacial foi essencial para comprovar o avanço da agropecuária ilegal e sua relação com a cadeia produtiva da carne.  Além das dificuldades de apuração, houve riscos diretos para as fontes. Durante a investigação, a casa de uma pessoa da comunidade local foi incendiada, evidenciando a tensão na região. A cobertura de crimes ambientais na Amazônia envolve ameaças e desafios jurídicos, tornando o jornalismo investigativo ainda mais necessário.","Dados georreferenciados foram essenciais para identificar o desmatamento e a presença de gado na reserva. Imagens de satélite foram analisadas por meio de plataformas como Google Earth Pro e MapBiomas, permitindo visualizar a degradação ao longo do tempo.  Para a formulação de mapas e análise espacial, foram utilizados softwares como QGIS, possibilitando o cruzamento de dados ambientais com registros fundiários e informações de autuações ambientais. A Lei de Acesso à Informação (LAI) foi empregada para solicitar dados a órgãos públicos, como o Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (Ibama) e o governo de Rondônia, embora muitas respostas tenham sido limitadas ou inexistentes.  Além disso, foram analisados processos judiciais e documentos públicos  cruzando essas informações com dados espaciais para demonstrar a conexão entre a criação de gado ilegal e a destruição da reserva.","Este projeto demonstra a importância da combinação entre jornalismo investigativo, análise de dados georreferenciados e uso de ferramentas de acesso à informação para expor crimes ambientais. Outros jornalistas podem aprender que, diante de dificuldades de obtenção de dados oficiais, é possível cruzar imagens de satélite, registros fundiários e processos judiciais para revelar padrões de degradação ambiental e suas conexões com atores econômicos.    Além disso, o caso reforça a necessidade de persistência ao lidar com a falta de transparência governamental e a resistência de autoridades em responder a questionamentos. O uso da Lei de Acesso à Informação (LAI) deve ser complementado por fontes alternativas, como documentos públicos e dados de organizações especializadas.    Outro aprendizado relevante é a importância de medidas de segurança para jornalistas e fontes em investigações sobre desmatamento e crimes ambientais, especialmente na Amazônia, onde há riscos de retaliação. Construir redes de apoio, proteger informações sensíveis e contar com parcerias estratégicas são práticas fundamentais.    Por fim, o projeto destaca como o jornalismo pode contribuir para mudanças concretas, seja ao pressionar autoridades ou ampliar o debate público sobre a proteção de áreas protegidas, mostrando que investigações bem estruturadas têm impacto real.",Português,https://infoamazonia.org/2024/01/16/agropecuaria-ilegal-triplica-em-10-anos-na-resex-jaci-parana-em-rondonia/,,,,Giullia Venus Oliveira Santos,"Repórter sediada em Brasília, Brasil, colaborou com a Agência Pública de Jornalismo Investigativo, Ponte Jornalismo e InfoAmazonia.

The report found that 358 Indigenous lands were experiencing drought, representing 92% of the territories in the region.","We had 1,302 views on this report, and it was prominently featured in major Brazilian media outlets. It was used in a television report on TV Cultura and appeared on the front page of the Folha de S. Paulo website. It was also shared by Indigenous leaders on social media.    The data was obtained from the National Center for Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (Cemaden) through the Integrated Drought Index (IIS). Before the report, this information was not publicly available, but after its publication, Cemaden began releasing monthly drought data for Indigenous lands in the country.    The report revealed the Indigenous lands experiencing extreme drought, showing that Indigenous people were suffering from food shortages and improvising wooden bridges over areas where rivers once flowed. This information had not been published before in any other news outlet.","It is very difficult for a reporter to cover Indigenous peoples from a distance, but during periods of extreme drought, it becomes impossible to reach the places where they live, as there are no roads, rivers, or airports in these areas. This report successfully tackled the great challenge of revealing the impact of global warming on Indigenous lands through data analysis, constant investigation, and rigorous journalism.

Increase in treatment for anxiety and depression (Outpatient Health Actions Registry)  4. Increase in the incidence of depression (National Health Survey)  5. Increase in feelings of loneliness at school (Programme for International Student Assessment - PISA)  The codes used are available on GitHub.","The study brings to Brazil the debate about the impact of technology on youth mental health, aligning with Jonathan Haidt’s ”The Anxious Generation.” It contributes to discussions on public policies, such as banning cell phones in schools and the effects of social media.

It sought to reproduce analyses done for English-speaking countries that showed a pattern of accelerating deterioration of these indicators in the mid-2010s.","The project employed R programming language for comprehensive data analysis of mental health trends. We developed specialized scripts to process extensive microdata from multiple Brazilian databases including SUS (healthcare system), IBGE (statistical bureau), and PISA/OECD international assessments.  Our analytical approach included: - Statistical computation of prevalence rates and temporal trends - Population-weighted analyses using official IBGE demographic projections - Patient de-duplication techniques to ensure accurate counting of unique cases - Standardized filtering by ICD-10 diagnostic codes across different health information systems - Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons across age groups and years  For the SUS data, we processed records from four distinct systems: SIA (outpatient care), SINAN (mandatory reporting), SIH (hospitalizations), and SIM (mortality). Each required specific methodological adaptations.  The PISA analysis involved complex sample weighting and standardized measurement of belonging and technology distraction among students, following OECD protocols.  For PNS (National Health Survey), we analyzed self-reported depression diagnoses across two survey waves (2013/2019), ensuring methodological consistency with published research.  Visualizations were created using R’s ggplot2 library to effectively communicate trends across different demographic segments and time periods.","I hope other journalists see how a health crisis can be identified by analyzing different stages of a phenomenon, from self-reported feelings, such as feelings of isolation, to more serious effects, such as suicides.  It’s important to note how this analysis addresses the argument that this crisis isn’t real but rather due to more people reporting issues, because more serious cases (self-harm and suicides) are also increasing.

Brazil,Folha de São Paulo,Big,,,Party GPS: Mapping the Ideological Positions of Brazilian Political Parties in 2024,2024-09-04,"Explainer, Open data, Elections, Politics","Scraping, CSV, R, RStudio","’Party GPS’ is a data-driven analysis of Brazil’s political spectrum in 2024 using four datasets: party migration by candidates, parliamentary fronts, electoral coalitions, and Chamber voting patterns. The methodology reveals remarkable consistency across these dimensions, creating a robust ideological left-to-right scale (1-100) for all Brazilian parties. This framework powered multiple analyses during the 2024 elections, including geographical mapping of ’ideological islands’ in cities, tracking center-right advancement nationwide, and identifying regional partisan trends—providing evidence-based insights into Brazil’s complex political landscape.","The ”Party GPS” project had a significant impact on Brazil’s electoral coverage by transforming abstract ideological discussions into data-backed analysis. By creating a robust 1-100 scale of political positioning, we provided journalists and readers with an objective framework to understand Brazil’s complex 28-party system.  The methodology was used in various articles of Folha de São Paulo, and [also by others media outlets](https://noticias.uol.com.br/eleicoes/2024/10/27/segundo-turno-51-cidades-direita-centro-direita-favoritos-pesquisas.htm). Importantly, the scale was also implemented as a visual color system by Folha de São Paulo to represent the parties across the political spectrum, creating an intuitive visual language for readers. This visual approach is particularly valuable in Brazil’s multi-party context.  It enabled identification of key electoral patterns, including center-right advancement in capital cities and the revelation of ”ideological islands” within São Paulo neighborhoods.  It was also used by independent and academic researchers for their own analyses in social media (examples: [1](https://bsky.app/search?q=https:%2F%2Fwww1.folha.uol.com.br%2Fpoder%2F2024%2F09%2Fnovo-e-sigla-mais-a-direita-e-pstu-a-mais-a-esquerda-no-brasil-mostra-gps-partidario.shtml), [2](https://bsky.app/profile/rmtakata.bsky.social/post/3lamfbnhnj224), [3](https://bsky.app/profile/jcaetanoleite.bsky.social/post/3l5zqdoddkj22))  The project’s open-source approach promotes transparency in political analysis. The scale’s robustness is validated by the strong concordance between different dimensions, lending scientific credibility to reporting during a politically polarized election season and ensuring that the visual representations accurately reflect political realities.","Brazil’s political landscape features 28 registered parties, creating an exceptionally fragmented system that challenges traditional analysis. This fragmentation makes objective classification crucial yet methodologically complex.  A particularly challenging aspect of the Brazilian system involves small centrist parties that frequently shift their alignments between left and right based on opportunistic power arrangements rather than ideological consistency. This ”physiological politics” creates a perpetual challenge for journalists and academics attempting to position these parties accurately. Our analysis, however, demonstrated that it is possible to identify a high degree of consistent alignment patterns between these fluid centrist parties and those more clearly identified with specific ideological positions.  Data access presented significant challenges. While Brazil offers transparency through open data portals, the information is scattered across different systems with inconsistent formats. The TSE (Superior Electoral Court) API had frequent outages during the election period, requiring numerous workarounds.  The methodology faced potential political criticism from all sides, as objective classification can challenge entrenched partisan self-perceptions. To preempt this, we prioritized methodological transparency and robustness by combining multiple independent measures that showed remarkable convergence.","**Core Statistical Techniques:** - Correspondence Analysis (CA) for dimensionality reduction in party migration, parliamentary fronts, and electoral coalitions - MCMC IRT (Markov Chain Monte Carlo Item Response Theory) specifically for Chamber voting data to handle missing values  **Programming Environment:** - R as the primary analysis language - R packages used: dplyr, stringr, purrr, data.table, tidyr, tibble, ca, magrittr, glue, rvest, jsonlite, httr, lubridate, MCMCpack, scales  **Data Sources:** - TSE (Electoral Court) data for party migration patterns between 2020 and 2024 elections - Chamber of Deputies data for parliamentary fronts in the 57th legislature - TSE data for electoral coalitions in the 2024 municipal elections - Chamber of Deputies voting records from 2023 to August 15, 2024  **Methodology Process:** - Data collected from the four distinct sources - Separate analyses conducted on each dimension - Rankings normalized to a 1-100 scale (1 = leftmost, 100 = rightmost) - Final positioning determined by simple arithmetic mean of the four normalized rankings - Parties categorized into ideological groups based on this final score  **Reproducibility:** - All code publicly available on GitHub  This methodology is influenced by the awards winning article of Pablo Barbera [”Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together: Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter Data”](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-analysis/article/birds-of-the-same-feather-tweet-together-bayesian-ideal-point-estimation-using-twitter-data/91E37205F69AEA32EF27F12563DC2A0A). But here we didn’t used social media followers, but political partys action.","First, the importance of using multidimensional data to analyze political phenomena. By combining four different behavioral metrics (party migration, parliamentary fronts, voting patterns, and electoral coalitions), journalists can create more robust classifications that transcend subjective interpretations.  Second, the power of methodological transparency. By making all code and methodology publicly available, this project builds credibility and invites scrutiny—essential qualities for data journalism in politically sensitive contexts.  Third, how to transform complex statistical analyses into accessible journalistic narratives. The project successfully bridges sophisticated methods (Correspondence Analysis and MCMC IRT) with clear visualizations and explanations that readers can understand.  Fourth, the value of creating reusable analytical frameworks.

The data-driven analysis provided concrete evidence about the career paths of youth players, moving beyond anecdotal stories to show the statistical reality faced by tournament participants.","The investigation faced significant data access challenges, as Brazil lacks a centralized system tracking football players’ careers. To overcome this, we created a novel methodology combining multiple databases: the São Paulo Football Federation’s match reports, the Brazilian Football Confederation’s contract registry (BID), and specialized websites Transfermarkt and O Gol.  The process required extensive manual verification to address data gaps, name variations, and homonyms. We developed unique player identifiers to track individuals across different sources - a challenging task given the prevalence of nickname usage and inconsistent record-keeping in Brazilian football.  Additionally, mapping the career trajectories of players who left football entirely required creative research strategies, including social media searches and direct outreach to former teammates.","**Data Collection & Processing:** - Applied OCR technology to extract player names, team affiliations, and match details from digitized match reports from the São Paulo Football Federation website - Developed a method to bypass the CAPTCHA system on the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) database to access the Daily Information Bulletin (BID) containing player transfer records - Implemented fuzzy matching algorithms in R with custom similarity thresholds to link player records across databases with inconsistent naming conventions - Established a manual verification process to validate automated matches, especially for homonyms and incomplete records - Created a uniform identifier system mapping players and teams consistently across multiple data sources  **Analysis Methodology:** - Used R programming for data cleansing, transformation, and statistical analysis - Developed a club ranking system categorizing teams into eight tiers based on squad market valuations from multiple years - Applied statistical methods to define player career outcomes using market value thresholds adjusted for inflation - Cross-referenced player data across four sources (Copinha records, BID, Transfermarkt, and O Gol) to create complete profiles - Constructed consensus tables tracking player team affiliations, excluding short-term contracts under 90 days - Created a market value estimation method for players with incomplete data, using team averages and historical patterns","Connecting separate databases often yields insights unavailable from any single source. Our method of linking player records across different platforms could be applied to many topics beyond sports.  The combination of data analysis with human stories created a more complete picture. The statistics gained meaning through the experiences of former players representing different career paths.  Data journalism can effectively challenge popular narratives by providing concrete evidence. In this case, quantifying career outcomes offered a counterpoint to the story of football as a reliable path to social mobility in Brazil.",Português,https://arte.folha.uol.com.br/deltafolha/2024/copinha/,,,,"Daniel Mariani, Luciano Trindade , Paula Soprana, Nicholas Pretto Augusto Conconi e Paula Soprana","Journalist specializing in data journalism who works at Folha de São Paulo.

Brazil,Núcleo Jornalismo,Small,,,Kwai está infestado de conteúdo que sexualiza menores,2024-01-24,"Investigation, Mobile App, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Women, Crime, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","A reportagem mostra que o Kwai deixa sem a devida moderação vídeos, comentários e perfis que sexualizam crianças e adolescentes – proliferando a distribuição desse tipo de conteúdo para cada vez mais usuários na rede. Essa negligência permite que a plataforma seja usada como um meio de divulgação para conteúdos explícitos de abuso sexual de menores e ponto de encontro para quem se interessa por esse material.  Na investigação, o Núcleo usou a rede social por dois meses. Na visualização, nós ilustramos um dos testes realizados e demonstramos de forma objetiva quantos vídeos assistimos até encontrar conteúdo sexualizando menores de idade.","Após a reportagem do Núcleo, representantes da Kwai foram a Brasília prestar explicações sobre possíveis violações da plataforma sobre contas fake e conteúdos com exploração sexual de crianças (https://nucleo.jor.br/institucional/2024-02-05-kwai-presta-esclarecimento-ao-ministerio-da-justica-apos-reportagens/).   O Núcleo denunciou que rede social se tornou espaço para proliferação de conteúdo que sexualiza crianças e adolescentes, com pouca ou nenhuma moderação para evitar a propagação desse tipo de conteúdo.   O site Metrópoles informou que representantes da rede social Kwai foram a Brasília prestar explicações sobre possíveis violações da plataforma. Segundo o veículo, a reunião aconteceu no Ministério da Justiça do Brasil e contou com a presença da Secretária de Políticas Digitais, pasta subordinada à Secretaria de Comunicação Social (Secom).","A falta de moderação do Kwai faz com que o conteúdo impróprio seja distribuído para cada vez mais pessoas e promove o uso da rede social como ponto de encontro para interessados em exploração sexual de crianças e adolescentes. Além de não moderar, a plataforma parece incentivar esse tipo de conteúdo.   Uma denúncia já havia sido enviada ao Ministério Público Federal, dizendo que Kwai estaria promovendo conteúdos irregulares para ”angariar seguidores, cliques e engajamento”, o que incluiria a exposição indevida de menores.  Mesmo assim, o Kwai seguiu atingindo um público enorme. A plataforma se tornou patrocinadora do Big Brother Brasil em 2024 e 2025, exibido pela TV Globo, uma das cotas publicitárias mais caras da emissora e do país. E em 2023, o Kwai foi um dos patrocinadores do programa A Fazenda, reality show transmitido pela TV Record.","Na investigação, criamos dois perfis no Kwai e usamos normalmente a plataforma. Rapidamente, conteúdos sexualmente sugestivos de menores passaram a ser reiteradamente exibidos.  Passamos a interagir com algumas publicações e seguir os perfis que postavam esses vídeos. A partir daí, o próprio Kwai passou a sugerir buscas por termos associados ao abuso sexual infantil.  Após essas recomendações do próprio Kwai, começamos a testar a moderação da plataforma ao fazer buscas com termos associados a conteúdos de abuso e exploração sexual de menores e não encontramos dificuldade em localizar a troca de materiais do tipo nos comentários.  Depois, as contas criadas pelo Núcleo também passaram a receber trechos de conteúdos de fetiches, desde desenhos animados japoneses envolvendo sexo entre personagens infantis até podolatria.

Hungary,Hungarian service of RFE/RL (Szabad Európa),Small,,,"Power Restored, Europe Diminished: The Evolving Rhetoric in Orbán’s State of the Nation Addresses",2025-02-23,"Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Elections, Politics","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","”Power Restored, Europe Diminished” examines the evolving rhetoric in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s State of the Nation addresses. Using web scraping and text analysis on decades of yearly speeches, we track changes in keyword frequency, sentiment, and thematic focus. The findings reveal a shift towards a simpler, more emotionally driven, and confrontational style, where external threats and national resilience play an increasing role. Through data visualization and narrative analysis, the project illustrates how political discourse reflects broader strategic transformations.","The project reached over 20,000 people across social media platforms, generating hundreds of reactions and sparking discussions on the evolution of political rhetoric in Hungary. Readers engaged with the findings, often placing Orbán’s shifting language into a historical perspective and comparing it to their own experiences. This led to conversations about continuities and shifts in political messaging, contributing to a broader understanding of the topic.  Beyond social media, the project was also discussed in a podcast episode featuring the journalists behind the analysis, offering additional context on the methodology and findings. It successfully engaged its audience, prompting dialogue about how language shapes political perception over time.","Independent data journalism in Hungary faces significant challenges due to limited access to public data—most datasets require lengthy requests or legal battles to obtain. However, Viktor Orbán’s State of the Nation speeches are widely published in multiple formats, making text collection relatively straightforward. The real challenge lay in analyzing and interpreting the speeches over decades, as their content is often repetitive and ideologically charged. To enhance sentiment accuracy, we developed a custom sentiment dictionary tailored to Orbán’s vocabulary, improving the precision of our analysis. While sentiment analysis in political discourse is inherently challenging due to contextual shifts in meaning, our approach allowed for a more nuanced and accurate interpretation of rhetorical trends. Additionally, time pressure played a role—the 2024 speech was delivered on February 17, and our analysis was published by February 23. Despite this, we successfully built a comprehensive, data-driven breakdown of how Orbán’s rhetoric has evolved, showcasing long-term trends in his political messaging. And for those who prefer visual semiotics over text analysis, we also tracked the color of Orbán’s ties throughout the years.","We combined automated data collection, text analysis, and visual storytelling to track rhetorical shifts in Orbán’s speeches. The speeches were collected via web scraping in R, as they are publicly available but not in a structured dataset. After preprocessing, we conducted keyword frequency analysis in R to track recurring themes over time. This project builds on a 2022 analysis, which used basic keyword tracking. This time, we applied sentiment analysis, speech structure metrics, and a custom dictionary for deeper insights. Using R made the methodology replicable and updatable, allowing future speeches to be analyzed with minimal effort. To improve sentiment analysis, we built a custom sentiment dictionary based on Orbán’s vocabulary, using the Political Science Dictionary of the Centre for Social Sciences as a reference. Since many words in Orbán’s speeches have context-specific meanings, generic sentiment models were insufficient. We measured sentiment by comparing the balance of positive and negative words, making tonal shifts easier to track. We also analyzed speech structure, including speech and sentence length, to identify broader stylistic trends. For visualization, we created simple but effective charts using Datawrapper, prioritizing clarity over complexity.","This project shows that simple keyword frequency analysis and straightforward visualizations can still produce valuable insights—there’s no need for complex statistical models to create a meaningful data-driven story. Another key lesson is that custom sentiment dictionaries can improve the accuracy of political speech analysis, especially when dealing with rhetoric that doesn’t fit standard sentiment models. Finally, the project proves that effective data journalism can be done under tight deadlines—with the right approach, even a fresh speech can be analyzed and published within days.",Hungarian,https://www.szabadeuropa.hu/a/orban-evertekelo-beszed-szavak/32830527.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPftdPPaAHQ,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lyPHba48VsSb2bZbAPl_qWgKleMW47pOLIWVbgWacfM/edit?usp=sharing,https://www.szabadeuropa.hu/a/orban-beszedek-szavak-elofordulasa/31755852.html,"Bálint Szalai, Dóra Németh","Bálint Szalai is an award-winning Hungarian journalist and data analyst specializing in economic crime, corruption research, and investigative reporting.

This thought gave birth to a story whose aim was not to sensationalise or cover political debates and PR models of governments. We decided to make this database story factual and grounded by sharing the thoughts of some of the most trusted policymakers in India, who have been pursuing the dream of developing model roads since the 90s.","After four weeks of research and three weeks of ground coverage, the story achieved its objective. It showed how highways passing through populated areas were causing deaths in violation of scientific recommendations. Taking the readers through the report cards of the states on trauma centres, silence on over-speeding, commission-grabbing on heavy vehicles, lack of public data, the story reaches the gender disparity on roads, which shows how even today in India, men are trusted more for driving than women. We are pleased that the truth about this web of roads was recently selected among the winners of the ICFJ (International Center for Journalists) Road Safety Reporting Competition 2024. ”This story presents a powerful analysis of road crash patterns in India, featuring strong medical, academic and civil society voices. It also includes excellent calls to action, including on tackling high speeds,” the ICFJ Special Comment said.","India’s growing road network is playing a big role in the country’s progress, and the government is leaving no stone unturned to take credit for it. It is intent on portraying it as a glimpse of developed India through its PR models. In all this noise, it is easily succeeding in hiding that aspect, which is related to the safety of millions and crores of lives.  The praise of wide roads can be seen and heard in various media channels, but how dangerous is the other side of this momentum for the economy? Perhaps a deep discussion can be heard or seen on this.  Through this story, we were successful in providing to our readers that even today, in a country with a population of 140 crores, the correct data of road accidents is not recorded. By using legal tactics, political diplomacy as well as new technologies, the government system is succeeding in hiding the accurate data. Government data was hidden from us for this story. The facts on public platforms were described as misleading and we were even threatened with a legal notice but our research continued and the story served its purpose.","To make this story credible, we first did live ground reporting in which we went to different areas and captured live pictures on camera as evidence. We created a Google Sheet through which we sought views on road safety from more than 200 people. This was circulated through social media, especially WhatsApp.  Apart from this, through an Excel sheet, we analysed the data of different states of the country and independent reports. After the story was published, we shared it across various social media platforms as well as in groups where independent experts and policymakers are present.  Used database query languages such as SQL to access data and create interactive charts, in addition to programming languages such as Python and R for advanced analysis. It also incorporated Tableau for creating visualisations that effectively communicated our findings. This combination of tools allowed us to present the data in a compelling manner, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the key insights and implications of our research.","The journalism community has a lot to learn from this project. Its biggest lesson is to move beyond government PR models and expose the ground reality. For this, time, intention and transparency are all necessary. Despite legal and political pressure on us, as well as lack of cooperation from the responsible departments, the story was brought to its objective. The project is also meant for journalists to learn how the project can use diverse sources, community-based reporting, and data visualization to tell complex stories.

We Asked 100 Practitioners,2024-07-12,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Video, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","In this investigation, I used a data-driven approach to examine ”Family Constellation” practitioners in Turkey, a pseudoscientific practice that lacks scientific proof. I contacted 100 practitioners, asking if they could cure MS (Multiple Sclerosis), an incurable disease. 34 claimed they could heal MS, despite legal restrictions on unlicensed medical claims.   This data, along with screenshots from text messages, highlights the extent of misinformation and the urgent need for better regulation.  Through expert analysis, we broke down claims and offered practical tips for the public to protect themselves. I believe this project showcases data journalism’s power in combating health disinformation.","The project has gained significant attention, with 65,000 views on YouTube and about 500,000 views  social media posts, a number that continues to grow. The majority of viewers are women, and the feedback in comments and on social media shows that the investigation was both informative and useful. Given the popularity of a Netflix series promoting the supposed healing effects of Family Constellation Therapy, I believe, this project became essential in providing factual information. The project filled a critical gap, helping people make informed decisions about their health. It not only informed viewers on the potential dangers of pseudoscientific practices but also sparked discussions about the need for regulation in the field.   By addressing a growing issue with evidence-based analysis, this project has contributed to a broader dialogue on health-related disinformation, showing how data journalism can play a key role in shaping public understanding and fostering critical thinking.  Additionally, there were several comments asking us to investigate other pseudoscientific practices, highlighting a clear demand for further inquiry in this field.","Data on pseudoscientific practices and practitioners is difficult to obtain unless you create it yourself. When investigating such practices, journalists typically rely on field trips or case studies. However, I wanted to capture the broader picture, hypothesizing that there was insufficient regulation in Turkey. This led me to conduct my own research over 3 to 4 months.  I contacted over 100 family constellation practitioners, sourcing their contact details from social media, using a fake WhatsApp account and name, pretending to be someone with MS. As I held the conversations, I directly entered the data into an Excel sheet, tracking session costs, their other titles, and claims about curing MS. This labor-intensive process allowed me to transform raw conversations into usable data.  So far, I haven’t come across a data project where a journalist has personally contacted over 100 people and turned it into a ddj investigation. This approach is particularly unique for the Turkish media ecosystem. To interpret the data, I consulted legal and psychological experts, who helped assess the practitioners’ claims and the need for regulation. Furthermore, I highlighted a law rarely discussed in public: it is illegal to claim treatment for conditions like MS without a medical license.","Tools & Technologies:  1.Instagram & WhatsApp: I sourced practitioner contact details from Instagram and communicated with them via WhatsApp. To maintain anonymity, I created a fake profile on WhatsApp, engaged with practitioners as someone seeking help for MS and collected unfiltered responses.  2. Excel: I used Excel to organize the data collected from family constellation practitioners, creating columns to track session costs, titles, gender, Instagram followers, and claims regarding MS treatment. I utilized Excel’s filtering and PivotTable features to analyze and summarize large amounts of data I reduced from our conversations, allowing for deeper insights into trends and patterns.     Techniques:  1. Impersonation: By posing as a person with MS, I was able to engage practitioners openly and receive genuine responses about their practices and claims. This helped me gather authentic data, some of which are shown on the video.    2. Visualization with Legos: To better visualize the data, I used Legos as a tool for creating physical models that represented different categories within the data. I made the visualisation via real-life objects such as legos and sticks.  Expert Consultations: I also worked with legal and psychological experts to assess the legality of practitioners’ claims and interpret the data responsibly.","1. Creating a dataset from scratch: When data is lacking, journalists can create their own dataset, as I did by reaching out to over 100 family constellation practitioners. This allows for research in areas that are hard to access.  2. Blending qualitative and quantitative data: Combining qualitative insights from conversations with practitioners with structured quantitative data in Excel provides a fuller and more comprehensive analysis.  3. Persistence and attention to detail: Reaching out to over 100 people and following up with those who didn’t respond demonstrates the importance of persistence.   4. Collaboration with experts: Consulting legal and psychological experts helps ensure accurate data interpretation and strengthens the credibility of the investigation.   The data, collected between March and May 2024, clearly demonstrates the lack of control and inspection from the officials.  Out of 100 family constellation practitioners:  - 34 claim to cure diseases - 59 attribute multiple sclerosis (MS) to psychological causes - 7 provided no information  - 5 have the title of psychologist, 1 is a medical doctor - The average number of Instagram followers is 54,000 - The average session price is 2,700 Turkish Lira  Out of 20 people from other pseudoscientific practices, 6 claim to cure MS.","Turkish, English (The English translation has been uploaded to the YouTube channel.

United States of America,"Documented (lead reporters), The Markup, The Guardian",Small,,,How TikTok Lead Migrants to Misery in America,2024-05-31,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Fact-checking, Crowdsourcing, Immigration","AI/Machine learning, Google Sheets, Python","As border states began sending  thousands of migrants to New York in 2022, it became clear that this period of migration was unique. Many had used social media to navigate the treacherous path to the U.S. and relayed their experiences when they arrived on the same platforms. On TikTok, New York looked like paradise: free housing, food, and ample work. This fueled further migration, leading more people to settle in the city, which changed its political landscape. But many migrants felt misled by the harsh reality of living here versus what they saw online. Our reporting sought to examine this.","This project was the first data based attempt to understand how misinformation about immigration drives people to travel to the United States. We interviewed dozens of people from China, Latin America and Africa to understand the role social media played in their decisionmaking. Investigative Reporter Lam Thuy Vo created a program that downloads TikTok videos, translates them from multiple languages and then analyzes the text for themes. We published that code and immediately received interest from other reporters in how they could use it for their own stories.  Documented has covered the role of TikTok in U.S. migration since 2022. We were one of the first organizations to take a thorough look at how social media was being used to facilitate migration here. Our connection to  immigrant communities and experience covering multiple waves of migration to New York allowed us to understand the uniqueness of this time. We were able to also look at  multiple immigrant communities, including people from West Africa, Latin America and China. By repeatedly returning to this topic through new angles with our partners, we were able to continue pushing the conversation forward. Through workshops, we taught dozens of immigrants about how to identify misinformation.","TikTok’s algorithms reward overly sensational or attention-grabbing content. This led many migration influencers to create content that either made their lives look better than they actually were or to produce viral and misleading information around immigration processes in the U.S. Documented and its partners The Markup and The Guardian, were the first news organizations to take a data-driven approach to examine this issue. We worked with migrants to access their viewing history of tens of thousands of videos, which we downloaded, automatically transcribed and analyzed using various types of machine learning. We were able to show through compelling narrative writing as well as data analysis, that migration related misinformation has proliferated on the platform and is driving people to travel to the U.S., where they face significant hardship, like an inability to find work and in some cases, homelessness.   Our stories offer an interdisciplinary approach to reporting that is not only bringing together reporters with different skillsets but also works hand-in-hand with the immigrant community to gather information. This allowed us to delve into issues that affect some of our city’s most vulnerable residents. We believe these methods have wide applicability, and should be used on other subjects.","Reporter Malick Gai traveled to shelters across New York City to interview West African migrants about how social media plays a role in their lives. During those conversations, Malick convinced them to download their TIkTok browsing history and send it to Documented, which was no simple task. Many of the migrants struggled with understanding how to export the data, so Malick had to revisit the shelters to collect it himself. Once we had the files, we had to sort through the tens of thousands of TikTok videos, to understand what was relevant. We focused on videos that were watched by 3 or more of the migrants, to set a base line for what information was being shared in the community. Lam Thuy Vo wrote code that enabled us to transcribe, translate and sort the videos by theme and general content. We were able to exclude the many videos about politics in their home countries and unrelated content and just focus on videos about migration to the U.S. Malick reviewed each video by individually and flagged all videos that contained false or misleading information. The final result, was an exhaustive look at content that was consumed by a community of migrants.","Misinformation can be hard to report on, because it is difficult to quantify. Tech reporting can also sometimes feel removed from the experience of consumers of, focusing on company policies and power structures. We believe that by collaborating with the most vulerable users to understand how social media affects them, journalists are able to break new ground and understand how these platforms are affecting peoples decisions and lives.",English,https://documentedny.com/2024/09/26/newyork-migration-tiktok-misinformation-senegal/,https://documentedny.com/2024/12/20/tiktok-migrants-immigration-social-media/,https://documentedny.com/2024/05/31/china-tiktok-migration-douyin/,https://github.com/lamthuyvo/tiktok-analysis-pipeline,"Lam Thuy Vo, Malick Gai, April Xu, Rommel Ojeda","Documented first began to understand the outsized impact of TikTok on migration, while covering the arrival of tens of thousands of migrants in New York City in 2022.

There has been ongoing reporting in mainstream media regarding these conditions of air pollution, but so far, there has been no investigation into the government spending directly collected from the annual taxes of ordinary citizens. Through this story, we have unveiled that despite receiving ₹3,600 crores, there has not been a single day in 2024 when the level of air pollution moved from hazardous to normal. On behalf of data collected from various sources, this story recently won the National Environmental Awareness Award.","In this story, we have indeed employed the fundamental principles of data journalism. Additionally, we have highlighted critical issues such as biodiversity and plastic pollution through data, alongside air pollution. Governments are making extensive use of revenue collected from the public, but due to corruption, these benefits are not reaching people at the grassroots level. We have also demonstrated in our story how disregarding scientific facts is causing both health issues and a loss of millions of rupees to the country.  Our story recently received the National Environmental Awareness Award. This recognition underscores the importance of raising awareness about environmental challenges and the need for accountability in governance. By sharing our findings, we hope to inspire action and encourage collaboration between communities and policymakers to create a sustainable future.","The biggest problem for India is pollution. From groundwater to toxic air and water pollution, it has become life-threatening for the lifelines of many cities like Delhi. There has been considerable discussion about it in politics and mainstream media, but so far, no one has presented this debate with strong data and solutions.  For this project, we collected data from various stations in Delhi using existing innovative technologies. Data was gathered from local departments in the cities that have the worst conditions. With the help of an Excel sheet, we organised the data and completed the analysis.  From the beginning, our objective for this project has been that addressing pollution is not a major challenge. The country does not lack resources and revenue for this purpose. What is needed is a transparent government system and political commitment, which has not yet been fulfilled. Without these essential components, efforts to combat pollution may remain ineffective and superficial.  Therefore, it is crucial for citizens to advocate for stronger accountability measures and to demand action from their leaders to ensure a cleaner, healthier environment for future generations.","Our project is entirely data-driven, starting with web scraping to access data from government agencies through API links. Additionally, we have compiled datasets from various scattered sources on the internet, such as government websites, research institutions, and data portals, using publicly available datasets. We made the data analysable through spreadsheets and then transformed the data by detecting outliers using the Python programming language. Statistical analysis, data pattern recognition, geographic structure development through AI algorithms, and data visualisation using Power BI were undertaken.","This project is no less than a training opportunity for any journalist. It has successfully provided a better understanding of various tools to prepare more effective and reliable ground reports in a shorter time. Additionally, it has succeeded in attracting interest in learning about data visualisation techniques for effectively utilising large datasets and presenting complex information in an accessible manner.",Hindi,https://indiaspendhindi.com/cover-story/even-after-getting-rs-3600-crore-4-states-did-not-get-even-a-single-day-of-clean-air-in-2024-936586,https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTqAeMo0ewygvwwV6QbiClF4BZjGKJLjCyPmKGIwBoeWjrv0_nZ4a4xUZGF58vc7R7YB1U_1_eAJG-C/pub,,,"Project Owner - Alka Barbele Publisher/ Editorial Help- Mr Saurabh Sharma, Editor, IndiaSpend Hindi Photos- Mr Vivek Nigam (Paid)","Alka is a seasoned freelance journalist with a focus on health, environmental, and climate change issues, currently contributing to IndiaSpend since 2024.

Kenya,Talk Africa,Small,,,How Men in Northeastern Kenya are Leading the Fight against FGM,2004-12-05,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, Infographics, Map, Culture, Women, Human rights",Microsoft Excel,"In Northeastern Kenya, a growing movement of men is taking a stand against female genital mutilation (FGM), challenging deep-rooted cultural norms. Traditionally seen as a women’s issue, FGM is now being confronted by fathers, religious leaders, and local activists who recognize its harmful effects on girls’ health and education. Through advocacy, community dialogues, and legal enforcement, these men are working to change mindsets and protect future generations. Their efforts, often met with resistance, are gradually shifting perspectives, proving that engaging men as allies is key to ending FGM in the region.","The project had a significant impact on the fight against FGM in Northeastern Kenya by shifting cultural perceptions and encouraging male involvement in ending the practice. Since i shared the story with the relevenant stakehollders, the following were the Key outcomes:  Increased Awareness & Advocacy: More men, including fathers, elders, and religious leaders, are publicly  opposing FGM, challenging traditional norms.  Reports from community organizations indicated a decline in FGM cases in areas where male advocates actively intervened.  Authorities, with support from men in the community have strengthened enforcement of anti-FGM laws, leading to increased reporting and action against perpetrators.  Girls at risk of FGM are finding greater support in their families, with more parents opting for education over harmful cultural rites.  Local and national leaders have taken note, integrating male-led approaches into anti-FGM programs to sustain long-term change.","The fight against FGM in Northeastern Kenya operates within a complex socio-political landscape. Despite Kenya’s legal ban on FGM, enforcement remains a challenge due to deeply ingrained cultural practices, limited resources, and cross-border cutting. Northeastern Kenya, with its vast, remote areas, faces additional hurdles such as weak institutional presence, reluctance from law enforcement, and the clandestine nature of FGM.  Access to data is another challenge, as many cases go unreported or are settled informally. This project relied on innovative storytelling approaches, including firsthand testimonies, engagement with male allies, and data-driven insights from local NGOs and government agencies.  Political and religious leaders play a crucial role in shaping attitudes toward FGM. While some have been instrumental in supporting anti-FGM efforts, others remain hesitant, fearing backlash from conservative factions. The story highlights how men—fathers, elders, and religious figures—are navigating these tensions to drive meaningful change.  Despite these constraints, the story showcases a rare and powerful shift: men stepping up as advocates against FGM. Their involvement is reshaping the narrative, challenging cultural norms, and influencing local policies, proving that grassroots-driven change can be a catalyst for broader systemic reform.","For this project, I employed a combination of investigative journalism, data analysis, and multimedia storytelling to provide a comprehensive and impactful narrative.  Data Collection & Analysis I gathered quantitative data from local NGOs, government reports, and international bodies tracking FGM prevalence. This helped establish historical trends and measure the impact of male-led interventions.  Interviews & Field Reporting I conducted in-depth interviews with male anti-FGM advocates, survivors, community elders, religious leaders, and local authorities to capture diverse perspectives. Given the sensitivity of the topic, I ensured ethical reporting by protecting identities where necessary.  Geospatial Mapping & Visuals To highlight FGM hotspots and cross-border cutting routes, I integrated geospatial analysis, illustrating the regions most affected . The story included a detailed map of Kenya, visually marking areas where the fight against FGM has been most active, making the data more accessible to readers.  Multimedia Storytelling The project featured powerful visuals, including photography and data visuals amplifying the voices of men leading the change. These elements provided an emotional connection and brought their stories to life.  Social Media & Audience Engagement To extend the reach of the story, I leveraged social media for audience interaction, incorporating real-time discussions on shifting gender norms in the fight against FGM.","This project offers several key lessons for journalists covering sensitive social issues, particularly those related to gender norms and cultural practices:  1. The Power of a People-Centered Approach Rather than focusing solely on statistics, this story prioritized the lived experiences of men leading the fight against FGM. Journalists can learn the importance of humanizing data by integrating personal narratives that resonate with audiences.  2. Ethical and Sensitive Reporting FGM is a deeply personal and often traumatic issue. This project underscores the need for ethical storytelling—protecting survivor identities, obtaining informed consent, and respecting cultural sensitivities while still holding power to account.  3. Innovative Use of Data & Visual Storytelling By incorporating geospatial mapping, photos, and visuals, the story made complex issues more accessible and engaging. Journalists can learn how data visualization can strengthen impact and provide new entry points for audiences.  4. Shifting the Narrative FGM stories often center women and survivors, but this project flipped the script by highlighting male-led interventions. This demonstrates the value of finding fresh angles in well-covered issues to challenge stereotypes and spark new conversations.",English,https://www.talkafrica.co.ke/32158-2/,https://www.talkafrica.co.ke/flooded-with-infections-the-story-of-mukuru-women-after-the-floods/,https://www.talkafrica.co.ke/middle-men-rip-off-from-artisanal-soapstone-miners-in-kenya/,,"Editorial support by Jayalakshmi Shreedhar,  Winnie Kamau","Lenah Bosibori is an award-winning journalist recognized with the 2023 Annual Journalism Excellence Award (AJEA) by the Media Council of Kenya.

PDFs submitted to the electoral court were converted into a spreadsheet, allowing textual analysis to detect identical plans. Running the same code on past elections revealed repeated use of texts. The findings uncovered a parallel industry that produces government plans for candidates, often copying content from other cities or states. Many candidates submit plagiarized documents, exposing a widespread practice of recycled political proposals.","All the candidates mentioned admitted to plagiarism and may face legal proceedings in the electoral court. The report could also drive changes in the rules for submitting electoral plans to prevent these documents from being simply copied, which could be considered misleading to the public.","The report makes innovative use of Python for an unprecedented analysis of government plans in municipal elections. We downloaded nearly 60,000 mayoral candidates’ plans from both the current and past elections. These documents were converted into a spreadsheet, allowing us to identify common words, phrases, and paragraphs. The results revealed hundreds of plans copied from one another, including identical spelling mistakes.  The analysis also examined plan lengths, finding that some candidates submitted just a single page with no details. Additionally, at least two parties used identical plans for their candidates, disregarding local specificities. This journalistic effort is unprecedented—while past reports mentioned isolated cases, none have examined all plans or compared them across elections.

Decades of unchecked encroachment, political greed, and land grabs have led to a dramatic loss of forest cover and biodiversity. As the green disappears, surrounding communities face worsening floods, prolonged droughts, and dwindling livelihoods, especially for livestock keepers.  #GreedVsGreen uncovers the forces driving this destruction—who profits, who suffers, and what’s at stake. Through investigative storytelling, we explore the consequences of this ecological crisis and the urgent solutions needed to save Ngong Forest before it’s too late.","GREEN VS GREED  By exposing the forest’s degradation and the factors driving it, the story heightened awareness about the urgent need for conservation, leading to widespread public outcry and activism.   This collective concern put significant pressure on authorities, culminating in a decisive response as the Kenyan government, through CS Aden Duale, revoked the licenses of developers responsible for encroaching on the forest.  The impact of this story can be measured in several key ways. It sparked widespread public discourse, both online and offline, with hashtags like #SaveNgongForest trending on social media platforms, signaling increased engagement and awareness.   The exposé also led to direct policy action, as the revocation of development licenses demonstrated the government’s commitment to addressing the issue.  Empowered by the increased visibility of the issue, local communities have actively participated in conservation efforts, including tree planting initiatives and monitoring activities to safeguard the forest’s future.   Environmental organizations have also intensified their advocacy, launching targeted campaigns to protect urban green spaces like Ngong Forest from further encroachment.  Moreover, the story’s value extends beyond its immediate impact, as it has become a resource for training in investigative journalism, solutions journalism, and climate change reporting.","This project was undertaken in an environment of high political sensitivity, legal risks, and logistical challenges, making its execution both dangerous and resource-intensive.  Ngong Forest is at the heart of Nairobi’s environmental future, yet its destruction is fueled by powerful political and business interests that have long operated with impunity. Investigating this issue meant confronting legal threats, intimidation, and restricted access to official records, as land transactions are often opaque and protected by influential stakeholders.  Resource constraints also posed a challenge. The team navigated rough terrain to document encroachment, using covert filming techniques and drone footage to capture real-time evidence of land grabs and deforestation. Given the reluctance of key figures to speak on record, digital forensics and open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques were employed to track land ownership patterns and policy inconsistencies.  The project required innovative storytelling to ensure its impact. Google Earth mapping, data visualization, and animations were integrated to show the forest’s alarming reduction over time. The team also leveraged social media strategies, making #SaveNgongForest a rallying cry that led to policy changes and the revocation of development licenses","To uncover the encroachment of Ngong Forest and its environmental impact, we combined investigative journalism, scientific reporting, and solutions journalism, leveraging innovative tools and techniques for accurate storytelling and data analysis.

The project was developed in four stages, providing relevant and personalized coverage. On the first day of the campaign, g1 published 5,569 reports, one for each city, listing candidates and updating them daily until election day. After the vote, g1 published 5,569  reports with local results. Artificial intelligence enabled the publication of automated videos, enhancing accessibility. Once official data was released, g1 published 109,084 reports detailing voting results at each ballot box. On inauguration day, 5,569 texts were published with details of mayors and most voted councilors.","The automated reports received dozens of millions of pageviews (confidential figures available upon request), demonstrating their usefulness to the public.  Beyond providing election results, the project’s data-gathering process uncovered information with direct societal impact.  All 125,791 reports included a link for readers to report relevant facts to the newsroom. One such report, submitted in the first stage, revealed that a candidate mentioned in an automated article was wanted by law enforcement. This tip led g1 to uncover that more than 60 candidates had outstanding arrest warrants. Following g1’s reports, dozens were arrested by authorities.  Additionally, the analysis revealed that in 25 out of 5,569 cities, the most voted mayoral candidates did not take office due to death, imprisonment, or judicial rulings.","The Brazilian municipal elections are a large-scale event. In 2024, voters in 5,569 municipalities chose from 463,000 candidates for 5,569 mayoral positions, 5,569 deputy mayor positions, and 58,000 city council seats.  Brazil has a robust electoral system, supported by electronic voting since 1996, with no recorded fraud affecting election outcomes. However, in recent years, electronic ballot boxes have faced unsubstantiated attacks, including from public officials.  By automating election coverage, g1 provided voters with a fast, accessible, and easy-to-understand way to verify results at every polling station nationwide.  From a news consumption perspective, the rise of platforms favoring segmented content (such as Google Discover and WhatsApp Channels) has increased both the demand for and the opportunity to invest in such initiatives.","g1 implemented an automated data pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), integrating Google Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Dataflow to collect, process, and distribute data from Brazil’s Superior Electoral Court (TSE). Data was structured in JSON and XML formats to ensure speed and accuracy.  Automated texts, infographics, and videos were generated, with video rendering done via Nexrender and Adobe After Effects, using Windows virtual machines on Google Compute Engine. To ensure video accuracy, g1 used artificial intelligence - an OCR system based on deep neural networks compared displayed results with official TSE data.

Kenya,"Africa Uncensored, IWPR.",Small,,,TRAPPED BY TERROR: Life and death in Kenya’s Boni forest.,2024-11-22,Long-form,"Animation, Drone","In the heart of Kenya’s Boni Forest in Lamu, the Aweer community lives on the edge of survival, facing overwhelming challenges that stretch back to Kenya’s independence. Systemic marginalization, a collapsing education system, and high maternal mortality rates create a stark backdrop for this story of resilience. Women face perilous childbirth without access to adequate healthcare, and young people navigate an education system that seems more myth than reality.  This documentary reveals the fight for dignity and survival amid unrelenting threats, capturing their journey to reclaim their future despite decades of neglect and conflict.","IMPACT: The Lamu County government’s decision to employ Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) teachers and permanent staff from the marginalized hunter-gatherer community, days after the documentary’s release, demonstrates this impact. •Increased Awareness and Advocacy: The documentary brought national and regional attention to the Boni community’s plight, including marginalization, threats from terrorism, and lack of access to basic services. This heightened awareness likely created public pressure on local authorities to act. •Policy Response: By employing ECDE teachers and permanent staff from the community, the Lamu governor Issa Timamy took a concrete step toward addressing some of the social inequalities highlighted. This policy move signifies recognition of the community’s needs and an effort to integrate them more fully into local development. Hiring individuals from the Boni community represents a step toward economic empowerment and inclusion. It provides role models for the youth and helps preserve indigenous knowledge by involving community members in the education system. •Media’s Role in Social Change: The swift governmental response underscores the power of investigative journalism and storytelling. By amplifying voices from marginalized communities, documentaries like Trapped by Terror play a critical role in holding authorities accountable and driving social justice.","CHALLENGES WHILE COVERING TRAPPED BY TERROR:   This project demanded resilience, adaptability, and ethical journalism to uncover hidden truths.  The project was conducted in a highly risky environment. The roads were plagued with IED threats, heavy military presence, and terrorist activity, with several fatalities reported. There were no vehicles, only motorcycles, and we cycled for three hours to reach our destination.  Accommodation was another challenge—there were no hotels or lodges. We relied on locals for food and slept on a raffia mat, using my tripod bag as a pillow. The government initially denied permission to document the Boni community’s struggles. Security leaders had issued strict instructions against filming, but after persistent negotiations, I secured approval.  Financial constraints also arose. Despite receiving an IWPR grant, unexpected costs forced me to use my personal funds. Poor network coverage and lack of electricity made research and communication difficult, often delaying work.  For filming, I employed discreet methods, using a DJI Osmo for covert sequences, especially at security checkpoints. To navigate political and security risks, I collaborated with a local journalist and trusted community members. Interviews with the MCA and county leadership ensured a balanced and ethical perspective.","TECHNIQUES USED: I employed aerial drone filming, DJI Osmo, and graphics, maps, figures, animations, and digital reconstructions to enhance storytelling and provide a deeper, more immersive visual experience.  Geographic Visuals & Mapping •Using Google Earth, I created animated flyovers of Boni Forest and surrounding areas, showing the terrain where Al-Shabaab insurgents operate. •Drone footage captured high-risk zones, military installations, and civilian settlements, providing a clear contrast between secured and vulnerable areas. •Before-and-after satellite images demonstrated shifts in security operations, civilian displacement, and environmental changes due to conflict.  Data Visualization & Contrasting Figures •Infographics contrasted official government data vs. actual field findings on attacks, disappearances, and terror-related activities. •Timelines tracked the escalation of violence, community displacements, and major security events leading up to the documentary’s key narratives.  Cinematic Techniques: Drone & DJI Osmo •Drone cinematography provided panoramic shots of Boni Forest, showing inaccessible areas affected by insecurity and military operations. •The DJI Osmo was instrumental in capturing covert footage, especially in high-risk areas where traditional cameras would attract attention. It allowed for smooth, steady tracking shots while navigating dangerous zones.. •Surveillance-style overlays simulated security threats, portraying the tension of navigating militant-controlled areas.","Key Lessons:  The documentary Trapped by Terror offers critical lessons for journalists working in high-risk environments, particularly in conflict zones and under restrictive regimes;  Risk Management & Safety Protocols •Pre-planning is crucial: Conduct thorough risk assessments before entering hostile areas. •Use local networks: Engage community leaders, fixers, and trusted sources for safer navigation. •Emergency protocols: Have an exit strategy, emergency contacts, and a backup plan in case of danger.  Innovative Storytelling Techniques •Use technology to enhance reporting: Drone footage, Google Earth mapping, and animations provide visual depth. •Covert filming techniques: The DJI Osmo and mobile cameras are effective tools in restrictive environments. •Data-driven storytelling: Infographics, satellite imagery, and reconstructed timelines help validate investigative findings.  Ethical & Balanced Reporting •Include all voices: Government authorities, security personnel, and affected communities must be represented. •Verify sources rigorously: Cross-check testimonies with official records and expert analysis. •Respect vulnerable subjects: Obtain informed consent, especially when covering survivors of violence. Overcoming Resource & Political Constraints •Be adaptable: Lack of electricity, poor network coverage, and movement restrictions require flexible workflows. •Leverage partnerships: Collaboration with local organizations, fellow journalists, and independent watchdogs strengthens credibility. •Persistence pays off: Navigating government restrictions requires patience, repeated follow-ups, and alternative approaches to access information.",English,https://youtu.be/sih7G8x0rFs?si=uWrE-WHaA0KiVuw2,,,,"Samuel Munia:Producer, cinematographer, script writer.

Zimbabwe,Humanitarian media focus on Zimbabwe (HuMFOZ),Small,,,Demining: undoing the land curse for sustainable economic development,2024-11-29,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","The feature story focused on how landmines in Sango border post between Zimbabwe and Mozambique affected the communities there. Having been laid there during the liberation  struggle by the Rhodesians to prevent guerilla fighters from receiving aid from Mozambique they are still there and many people and livestock lost their lives. However a humanitarian organisation APOPO came on board to help the communities by removing the landmines. To date a number of landmines have been removed, the community is benefitting from the  land. According to authorities bigger projects are set to be  done in the area once it is cleared.","The story was funded by the Media Monitors a media organisation based in Zimbabwe with the aim of helping journalists on how to write data stories. The story was of great importance especially to the community that was affected, from the interviews i got community members expressed  challenges that they were facing because of the landmines. From the voices of the community some audiences were shocked to realise that we still have places in Zimbabwe which are still manifested with landmines so to audiences it brought a broader picture of what Zimbabwe is like. some journalists after reading the story were inspired some called to know how  I managed to write the landmine story. One actually said that your story inspired me because when she read it through she saw the picture of what i wrote in her mind. she added that the story from reading it one can safely say i visited the place because it shows real events.","the story on its own was vey difficult to carry.  APOPO who were carrying out the demining activities were difficult to get in touch with but with the assistance of the local community in the area i managed to get hold of them. So after getting in touch with them i had difficulties again cleared to visit the area. By the way the area is very sensitive because it has landmines and also that it is protected by the army or defense forces...so it was a challenge being cleared, it took me months negotiating for me to visit the place. after i got cleared i managedto visit the place and the road to the area was very bad, i did not have a big car, the small car i had faced challenges and rather than for me taking a few hours there i had to take long hours. Naturally the place is risky with some wild animals still there as well as landmines. I visited the area with the landmines and i managed to witness the demining process, though it was risky but for the love of my job and to come up with a good story i participated.","At first i did desktop research about the area with the landmines, the organisation carrying out the demining process. i then visited the area to access the land and did some interviews with the local communities and APOPO who were carrying out the demining process, and managed to get raw data from APOPO which i then translated into something meaningful with the aid of graphs and charts. so i managed to use datawrapper to package the data i got.","Perseverance is the key nomatter the challenges that you get along the way you will always succeed. if i had stopped knocking the doors of the responsible authorities who were key to my story i could not have done the story so one should persist. another take away is that journalists when doing investigative stories apart from doing desktop research one should visit the area being investigated nomatter what, the main reason is that you will get first hand information from affected people and come up with a good story and not fabricated story. for a story to be authentic all sides should be included in other words the story should have more sources",english,https://humfoz.org/2024/11/29/demining-undoing-the-land-curse-for-sustainable-economic-development/,https://mediamonitors.org.zw/data-driven-news-articles/,,,Hazvinei Martha Mwanaka,"Hazvinei Martha Mwanaka is a freelance journalist based in Masvingo province in Zimbabwe. with more than 10 years of experience writting humanitarian stories including health, climate, environment and community and partly political stories. the desire to bring change in the communities inspired me to be a communicator"

У межах проєкту аналізуються місячні бюджетні витрати Києва, а також міст та сіл Київщини для виявлення та демонстрації громадськості некритичних покупок в умовах війни, а також виявлення зв’язків між бюджетними місцевими замовниками та підрядниками. Метою проєкту є привернення уваги до ефективності розподілу коштів і підвищення прозорості бюджетних витрат. Проєкт стартував у вересні 2022 року і триває досі, протягом 2024 року в його рамках було створено майже півсотні матеріалів.","Проєкт став важливим інструментом громадського контролю за бюджетними витратами Києва та громад Київської області. Регулярні аналітичні матеріали викривають некритичні замовлення та підозрілі зв’язки між місцевими підрядниками й замовниками. Це сприяло підвищенню уваги суспільства до прозорості бюджетних закупівель та медіаграмотності. Читачі отримали інструменти для самостійного аналізу місцевих бюджетів і можливість контролювати використання коштів у своїх громадах. Завдяки широкому розголосу та активній дискусії в соцмережах, проєкт сформував активну аудиторію, яка долучається до контролю за використанням коштів. У коментарях до матеріалів читачі діляться власними спостереженнями щодо освоєння бюджетних грошей, що сприяє створенню активної спільноти. Крім цього, проєкт має освітницьке значення, оскільки в його рамках у жовтні 2024 року було проведено лекцію для студентів інституту журналістики Київського національного університету імені Тараса Шевченка на тему використання бюджетних коштів. Таким чином, «Справи насущні» не лише викриває проблеми у бюджетних замовленнях, а й формує культуру прозорості, відповідальності та громадського контролю за бюджетними фінансами.","Проєкт реалізується в умовах воєнного стану, що значно ускладнює доступ до інформації про публічні витрати. Хоча відкриті дані залишаються основним джерелом досліджень, державні органи та органи місцевої влади все частіше обмежують доступ до бюджетної інформації, посилаючись на безпекові ризики. Особливо поширено це в контексті ремонтів та будівництв обʼєктів критичної інфраструктури, але зустрічається також “засекречення” інформації з приводу дрібних ремонтів в житлових будинках після деокупації. Крім цього, численні державні реєстри та бази даних є наразі закритими. Це змушує автора проєкту використовувати альтернативні методи збору даних – аналіз тендерів, запити на інформацію, розслідування через доступні реєстри та залучення внутрішніх джерел. Ще однією складністю є політичний тиск. Частина розслідувань зачіпає впливових осіб, пов’язаних із місцевими органами влади. Неодноразово редакція та безпосередньо автор проєкту отримували дзвінки з пропозиціями допомовитися про коригування матеріалу або недопущення подібних текстів в подальшому. Команда проєкту працює з медіа-юристами для захисту від таких загроз.","Проєкт базується на журналістиці даних, поєднуючи автоматизований аналіз бюджетних витрат, візуалізацію та OSINT-методи.   Основним джерелом даних є система Prozorro, де через скрейпінг та аналіз масивів даних відстежуються підозрілі закупівлі, зміни в угодах та аномальні витрати. Джерелами інформації слугують модуль публічних закупівель Bi.Prozorro, аналітичні системи YouControl, Clarity Project та багато інших. Також практикується надсилання запитів на інформацію, створення та збір фото- та відеоматеріалу, перевірка інсайдерської інформації щодо відповідальних осіб та можливих корупційних схем. Щомісяця автор створює інфографіку, яка демонструє розподіл бюджетних коштів Києва або міст та сіл області. Це дозволяє місцевим мешканцям та журналістам інших медіа легко аналізувати тренди витрат. Завдяки використанню журналістики даних та інших перерахованих інструментів проєкт не лише висвітлює сумнівні витрати, а й дає читачам інструменти для самостійного аналізу бюджетних рішень у їхніх громадах.","Проєкт демонструє, як журналістика даних може ефективно виявляти сумнівні бюджетні витрати та робити фінансову інформацію доступною для широкої аудиторії. Інші журналісти можуть використати наш пропрацьований інструментарій та способи подачі даних для розслідувань у своїх регіонах, адаптуючи методи аналізу відкритих даних. Важливим аспектом є візуалізація інформації. Проєкт використовує графіки, які допомагають легко інтерпретувати складні фінансові дані.

The political and religious leaders shied away from even codeming the incidents while many endorsed. The story also broke down the false narrative that the sacrilege cases pertainined only to Sikh religion since based on the data of these cases, the alleged incidents were reported by followers of other religions too including Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. The project further showed how many of these cases were either not traced or found to be committed by those from the same religion for financial or other gains. This study showed how the state of Punjab simmering after 2015 sacrilege cases by followers of a Godman witnessed an increase in sacrilege cases and hitherto unknown lynchings by a paranoid  population. People manipulated by politicians for gaining mileage by exploiting the religious feelings on the name of sacrilege earlier used to staty quiet but my story dispelled these false narratives and also their fear.","I want the jury to know that  the issue of sacrilege being a sensitive issue to Sikhs and breaking the narrative or even getting the data or the medical histories was an uphill task. Not only did I invite the wrath of the fundemantalists or the religious figures, their ideologies and claims were contrary to what the data spoke.  Further, even the senior police officers were not ready to share the data and exact causes of these sacrilege incidents being on defensive due to the political situation in the state. I was trolled post the publication of the story but at the same time, applauded by those who wanted some concrete evidence and a voice like ours to join them for breaking the false narratives and condemning the gross human rights violations.","I took details of the sacrilege related cases and lynchings from all police districts in Punjab, India.

The Yandex Researches team worked closely with meteorologists to select the most compelling parameters that clearly highlight ongoing climate shifts: the balance of cold and warm days, temperature record dates, fluctuations in precipitation levels, and shifts in the first snowfall.  One of the standout features of the project is the enhanced visualization of Warming Stripes, which vividly illustrates how different portions of the country’s area have warmed year by year.","The project gained significant publicity — almost million of views on social media, publications in traditional media, and appearances on radio and TV.

Newstapa presents an in-depth investigative interactive project, analyzing the context beyond mere facts using interactive technology and data visualization. Newstapa reconstructed the day of martial law using satellite imagery and citizen-generated on-site video records. The second part, Traitors, documents politicians and officials who supported the martial law, threatening democratic values. By meticulously recording their statements and actions, this project serves as a historical record of those who undermined democracy in one of South Korea’s most unprecedented political crises.","This project provided clarity to citizens who endured the chaotic night of martial law. By reconstructing the sequence of events, it helped people understand what truly happened. While much of the public discourse focused on the military’s attempt to seize the National Assembly, the project revealed another critical aspect—the military’s attempted takeover of the National Election Commission. This revelation influenced ongoing discussions about the implications of martial law and its broader impact on democracy. Part 2(traitors) addressed the deep ideological confusion gripping South Korea’s democracy. Despite the unconstitutional nature of the martial law, the military’s suppression of parliamentary politics, and the seizure of key democratic institutions, a significant portion of the political establishment continued to support President Yoon. The project documented these figures, exposing their rhetoric and actions. More than just an exposé, it serves as a historical archive of those who prioritized political gain over democratic principles. While martial law itself was a blatant breach of democracy, the more insidious threat lay in the erosion of democratic values by those who justified it. This project stands as a safeguard of democratic memory, ensuring that their actions are not forgotten.","President Yoon Suk-yeol is currently undergoing an impeachment trial in South Korea’s Constitutional Court, where his presidency is at stake. Throughout the proceedings, he has consistently argued that the martial law was not ”real” but merely an ”appeal to the public in the form of martial law.” However, Newstapa’s reporting provides a comprehensive and evidence-based account of how the martial law was actually enforced, providing a comprehensive combination of videos, geographic data, photos, and text, it enables readers to fully understand its impact. Now politicians of People Power Party often use social media to spread inflammatory misinformation to rally their supporters, and delete their posts later to evade legal accountability. Newstapa’s part 2(traitors) serves as a safeguard against such irresponsible political actions by systematically archiving statements and actions that might otherwise be erased. By preserving these records, the project aims to counter democratic backsliding and ensure accountability, reinforcing South Korea’s democratic foundations.","Both Part 1 (The Timeline) and Part 2 (The Traitors) relied heavily on crowdsourced data, continuously updating information gathered from citizens, journalists, and open sources.  For Part 1, we designed an interactive timeline that integrates maps, videos, and text to reconstruct the sequence of events. This approach, which presents information in a dynamic and layered format, is rare in South Korea’s journalism landscape. By visualizing the military’s movements and key political decisions geographically and chronologically, we provided a clearer narrative of how martial law unfolded. This innovative storytelling method was well received by fellow journalists for its originality.  For Part 2, we focused on archiving and analyzing public statements and deleted social media posts from politicians who supported martial law. We utilized automated monitoring tools to track and log these statements before they were erased. This method ensured accountability by preserving records of political rhetoric that could otherwise disappear.","This project demonstrates the power of crowdsourced journalism in documenting fast-moving political crises. By gathering real-time reports from citizens and integrating them into an interactive format, we were able to present a more comprehensive and multi-dimensional account of events.  One key lesson is the importance of visual storytelling in investigative journalism. The combination of maps, videos, and timeline-based narratives made complex information more accessible to the public. Instead of relying solely on text-based reporting, journalists can enhance audience engagement through interactive content.  Another takeaway is the need to archive political statements before they disappear. In an era where politicians frequently delete or alter their words to evade accountability, setting up automated tracking and digital archiving tools is essential. By preserving these records, journalists can ensure that history is not rewritten to suit political narratives.  Ultimately, this project highlights how technology and investigative journalism can work together to protect democratic values and counter misinformation.",Korean,https://pages.newstapa.org/2024/insurrection/,https://pages.newstapa.org/2024/traitors/,,,"Data: Yeon Da-hye, Kim Kangmin, Kim Ji-yeon, Byeon Ji-min, Choi Yun-won Develop/Design: Chun Ki-hwan, Kim Ji-yeon Design: Lee Do-hyun Video: Oh Jun-sik","Newstapa’s Data Team was founded in 2013 and consists of 6 data journalists with diverse technical expertise, including data analysis and software development.

The visualization combines quantitative network analysis with artistic expression to transform complex bibliographic data into an intuitive, exploratory experience.","This visualization reimagines how we understand book genres through the lens of network science and data art. By analyzing bestseller data and user-generated book labels from Open Library’s API, we discovered that literary categories are fluid social constructs rather than rigid classifications. Our interactive visualization presents this insight through two distinct views: a subject-based network showing interconnected themes, and a dynamic brushstroke visualization representing individual books. The idea behind the brushstroke visualization is to provide a general view of books as independent objects, while the subject-based network shows the bipartite structure between books and the top 200 most popular topics.","To see the network layout, please click through the nodes of books and genres. To discover the subject’s layout, click on it and give it a moment to load. Then you should be able to click through the books to see their sales, genres and information in the original language.  I am not awae of any other project that uses p5brush library to represent a big dataset.","The visualization offers two complementary views: a network map showing how subjects are interconnected through shared books, and an artistic representation using a novel approach to p5.js brush to create data art  — each book becomes a dynamic brushstroke whose size reflects sales and style, plus indicates language and origin.","Our project transforms bibliographic metadata into an interactive artwork that challenges how we think about book genres. Through network analysis of Open Library’s top 200 subject tags and bestseller data, we revealed that literary categories are more fluid and interconnected than traditional classification systems suggest.   What sets this project apart is its preservation of complexity — rather than simplifying relationships into conventional genres, we let users explore the rich tapestry of how readers actually categorize books. The result is both a data visualization and a critique of existing classification systems, inviting viewers to question their assumptions about literary categories while discovering unexpected connections between books and subjects.",English,https://books.dariakoshkina.com,,,,"Credits: Daria Koshkina — concept & creative direction, art direction, data search, analysis, visualization and web development programming Yixuan Liu — data analysis, network science, visualization and programming David Y.

India,The Reporters’ Collective,Small,,,Pigs and Prejudice: Marginalised Pig Farmers Pay the Price of Government Bias,2024-07-04,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Fact-checking, Politics, Environment, Culture, Agriculture, Health, Economy, Employment","Animation, Google Sheets","Climate change induced inflated temperature has provided a fertile environment for the new types of the vector borne diseases in India. In recent past India has witnessed two such completely new vector borne diseases- Lumpy Skin disease (LSD), African Swine fever (ASF).  Over the expanse of pigs dying due to ASF ultra-right Indian government has taken all the measures to contain the cows affecting LSD. The biased climate response the Indian government has given because pigs in India are only owned by marginalized Hindus called lower castes while cows are saturated in the households of the privileged upper caste Hindus.",In climate journalism stories are often revolving around the quantitative data e.g. inches the sea level gained. And there is assumption that such quantitative variables are affecting each and every human being equally. But this story has shown that in traditional societies such as India the climate response by government could be amplified by ancient societal structures e.g. Hindu caste system.  Being considered sacred by privileged Hindus Indian streets has been bustling with cows while in last couple of years due to the government neglect large number of the Indian pigs have been died. When we published this story Indians suddenly realized that pigs are no longer visible anywhere and how at onset of the climate change induced diseases the Indian government has favored the cow health over the piggery.   Apart from the people’s awareness this story has brought the attention of the researchers dwelling in the realm of inter- species research.,"There are few contextual points I want jury to consider-  1) Along with this report, in last couple of years, The Reporters’ Collective has published perhaps best investigative reports from India. And in response the Indian government has [revoked](htthttps://cpj.org/2025/02/india-revokes-nonprofit-and-tax-status-of-news-outlets/ps://) our non- profit status and hence in garb of tax extorted money from us.  2) The parliamentary documents this report has mentioned are not easily accessible to many Indians. I myself dug the ministerial files thoroughly and accessed such exclusive data which has exposed the government’s biased climate response.   3) Piggery in India has been owned by marginalsied Hindus called lower castes. Such lower caste constitutes the largest part of the India’s population and due to lack of the ownership of land such population is unable to produce grain hence often rely on their livestock e.g. piggery. Considering this traditional precarity Indian government is supposed to provide the best possible help to the lower castes. But, as the provided investigative report is showing, when the mentioned vector-borne diseases wrecked havoc in India’s livestock economy to spent the pigs lives the instant medical aid provided to an animal- cow- of traditionally privileged Hindus.",Mainly it is a data based investigative report for which I used a constitutional right conferred to all Indian citizens through the Right to Information Act (2005) passed by the Indian parliament. Being an Indian citizen using this right I filed several applications across the India and tapped on all the relevant information housed in different government offices.   Secondly I benefitted from the high speed internet access.,"1) Climate change has however inflated the bar of the average temperature across the world equally but the societal or economic problems it caused in developing countries, e.g. India, are far more different than the developed, western, northern hemisphere of the globe. Hence while one do climate journalism in India it is prerequisite to acquaint herself with the traditional social structures, e.g. Hindu caste system, the governance of the third world is based upon.   2) Increasing global temperature is providing the best ambience to breeding mosquitoes hence in coming years the vector-borne disease burden of the tropical countries, e.g. India, is likely to increase. Health journalists should prepare themselves for this.  3) In recent past obesity has emerged as a big health issue across the world. And recently to aid the obese patients scientists working in the realm of [interspecies research](hhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/science/gila-monsters-cryptosporidium.htmlttps://) invented a drug- Ozempic. The invention of this medicine underlined the importance of inter- species research.

Si bien la lucha de la comunidad tenía ocho años de existir, el abordaje del tema en los medios de comunicación se había dado de manera superficial. A partir de este trabajo, distintos medios dieron cobertura al tema de manera más profunda y finalmente, en julio del 2024, cuatro meses después de esta publicación, el Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo ordenó al Estado, específicamente Sistema Nacional de Áreas de Conservación (Sinac), dependencia del Ministerio de Ambiente y Energía (Minae), a hacer correcciones inmediatas al daño ambiental y marino ocurrido por construcciones en zonas de humedal. También abrió la posibilidad de demolición a inmuebles, constató que las autoridades, a pesar de que tenían conocimiento del problema, no comunicaron los límites y restricciones que estos ecosistemas implican para el desarrollo inmobiliario en esta zona.

India,BBC,Big,,,India’s Deadly Toys,2024-12-17,"Investigation, Long-form, Documentary, Database, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Video, Elections, Politics, Crime, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python, Jupyter Notebook Google Advanced Search Google Sheets","For children in parts of India, playing outside can be deadly.   A BBC investigation reveals that hundreds of children in West Bengal have been maimed, wounded, or killed by home-made bombs they mistook for toys.    But why are these lethal devices being made? And why are children so often the victims?  Note: India’s Deadly Toys is a 10-minute data viz film, part of the Dec 2024 roll out of ‘Children of the Bombs’, a feature length documentary that investigates the impact and scale of crude bomb violence on children in West Bengal using newspaper archives and onground reporting.","The film and its version garnered 220K views on YT. Audiences  thanked us for making the film via comments.    This data investigation is the first of its kind data-set documenting child crude bomb casualties in West Bengal over the last three. For most of our contributors and their families, we were the only team of journalists to follow with them to understand the impact of accidental explosions on their lives.   The film moved Ranajit Sardar, father of crude bomb victim Puchu Sardar to tears when he watched it. His son Puchu, was injured in a blast on polling day in 1996. Two of Puchu’s friends died in the blast. The incident left a deep impact on not just Puchu but all the kids he grew up with. “This is the first time that I have felt like someone stood up for us,” Puchu’s friend Avijit, also a contributor in the main film, said to us. After the film came out, Puchu and his friends shared the film far and wide in their community in an attempt to spread awareness about the issue.   Leading news organisations such as The Times of India, News Laundry and The Print subsequently highlighted our findings.","West Bengal’s political landscape is violent, unpredictable and cases of crude bomb violence are often suppressed. Victims suffer in silence out of fear of backlash, even though cases are reportedly routinely in the press.   The evidence underpinning this investigation was not hidden. It was there, in the poorly maintained, dusty archives of the state. It had never been accessed with the objective of ascertaining the number of child crude bomb casualties in the state. However, accessing the newspaper archives was tricky. We had two options – accessing them through state-run libraries or media houses. The latter was not an option. We had to keep the project under wraps to ensure contributor and team safety.   There is only one state-run library in the state where archives are organised and accessible. The team had to be astute in negotiating and maintaining access for months on end. Many editions were missing from this library and so we knocked on the door of every possible institution in Kolkata and Delhi to find them. It took multiple visits, negotiating access with government officials, rummaging through dusty and disorganised storerooms and racing to finish work before sunset because one of the store rooms did not have electricity.","We used google spreadsheets to gather reports of child crude bomb casualties in the state over 28 years. Maintaining this spreadsheet over months, and keeping it error free required rigour. We set up the spreadsheet to be filterable and made frequent back up copies. We also used basic OSINT techniques such as google advanced search to run site searches when we realised that cases away from Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal were being reported in online editions but not always in the print edition.   The motion graphics sequences for this film presented a crucial and challenging task: to clearly convey the staggering number of children who have been tragically killed and injured by crude bombs in West Bengal since 1996, without losing sight of the real children behind these statistics. The research team meticulously counted child casualties from vast archives of newspapers in India, compiling the first-ever dataset of its kind. We used Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyse this dataset and gather additional insights for the data visualisation sequences. We then used Adobe After Effects to present and animate the data, ensuring the look and feel of the sequences were consistent with the other footage in the film.","This project is an example of using newspapers that are considered papers of record to unearth data on a subject where there is none. It combines a data-led investigation with visual storytelling to give a voice and face to those who would otherwise remain data points. It is project that holds up a mirror to society and shines light on an issue shrouded in silence, even though widely reported. It is also an example of the power of collaboration between a team of individuals with a diverse skillset and geographies – journalists, researchers, film-makers, motion graphics designers and video editors based across India and the UK. It is a reminder that it takes teams to pursue and bring to life ambitious, hard to execute stories and editors who trust you.","English and Bengali [Also translated into Hindi, Marathi, Telegu]",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s784Mj9yflw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9bprEW5vtc,,,Nupur Sonar Debraj Ghatak Nikhil Singh Anandee Chattopadhyay Nandita Das Srijeeta Das Asher Kaye Isbrucker Baya Cat Ronny Sen Tanushree Pandey Andy Bell Ankur Jain Daniel Adamson,"Nupur Sonar, a journalist and documentary producer led this data investigation with a team of researchers - Debraj, Nikhil, Anandee, Nandita and Srijeeta.

India,Article 14,Small,,,‘Congress-BJP Comes Second. We Are Hindus First:’ Himachal Became A Hotbed Of Islamophobia In 2024,2024-12-24,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Politics, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","In 2024, anti-Muslim violence and propaganda swept Himachal Pradesh, making it another hotbed of Islamophobia in northern India, similar to the BJP-run states of Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. Influenced by Hindu right-wing organisations, misinformation and offensive propaganda about Muslims, Hindu protesters demanded mosque demolitions, eviction of ‘outsider’ Muslims, economic boycotts, and vandalised Muslim properties. We spoke with six Hindu extremists, who orchestrated the hate campaign. We tracked **over 30 anti-Muslim rallies over a period of one month in September-October**, and found that the police arrested not even a single perpetrator and hundreds of Muslims fled the state.","My story from Himachal Pradesh initiated public debates on the situation of Muslims in the state. I also addressed a press conference at the Press Club of India along with several senior advocates of the Supreme Court, where I spoke about the threat of ethnic cleansing of Muslims in the state. After my story, the state government cancelled the permission of some of these rallies and also detained one of the major leaders of these rallies. As a result, after October no anti-Muslim rally has taken place in the state. Thus, my stories helped people to seek accountability from the government.","When I was on ground in Himachal Pradesh and reporting on the exodus of Muslim minorities, I was threatened with violence and police action. Kamal Gautam, one of the major leaders of these anti-Muslim rallies posted my photo on his Facebook and twitter and wrote, ”I have been informed through my sources that he is a suspected terrorist who has come here to provoke riots. I have written to the police demanding his arrest.”   I was scared when I read the comments on his posts. People were commenting, ”Police won’t do anything. We will have to find him and teach him a lesson.” I was really anxious. But I continued reporting because I thought it was important. Later, the police detained me for questioning when I was on ground. They told me that they have received a complaint against me that I am a terrorist. They took photos of my identity cards, questioned me for over an hour about my work and then let me go. This was traumatic for me, to be questioned like this by the police just for doing my job.   The viral post of Kamal Gautam is still there on his account (Link: https://www.facebook.com/share/p/167LBLt2Fb/).","Through open-source intelligence, we tracked over 30 anti-Muslim rallies in Himachal Pradesh over a month that led to the exodus of hundreds of Muslims. I have been reporting pn hate crimes against religious minorities in India for over three years. I already follow a lot of extremist pages on social media. From September 2024, I noticed a surge of posts from the extremist leaders in Himachal Pradesh. Then, I started tracking them and mapped these rallies across the state and also identified at least six major leaders of these rallies.","When you see a news article such as ’Hundreds of Muslims flee Himachal Pradesh’, as a journalist you should try to go deeper. How did they flee? Why did they flee? Who were the people who created such a situation that they had to flee? What were the police doing? Why didn’t the police arrest the perpetrators and ensured security for the Muslims?   You should try to find answers to these questions. And there is no shortcut to these investigations. I could do this only because I was already tracking hundreds of extremist social media pages. So, dedication is the key here.",English,https://article-14.com/post/-congress-bjp-comes-second-we-are-hindus-first-himachal-became-a-hotbed-of-islamophobia-in-2024-676a263728ec9,,,,"Kaushik Raj, Srishti Jaswal","Kaushik Raj, 26, is an Indian freelance journalist who has reported for publications like The Guardian, Vice, and Al Jazeera over the past four years.

The Examination and The Post analyzed more than 6,000 social media posts by 68 registered dietitians with at least 10,000 followers to find that roughly 40 percent of these influencers – with a combined reach of more than 9 million followers – repeatedly used anti-diet language. Reporters found that a majority of these health professionals also were paid to promote products by food, beverage or supplement companies.","The reporting sparked a widespread conversation online and across the industry about how discussions around food shaming, intuitive eating, and rejecting fad diets could be used for commercial interests. Dietitian influencers spoke to their followers about how they talk about these ideas and their ethics around accepting sponsorships while others in the Health At Every Size movement pushed for their work to be refocused around healthcare issues.  Aside from publishing on The Examination’s site, the story appeared on the front page of the Post and the Star Tribune in Minneapolis where General Mills’ is headquartered.

More than 3,000 people commented on the story on the Post’s website, expressing concerns and calling General Mills behavior, among other things, “underhanded” and “harmful to public health.”","The story reveals the rise and evolution of the anti-diet movement online, especially how it has been distorted in recent years. What had started as an effort to combat weight stigma and an unhealthy obsession with thinness, this growing “anti-diet” movement was now being used by global food marketers seeking to cash in on the trend.  Reporters found that General Mills, the maker of Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs and Haagen Daz, had launched a multi-pronged campaign capitalizing on the anti-diet movement to boost sales of its products and beat back federal regulations — all amid growing evidence linking obesity to scores of health issues.   General Mills was touring the country touting its research on “food shaming,” showering giveaways on dietitian influencers who promoted its cereals using the slogan #DerailTheShame. And despite a growing obesity epidemic, the company was using anti-diet arguments to oppose federal regulations that would add health information to the front of food packages.","Dealing with large quantities of social media video is always a challenge. In this case, a data reporter had to search across platforms to find users with specific phrases or words in their bios, find libraries that would download and transcribe large tranches of video, deal with metadata from two distinct sources, and had to find a way to access content such as Instagram Reels, which are substantially different from Instagram posts.   Social media sites such as TikTok and Instagram are built to prevent scraping, so the reporter had to write scripts and use tools like puppeteer to circumvent rate limits and issues with lazy-loading content.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,,,AI-Bot for the Elections,2025-02-07,"Elections, Politics",AI/Machine learning,"What do the parties promise in terms of family or climate policy? What impact will the electoral law reform have? What do the parties’ plans mean for your wallet? No matter what readers want to know about the German parliamentary elections - the SZ’s AI election assistant provides answers based on the election programmes and the SZ’s reporting! Based on the previous conversation, the dialling assistant provides suggestions for follow-up questions that can be used to continue the conversation.",The AI bot was first published for the 2024 European elections and was so well received that it was improved and relaunched for the Bundestag elections.,"The global political situation, crises, the economic situation and current national debates led to an unusually high level of interest in analysing the specific demands and positions of the parties. The AI assistant explicitly does not make any voting recommendations, but answers questions on how the parties stand on certain issues, such as who wants to do the most for families. In this project, we worked with several AIs at the same time. More precisely, with so-called Large Language Models (LLM). The sources on which the generated response is based, such as our own reporting, are linked accordingly in the response. This allows users to continue reading directly.","Our AI assistant is a so-called ‘retrieval augmented generation’ system. This means that we have optimised our language models with an additional knowledge database from election programmes and SZ articles. This ensures that the answers are primarily based on our journalistic texts, whose information is verified - unlike would be the case with a more general chatbot. The language model analyses every question a user asks and decides what information is needed to answer it. It then searches the knowledge database for this information. Another language model then generates an answer, specifies the sources used and links them. This process is and remains error-prone. It can happen that the AI uses inappropriate information for the answer, combines information in a nonsensical way or simply does not find any suitable text passages for the question asked. We therefore tested the assistant for several weeks. A dozen SZ colleagues asked it questions and also tried to trick it into making mistakes, which we were then able to analyse and correct. In order to avoid mistakes as far as possible, we have given the language models carefully formulated instructions on how they should respond to user questions and input.","For us as journalists, the AI bot is not just an exciting new way to reach people with our work. We were also able to analyse which questions our readers ask and found that some of them differed from the surveys of the general population about the most important problems. In addition to general questions about election promises and key issues in the general election, our readers are very interested in which parties might form the next government.

United States of America,Miami Herald,Big,,,"Juvenile Crime, Adult Time",2024-06-27,"Investigation, Long-form, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python","From a teen sentenced to 20 years in adult prison for robbing only $300 to an autistic child facing decades for assault, Florida’s punitive juvenile crime laws give prosecutors free rein to try kids as adults.   The Miami Herald revealed Florida is a national outlier in the U.S.: Children tried as adults receive longer sentences than older offenders and Black children are disproportionately charged as adults.  The Herald’s data-driven investigation — a comprehensive and first-of-its-kind look from arrest to sentencing — reveals the stunning scope of Florida’s punitive approach towards juvenile crime and how it unfairly targets the state’s most vulnerable children.","Florida lawmakers filed two [bills](https://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h0613__.docx&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=613&Session=2025) in the [House](https://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_h1521__.docx&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=1521&Session=2025) and one in the [Senate](https://www.flhouse.gov/Sections/Documents/loaddoc.aspx?FileName=_s0950__.docx&DocumentType=Bill&BillNumber=950&Session=2025) to curb state prosecutors’ power to charge children as adults. Lawmakers will debate and vote on them in the March, 2025 session.  Two of the bills restrict prosecutors from unilaterally charging children aged below 16 as adults. The third removes all power from prosecutors: Children of any age can be tried as adults only if a juvenile court judge decides to do so. All three bills empower adult court judges to transfer children back to the juvenile system if they deem that is more appropriate.   Rep. Dianne Hart, the sponsor of one of the bills, called the Miami Herald’s reporting “eye-opening” and credited it for aiding “more conversations around the issue.”  The bills came after lawmakers had expressed outrage at the Herald’s findings. The House minority leader called the findings shocking and heart-breaking. An ex-Republican state senator called on his colleagues to reevaluate the use of the law.   Separately, Brendan Depa, a severely autistic Black child was facing 30 years in adult prison for assaulting a teacher’s aide. After the Herald revealed the systemic failures that led to the incident, Depa was sentenced to only five.","The Herald’s series stands on records from numerous government agencies, most importantly Florida’s Juvenile Justice Department and the Office of the State Courts Administrator. The Juvenile Justice Department refused to release their records. After repeated negotiation attempts failed, the Herald’s attorneys had to pry the records loose.   Dasgupta then broke down and cleaned the datasets — containing 1.1 billion datapoints — to make them ready for analysis. Dasgupta used Python to compute advanced statistical methods to report out the findings.   Interviewing individuals in prison is hard. This was compounded by the fact that children tried and sentenced as adults are not designated with any special code in court records. Dasgupta used the state’s corrections database to compute the age at which each inmate entered the system and cold-contacted individuals were under 18 when they first entered prison. Over several months, he ended up speaking with dozens of individuals, talking with them many times to build trust so they would open up and talk about experiences that were often traumatic.   The final project is based on the accounts of dozens of individuals impacted by the system, information obtained via more than 70 public records requests and interviews with more than 50 legal experts.","Juvenile Crime, Adult Time is the result of a combination of meticulous descriptive statistical analysis of criminal justice data, qualitative analysis of state laws and a survey of prosecutorial practices.  Dasgupta computed rates broken down by year, demographic characteristics and geographical areas for data on which children are tried as adults and sentencing outcomes.   He then performed regression analyses to gauge the effect of different variables both independently and in combination with each other, on the likelihood of a child being transferred to the adult system.   Dasgupta uncovered some staggering findings: Children tried as adults received stiffer sentences than older offenders for the same level of offense and prosecutors were two times more likely to try Black children in the adult system than white children for similar types of crimes.   All of the findings reported in the series were meticulously verified for consistency by computing measures of central tendency and then adjusting for outliers that might skew the figures. Dasgupta worked closely with a statistician and criminologist from the University of Miami to develop his methodologies and verify the findings.   All of the computations were completed using Python and some SQL.","A big takeaway from this project for data journalists is to maintain an open mind throughout the reporting process.   When Dasgupta started reporting this project, he was focused on the history and enforcement of juvenile offenses in Florida and the implementation of the “direct file” statute  with a particular focus on which children were being charged as adults, and which children were not. But in the course of his reporting, he kept encountering teens who received sentences that seemed very excessive for the offense they had committed.   That led him to look into sentencing outcomes in general.   He filed a records request for sentencing data from Florida’s Office of the State Courts Administrator and the analysis of that data led to the most important finding of the project — that teens tried as adults get higher sentences on average than adult offenders themselves.   While most data reporters tend to think of data as the starting point that will point them in the direction of people to interview, this project showed that interviews can also suggest new avenues for data exploration that can result in more impactful reporting.",English,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/article291138470.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article290425414.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article288348190.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article290425114.html,Shirsho Dasgupta,**Shirsho Dasgupta** is an investigative/data reporter at the Miami Herald Washington Bureau.

The team scraped over 160,000 election documents and obtained more election data under FOIA. It developed custom machine learning models to analyze these documents and detect anomalies. Our team of over 20 journalists across Nigeria used our data to guide their fieldwork. Our combined data analysis and field reporting revealed significant problems: altered vote tallies, widespread voter suppression, systematic misinformation campaigns and violations of mandated rules for verifying registered voters. In some cases, instead of vote totals, election workers uploaded selfies to the country’s election computers.","The project generated widespread impact. The stories have become among the most read in CCIJ’s history. They were the subject of intense discussions on social media, on Nigerian radio and elsewhere. The Center for Cooperative Media in the United States named it one of the 10 best collaborations globally in 2024.  We built a West Africa hub of journalists, establishing a collaboration network, sharing resources and providing data and osint training. We fostered conversations with NGOs and major media organizations in Nigeria focused on improving election reporting. A leading law firm has promised to represent those who believe their ballot was wrongly not counted. The government had hidden documents it had promised to make public about voting in each neighborhood polling station in Nigeria. CCIJ not only obtained those records for its reporting, it made those all freely available on its website via DocumentCloud.  Each part of the series broke new ground and contained startling new findings: Altered voting tallies, poor electoral oversight that cast doubt over Nigeria’s presidential elections. The extensive violence in Nigeria’s ’Peaceful’ presidential elections. The False Information Merchants and their multi-front assault on facts during the 2023 Nigerian election.","Our investigation faced extraordinary challenges in Nigeria’s hostile press environment. Journalists who reported on the presidential election routinely faced harassment, arrest, and legal intimidation. Government officials consistently declined to answer questions, even after multiple in-person requests. Reporting on the ground carried significant risks—our journalists interviewed witnesses to election violence and manipulation in regions where speaking out could trigger reprisals. Many sources requested anonymity fearing government or partisan retaliation, while others refused to discuss the election entirely. Security concerns prevented journalists from accessing certain areas.  The data challenges were formidable. Throughout our investigation, the government repeatedly removed access to critical documents. By proactively preserving records in the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, we maintained the evidence supporting our findings. By publication time, all documents had been completely purged from government servers.  The technical complexity demanded innovative solutions. Poor document quality necessitated developing algorithms to rotate, crop, and unwarp materials before processing them through our layout model. We created our own layout model due to the prohibitive cost of OCR solutions for handwritten form reading for such a large dataset. Additionally, organizing and managing the crowdsourcing effort presented substantial logistical challenges given the scale of human input required.","We developed a Python script to scrape over 167,000 polling station documents from INEC’s election result viewing portal ([IReV](https://www.inecelectionresults.ng/pres/elections/63f8f25b594e164f8146a213?type=pres)). We uploaded these to [DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/218733-all_docs/) using command line tools and made them publicly available. We also preserved the documents in the Wayback Machine before INEC removed public access early 2025. We FOIAed and, after a months long battle, got the local government area level results from INEC.  To detect irregular election filings – including wrong election papers and irrelvant documents like selfies – we built a document processing pipeline that included custom computer vision solutions. This involved detecting document orientation, cropping and unwrapping documents, and training a YOLO-based model to identify document layouts. We implemented algorithms to identify those missing required verifications – including government stamps and signatures. By inspecting document dimensions, we identified over 10,000 illegible election papers, which were characterized by their 192×256 pixel size.   For text extraction, we utilized Amazon Textract together with the layout model. For verification, we used crowdsourcing through [MuckRock’s platform](https://www.muckrock.com/assignment/stamp_signature_batch4-480/form/) to check documents flagged by our algorithm.   We accessed the backend of the IReV to identify areas where voter verification appeared absent. Our journalists then investigate these cases. Our team also used google pinpoint for labeling documents.","Our project demonstrates how advanced technology can transform election oversight through computer vision and machine learning techniques that automate document analysis at scale. The project showcases how human verification strengthens machine learning applications. It also offers journalists powerful tools for document-based investigations. The project offers a replicable methodology for election oversight that other journalists can adapt worldwide.  When governments remove public access to crucial documents, systematic archiving becomes essential for accountability. Our experience shows how journalists and civic society actors can proactively preserve records before they disappear.   Our collaborative approach—bringing together data scientists, programmers, and field reporters—created a resilient investigative framework. When technical analysis identified suspicious patterns, field journalists investigated on the ground, answering questions that data alone could not resolve and connecting abstract anomalies to tangible evidence of election manipulation.   This collaborative model also provided a safety net when reporting in hostile environments. By working with multiple local newsrooms, we reduced individual risk while maintaining investigative momentum in regions where such reporting is dangerous.",English,https://veza.news/article/2024/12/20/inecs-broken-promises-altered-voting-tallies-poor-electoral-oversight-casts-doubt-over-nigerias-presidential-elections/,https://veza.news/article/2024/08/29/beyond-the-facade-unveiling-the-violence-in-nigerias-peaceful-presidential-elections/,https://veza.news/investigative-series/democracy-deferred/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uukk5ayZDAZ1KjYVEhgqdjlKb32MzhfN_aCrbSBXLKs/edit?usp=sharing,"Ajibola Amzat, Andrew Lehren, Sotiris Sideris, Yuxi Wang, Nelly Kalu, Nic Bothma, Jillian Dudziak, Kirsty Card, Pupul Chatterjee, Rakshitha Narasimhan, James Emmanuel, Olajide Adelana, Haruna Mohammed Salisu, Idris Kamal, Lami Sadiq, Aminu Adamu Naganye, Usman Bello Balarabe, Arinze Chijioke, Victoria Ogechukwu Ujam, Samad Uthman, Golok Nanmwa, Lukman Abolade, Yawale Adamu, Sadam Mato Burra, Kabir Yusuf, Yekeen Akinwale, Ekemini Simon, Abhik Maiti, Jeremy Singer-Vine, Yaffa Fredrick, Jeff Kelly Lowenstein, Sarah Baum, Betsy Ring, Kirk Cheyfitz, Shehu Olayinka, Sodeeq Atanda, Olanrewaju Oyedeji, Gbenga Salau, Lee Mwiti","CCIJ is a global nonprofit newsroom that brings together journalists, data scientists, and visual storytellers to produce in-depth investigative reporting on critical issues.

It exposes scam compounds, online gambling, and cybercrime hubs like Shwe Kokko and KK Park, where victims face torture and death. Through undercover infiltration, victim testimonies, and open-source research, the film reveals how illicit proceeds allegedly fund the junta and connects key players behind these crimes against humanity. This documentary exposed hidden horrors behind Southeast Asia’s cybercrime syndicates and their global implications.","The investigative documentary Border Hell has sparked significant government action, leading to crackdowns on human trafficking and cyber scam operations along the Thailand-Myanmar border.  1) Thai Government Cuts Power & Internet, Rescuing Thousands Following Border Hell’s revelations, Thai authorities cut electricity and internet to Myanmar’s border regions, disrupting scam centers run by armed groups.

Our investigation relied on leads from victims, primarily scam website addresses, which allowed us to uncover additional data and connections. We identified the perpetrators operating along the Myanmar-Thailand border by analyzing documents and verifying findings with open-source intelligence from social media.  We reconstructed the trafficking process in forced criminality with the help of cybersecurity experts, who pinpointed the criminals’ exact locations and IP addresses. Our findings revealed that these actors were using Thai-based internet service providers. Due to security concerns, several contributing journalists from Myanmar and Thailand remained anonymous.  Upon the documentary’s release, we faced immediate intimidation. Two days after publication in Indonesia, our journalist Reno Surya was directly followed on X (formerly Twitter) by President Joko Widodo, which we perceived as an intimidation tactic—especially as the upcoming sequel exposes individuals with ties to him. Our Deduktif email was flooded with spam, and executive producer Sabda Armandio received anonymous calls.  We also suspect shadow-banning, as the documentary repeatedly fails to appear in YouTube search results. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to exposing cross-border human trafficking networks and the powerful actors protecting them.","Through extensive open-source investigation (social media intelligence) across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Douyin (Chinese TikTok), we uncovered further evidence corroborating corporate investigations into companies linked to cybercrime parks in Myanmar. Our findings revealed connections between military junta-affiliated armed groups, Malaysian politicians and businessmen, and the Chinese organized crime syndicate 14K Triad, all of whom were present at the groundbreaking ceremonies and company launches.  By analyzing a single scam website obtained from trafficking victims in Shwe Kokko, Myanmar, we identified hundreds of similar scam sites. Using hash analysis via urlscan.io, we found that numerous fraudulent crypto-mining sites shared the same web design. Further analysis via FOFA linked these sites to unregulated online gambling platforms suspected of being scams.  To track human trafficking recruiters, we collaborated with cybersecurity experts to conduct social engineering, using fake map addresses based on the Storm-Breaker repository. Additionally, we identified internet service providers facilitating cybercriminal operations along the Myanmar-Thailand border by analyzing criminals’ IP addresses, obtained in collaboration with cybersecurity experts and processed through IP2Location.  These findings expose the infrastructure supporting transnational cybercrime and human trafficking, demonstrating the deep entanglement between criminal networks and political figures","Journalists should explore various data sources across the internet, conducting open-source investigations to connect seemingly unrelated dots that are, in fact, deeply intertwined. Sometimes, crucial clues can be found on TikTok, other social media platforms, or even by infiltrating organized crime networks. However, open-source findings must always be verified on the ground or cross-checked with reliable sources familiar with the situation. In some cases, visual evidence is more useful than corporate records or legal documents, as organized crime groups often use fake names or manipulate official paperwork to build their business infrastructure. Combining both methods—visual evidence and document analysis—can significantly impact investigations and provide irrefutable proof to support law enforcement efforts.","Indonesia, English",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvkU_wfa7Ww&t=1210s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO4hZELiA5M&t=19s,,,"Producer, Researcher, Scriptwriter: Kelana Wisnu (Suara Kembara)  Executive Producer & Supervisor: Sabda Armandio  Reporters: Kelana Wisnu (Suara Kembara), Aung Naing Soe (Maung Moe), Reno Surya, Fajar Nugraha, Aditya Widya Putri, Anggita Raissa, Fikry Ainul Bachtiar, Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous  Impact Producer:  Melati Noer Fajri  Video Editor & Virtual Cinematographer: Kelana Wisnu (Suara Kembara)  Camera Operators: Kelana Wisnu (Suara Kembara), Maung Moe, Reno Surya, Zifan Yang, Anonymous, Anonymous, Anonymous  Motion Graphics: Fikry Ainul Bachtiar Wilyanu Dadap  Co-Video Editor: Dendy Ariza Putra  Cover Illustration: William Handoko  Music Composer: YoRu  Voice-over Artist: Anggita Raissa  Sound Director: Galih Nugraha Su  Sound Mastering: Bagus Candra Ramadhan  Production Assistants: Raditya Yogiswara Alan Bintang Dzulfiusi Rafif  Script Supervisors: Fajar Nugraha Riva Rais  Translation: Kelana Wisnu (Suara Kembara) Aliffaiz Achmad  Script Editor: Aditya Widya Putri","The End Modern Slavery Now! is a collaborative investigation project involving journalists from four countries.

Las licencias adquiridas por todas las autoridades mexicanas incumplieron con su propósito de rescatar a víctimas en riesgo mortal o perseguir delincuentes, tras comprobar que ninguna agencia gubernamental puede probar resultados por el uso legal de las tecnologías.","Por primera vez se hizo un reportaje que no requirió de filtraciones para demostrar los dispositivos de espionaje y el uso dado por los gobiernos mexicanos. El mayor aporte fue dejar precedentes en materia legal para acceder a la información: 1) Parte de este reportaje se realizó mediante 256 recursos de revisión presentados ante el Instituto Nacional de Transparencia, Acceso a la Información y Protección de Datos Personales (INAI) que obligó a autoridades del país a confirmar cuántes ocasiones usaron dispositivos y las tecnologías que poseyeron. Los precedentes en la materia permitirán a futuros solicitantes a obtener la información.  2) Tenemos el único padrón oficial de 20 intermediarios de tecnologías israelís o de otros países que vendieron a gobiernos mexicanos. La información ayudó a que organizaciones como Artículo 19 o la Red en Defensa de los Derechos Digitales (R3D) en México realizaran artículos sobre la presencia de dispositivos en el país.  3) La información permitió revelar la situación de espionaje en diversas entidades que retomaron el tema, como en Ciudad de México, Veracruz, Puebla y Estado de México, para que otros reporteros visibilicen los abusos en sus entidades o los riesgos de vigilancia.","El mayor impedimento para documentar espionaje en México fue que la mayoría de las investigaciones necesitaron de filtraciones periodísticas, como los casos de Pegasus para vigilar a opositores del gobierno.  Nuestro caso fue distinto, toda la información se obtuvo de leer cientos de contrataciones, presentar más de 700 solicitudes de acceso a la información pública y pelear con recursos de revisión las negativas del gobierno. Toda la revisión nos permitió revelar el único listado de dispositivos existentes en México. La obtención de información de manera oficial permitió evidenciar con respuestas del propio gobierno que abusaron de sus dispositivos, para vigilar la ubicación en tiempo real de ciudadanos o extraer información privada de sus celulares y computadoras.

United States of America,The Associated Press,Big,,,Researchers say an AI-powered transcription tool used in hospitals invents things no one said,2024-11-01,"Investigation, Open data, OSINT, Health","Google Sheets, Python","This story, for the first time, reveals that one of the world’s most popular AI-powered transcription tools invents text no one ever said, and has been deployed in hospitals across the U.S. as well as many other high stakes settings.","The reactions to our story were instant: AP’s X post got over 3 million views and nearly 3,000 reposts. Officials including the United Nations Secretary-General’s Envoy on Technology and many AI entrepreneurs cited AP’s story, with one tech founder hailing the story for explaining why it had taken his team months of refinement to get Whisper to reliably work, and still finding inaccuracies. Sources told us AI officers in the U.S. federal government panicked, and sent around the story as they scrambled to rid their systems of Whisper. OpenAI acknowledged the problem and thanked the researchers. A Stanford professor wrote “I’m very worried about Stanford now piloting generative AI transcription [...]I hope ground truth audio recordings remain easily accessible by clinicians & patients...” The University of California, San Diego’s Chief Clinical & Innovation posted: “One of many reasons rigorous studies are needed before deployment at scale!”    The story ran in dozens of outlets worldwide, including ABC News, The Independent, and Scripps Howard. The Verge, WIRED, Engadget, Tech Crunch, Tech Spot and TechMeme all did their own versions, citing our AP story. PBS NewsHour followed up with a segment devoted to the story.  We are also sharing our work at NICAR.","This story began in an unconventional way—emerging from academic research that I led as both a journalist and academic. While reporting on AI, I had always wondered how transcription systems, which are ubiquitous in tech, and turn speech into text, handle speakers with accents or speech disabilities. Could inaccuracies in transcription result in bias or discrimination based on disability status or national origin? These questions led me to build an interdisciplinary team with Allison Koenecke, a computer science professor at Cornell, and Mona Slaone, a sociology professor at University of Virginia. Academic studies take a long time and we were about 18 months into the complex data analysis when we first found the hallucinations/fabrications after running about 13,000 audio recordings through different transcription tools. I then pitched the story to investigative journalist Garance Burke at The Associated Press.   For our journalistic investigation we not only focused on what we found, but also on the consequences. We found more than a dozen software developers on GitHub talking about similar fabrications they had found using the tool in the real world. Folks generally post anonymously on GitHub, so we had to use OSINT techniques to derive people’s names and their contact information.","We used Python 3 and after segmenting each participant’s speech, we had 13,140 audio segments, about half from speakers with a speech impairment and about half from speakers without a speech impairment, to input into Whisper and four other transcription tools.  We designed a control group to account for speech impediments. And for comparison, we also ran audio segments through Google’s speech APIs twice, and ran a subset of the audio segments through four other APIs for comparison.  For our journalistic investigation we built a spreadsheet based on comments made by software developers on GitHub about the phenomenon we were investigating. Folks generally post anonymously on GitHub, so Burke and I had to use open source investigative techniques to derive people’s names and their contact information. Convincing them to talk on the record about their experiences was another hurdle, given OpenAI’s prominence and power in the AI sector. Burke and I also tracked down a company that uses OpenAI’s Whisper tool and knows about the fabrications, but nevertheless uses the software in their medical summarization tool that is used by over 30,000 providers in the U.S.","Other Journalists, especially freelance reporters and journalists working in small newsrooms, can learn from this story how to do deep investigative data work that most newsrooms don’t have time for: partner with academics. These collaborations are a win-win situation, because I can answer urgent current questions through in-depth studies with authoritative results. This pioneering approach creates new interdisciplinary methods, powerful public scholarship and brings new knowledge to academia and the public.   Journalists can also learn that so many of these stories we cover are already out there. Many developers complained on GitHub about these hallucinations - the story was right in front of us, but no one put 1 on 1 together until we found the problem in our research.",English,https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/honorable-mention/2024/researchers-say-an-ai-powered-transcription-tool-used-in-hospitals-invents-things-no-one-said/,,,,"Garance Burke, The Associated Press Hilke Schellmann, NYU  Allison Koenecke, Cornell University Mona Sloane, University of Virginia  Katelyn Mei, University of Washington Anna Seo Gyeong Choi, Cornell University","Hilke Schellmann, is an Emmy award winning investigative reporter and assistant professor of journalism at New York University.

O material denúncia a ausência do avanço de proteção do bioma que enfrenta altos índices de desmatamento e fogo, hoje o Cerrado possui apenas 8% de sua área protegida por unidades de conservação. As áreas protegidas estão entre as principais estratégias para evitar a exploração da natureza, uma vez que é a instalação de empreendimentos econômicos com potencial destruição é mais restritiva nesses espaços.","Foi a segunda edição mais lida do ano, alcançando cerca de 900 inscritos no Brasil e fora dele.","Só 8% da área do Cerrado é protegida por Unidades de Conservação. Com regras de uso mais flexíveis que as da Amazônia, o bioma permite maior desmatamento legal. Berço das águas brasileiras, o Cerrado já perdeu quase 50% de sua vegetação nativa e, em 2024, registrou níveis de desmatamento superiores aos da Amazônia. A destruição do Cerrado não afeta apenas as populações indígenas, quilombolas e agricultores familiares, mas compromete o equilíbrio hídrico do país, pois o Cerrado abastece seis das oito bacias hidrográficas brasileiras. Ainda assim, a maior parte da cobertura jornalística ambiental se concentra na Amazônia, reconhecida globalmente por seu papel na mitigação das mudanças climáticas, no entanto, são poucas as vezes que sua relação crucial com o Cerrado é percebida.","A análise de dados foi realizada por meio da programação em Python, utilizando métodos de automação, como a criação de funções (”def:” na linguagem Python), que viabilizaram o diagnóstico em grande escala dos dados.

Indonesia,Narasi,Small,,,Unmasking Anti-Rohingya Hate Campaign,2024-08-27,"Investigation, Documentary, Fact-checking, OSINT","Scraping, R, Python","This groundbreaking investigative project combines digital forensics, advanced data science, and deep investigative journalism to uncover the most systematic disinformation campaign targeting Rohingya refugees in Indonesia’s. By analyzing over 1.08 million data points, including 15,000 social media posts, 3,700 TikTok videos, and 54,000 hate comments, the project maps out how a highly organized digital ecosystem weaponized hate speech to manipulate public opinion — triggering real-world violence in Aceh. This investigation not only exposes the mechanics of bot networks, sentiment engineering, and political amplification, but also serves as case study the intersection of digital warfare, racial hatred, political propaganda in SE Asia.","This project had significant impact on both the public and the journalistic community. By exposing the systematic disinformation campaign targeting Rohingya refugees, it sparked national debate on the dangers of social media manipulation and how engineered hate speech can drive real-world violence.  The findings were amplified by mainstream media, fact-checking organizations, and civil society groups, ensuring the broader public became aware of the coordinated efforts to fuel anti-Rohingya sentiment. The investigation’s data-driven methods — combining social media forensics, sentiment analysis, and cross-platform tracking — became a reference for journalists and researchers, inspiring several newsrooms to adopt similar data journalism approaches in their own reporting.  In Aceh, community leaders and local media used the findings to start public dialogues, raising awareness about how their communities were manipulated for political purposes. The project also reached policymakers and digital rights advocates, influencing conversations with social media platforms on improving transparency and content moderation for vulnerable communities.  Most importantly, this investigation empowered both the public and journalists with the tools to detect, question, and resist organized disinformation campaigns, contributing to stronger media literacy and resilience against digital hate movements in Indonesia.","This project was produced amid one of Indonesia’s most polarized political landscapes, just months before the 2024 Presidential Election. In this climate, the refugee crisis was deliberately politicized, with anti-Rohingya narratives exploited across social media to mobilize support along nationalist and populist lines. Investigating this issue meant navigating significant legal and political risks, as powerful interests behind the disinformation campaign sought to silence investigations into their involvement.  Access to reliable data was a major hurdle, requiring innovative use of crawling technologies, bot detection algorithms, and sentiment analysis tools across multiple platforms — including TikTok, which offers limited transparency tools compared to Twitter or Facebook. The team also developed custom heatmaps, clustering models, and anomaly detection systems to visualize patterns of coordinated manipulation in real time.  In Aceh, on-the-ground reporting was challenging, as many community members feared speaking out, worried about reprisals from local political actors and organized anti-Rohingya groups. Despite these barriers, the team combined investigative journalism, advanced data science, and digital forensics, producing a rare cross-platform, cross-disciplinary exposé that not only uncovered a sophisticated disinformation network, but also set new standards for digital investigative reporting in Indonesia’s evolving media landscape.","We used a combination of digital forensics, social media crawling to map how disinformation targeting Rohingya refugees spread and escalated into real-world hostility.We started by crawling hashtags and keywords across TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, collecting over 1.08 million data points from 15 November 2023 to 14 February 2024-crucial period covering the arrival of Rohingya refugees and Indonesia’s presidential campaign season.  We collected 15,000 posts across platforms and 3,700 TikTok videos, while also extracting 54,000 comments from key Instagram posts by UNHCR, where coordinated hate speech were detected.To detect anomalies coordinated attacks, we applied timeseries analysis, clustering, and engagement heatmaps to visualize when and how disinformation occurred.  Z-score analysis interquartile range (IQR) methods helped us flag suspicious surges in engagement, identifying bot-like patterns including synchronized commenting and 8-hour posting cycles, resembling shift-based operations.  On TikTok, we analyzed metadata from thousands of videos, tracking reach, comments, shares, reactions, and engagement rates. Using these metrics, we classified accounts into micro, macro, and influencer tiers — revealing how disinformation narratives were seeded by key influencers, amplified by bots, and pushed into mainstream conversation across platforms.This data-driven approach was combined with field reporting in Aceh, ensuring we could connect online narratives to offline mobilization and violence.","This project offers crucial lessons for journalists investigating disinformation, refugee issues, and politically motivated hate campaigns, especially in the TikTok era.  One key takeaway is the importance of tracking narratives across platforms, with TikTok playing a central role as a breeding ground for disinformation. Unlike Facebook or Twitter, TikTok’s closed algorithm, limited transparency tools, and viral amplification system make it uniquely vulnerable to coordinated manipulation. Journalists must treat TikTok as a primary site for narrative seeding, especially in cases where emotion-driven content (like refugee stories) is easily weaponized through short-form videos designed for outrage and virality.  This project also shows the power of combining traditional field reporting with advanced digital forensics. By crawling over 3,700 TikTok videos and combining engagement tracking, bot detection, and metadata analysis with on-the-ground reporting in Aceh, we built a full-chain investigation — showing how content born on TikTok triggered real-world violence.  In short, this project highlights why TikTok should be treated as a critical investigative battleground for journalists covering disinformation, migration, and political propaganda in the digital age.","Indonesian, English",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7-IFOGYxmU,,,,"Aqwam F Hanifan, Febrian Adhika, Ayu Dwi Susanti","Over the past five years, I have conducted digital-based investigations using Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to create video reports for a young audience. .

Their activities were exposed when a Russian hacking group published a trove of over 22,000 emails between members of the group online. While the hackers claimed to have uncovered a conspiracy, the truth was closer to Dad’s Army than the ”deep state”.","The _Brexit Conspiracy Files_ shone a light on the murky world of lobbying in British politics.   We showed how these Establishment figures used their networks to gain access to government ministers and even send briefings to the Prime Minister. We revealed how they planned to use the political ”dark arts” – such as hiring private spies to gather dirt on their opponents. We followed the money to uncover a network of reclusive financial donors, including an offshore art collector whose political activities were previously unknown.   We were the only journalists who systematically examined this leaked data, including extensive efforts to check for signs of manipulation and to corroborate using open source material. In doing so, we uncovered stories that were far more nuanced than the hackers’ propaganda.","Working with data leaked as part of a foreign intelligence operation presents a significant ethical challenge. By collaborating with experts in digital forensics and computing, our small team was able to examine the integrity of the email cache and to systematically analyze tens of thousands of documents by constructing a dedicated SQL database.   To accompany our reporting, we created an interactive network visualization of the group, helping our readers to make sense of these complex and overlapping stories and to familiarize themselves with the key individuals.","We used a range of tools and techniques, including:  1. Digital forensics  Since this project is based on leaked emails that were published as part of a ”hack and dump” operation, we collaborated with experts in computing and digital forensics to examine whether the emails had been fabricated, manipulated, or cherrypicked.   2. Open source corroboration   We used a range of publicly available sources to verify information in the leaked emails, such as names, email addresses, job titles, events, and documents. Many members of the group used pseudonyms with their Protonmail accounts, so this contextual information was key in identifying the owner of each account.  3. Database management  Since there were over 22,000 leaked emails, we consolidated all of the emails and attachments into a SQL database to allow for flexible and efficient searches.   4. Network visualization  We analyzed the email network structure, which revealed one central node (the individual whose account were first compromised by the hackers) connecting several sub-networks. We used the vis.js library (coded in R) to create an interactive network visualization, allowing readers to see the names of key individuals, hover for further information, and see the connections between them based on the flow of emails.","We believe this project shows that investigative journalists should not be afraid to examine leaked materials resulting from ”hack and dump” operations, as long as this is done with caution and awareness.   Digital forensics methods can help to establish whether leaked emails have been manipulated. Public reports by cybersecurity experts can help to identify those responsible for a particular hack and provide context on their motivations.

While much attention had been paid to Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, little was known about the global network of companies that the family sits atop called Mundipharma. Working with Finance Uncovered, journalists learned that while Purdue was in bankruptcy, Mundipharma sold opioids around the world and made hundreds of millions of dollars — often using similar misleading tactics.",This window into the Sackler’s international pharmaceutical companies resonated with governments — that hadn’t pieced together the full picture  — and families across the U.S. seeking restitution for the devastation caused by the opioid epidemic.,"As we detailed in “World of Pain,” the financial analysis showed that from 2020 to 2022, nine Mundipharma companies in Europe and Australia made profits of $531 million.  Reporters learned that in Germany, Mundipharma sponsored a patients group that encouraged opioid use for chronic pain while minimizing addiction risk. And in Brazil, the company paid prominent doctors to hold classes on treating pain that also downplayed opioid’s dangers.  Journalists reviewed thousands of pages of public and sealed court documents, academic papers, company filings and spoke with doctors, patients, researchers and more than a dozen former Mundipharma employees.","For its analysis, Finance Uncovered worked off a list of more than 170 independent associated companies disclosed by the Sacklers in U.S. court proceedings. Together these are referred to as Mundipharma. Using company registries in multiple countries and other open sources, Finance Uncovered  journalists identified where each of these units was incorporated and, where possible, the names of each of their parent companies. This showed how listed corporate entities fit together in clusters. The analysis then looked to identify the functions of each cluster.  In many countries, companies — even those privately owned — are required to file annual financial statements with national corporate registries.

Residents suffering headaches, nausea and other health effects struggle to get help and when Texas inspectors find the gas venting into the air, companies seldom face penalties.  Reporters cross referenced state databases and mapped H2S (hydrogen sulfide) hot spots for the first time, showing that tens of thousands of Texans risk potential exposure and letting residents look up the hot spots where they live.","In the wake of the reporting, several Texas lawmakers vowed to address the issue. Rep. Ron Reynolds, a Missouri City Democrat, said he will file a bill next session requiring TCEQ and the Railroad Commission to do a “targeted study to jointly look at toxic hotspots.” Saying the agencies “need to step up and do their job,” Reynolds called for more air monitoring stations, more cooperation between agencies and more funding for enforcement.","Reporting on oil industry problems in oil country is inherently difficult. Most people have a connection to the industry, through their jobs or their friends’ and relatives’ jobs, or through royalties from drilling on their land, or through the tax revenues that fund their schools, police, etc.. A community doctor who had seen the health effects of the gas wouldn’t talk about it saying, ”I don’t want to commit to career suicide.”  Another challenge was identifying which facilities were leaking H2S and affecting the health of residents. The Texas agency that regulates air quality has a database of complaints, but doesn’t specify which ones are related to H2S and doesn’t include the complainant name or address. We went through hundreds of them,  then cross-referenced geographic clues in the complaint with another agency’s GIS of oil field facilities to pinpoint the problem location.  Proving the ongoing hazard of an invisible gas was another challenge — one that we overcame by placing a H2S monitor in a family’s yard for 2 months.  Our data-driven approach to this project allowed us to quantify, for the first time, the horrific scale of the danger that H2S gas may pose to hundreds of communities across Texas.","The Texas agency that regulates air quality has a database of complaints, but doesn’t specify which ones are related to H2S and doesn’t include the complainant name or address.

Then we used Google maps to locate nearby addresses and cold-called residents living nearby.  We also placed a data-logging H2S monitor in a family’s yard for 2 months to measure the exact levels of gas there.

Brazil,InfoAmazonia,Small,,,Main rivers of the Amazon Basin reach lowest level in history in 2024,2024-11-14,"Database, Open data, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment",R,"This report presents an exclusive analysis of the drought affecting the main rivers of the Amazon Basin, the largest freshwater basin on the planet, located in the Amazon. The 2024 drought reached the worst levels in history, caused by the advance of global warming, which prolonged the effects of El Niño in the region and overheated the North Atlantic. The article provides data and accounts of how this has impacted Indigenous and riverside communities.","There were 1992 views on the site. This report presented data that had never been compiled together before, as records on the water levels of the Amazon rivers are decentralized. This lack of organization negatively affects the lives of Amazonian populations, who rely on the rivers for access to medical care, education, and food supplies.    The report served as a resource for Amazonian communities to use this information in their daily lives.","It is important for the jury to understand the significance of rivers in the Amazon. The rivers are the roads, the streets, the sidewalks—they represent food and health. When the climate crisis affects the Amazon Basin, populations struggle to catch fish for their daily meals or even to bathe. Children cannot reach their schools and lose their spaces for play. Those in need of medical care have to wait over six hours to reach a facility—or are unable to get there at all.    Access is precarious, and cities are not prepared to cope with the increasing effects of global warming.","This analysis used satellite images, the R programming language, data extraction, and field interviews.","This report combines data analysis and visualization with powerful stories about how the climate crisis is harming marginalized populations in the Amazon, who have limited access to resources and media coverage.    In this story, we show how coverage of this crisis should be done. It cannot be distant from the affected populations, nor limited to numbers or discussions about decisions at climate conferences. It must be close to the people, showing how this crisis is truly disrupting lives and causing lasting trauma.",Português,https://infoamazonia.org/2024/11/14/seis-principais-rios-da-bacia-do-amazonas-tem-menor-nivel-da-historia-em-2024/,https://infoamazonia.org/2025/01/25/mais-da-metade-dos-municipios-da-amazonia-passou-2024-inteiro-em-seca/,https://infoamazonia.org/2024/11/23/amazonia-vive-calor-extremo-em-2024-com-alta-de-ate-51oc-nas-temperaturas-maximas/,https://infoamazonia.org/2024/08/15/nove-em-cada-10-terras-indigenas-da-amazonia-enfrentam-seca-levando-a-falta-de-alimentos-e-agua/,Text: Jullie Pereira   Data Analysis: Renata Hirota   Data Visualization: Carolina Passos   Editing: Carolina Dantas   Data Coordination: Thays Lavor   Editorial Direction: Juliana Mori,"Journalist graduated from the Federal University of Amazonas.

Además, incluye la visión de un milagro en el sol que observo desde 2016 y que aparece en Apocalipsis 21, 23. Este fue probablemente el que también vio el papa Pío XII en 1950.   El origen del cuadro de Leonardo es un manuscrito que narra cocho arrebatamientos, y fue usado por el cardenal Carvajal, embajador de los Reyes Católicos en Roma, como un oráculo.   Cuento con el apoyo de Martin Kemp, profesor emérito de la Universidad de Oxford.","El impacto de mi artículo ha sido limitado debido a las restricciones del medio de comunicación local, aunque la difusión sea a través de Internet. Por su parte, el impacto de mi libro, que es la base del artículo, también ha sido escaso, ya que ni las instituciones ni los medios de comunicación han cumplido con su obligación de promover descubrimientos tan importantes y únicos.","Me gustaría que el jurado conociera que mi proyecto se desarrolló en un contexto de limitaciones significativas de recursos, ya que llevo casi 10 años en desempleo, lo que ha hecho que la realización del trabajo sea aún más desafiante. A pesar de contar con medios limitados, que se reducen a un ordenador, he logrado acceder a información y datos clave que me han llevado a resultados asombrosos e históricos, resolviendo un misterio de cinco siglos.

United States of America,Bloomberg News,Big,,,How political misinformation proliferated on X ahead of major elections,2024-09-28,"Investigation, Long-form, Fact-checking, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics, Business, Immigration, Human rights","Animation, AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, Json, CSV, Python, Node.js","Two Bloomberg investigations explained how Elon Musk used social network X to promote far-right conspiracy theories.  Bloomberg analyzed posts about “remigration” — white nationalists’ call to deport non-white people from Western countries. Reporters revealed how this once-obscure theory influenced elections in Austria, Germany, and the US.  Reporters also showed how Musk shaped the US immigration debate. They used machine learning to categorize 53,000 of Musk’s posts, reviewing hundreds for accuracy. They found Musk posted about immigration more than any other policy topic, often in misleading ways with sky-high engagement. Reporters interviewed voters influenced by misinformation and immigrants living in fear.","The stories lifted up the voices of migrants at a time when they were coming under threat in the US and Europe, helping to separate Musk’s viral claims from the reality on the ground. They also foreshadowed how Musk has wielded his platform during the Trump presidency, using it to pressure politicians to fall in line, intimidate critics, and shape the electorate’s perspective.  Bloomberg’s reporting helped open other journalists’ eyes to the insights that can come from analyzing Musk’s posts at scale. Following the Bloomberg series, Reuters published a story analyzing how Musk used X to advocate for his preferred cabinet nominees, the Wall Street Journal wrote about how X pushed political content onto its users, and The Economist similarly explored the subjects that have preoccupied Musk over time, based on his feed on X.","Public discourse is a key driver of political change and for years, social media and especially X (formerly Twitter) have been a crucial source of data for academics and journalists that report on politics and societal trends. Since the Twitter takeover, however, Elon Musk has essentially killed the public API and reshaped the X algorithm to favor his posts, becoming one of the most influential political commentators in the world. Through the use of third-party data sources and machine learning, our analysis examined all of Musk’s posts (over 53,000 tweets over more than a decade) in unprecedented statistical depth to quantify the core messages he has pushed. Bloomberg documented how key figures — especially Musk — built public support for extremist ideologies that have since been incorporated into real-world policy. And as Musk’s financial support of Trump’s campaign became clear, our stories were definitive in exposing Musk’s role in using X to amplify and spread conspiracy theories and misinformation, promoting a reorganization of the world’s political order that serves his interests.","The stories were the product of cutting-edge machine learning and old-fashioned field reporting.  For the first part of this series, Bloomberg collected over 3 million social media posts mentioning ”remigration,” ”mass deportation,” and ”Martin Sellner” from January 2024 to September 2024. More than 95% of posts came from X. Bloomberg analyzed the spread of the “remigration” movement over time and geography, identifying heightened discourse ahead of important global elections. Using data analysis and traditional reporting techniques, Bloomberg documented X’s role in driving “remigration” rhetoric from social media to mainstream political campaigns like Donald Trump’s presidential bid, the Austria Freedom Party’s immigration policy, and the Germany party AfD’s main political agenda. For the second story, reporters collected Musk’s tweets and augmented them with data from the surrounding online context, such as related tweets and text from images. They then clustered this enriched text using machine learning algorithms. Reporters then manually reviewed hundreds of the clusters to categorize them and ensure they met Bloomberg’s standards for accuracy. Reporters also traveled to Aurora, Colorado, and Butler, Pennsylvania, showing how the online rhetoric reverberated in the real world.  Advanced interactive graphics and data visualizations complemented both stories.","Billions of people rely on social media for information about their communities, news, and politics. At the same time, social media has become increasingly polarizing, and influenced by the ideologies of their leaders and owners. Our analysis and reporting shows how easily harmful misinformation can spread on online platforms and shape political outcomes, while underscoring how key influencers leverage their platforms to promote lies that advance their own interests. We hope that more journalists learn to harness data and computation to track the spread of false information on social media, identify the driving forces behind this messaging, and explain the real-world consequences of these dynamics to the general public in engaging ways.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-elections-social-media-influence-remigration/,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-musk-x-election-influence-immigration/,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-10-24/misinformation-from-trump-and-musk-makes-aurora-unsafe-for-migrants,,"Davey Alba, Julia Love, Jeff Kao, Leonardo Nicoletti, Jonathan Tirone, Chloe Whiteaker, Jessica Loudis",Davey Alba: Technology Reporter Julia Love: Technology Reporter Jeff Kao: Data and Investigations Engineer Leonardo Nicoletti: Data Journalist Jonathan Tirone: Politics Reporter Chloe Whiteaker: Data Visualization Editor Jessica Loudis: Politics Editor
Argentina,LA NACION,Big,,,Heat Islands: How to explain interactively to our audience why it’s hotter in their neighborhood than in the next one,2024-02-06,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, News application, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Health","3D modeling, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Python","At LA NACION, we set out to explore urban heat islands in depth, presenting the issue in an engaging way. We combined investigative journalism, data analysis, technology, mapping, and immersive visualizations to explain what heat islands are, why they form, their link to climate change, and their impact on health.  A key component was an interactive map with street-level detail, allowing users to check the average annual ground temperature of specific locations compared to the rural average.  Developed with a data scientist and an urban planner, the project used NASA’s Landsat 8 satellite imagery to analyze temperatures in Buenos Aires.","We chose to publish this interactive feature during the summer, on the day Buenos Aires broke its all-time heat record. The article quickly gained traction, becoming one of the most widely consumed pieces among our subscribers, with an average reading time of 2 minutes and 30 seconds.  Beyond its immediate reach, the project had a lasting impact on the public agenda. It brought urbanism and climate change to the forefront of the conversation, prompting other media outlets to pick up the story and amplify its findings. Following our publication, journalists from across the region contacted the same expert we did to replicate the study in their own countries.  Even a year later, the interactive map continues to resonate. Readers still return to the piece to check the temperature of their own neighborhoods, demonstrating the long-term value of the project.  More than just an in-depth analysis of an urban issue, this initiative also serves as a public service tool. By allowing users to explore their city and determine whether the streets they live, work, or frequent are part of a heat island, it empowers individuals with localized, actionable information.","In Buenos Aires, summer temperatures can exceed 40°C (104°F), and due to high humidity, the heat index becomes even more extreme.   This natural factor is exacerbated by poor urban planning—excessive pavement, limited green spaces, and insufficient adaptation measures—creating an environment where heat islands intensify the impact of rising temperatures.  Access to granular temperature data at the street level was a major challenge. While global climate models provide broad insights, they often lack the hyper-local precision needed to illustrate the stark differences between neighborhoods. To overcome this, we relied on satellite imagery from NASA’s Landsat 8 and collaborated with specialists in urban planning and data science to process and interpret the information.  To maximize impact, we strategically published this interactive feature in the summer, on the day Buenos Aires broke its all-time heat record. This timing not only increased public interest but also helped drive the conversation about the urgent need for better urban policies.  Despite the technological and data challenges, we demonstrated that data-driven journalism can bridge the gap between abstract climate science and citizens’ everyday experiences, providing a tool that is both informative and practical for understanding urban heat islands.","Surface urban heat islands are measured by analyzing ground temperatures, which can be identified and quantified using satellite imagery. These images are available in open-access repositories, free to use, and updated periodically. For this project, we used the most recent images from NASA’s Landsat 8, accessible via Google Earth, to detect and map heat islands in Buenos Aires.  To develop the interactive heat map, we collaborated with a data scientist and an urban planner, who provided technical expertise in processing and interpreting the satellite data. They helped identify hot spots across the city by analyzing temperature variations at the street level.  At LA NACION, we focused on design and storytelling to transform data into an engaging narrative. We deployed our own map server to visualize temperatures at a hyperlocal level (block by block), using a clear and appealing scale that avoided an alarmist tone. Additionally, to contextualize the heat island effect, we leveraged data insights to create a 3D model of the hottest block, highlighting the anthropogenic factors contributing to the extreme temperatures.","The key to success in data journalism is collaboration.   Inviting experts—such as data scientists, urban planners, and climate specialists—to contribute to special projects adds depth and credibility to the reporting. Their expertise enhances both the analysis and the storytelling, making complex topics more accessible to audiences.  Engaging in hackathons and collaborative spaces is also essential.   These environments foster innovation and inspire new ideas. By working alongside professionals from different fields, journalists can expand their skills and push the boundaries of traditional reporting. Interactive maps are a powerful tool in data-driven journalism.   Allowing users to explore and interact with the content transforms storytelling into an engaging experience. When readers can navigate information in a personalized way—checking data relevant to their own neighborhood or daily routine—it increases both engagement and the public service value of the project.  Ultimately, this project demonstrates how journalism can go beyond reporting and become a tool for exploration, education, and impact. By embracing collaboration, technology, and interactivity, journalists can create stories that not only inform but also empower audiences with actionable knowledge.",español,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/islas-de-calor-portenas-tenes-calor-entonces-ni-te-asomes-a-estas-esquinas-portenas-donde-la-nid06022024/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1MXeFaTeGoKJa6OFda6X2r8oIgEOfJH2TvScwG4UF1qk&titulo=Urban+heat+islands%3Cspan%3EHow+to+explain+interactively+to+citizens+why+it%27s+hotter+in+their+neighbourhood+than+in+the+next+one%3C%2Fspan%3E&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://youtu.be/S9UZruP-dZM,,"Nicolás Cassese, Emma Stoks, Florencia Rodríguez Altube, Florencia Fernández Blanco, Héctor Villarino, Juana Copello, Gastón de la Llana, Martín Pascua, Tomás Morrison, Gonzalo Colini, Julieta Bollini, Francisco Ferrari, Gabriel Podestá, Alejandro Bogado, Aníbal Greco, Pablo Loscri, Florencia Abd","This project was developed by LA NACION Data, the Digital Narratives team, the Video team.

United States of America,Bloomberg News,Big,,,AI’s Impacts on Global Power Grids and Power Quality,2024-06-21,"Investigation, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment","Animation, D3.js, QGIS, Canvas, Json, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js","Through extensive collaboration across teams, Bloomberg conducted two definitive data investigations on the impacts of Artificial Intelligence on global energy usage and power quality.   Reporters first quantified the energy demands of data centers globally to uncover an alarming trend: in many countries data center energy demand is set to exceed these countries’ entire renewable energy supply.  Next, reporters analyzed exclusive and very granular data on power quality and “harmonic distortion” to uncover the first-ever definitive link between data centers and distorted US power, showing some of the first real-time grid impacts from the AI boom.","Both stories had significant readership and were widely followed by dozens of publications like TechCrunch, Business Insider, and Semafor. For the power quality story, the head of the Dept. of Energy’s loan office shared the story on LinkedIn, quoting extensively from the article, and an Energy Information Administration employee wrote to tell us the story was being shared at the agency. Officials at the OECD and International Energy Agency invited the reporters to present the findings of the data analysis and reporting for both stories. We also received overwhelming positive feedback from industry leaders and other experts on how well the story’s ambitious graphics and careful reporting covered a complicated subject.   In late February, a representative from the Texas power grid said at a statewide power conference that these big data centers pose power quality risks and the potential for them to cascade into bigger problems. At this event, other electricity industry experts also said that these issues created by big data centers need to be studied and fixed.","For the story about AI’s impact on renewable energy, we were challenged with the task to demonstrate the global nature of the issue without losing the reader in the wide scope. Data journalism proved especially effective in addressing that question, enabling us to use the data to help readers visualize the global nature while the narrative text delved into specific localities, allowing the piece to offer both scale and depth.  The story about power quality was built around exclusive access to granular data for about 770,000 individual residential sensors, the first time Whisker Labs shared such data with a media outlet. This was only possible due to months of careful source-building by Naureen.","Both stories involved advanced data science and visualization techniques. Bloomberg analyzed the location and energy capacity of data centers globally based on data provided by DC Byte, a market intelligence firm.   For the first story, Bloomberg used BloombergNEF, a research service, to gather data on electricity consumption and generation by fuel type for every country. Using Python code, Bloomberg converted data center capacity values to energy consumption estimates, and calculated the ratio of available renewable electricity (as of 2022, per latest data) to data center electricity consumption for each country.   For the second story, Bloomberg News analyzed exclusive data from about 770,000 Ting sensors from Whisker Labs, which are plugged into homes across the country, to better understand the distribution and severity of an important power-quality measure known as total harmonic distortion (THD). A lower THD is better. Bloomberg’s analysis focused on a THD threshold of 8%, which the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers indicates is particularly damaging. To test the correlation between THD and proximity to data centers, we used Python and R code, and the cKDTree algorithm, to calculate the distance from each sensor to the nearest 10 MW of combined data center live capacity.","These stories’ success demonstrate the key role that data analysis and visual storytelling can play in debunking incomplete narratives and stimulating more accountability in the private sector. We tackled a very technical subject and made it accessible, while not sacrificing accuracy, through strategic use of data visualization and a lot of care around terminology and language. This type of transparency has shifted the conversation around data centers from denial that they cause issues to making it ok to discuss them in public.   We hope these stories inspire other journalists to continue to investigate the ways in which data centers are impacting the world, and to probe deeper when companies claim that they are acting responsibly. As our investigations showed, new data center projects are heralded as being drivers of new renewable energy projects, when in fact their enormous consumption of the renewable energy resources is forcing other industries to rely more on fossil fuels.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-data-centers-power-grids/,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-power-home-appliances/,,,"Leonardo Nicoletti, Naureen Malik, Andre Tartar, Josh Saul, Saritha Rai, Dina Bass, Ian King, Jennifer Duggan, Chloe Whiteaker, Millie Munshi, Brian Eckhouse, Seth Fiegerman, David Ingold, Lynn Doan",Leonardo Nicoletti: Data Visualization Reporter Andre Tartar: Data Reporter Naureen Malik: Energy Reporter Josh Saul: Energy Reporter Saritha Rai: Technology reporter Dina Bass: Technology Reporter Ian King: Technology Reporter Jennifer Duggan: Dublin Bureau Chief Chloe Whiteaker: Data Visualization Editor Millie Munshi: Energy & Commodities Editor Brian Eckhouse: Power & Renewables Editor Seth Fiegerman: Technology Editor David Ingold: Data Editor Lynn Doan: Technology Editor
Argentina,LA NACION,Big,,,Actas Abiertas: How LA NACION mapped the evidence of Venezuela’s electoral records with the help of crowdsourcing and open collaboration,2024-08-28,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, News application, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, QGIS, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, R, RStudio, Python","“Actas Abiertas” is LA NACION’s citizen fact-checking project providing transparency in Venezuelan elections by facilitating the publication of official actas and collecting additional voting records.  The Venezuelan opposition published more than 25.000 actas - local election records - online after an unprecedented parallel recount. Our developers scraped the actas to create a backup and structured it into a database.  We leveraged the project by displaying the election results in an interactive map, allowing citizens to verify each voting center´s results and search for missing actas. Collaborations with media and organizations such as Cazadores de Fake News and Connectas amplified our reach.","This project had a significant and wide-reaching impact on our audience. Since Venezuelans represent one of the largest migrant communities in Argentina, there is strong awareness of the country’s situation, and many hoped that Maduro would recognize a democratic defeat.  One of the main goals of this project was to keep the topic in the news agenda and stimulate coverage in Latin America, even a month after election night, with the actas still missing.  At the same time, we encouraged Venezuelans to verify the results from their voting centers. That’s why we relied on the interactive map to easily locate each acta by voting center.  Through Actas Abiertas, we were able to collect previously unpublished actas, which Venezuelans were able to send anonymously via our platform.  The Venezuelan community played a crucial role in this project, actively participating from the beginning. Additionally, many Venezuelans, Argentinians, and people from other Latin American countries widely shared the map to reach as many people as possible.  It inspired not only journalists but also ordinary citizens to engage, participate, and share this initiative.","One of the main challenges we faced was the restrictions imposed by Maduro’s regime. First, there were several attempts to take down the opposition’s website containing the published actas. This forced us to act as quickly as possible to obtain the actas before the site was taken down.  Secondly, we feared they would try to shut down our project’s website. To prevent this, we implemented multiple layers of security across our website and the entire project to safeguard our infrastructure.   Additionally, we understood that collaborating on this type of project can be dangerous for those living in Venezuela and their families. Therefore, we developed strict security measures to avoid collecting any personal data and to conceal the IP addresses of those interacting with the project. Ensuring participant security and anonymity was our top priority, further strengthening the project’s credibility and impact.  Another technical challenge we faced was understanding how addresses are written in Venezuela, which is different than in Argentina. Venezuela´s structure of addresses includes multiple components such as: sector, aldea, callejón, pasaje, asentamiento, caserío, parroquia, etc. Understanding these regional differences in addressing systems was essential for properly mapping the election data.","From a technical perspective, Actas Abiertas has been designed to provide security, scalability, and efficiency in handling Venezuela’s electoral actas. To protect the platform from threats, AWS WAF was implemented, while API Gateway manages and exposes APIs as the entry point to backend services developed on AWS Lambda for scalable request processing.  The storage of actas and files was handled using AWS S3, while AWS CloudFront ensured low-latency content distribution. For security and performance monitoring, AWS CloudWatch was used to collect metrics and generate real-time alerts, ensuring the platform’s proper operation. To ensure secure and structured electoral data management, AWS RDS with PostgreSQL was utilized. The backend was developed in Python 3.x, ensuring seamless integration with AWS services. This architecture makes Actas Abiertas a reliable and accessible platform for citizen verification of electoral data.  For data analysis and spatial data management, we utilized QGIS, a tool that allowed us to process, visualize, and analyze electoral data efficiently. For the geolocation process, we integrated Google Maps API, which enabled precise mapping of each voting station. This ensured that every voting center was correctly placed on the interactive map, allowing users to verify results with high accuracy.","The biggest lesson we learned from this project is the power of newsroom collaboration and citizen participation, both of which proved to be our most valuable assets in this project. The success of Actas Abiertas was only possible because of the effort of many journalists, fact-checkers, media organizations, and engaged citizens who contributed to verifying the electoral results.   The Venezuelan community, both withinLA NACION, but also Argentina, and across Latin America drove this project forward and contributed their experience and local contextual knowledge. This collaboration not only expanded the project’s reach and impact, but also helped us collect unpublished actas and verify a significant portion of the results.  Additionally, the power of working together with other teams, most prominently with Connectas and Cazadores de Fake News, was crucial in giving the project impact and strength.  Finally, we saw the potential of data-driven fact-checking and visualization of electoral results. This lets users navigate their own cities, explore familiar places, and verify the results at locations they know. This approach made fact-checking more accessible, and reinforcing the importance of transparency in journalism.",español,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/el-mundo/elecciones-en-venezuela-mesa-por-mesa-el-mapa-con-las-actas-recopiladas-por-la-oposicion-y-como-nid28082024/,https://youtu.be/pxXzGa4VMhk,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1LrEs3XAuhHW6zar1QZSErrcLlVSFYUQMyPGTA3ffM5Y&titulo=Actas+Abiertas:+Fact-checking+the+results+behind+Venezuela%27s+2024+Election&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,,"Momi Peralta, Florencia Coelho, Julieta Nassau, Juan Landaburu, Florencia Rodríguez Altube, Natalia Louzau, Miguel Bevacqua, Gabriel Alonso Quiroga, Pablo Loscri, Florencia Abd, María Jose Abad, Giselle Ferro, Lautaro Royan, Lucas Velez.

The project geolocates over 127,500 reported crimes in 2023, revealing crime patterns across time and space. Through heatmaps and detailed analysis, users can explore high-risk areas, compare crime rates, and gain insights into evolving crime trends. This data-driven approach transforms crime reporting into an engaging and practical public service tool.","The Buenos Aires City Crime Map had a significant impact beyond audience metrics. While the project attracted over 150,000 pageviews in its first week, its true value lies in how it transformed crime reporting into a public service tool.  Readers didn’t just consume information; they actively engaged with it to make informed decisions about their safety. The tool was widely used by residents, travelers, and parents seeking safer routes for their children. It also influenced real estate decisions, as users explored crime rates before renting or purchasing properties. Additionally, it sparked conversations about urban security policies, with local authorities and experts using the data to discuss crime trends and possible solutions.  In the journalism community, the project demonstrated how interactive and personalized storytelling can enhance audience engagement and deepen understanding of complex topics. It gained media coverage in Argentina, and on the day of publication, many people shared crime maps of their locations. Also, it was recognized as one of the top 10 data journalism projects of 2024 by the Global Investigative Journalism Network.","In 2023, Argentina faced a deep economic crisis, with soaring inflation and poverty affecting nearly half of the population. This social and economic instability led to a 15% rise in crime, particularly thefts and robberies.  Given this reality, our team sought to go beyond traditional crime reporting by providing deeper insights into urban safety. We faced challenges working with large datasets from the city’s Department of Security, requiring advanced spatial analysis to reveal meaningful insights.  Access to public data in Argentina is often difficult, with datasets that are not always updated frequently or structured consistently. One of the key challenges we encountered was the absence of a precise geolocation for each crime. Instead of pinpointing the exact location where the crime occurred, the dataset often referenced general areas, such as the intersection of two streets.   This created issues in the project’s early visualization. Since multiple crimes were reported at the same intersection, data points overlapped, making crime rates appear lower than they actually were. To solve this, we developed a custom function that slightly adjusted identical coordinates, shifting them a few meters at random. This method preserved accuracy while providing a clearer, more truthful representation of crime patterns.","For this special production, we used traditional data analysis tools (R, SQL, Python), Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools (QGIS, GeoPandas), and web development technologies for the interactive frontend.  For data processing and analysis, we primarily used R, and Python, leveraging Pandas and NumPy to clean, manipulate, and structure the crime dataset. SQL was used to store and manage data, ensuring quick access and real-time queries.  For geospatial analysis and mapping, we used QGIS to process and visualize crime data in Buenos AIres. The crime distribution was displayed through 48 heatmaps—one for each type of crime from 2016 to 2023—generated in QGIS to help users understand the nature and evolution of different crimes through the years.  We also developed an interactive map that plotted each crime as a dot and included a search bar, allowing users to enter an address and see reported crimes nearby.  To further assess safety levels, we implemented a 200-meter radius crime aggregation function, which summarized crimes in each specific area and identified high-risk zones. This feature enabled users to explore crime concentration trends and evaluate the relative safety of different locations across Buenos Aires.","The Buenos Aires Crime Map pushed us to enhance our data analysis skills and apply geospatial analysis to crime reporting. What started as an article evolved into a public service tool that our audience continues to use to this day.  From this project, we learned two key lessons as journalists. First, we must make the reader the protagonist and take the story into their daily basis activities. This user-centered approach deepened the public’s understanding of crime patterns in Buenos Aires. For example, many searched crime data around their home, workplace, or frequently visited areas.  Second, interactive interfaces sustain audience interest. Journalism isn’t just about informing—it’s about empowering people with information and the tools to explore the data themselves. By giving users the ability to navigate the crime map, we transformed reporting into an investigative experience, where readers take an active role in understanding their surroundings.   Ultimately, this project reinforced how data-driven and interactive journalism can increase engagement and provide meaningful insights to the public.",español,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/seguridad/mapa-del-delito-te-sentis-inseguro-en-la-ciudad-comparti-tu-ubicacion-y-te-decimos-cuantos-delitos-nid23102024/,https://youtu.be/szJpojASuFc,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1nwdsnReOxn-2MR51FT60NeQNr-IwbBr-lMlT2OH_whw&titulo=Buenos+Aires+Crime+Map:+How+safe+is+your+block%3F&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,,"Nicolás Cassese, Florencia Fernández Blanco, Pablo Loscri, Giselle Ferro, Gastón de la Llana, Héctor Villarino, Florencia Rodríguez Altube, Miguel Bevacqua, Fernando Torres Ullmer, Bruno Soifer, Sofía García Katz.","This project was created by LA NACION Data and the Digital Narratives team.

Access to this data helps show potential “wandering officers,” and is intended for use by residents, journalists, researchers, attorneys, and other stakeholders. Information about the age, source, and other specifics for each state is available on each page.","Most immediately, access to the data has allowed local journalists to report out stories of malfeasance and hidden histories of misconduct, including by [chiefs of police](https://www.utahinvestigative.org/did-moabs-police-chief-fully-disclose-his-history-of-leaving-departments-while-under-investigation-for-misconduct/). The story about the chief of police was reported using data from Utah won in a legal challenge brought by the journalistic and legal coalition supporting the data collection effort behind the National Police Index, a process that all three NPI institutional members were also key parts of. That data would not be accessible but for the data collection efforts behind the NPI.","Access to these databases is not guaranteed. In several states, the data collection effort was met with flat denials by state governments claiming to protect law enforcement from exposure. In several, coalition members have filed legal cases to overturn the denials — some with varying levels of success already, most significantly in Utah. Such a simple fact about a government employee entrusted to carry and use a gun — their name — is withheld from the American public in many states, representing millions of people who are subject to lesser transparency simply because of where within the country they live.   In addition to the legal challenges, and as part of the journalistic aspect of the NPI, Invisible Institute has partnered with several local media organizations to report on the implications of a lack of access to data, which can be found on our [landing page](https://invisible.institute/national-police-index).","Dozens of public records requests were used to obtain the data. In addition, appeals had to be filed in several states, one of which was successful and several others of which are still pending.   Multiple contributors contributed data cleaning and processing code, which we coordinated using git and GitHub. Contributors used a combination of r and Python for this. We load the processed data into a postgres database hosted on firebase. The front end interface is written in next.js","This project can be instructive for journalists looking to report on similar systems across different jurisdictions, whether they be cities, states, or countries. We also hope this can serve as an example of how to implement a practice of sharing widely the data used in investigations, outside of the context of one particular series. Police employment data are frequently used by investigative or criminal justice journalists across the U.S., but mostly only by those who have learned the byzantine systems they exist within.

We built a whimsical, in-depth story explaining these changes and what they mean for your garden. Our story and map show the entire country in high zoomable detail, providing more information and detail than the US government’s own tool. All that AND a walking potted plant.","The USDA hardiness zone map is widely used but poorly understood. In some areas, climate change has caused it to change dramatically. Our story provides our audience much needed context for how to use this important tool, allowing users to find themselves in the data to a degree the government’s website doesn’t allow.   In terms of metrics, the story has been well received by our audience and was the best performing piece on our site the week it was published. It landed in the top spot on Hacker News, and spawned follow-up stories by other news orgs.   Through a blog and conference talk, I shared details about our technical approach, which has helped other journalists looking to build maps for cheaper.","Until recently, it was difficult to build zoomable, data-heavy maps without turning to MapBox and paying a ton of hosting fees. Through a few rapidly developing open source tools like MapLibre, Tippecanoe and Protomaps, we’ve been able to host our own vector tile maps at a fraction of the cost. This was a huge leap forward for us. See our blog in the links below for more information about that process, which was heavily influenced by blogs by Kevin Schaul (WaPo) and Chris Amico (MuckRock).  In addition, we collated gigabytes of weather data, creating a database of the last 30-years of the coldest winter temperatures for virtually every square mile of the United States. To our knowledge, our story is the only place to easily access that information where you live.","For weather data, we used python scripts to take large amounts of data and combine them to form the temperature minimum database. For the USDA hardiness zone data, we used a mix of python and QGIS to prepare the data, before converting them to vector tiles with Tippecanoe.   We used OSM data for basemaps, captured via Protomaps weekly basemap. We used Maplibre in the front end to display the maps and data. For the scrolly presentation we used NPR’s open-sourced interactive template (available on github).

United States of America,"VoteHub, Redistricter",Small,,,VoteHub’s 2024 Election Night Coverage,2024-11-05,"Solutions journalism, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, News application, Mobile App, Video, Map, Elections, Politics","3D modeling, Scraping, QGIS, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Hub, ArcGIS Experience Builder, ArcGIS Dashboards, Blender, OBS Studio","VoteHub’s 2024 election night coverage provided real-time precinct-level results—a level of granularity unmatched by other media outlets. Our interactive maps covered every presidential battleground state except Nevada, displaying live margins, shifts from 2020, and raw vote differentials as a proxy for turnout. We scraped, processed, and published results live, making the data publicly accessible for free. Our team also hosted a YouTube live stream and promoted key insights via social media. Despite working unpaid, we committed hundreds of hours and conducted multiple mock elections to ensure smooth execution, setting what we believe to be a new standard for election reporting.","While major media outlets typically report county-level data, we provided an interactive, publicly accessible map detailing precinct-level shifts and vote margins—allowing journalists, analysts, and the public to see trends at an unprecedented level of detail.  Our coverage helped fill a critical data gap in election reporting, with many users engaging with our platform to understand how voting patterns evolved since 2020. Our raw vote differential maps served as a useful proxy for turnout changes, and the shift maps provided immediate insight into the evolving political landscape.  Beyond the map itself, we engaged the public through a YouTube live stream and social media updates, making the data digestible and accessible. Internally, we developed innovative workflows to process live results efficiently—techniques that can be expanded for future elections.  Given that this was accomplished by an unpaid team, our ability to deliver this level of coverage underscores the power of dedicated, independent journalism. Our work demonstrated that small teams can produce election coverage that rivals—or surpasses—major media outlets using innovative processes.","Our election night coverage was a massive logistical and technical effort, undertaken entirely unpaid by a small team. Unlike traditional media outlets, which rely on state-reported feeds or AP data, we scraped election results directly from county and state websites, processed them in Python, and pushed live updates to an ArcGIS Online-hosted table that powered our interactive map.  The sheer scale of this effort cannot be overstated—hundreds of hours were spent writing scripts, running tests, and conducting two full mock elections to ensure a seamless process on election night. Given the lack of standardized reporting formats across counties, manual verification and adjustments were often required.  This project also highlighted the barriers to accessing real-time election data. While election results should be transparent and available, many jurisdictions do not provide easily accessible, machine-readable data. Overcoming this challenge required significant technical expertise and persistence.  Despite these obstacles, we delivered a first-of-its-kind interactive election night experience, covering precinct-level results in key battleground states—something no other media outlet provided in this format.","Our real-time precinct-level election night coverage required a combination of web scraping, Python scripting, GIS processing, and cloud-hosted mapping.  To collect data, we scraped county and state election websites and converted results into CSV format. We then processed the data in Python, performing cleaning, standardization, and calculations to generate live vote margins, shifts from 2020, and raw vote differentials.  The cleaned data was pushed to a hosted feature table on ArcGIS Online, where a joined view updated our interactive map in real time. The map used choropleth and arrow symbology to show shifts, while turnout proxies were displayed using raw vote differentials.  As part of the event preparation, we tested data flows, error handling, and update speeds. On election night, a team of volunteers manually verified data when automated scrapers failed due to format inconsistencies.  Additionally, we generated 3D Vote Density Maps to visualize turnout and partisan margins in an engaging format. Python scripts processed vote totals and calculated density per precinct, while Blender automation controlled the 3D rendering—scaling density, setting up camera views, and applying materials dynamically based on real-time election data. These maps helped distill complex data into a format easily digestible by the public.","Covering an election in real time at the precinct level is an extremely high-stakes endeavor. There is no room for error -- every number must be accurate, every update must be timely, and every decision must be defensible. With thousands of people accessing our site on election night, any mistake could have spread rapidly, eroding trust in the data and damaging our credibility.  One of the biggest lessons from this project is the importance of rigorous preparation. We conducted two full mock elections to test scrapers, data pipelines, and map performance, ensuring that on election night, we could handle unexpected issues without delay.  Another key takeaway is that automation is essential—but human oversight is irreplaceable. While our Python scripts streamlined data collection and processing, manual verification was crucial when counties reported data in unexpected formats. Journalists should never blindly trust automated tools when working in high-pressure environments.  Finally, our work demonstrates that independent outlets can compete with major media organizations if they leverage the right technologies. Despite being unpaid, our team produced a level of granularity and speed that mainstream newsrooms could not match, proving that innovative, data-driven journalism can thrive outside traditional institutions.",English,https://portal.votehub.com/,https://elections.votehub.com/pages/michigan,https://elections.votehub.com/pages/north-carolina-explorer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAZV_8UBHXM,"Garrett Herrin, Varun Vishwanath, Austin Park, Luke Wines, Connor Brooks, Will Bradley, Danny Kaminsky, Colin Miller",Garrett Herrin is CEO & Publisher of VoteHub.

Se recolectaron y analizaron datos sobre los delitos ambientales y homicidios contra defensores ambientales perpetrados en el país, identificando potenciales móviles y difundiendo la información mediante formatos digitales y físicos, incluyendo visualizaciones análogas para promover la empatía de la audiencia.   Este proyecto es la última entrega de una serie de especiales periodísticos de datos que con temas relacionados venimos publicando desde 2019.","Este es el primer ejercicio periodístico que logró evidenciar el panorama completo de las agresiones contra el medioambiente y sus defensores en Colombia. Las distintas fuentes de datos (tres instituciones del Estado y nueve ONGs) habían documentado, bajo diferentes criterios, información dispersa que no había permitido saber con precisión la cantidad de defensores ambientales asesinados y crímenes contra el medio ambiente ocurridos en el país después de que se exacerbara la violencia tras la firma del Acuerdo de paz entre la antigua guerrilla de las FARC y el gobierno colombiano. Nuestro equipo construyó bases de datos propias para revisar caso a caso y categorizar la información de manera incluyente y clara, teniendo en cuenta a defensores de territorios étnicos que no diferencian entre la defensa del territorio y el medioambiente; ambos indivisibles en su cosmovisión.   La claridad de las visualizaciones de datos que traducen de manera sencilla la complejidad de los datos ha sido reconocida por nuestras audiencias, quienes se han podido informar de manera precisa y veraz, así como también han reconocido la cercanía con el tema que han tejido nuestras visualizaciones análogas, construidas para dignificar la labor de la defensa ambiental y promover su reconocimiento social.","Este proyecto demuestra la persistencia del trabajo independiente de Rutas del Conflicto que le apuesta al periodismo de datos como una herramienta poderosa para explicar las dimensiones de la violencia en Colombia, particularmente contra líderes sociales y defensores de derechos humanos. Aunque la persecución en su contra es una estrategia de control histórica en el país, después del Acuerdo de paz entre las FARC y el gobierno, en noviembre de 2016, esta violencia no menguó, sino por lo contrario, mostró una tendencia a la alza. Para elevar la discusión pública sobre este tema, Rutas del Conflicto lideró proyectos de investigación y de datos para mapear los factores de riesgo en su contra, visibilizar sus luchas y alertar a las autoridades responsables de su protección (lo que nos valió un cupo en el Shortlist de los Sigma Awards 2021 - ver “Enlaces adicionales”). En todos los casos, las luchas ambientales emergieron como una constante que se cruza con otras formas de defensa territorial y no fue sino hasta el año pasado que logramos financiación para enfocarnos exclusivamente en esto. Aunque los recursos de la fundación FESCOL nos permitió armar un equipo base, necesitamos manos voluntarias para la documentación de casos (ver “Autores”).","Por la dificultad de acceso a recursos, desde el planteamiento del proyecto, la idea fue minimizar recursos humanos y técnicos, sin sacrificar calidad periodística y de diseño. Por lo tanto, las técnicas y tecnologías fueron en su mayoría de uso libre y universal. La recolección de la información se realizó mediante fuentes de acceso abierto y solicitudes de información respondidas en formatos Excel y PDF. El cruce y análisis de los datos se realizaron en archivos y tablas dinámicas de Google Sheets. Las visualizaciones se dibujaron en Flourish o infografías diseñadas a medida y el especial digital se montó en una plantilla completada en HTML5.

United States of America,Bloomberg News,Big,,,OpenAI’s GPT Is a Recruiter’s Dream Tool. Tests Show There’s Racial Bias,2024-03-07,"Investigation, Business, Employment","AI/Machine learning, Python","Bloomberg reporters noticed that HR vendors and recruiters were starting to rely on AI chatbots to screen job candidates, despite concerns that generative AI can replicate and amplify biases found in their training data. Over the course of five months, Bloomberg conducted a data-driven investigation and found that OpenAI’s GPT – the best-known large language model and one that powers some of these recruiting tools – discriminates based on candidates’ names when ranking resumes. We replicated the recruitment workflow in a classic hiring discrimination study.","Bloomberg’s reporting on bias in OpenAI’s GPT has quickly influenced discussions in the academic community. We released our code and underlying data, with researchers using these resources to reproduce and build upon our experiment. A researcher in Ghent University published near-identical findings concurrently, and others have used our work to submit to peer-reviewed journals. Additionally, our investigation has been cited by dozens of academic papers about ethics, policy, and computer science.  Universities from New York to Utah are relying on our reporting to teach students about algorithmic bias. Reporters have presented the piece to other journalists at the Pulitzer Center, as well as at NICAR, an annual data journalism conference, and at universities such as Cornell Tech and Bryn Mawr. The reporters presented the work at the Association for Computing Machinery Conference on Fairness, Accountability and Transparency in Machine Learning in Brazil.  In 2024, California lawmakers proposed policies to restrict how employers use AI to screen job applicants as evidence of automated hiring discrimination increased, following our reporting. The same year the EU AI act classified recruitment and employment as a high risk AI application, which requires employers to provide transparency and human oversight to AI systems.","Finding evidence of hiring discrimination is notoriously difficult. The legal onus of proving an employer made a biased hiring decision falls on individuals, who don’t have the ability to know how an employer behaved toward other applicants. Candidates also don’t have the means to audit an employer’s hiring processes themselves, and hiring managers using AI tools to find diverse candidates aren’t likely to catch patterns of discrimination in the candidate results they’re presented with every time they do a search.  Testing GPT for bias is similarly challenging — asking ChatGPT, “Do you discriminate?” is not sufficient. AI systems such as GPT are completely untransparent about how they arrive at their conclusions – a black box even to those who build them.  To investigate GPT for bias, Bloomberg designed an audit study modeled after landmark studies in algorithmic bias and hiring discrimination. These studies — one showing how Google displayed ads suggestive of arrest records for Black names, and another showing how hiring managers are less likely to call resumes with a Black name compared to an equally-qualified resume with a White name — both used demographically-distinct names as proxies for race and ethnicity, and documented how names can lead to racialized outcomes by algorithms.","Bloomberg designed an experiment to test for racial bias in OpenAI’s GPT.   We used names as proxies for race. Bloomberg selected popular first names from people registered to vote in North Carolina. We randomly paired these first names with one of 20 of the most distinctive last names for each demographic group from the 2010 decennial census.  We produced 800 demographically-distinct names for Black, White, Hispanic or Asian males and females.  Bloomberg prompted OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to rank resumes from a job description from four real jobs at Fortune 500 companies.  For each role, we generated eight nearly-identical resumes using GPT-4. The resumes were edited to have the same educational background, years of experience, and job title.   We randomly assigned a distinct name from each of the eight demographic groups to each of the resumes, shuffled the order, and asked GPT to rank candidates.  We repeated this process 1,000 times for each job description, cycling through hundreds of names randomly assigned to the same eight resumes.  For each job, we measured how often each demographic group was ranked as the top-qualified candidate. We compared the best performing group to all other groups to test for adverse impact.","As artificial intelligence is aggressively incorporated into all aspects of our daily lives, journalists must cut through the zeal of marketing claims and ask critical questions about where these tools are applied and the harms they may present.  Our investigation sought to test a high-stakes decision-making process that was already being mediated by AI systems. We designed an experiment to show the clear harms that await the application of AI systems in hiring.  Our journalism was the first to uncover clear evidence of racial discrimination in the world’s most advanced AI system (at the time), showing the public that these systems can exacerbate existing inequities in the job market.  More difficult still, the receipts of algorithmic bias for job seekers is invisible. Our approach was the only way to show that names encode race and ethnicity in AI systems, which can lead to racialized outcomes.  In combining elements of landmark scientific studies, visual storytelling, and traditional reporting, our investigation shows new possibilities in accountability journalism.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-openai-gpt-hiring-racial-discrimination/,,,,"Leon Yin, Davey Alba, Leonardo Nicoletti",Leon Yin is an investigative data journalist at Bloomberg News.

Following our published story, Buriticupu signed a contract for 90 houses to assist gully erosion victims. But the lack of investment in environmental issues in Brazil remains a constant, a problem that extends beyond Buriticupu.  Although the Jair Bolsonaro administration was openly hostile to established “green” policies, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s current term lacks a major and comprehensive plan for climate change.  Our research involved close collaboration with scientists to analyse the data and ensure the accuracy of our interpretations and visualisations.  The precision and clarity of our work were praised by researchers, who recognised it as a valuable piece aimed at bringing visibility to a problem they are working to understand and resolve.","The Ravines Scrolly was a bespoke development based on the in-house BBC Visual Journalism codebase. It was built using HTML, CSS, SASS, Vanilla JavaScript and Handlebars. We used Daniel Kao’s Scrolly-Video component to provide the functionality to progress through a video as you scroll through the article. The article is designed so that we can easily update the transcript to re-publish in different languages.  To explain how ravines are formed, we used a mix of 3D animation and motion graphics. The 3D animation, produced with Blender,  allowed us to change the camera position and show the process without having to rebuild the graphic. To explain the  water incidence in the terrain we used motion graphics made with After Effects. Then, the processed video was embedded as a scrolly asset, allowing the user to control the playback of the animated sequence.   To design the immersive interface we used Adobe XD, as well as Illustrator for the maps and graphics.  Accessibility was prioritised throughout alt-texts for screen readers, careful color and font size considerations, reduced motion option for the animations and optimization for low speed internet connections.  The project was designed to flow and look equally good on both desktop and mobile.","These are some lessons we learned during the production of the project that may be useful to other journalists:  -Exploring local problems through a global lens strengthens storytelling: While gully erosion is often seen as a local issue, framing it as a global phenomenon made it more impactful and relevant to wider audiences.  -Collaboration across diverse backgrounds enhances the story: Combining expertise from different regions and disciplines resulted in a richer, more compelling piece, while maximising the value of World Service’s global perspective.  -Engaging stakeholders early leads to better outcomes: Before developing the interactive, we presented three mockups—ranging from a minimum viable product to an ideal version—outlining the pros, cons, and timelines for each. This approach ensured buy-in from key stakeholders, who ultimately chose the vision we had in mind. Their enthusiasm from the output translated into greater support, resources, and a shared sense of ownership.  -Balancing ambition with accessibility is key: We initially planned to include more animated satellite visuals to illustrate the rapid progression of gully erosion. However, we deprioritised this feature due to accessibility concerns, ensuring the final product remained widely accessible without compromising clarity.","The project was published simultanously in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Serbian, Pidgin English, Amharic, Hausa, Swahili, Igbo, Persian and Oromo.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-61d57e25-d458-4785-8a37-3ef119a504c7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvKLmOhJ0L4&t=1s,https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/resources/idt-61d57e25-d458-4785-8a37-3ef119a504c7,https://www.bbc.com/mundo/resources/idt-61d57e25-d458-4785-8a37-3ef119a504c7,"Lead reporter: Shin Suzuki  Additional reporting: Stephany Hegarty, Emery Makumeno, Paul Ivan Harris, Vitor Serrano  Editorial and visual direction of the project: Tamara Gil and Carol Olona  Executive Producers: Tamara Gil, Caio Quero, Flavia Marreiro, Carol Olona  Design: Caroline Souza  3D Model: Daniel Arce López  Development: Matthew Taylor, Marta Martí, Simon Frampton  Visual coordination of the project: Holly Frampton y Carol Olona  Photograph: Vitor Serrano, Paul Ivan Harris, Dareck Tuba e Alex Huguet/AFP via Getty Images","**Bio of the lead reporter** Shin Suzuki graduated in journalism from Faculdade Cásper Líbero in São Paulo.

United States of America,"The Marshall Project, WIRED",Big,,,How Mask Bans Threaten Free Speech / The High Tech Tools Police Can Use to Surveil Protestors,2024-11-12,"Investigation, Explainer, Crime, Human rights",,"This project interrogates how the ongoing nationwide push to ban the wearing of face masks in public places infringes on the Constitutionally protected free speech rights of political protesters.   While politicians claim mask bans are necessary to identify unruly protesters and hold them accountable for any destruction they’ve wrought, journalist Ilica Mahajan showed how law enforcement already has myriad other high-tech methods of identifying masked protesters regardless of facial coverings, only some of which can be meaningfully avoided. Instead, the primary effect of mask bans are to open up protesters to attacks and harassment from their political an ideological opponents.","The stories were originally published on The Marshall Project’s website, where readers collectively engaged with them for over 100 hours, these stories also ran in WIRED’s website, where they generated another approximately 500 hours of collective reading time.  However, this project also found its way to the communities where it was needed most. The story was circulated on social media by local advocacy and mutual aid groups like Emancipate North Carolina and Community Care Tucson, as well as national civil rights advocacy groups like Fight for the Future and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.","This project was published on November 12, 2024—a crucial inflection point for political protest in America.   The previous week, Donald Trump had been elected president for the second time on a platform explicitly promising to weaponize the government’s digital surveillance technology against his political opponents. For the previous year, protests against the United States’ support for the Israeli government’s invasion and bombardment of Gaza have roiled college campuses, an equally intense backlash.  A key challenge in this project was to acknowledge this reality, while also showing readers that the tension between free expression and what seems like public safety is larger than any specific political battle. Surveillance techniques initially deployed against one group often become ubiquitous; anonymity rights are stripped from everyone collectively, rather than on a case-by-case basis.   Striking that balance in everything from the investigative reporting to the illustrations depicting the different surveillance technology available to law enforcement was certainly tricky, but essential to giving readers a true sense of the stakes of the battle over mask bans.","This reporting draws heavily on Ilica Mahajan’s background in technology and engineering to do foundational investigative reporting. While it’s impossible to fully know how widely used these tools are, Mahajan used creative sourcing techniques to illuminate the topic. For example, she interviewed a TikToker who claims to practice “ethical doxxing” and used her own face on a facial recognition search engine to viscerally demonstrate its capabilities..   The story has a complex hook—mask bans are increasing, which makes protestors vulnerable, but also law enforcement has many more surveillance tools at their disposal. To convey that hook effectively, a mobile-optimized scrolly-telling intro—developed in collaboration with art director Jovelle Tamayo, illustrator Anuj Shrestha, with design and development by Katie Park and Bo-Won Keum—does the work by showing an illustration of masked (and unmasked) protestors, then highlighting all the ways they could be surveilled.","While journalists can certainly learn from how we did the project, they can also learn from the material itself. When a journalist goes to cover a protest, they can use the material to learn about what surveillance technologies may be deployed against them and their sources, as well as some strategies for circumventing that surveillance. In addition, journalists covering future mask ban debates can incorporate the lesson that police don’t actually need to prohibit masks to identify people in public, an essential idea largely missing from previous coverage of the issue.  Journalists can also learn from the project’s visual aesthetics. The introductory interactive on the “The Real Problem With Banning Masks at Protests” story is a masterclass showing how a well-designed piece of scrolly-telling can quickly summarize and preview the piece of analysis that follows.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/11/12/mask-bans-protest-surveillance,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/11/12/protest-surveillance-technologies,,,"Ilica Mahajan, Anuj Shrestha, Jovelle Tamayo, Bo-Won Keum, Katie Park","Ilica Mahajan is a computational journalist who analyzes data to uncover the complexities of the criminal justice system and tells stories about how technology is changing the system.

United States of America,"The Marshall Project, Signal Cleveland, Mississippi Today, WEWS, IdeaStream",Big,,,Jackson and Cleveland Judge Guides,2024-03-05,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, News application, Illustration, Elections, Politics, Crime, Human rights","Json, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js, Airtable, Svelte + SvelteKit","The Marshall Project and its partners created judge guides in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and Jackson, Mississippi, to help residents make informed voting decisions. Many voters skip judicial races due to a lack of accessible information—nearly 30% did so in Cuyahoga County in 2020. The guides, launched ahead of primary and general elections in 2024, profile judges and nominees and will be updated with new details. Residents contributed to their development, shaping data collection, design, and distribution. By addressing this critical gap, the guides empower voters in both communities to participate in judicial elections with confidence.","Both judge guide projects saw strong organic reach and engagement.   Seven of the top ten pages for The Marshall Project - Cleveland since January 2024 were judge guide pages, reaching tens of thousands of people. By embedding guide elements with partners like [Signal Cleveland](https://signalcleveland.org/judges-election-2024-voter-guide-cuyahoga-county/) and [WEWS](https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/the-marshall-project/voting-for-judges-on-nov-5-in-cuyahoga-county-this-guide-has-you-covered), we extended that reach by tens of thousands more.  Jackson’s single-page guide became its most-viewed piece, reaching 11,000 unique viewers and driving newsletter subscriptions and recirculation. With an average engaged time of 3 minutes, the page did a good job holding the audience’s interest.   Both projects were driven by organic search, with people actively seeking judicial information. [Comments on our YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5iusQUGWbMI)—requests for guides in other cities and advice-sharing—underscore this demand.  In Cleveland, undervoting for judges decreased, meaning more voters participated in judicial races. While we can’t claim direct credit, we created a resource that responds to a growing need, helping voters engage more fully in elections.  Both projects had serious reach driven by organic interest and strong engagement with the material.","A key part of this project was working with Cleveland Documenters, a program that trains and pays residents to cover public meetings. They helped compile judicial information into a central database powering our judge guide.  Documenters gathered basic details like judicial tenure and roles, as well as harder-to-find data, including financial disclosures and campaign donations. They also reviewed local news coverage of judges. Each participant was compensated for their work.  We also sourced questions for candidates directly from Cleveland residents. Reporters organized dozens of submissions into themes, then sent them to judges, publishing their unedited responses alongside the guide.  This community-driven approach served as a civics lesson. Some Documenters were surprised by how difficult it is to research judicial candidates, while others learned about low voter turnout in judicial elections. Their insights helped strengthen support for the guide and ensure it reached those who needed it most.  We also worked hard to create a strong ground game, using the material to generate everything from printed handouts to TikTok videos.","We made extensive use of basic data tools like Airtable, documenting our fields and processes for checking data.   It was not enough to compile all this information. We also needed to make a guide that took into consideration how people would actually use it. To do this, we asked Documenters in Cleveland for feedback. Many told us the guide would be handy when filling out their ballot on election day.   We made sure our design looks great and is easy to navigate on mobile platforms, so residents can access the guide on their phones at their kitchen table or when they’re in the election booth. We took that lesson to Jackson as well.  “I would definitely share this with my mom and other family members, who I know are passionate but feel similarly that it is difficult to access information,” said a Cleveland Documenter whose feedback contributed to the final design. “It’s simple, straightforward, and informative.”  We also made sure judge profiles could be directly embedded on partner sites, which allowed them to build their own pages that serve their unique audiences.","Local journalists and journalists covering the criminal justice system face news avoidance and measurable loss of interest in crime versus other social issues like the economy and immigration. But elected judges appear to be the exception, and there’s very little out there about them. News organizations around the US could take some good old-fashioned reporting, put it into a database, and build a simple guide that’s better than what exists now.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/cleveland/judge-guide,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/09/24/mississippi-judge-guide-supreme-court-appeals-hinds-county,,,"The Marshall Project, Signal Cleveland, Cleveland Documenters, Mississippi Today","A team of journalists representing several key disciplines collaborated together on this project.

United Kingdom,Carbon Brief,Small,,,Mapped: How climate change affects extreme weather around the world,2024-11-18,"Explainer, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Environment","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Svelte","Over the past two decades, attribution research has made headlines around the world as scientists have linked climate change to extreme weather that impacts millions of people.  Now totalling hundreds of studies, they collectively tell a story of how climate change is affecting society right now – and Carbon Brief’s interactive feature is the only place where every single one can be found.  Published during the COP29 summit in Baku, our map presents the findings of more than 600 studies, covering almost 750 extreme weather events and trends in all corners of the world.","The Guardian used the map as a focal point for two articles – one focusing on heatwaves that were found to be “impossible” without climate change and a second on the scientific techniques of attribution. The former was run as an exclusive on the homepage of the website and given a full page on page four of the print edition.  In other media coverage, Carbon Brief was interviewed by CBS News in Canada for their Daybreak South radio show, and the map was covered by outlets from Oxford University student newspaper Oxford Blue to international media platform openDemocracy and Spanish daily newspaper La Vanguardia.   In Unearthed’s list of the best environmental journalism of 2024, the map was described as “exhaustive, public-interest science journalism”.  Work is also underway by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) – the world’s leading source of data and analysis on internal displacement – to use the map to identify links between climate change and extreme events that leave people homeless around the world.  Since its publication in November 2024, the map has been viewed more than 50,000 times and is Carbon Brief’s best-performing article.","Although based in the UK, Carbon Brief has a large international reach and for the past few years we have seen the US become our largest audience group. The project maps more than 100 attribution studies focusing on events in the US, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the recurring California wildfires and New York City floods.  Of the 100+ US studies, nearly three-quarters of them concluded that climate change either increased the severity or likelihood of the event. In a time where the US government is deleting mentions of climate change from its websites, it is crucial that climate information is made easy – and free – to access.   By collating, cleaning and standardising attribution study data, we’re providing easy access to scientific information that is often hard to find or locked away behind hard paywalls. Every study is provided with a link to the original source for further reading.   Recent advances in AI enabled us to carry out a far more detailed survey of the literature than was previously possible, identifying studies that otherwise would have been missed by manual search alone.","We drew on a number of sources to identify attribution studies for this map. We first carried out a broad search on the Scopus database of scientific papers to produce a large dataset of potentially relevant studies. We carried out a first-pass assessment of these search results to identify attribution papers using the numerous.ai AI tool. The resulting shortlisted papers were then evaluated manually to create a final list.  We identified additional studies through Carbon Brief’s contacts, reporting and monitoring of new research. We also added “rapid” studies that are not published in journals.   We georeferenced the data according to world regions defined by the United Nations, before using javascript and D3 to cluster the events regionally and by type. The basemap was designed in QGIS and Adobe Illustrator. The webpage is built using the Svelte framework.  The map is underpinned by an easy-to-use database for users to type queries or filter depending on their interests. Every country has its own shareable page, and the entire dataset is available to download for additional analysis.","The attribution map not only gathers together and presents previously inaccessible data for further study or journalistic use. It also generates entirely new summary indicators on the role of climate change in extreme weather events.  These indicators have already informed wider news reporting, but the rich and accessible data we have created offers countless potential avenues for further story generation.  We permit those interested to share our content under a creative commons license (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0). By also providing a clean and formatted dataset in full and a clear method at the end of the article, others can reproduce the results.   In addition, by conducting our own research and building our own database, it is an example to other journalists of the benefits of providing a resource that will be used by thousands of people around the world.   The project has been built and managed with the intention to update and expand upon the analysis at least once per year, which can also serve as an example for others.  This is important to ensure the longevity and ongoing relevance of the project, as a resource and as a form of explorative journalism.",English,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/attribution-studies/index.html,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/18/climate-crisis-to-blame-for-dozens-of-impossible-heatwaves-studies-reveal,https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-the-evolving-science-of-extreme-weather-attribution/,,"Robert McSweeney, Ayesha Tandon, Tom Prater, Tom Pearson, Kerry Cleaver","Carbon Brief is a UK-based website covering the latest developments in climate science, climate policy and energy policy.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,,,”Navigating the chaos: how Congress reshaped Milei’s ‘Make Argentina Great Again’ (MAGA) law”,2024-06-14,"Explainer, Database, Politics",AI/Machine learning,"Upon taking office, Argentina’s disruptive president, Javier Milei, introduced a sweeping reform bill that included changes to the electoral system, tax modifications, an amnesty program, and stricter regulations on public protests. The original document spanned over 180 pages and 664 articles across multiple chapters.   After six months of intense negotiations and numerous revisions, the bill was approved by both the House of Deputies and the Senate, albeit with significant changes. To provide transparency, we developed a comparative tool using Artificial Intelligence—combined with rigorous journalistic oversight—to track modifications and clearly present what was ultimately legislated.","The Comparative Law Tool became an essential resource for those seeking to quickly, clearly, and dynamically understand the fine print of legislative changes. In a political landscape where the bill covered multiple crucial issues—each sparking its own debate—this project provided much-needed transparency and accessibility.  Beyond making complex legislation digestible, this special report bridged the gap between government documents and the public, transforming dense legal texts into an interactive, easy-to-navigate experience. It wasn’t just an article—it was a public service that empowered citizens, journalists, and policymakers to engage with legislative changes in a more informed way.  The impact was evident: on the day of its publication, the project caught the attention of 21,651 newspaper subscribers, showing strong engagement from a dedicated audience.   Additionally, the article had an average time on page of more than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, demonstrating that readers took the time to explore and analyze the changes in depth.  We did not expect a report with such a high level of technical detail to reach a massive audience.   We believe that providing this kind of tool is essential—not only to inform but to empower our readers, enabling them to engage critically.","Javier Milei introduced disruptive and far-reaching changes across a wide range of issues—part of a deliberate strategy. One of his first major political moves as president was to push for an extensive legislative package, combining high-consensus reforms with more controversial ones, leveraging the momentum of his electoral victory to negotiate them as a whole.  This bill became the focal point of legislative debate in Congress for six months, carrying profound political significance beyond its legal scope. After a failed attempt in February, a revised version was approved by the House of Deputies in April. However, a lack of consensus in the Senate forced the government to introduce a substantially modified and more concise version, which, after further negotiations and adjustments, was finally approved in June. The final law consisted of 95 pages and 238 articles—significantly fewer than the original 180-page, 664-article draft.  The complexity of this process made producing this special report essential. Every modification—whether an addition or removal—impacted the numbering of the entire bill, making traditional comparison methods ineffective. Manually tracking these changes was impossible, which is why we developed an AI-powered system to efficiently analyze the evolving versions, allowing for quick publication with rigorous journalistic verification.","The Law Comparator is a tool designed to analyze and compare legislative texts, making it easy to identify changes between an original version and a proposed amendment. It leverages text processing, spreadsheet structuring, and a mini LLM model for semantic article comparison.  Developed in Python 3.8+, it integrates various technologies, including Google Sheets API for data storage, boto3 for AWS S3 integration, PyMuPDF and python-docx for text extraction, and Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) with Torch for semantic similarity calculations. Regex is also used for text structuring.  The system is structured into different modules: lambda_parser_ley_original and lambda_parser_nueva_ley handle text extraction and structuring, lambda_text_compare compares articles between versions, and the common/ directory contains utility functions, including Google Sheets integration. Additionally, utils.py manages JSON and regex handling, while service.py orchestrates the workflow.  The implementation follows a structured process: encoding original and new articles, calculating similarities using dot_score, classifying based on similarity thresholds, and storing results in Google Sheets and JSON.","AI has provided journalists with powerful tools to analyze vast amounts of data faster and more accurately. However, human oversight remains essential. One key lesson from this project is the importance of designing workflows that seamlessly integrate AI-driven analysis with journalistic verification.  In our case, we structured the AI output in a Google Sheet, allowing journalists to systematically refine, cross-check, and validate the machine-generated results before integrating them back into the system. This streamlined approach ensured both accuracy and efficiency, enabling us to publish our findings quickly without compromising editorial integrity.  Another key takeaway is the importance of adaptability in AI-driven journalism. When we built this project, we ran the analysis locally due to technological constraints. Today, with advancements in AI processing and contextual understanding, we might have executed the entire workflow online. The landscape of AI is evolving rapidly, and journalists must embrace experimentation, adapt to new tools, and push the boundaries of what’s possible.  Ultimately, the role of AI in journalism is not to replace human judgment but to enhance it. By combining technology with rigorous editorial oversight, journalists can tackle complex, data-heavy stories with greater speed, depth, and clarity.",español,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/ley-bases-asi-quedaron-articulo-por-articulo-las-dos-versiones-del-proyecto-clave-para-javier-milei-nid14062024/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1YD_XOFdmZ4Zmk_s1Di7Ti3g7mJc8bZb5GZuOauyG2ZA&titulo=Navigating+the+chaos:+how+Congress+reshaped+Milei%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98Make+Argentina+Great+Again%E2%80%99+%28MAGA%29+law&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,,,"Martín Rodríguez Yebra, Pablo Loscri, Martin Pascua, Natalia Louzau, Florencia Rodríguez Altube, Miguel Bevacqua, Melanie Michelle Prokopiec, Gastón de la Llana","This project was created by LA NACION Data and the Digital Narratives team.

El impacto fue inmediato: el especial fue replicado en medios nacionales y utilizado por periodistas y analistas para profundizar investigaciones sobre la estructura de poder en el gobierno de Javier Milei. Además, la publicación incentivó nuevas solicitudes de acceso a la información, promoviendo una mayor rendición de cuentas por parte del Estado.

Desde la llegada de Javier Milei al poder, el Gobierno nacional tomó medidas para restringir el acceso a la información y la comunicación oficial tomó formatos inéditos. En este escenario, brindar un manto de transparencia sobre los encuentros en la Quinta de Olivos fue un desafío clave.  Además, la creciente descalificación hacia periodismo y la polarización política generaron un entorno desafiante para investigaciones que exigen rendición de cuentas y pedidos de acceso a la información pública.

En este sentido, además, buscamos hacer visible y en un mismo contexto a una serie de usuarios a los que de modo aparentemente inorgánico el presidente de la Nación recurre periodicamente para hacer llegar sus propios puntos de vista, a partir del apoyo expícito a publicaciones de los terceros mencionados.   También, y como parte de la cobertura, se buscó poner en la conversación pública el debate sobre la comunicación presidencial y esta práctica habitual del primer mandatario argentino de ”tercerizarla” en usuarios de la red social TW, principalmente. Es decir que el impacto social que esta cobertura conlleva - y se alinea con la misión de Chequeado - es contribuir a fortalecer el sistema democráctico a partir de elevar la calidad del debate público, aportar información verificada y alcanzar la mayor cantidad de audiencia posible a través de múltiples plataformas y modos de mostrar los datos.","Desde su asunción, el presidente argentino Javier Milei ha redefinido la comunicación política, utilizando X (antes Twitter) como su principal canal de expresión. A diferencia de mandatarios anteriores, no solo publica mensajes oficiales, sino que dedica varias horas diarias a interactuar con cuentas privadas, a menudo anónimas, que promueven su visión política.  En un contexto de polarización y desinformación creciente, el alcance de estos reposteos y ”me gusta” puede amplificar discursos agresivos o engañosos, con un impacto directo en la opinión pública. Sin voceros tradicionales ni conferencias de prensa, sus redes sociales funcionan como una caja de resonancia digital, dando prioridad a ciertos actores e invisibilizando otros.  Por eso, en Chequeado nos propusimos investigar quiénes son estas cuentas, qué contenido producen y qué relación tienen con la estrategia digital del Presidente. No solo identificamos sus principales fuentes de información, sino que revelamos el nivel de anonimato, la afinidad ideológica y el tipo de mensajes que más impulsa Milei.  Para hacer accesible esta información al público, utilizamos scrollytelling, visualizaciones interactivas y formatos diseñados para redes sociales. De esta manera, logramos traducir datos complejos en una narrativa clara y visualmente atractiva, maximizando su impacto y alcance.","Para el análisis se seleccionaron las 10 cuentas más reposteadas y likeadas por el Presidente, compartidas por Milei más de 120 veces en la última semana y likeadas más de 450 veces. Toda la información incluida en esta nota es de acceso público. Contactamos a todas las cuentas mencionadas a través de redes sociales y, de la mayoría, no obtuvimos respuesta.   Para el Scrollytelling utilizamos una planilla de Excel que contiene y ordena la información de nuestras bases de datos (fechas, hitos, componente visual y su correspondiente guión). Aplicamos herramientas de IA (Claude) para la limpieza de datos y utilizamos el lenguaje de programación R para su análisis posterior. Utilizamos Flourish (D3 y CSV) para la realización de gráficos y visualizaciones.  Contamos con la colaboración de un programador que se dedicó al monitoreo y detección de tweets y un análisis riguroso por parte del equipo de Chequeado para la verificación e investigación.  Adaptamos este contenido a distintos formatos para ampliar su alcance. Realizamos un video para publicar en Instagram, Tik Tok, X y Facebook. También hicimos un episodio especial de nuestro podcast semanal que implicó un proceso específico de preproducción y producción y se difundió a través de Spotify.","Este proyecto aborda un fenómeno novedoso: un presidente que utiliza sus redes sociales como canal principal de comunicación oficial y que, además, comparte contenido de otras cuentas, tercerizando así su discurso. Este modelo desafía las formas tradicionales de comunicación gubernamental y requiere nuevas metodologías para su análisis.  Para entender este ecosistema digital, Chequeado desarrolló una técnica propia de recopilación y análisis de interacciones en X (antes Twitter), combinando herramientas de scraping y procesamiento de datos. Esto permitió construir una base de datos que mapea las interacciones del presidente con otras cuentas, identificando patrones de amplificación y dinámicas de influencia.  Esta misma metodología se aplicó luego para analizar el rol de distintas comunidades digitales en disputas dentro del oficialismo, como los grupos que respaldaban a la vicepresidenta Victoria Villarruel en sus confrontaciones con el presidente.  El enfoque demuestra cómo es posible utilizar datos abiertos de redes sociales para entender cómo se construyen y difunden discursos políticos. Además, resalta el valor de combinar el análisis tecnológico con el reporteo tradicional para desentrañar estrategias de comunicación digital y dinámicas de poder en entornos altamente polarizados.",Español,https://chequeado.com/investigaciones/javier-milei-y-su-cuenta-de-x-quienes-son-los-tuiteros-favoritos-del-presidente-con-los-que-construye-su-discurso/,https://chequeado.com/investigaciones/cruce-de-tuiteros-libertarios-en-x-quienes-son-las-cuentas-mas-reposteadas-por-javier-milei-y-victoria-villarruel/,https://www.instagram.com/chequeado/reel/C374xq0IxhC/,,"Franco Piccato, Matías Di Santi, Florencia Ballarino, Lucía Gardel, Ignacio Ferreiro, Ariel Tiferes, Joaquín Saralegui, Ignacio Ferreiro, Matías Severo, Matías Ferán.","Franco Piccato (Director Ejecutivo - Edición periodística) , Matías Di Santi (Director de Medios - Edición periodística), Florencia Ballarino (Jefa de Redacción - Edición periodística), Lucía Gardel (Editora - Producción periodística y análisis de datos), Ignacio Ferreiro (Coordinador de Datos - Desarrollo, producción periodística y análisis de datos), Ariel Tiferes (Jefe de Innovación - Desarrollo), Joaquín Saralegui (Product Manager - Desarrollo), Matías Severo (Coordinador de Diseño - Fotografía), Matías Ferán (Responsable audiovisual - Fotografía)."
United States of America,VoteHub,Small,,,Presidential Campaign Tracker,2024-09-10,"Explainer, News application, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Map, Elections, Politics","Google Sheets, ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Hub, Datawrapper","The Presidential Campaign Tracker provides a daily updated record of campaign events for Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump, and their running mates, Governor Tim Walz and Senator JD Vance. It tracked rallies, speeches, town halls, and other public appearances, offering insight into how candidates allocated their time and focus their campaigns. Modeled after a similar project by the New York Times. By mapping and cataloguing these stops, it helped the public understand the strategic priorities of each campaign in the 2024 election.","The Presidential Campaign Tracker had a significant impact on election coverage, providing a real-time, data-driven record of where and how candidates campaigned. It was cited by ABC News’s FiveThirtyEight, which used our data to analyze disparities in campaign activity between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Their coverage brought national attention to the tracker, reinforcing its role as a key source for understanding campaign strategy.  The tracker provided the public with an accessible tool to analyze candidate priorities. By updating daily, it became a go-to resource for tracking campaign stops, primarily in key swing states, revealing where candidates focused their efforts. The project provided a neutral, fact-based reference in an election season often dominated by spin and speculation.","One key context for the Presidential Campaign Tracker is that it filled a critical gap left when the New York Times stopped updating its campaign tracker after Joe Biden dropped out of the race. With major media outlets scaling back, there was no centralized, public resource tracking where candidates were spending their time—so we stepped up to ensure this data remained accessible.  Unlike major news organizations, we operated with little funding besides volunteer donations, and have no regularly paid staff. In our free time, we relied on public schedules, local news reports, and user submissions to verify events. Despite these limitations, we committed to daily updates, ensuring accuracy even as campaign schedules shifted.  Access to data was another challenge. Campaigns are often selective in announcing events, and private fundraisers or closed-door meetings were excluded to maintain transparency. We focused on public-facing appearances, providing a balanced and nonpartisan record of campaign activity.  Despite these hurdles, we were committed to making the data engaging and accessible. By stepping in where others left off and without institutional support, the tracker became a tool for election transparency and ensured the public could continue analyzing campaign strategies in real time.","We used a straightforward yet effective combination of ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Dashboards, ArcGIS Hub, and Datawrapper to present campaign event data in an accessible format.  Each event was logged into an ArcGIS Online hosted table, which automatically updated a list widget within an ArcGIS Dashboard. This dashboard was then embedded as an iframe within ArcGIS Hub, creating a seamless, publicly accessible interface for users to track campaign stops in real time.  To enhance the visual representation of events, we used Datawrapper to map locations, allowing users to see the geographic distribution of campaign stops at a glance. This provided an intuitive way to analyze candidate strategy, particularly in swing states.  While the tools were relatively simple, the project demonstrated how off-the-shelf GIS solutions can be effectively combined to create a functional, real-time political data tracker. By leveraging web mapping, dynamic tables, and dashboards, we ensured that the tracker remained up-to-date and user-friendly without requiring extensive custom development.","We feel other journalists can learn several valuable lessons from the Presidential Campaign Tracker.  First, the project demonstrates how simple tools and a hands-on approach can create an impactful resource. While large organizations rely on complex systems and dedicated teams, we showed that minimal resources—using free or basic software like ArcGIS Online, Dashboards, and Datawrapper—can produce dynamic, real-time data trackers.  Additionally, the project underscores the importance of filling gaps left by mainstream media. When major outlets stopped updating their campaign coverage, we seized the opportunity to provide essential information about candidates’ public appearances. This highlights the value of independent, community-driven journalism, especially when traditional news organizations step back.  More broadly, we feel our project highlights how data transparency can help decode campaign strategies. By focusing on public-facing, verifiable events, we offered a more comprehensive view of candidate activities, enabling voters and journalists to track and analyze campaign trends.  Finally, the tracker emphasizes the importance of collaboration and user engagement. By encouraging us the public to email us corrections, we fostered a collaborative, crowdsourced approach to election reporting, which is invaluable in the rapidly changing political landscape.",English,https://projects.votehub.com/pages/campaign-tracker,https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-holding-campaign-events-harris/story?id=114567436,https://www.axios.com/2024/10/30/harris-trump-lighter-travel-campaigns,,Garrett Herrin,"Garrett Herrin is the CEO & Publisher of VoteHub.

Pensado para periodistas, líderes de opinión, estudiantes y el público en general, el proyecto combina transparencia de fuentes, aplicación de herramientas digitales de visualización y formatos optimizados para redes, permitiendo que los datos sean utilizados en diversas narrativas y alcancen nuevas audiencias.","Este proyecto busca ampliar el acceso a datos e información verificada en un contexto de alta circulación de desinformación, brindando herramientas a periodistas, líderes de opinión, docentes, estudiantes y a toda la comunidad interesada para enriquecer el debate público con evidencia clara y accesible.  El panel permitió que datos oficiales, muchas veces presentados de forma compleja o dispersa, sean interpretados y compartidos fácilmente, logrando que la conversación pública se base en información precisa con evidencia y contexto. Además, su integración con redes sociales facilitó la viralización de contenido confiable, reduciendo la brecha entre datos y audiencia que es, precisamente, por donde se cuela la desinformación.  El impacto del proyecto se reflejó en su adopción por otros medios y referentes que utilizaron las visualizaciones en sus propias producciones, aumentando el alcance del periodismo de datos de Chequeado. También inspiró a periodistas y comunicadores a incorporar formatos de visualización más accesibles y atractivos en su trabajo, fortaleciendo el ecosistema de información verificada en Argentina y la región.","Esta iniciativa surge en un contexto de alta polarización política, cambios de gobierno y crisis en la credibilidad política, donde la desinformación juega un rol clave en la conversación pública. En este escenario, el acceso a datos confiables y actualizados es fundamental, pero muchas veces se ve obstaculizado por la dispersión de las fuentes confiables, la falta de formatos accesibles y la manipulación de contenidos engañosos en redes.  Para superar estas barreras, este proyecto combina tecnología con datos, busca garantizar información verificada, actualizaciones en tiempo real, visualizaciones de datos claras y un análisis histórico de la variación de esos mismos datos a lo largo del tiempo.

A través de una metodología rigurosa y transparente, se analizan 20 compromisos clave, evaluando su estado con fuentes oficiales, documentos gubernamentales y especialistas. El proyecto combina periodismo de datos, tecnología y narrativas multiplataforma para hacer accesible la rendición de cuentas y fomentar el pensamiento crítico. Con visualizaciones interactivas y amplia difusión en medios y redes sociales, Promesas Chequeadas busca fortalecer la transparencia, combatir la desinformación y permitir que la ciudadanía evalúe la gestión con evidencia verificada.","Esta iniciativa generó un impacto significativo en la conversación pública, consolidándose como una contribución de relevancia para el análisis del discurso político en Argentina. En su primera semana, alcanzó a más de un millón de personas a través de nuestra web, redes sociales y alianzas con medios como Clarín, logrando que información verificada llegue a una audiencia masiva.  Más allá de las métricas, el proyecto promovió un debate basado en evidencia, permitiendo que periodistas, académicos, analistas y ciudadanos contrasten los dichos del gobierno con datos concretos. Fue citado en diversos medios y utilizado como referencia por especialistas, consolidándose como un insumo clave para el periodismo político y la rendición de cuentas.  Además, incentivó la participación ciudadana: muchas personas interactuaron con el contenido, enviaron consultas y pidieron seguimiento sobre nuevas promesas. Esto demuestra una mayor demanda de transparencia y una ciudadanía más involucrada en evaluar la gestión gubernamental.  El proyecto también inspiró a otros periodistas y organizaciones a explorar metodologías de monitoreo de promesas políticas, reforzando la importancia del fact-checking en contextos de alta polarización. Su impacto demuestra que el acceso a información verificada no solo informa, sino que fortalece la democracia y el pensamiento crítico.","La propuesta surge en un contexto de alta polarización política y desinformación, donde el discurso público está marcado por promesas ambiguas, interpretaciones sesgadas y falta de mecanismos accesibles para evaluar la gestión de los gobernantes. En Argentina, el acceso a datos oficiales es un desafío: si bien existen fuentes gubernamentales, muchas veces la información es fragmentada, difícil de interpretar o directamente inaccesible.  El gobierno de Javier Milei, además, se caracteriza por una fuerte presencia en redes sociales y un discurso que interpela a los medios y el periodismo tradicional. En este escenario, el seguimiento de sus promesas implica desafíos tanto en el acceso a la información como en la recepción del proyecto dentro de un entorno polarizado.  Otro reto fue la adaptabilidad tecnológica y comunicacional. Para llegar a nuevas audiencias, especialmente jóvenes y sectores menos familiarizados con el periodismo de datos, trabajamos con formatos interactivos, narrativas short-form y estrategias multiplataforma.  Además, el monitoreo es un esfuerzo de largo plazo: seguimos cada promesa a lo largo del mandato, lo que requiere metodologías consistentes y un análisis constante en un entorno político y económico dinámico. En este contexto, Promesas Chequeadas informa y fortalece la cultura de la rendición de cuentas.","El especial está desarrollado en una plataforma de Wordpress, al igual que la mayor parte de nuestro sitio web.

El proyecto también resalta la importancia de adaptar la información a distintos formatos y audiencias. No basta con publicar datos: es clave traducirlos en visualizaciones interactivas, narrativas breves y contenido multiplataforma para garantizar su alcance y comprensión. Periodistas de cualquier medio pueden aplicar esta lógica para hacer que su trabajo tenga mayor impacto.  Otro aprendizaje es que el fact-checking no termina en una nota: requiere seguimiento constante. La metodología de actualización anual permite evaluar no solo si una promesa se cumplió, sino también su evolución en el tiempo, algo replicable en otros países y niveles de gobierno.  Finalmente, el proyecto refuerza que la transparencia es clave para la credibilidad.

Embora a humanidade tenha avançado no desenvolvimento de tratamentos e vacinas, mais de um bilhão de pessoas ainda sofrem todos os anos por conta de doenças. A Organização Mundial da Saúde lista 20 dessas doenças para incentivar o combate global, abordando também a redução da pobreza e das desigualdades.   Este conteúdo especial explica o que são essas patologias, abordando seu determinante social e a busca por soluções. O material combina infográficos, ilustrações, textos, interatividade e entrevistas.","O projeto gerou maior visibilidade para as Doenças Tropicais Negligenciadas, contribuindo para o debate público sobre o tema. A abordagem acessível e aprofundada permitiu que mais pessoas compreendessem a gravidade dessas doenças e seus impactos sociais. Além disso, ao dar espaço para vozes de comunidades afetadas e especialistas, o trabalho ajudou a trazer perspectivas muitas vezes ausentes no noticiário tradicional.","Há anos queríamos abordar as Doenças Tropicais Negligenciadas com dados, mas logo percebemos a complexidade do tema. A mensuração do impacto dessas doenças é desafiadora, pois afetam populações de maneiras diversas. Além disso, apresentar apenas os dados de forma descritiva não seria suficiente – era essencial contextualizar e explicar a importância do assunto para o público. Sabíamos que o projeto exigiria um formato especial, com apelo visual e recursos de interatividade. No entanto, temos uma equipe pequena e a viabilização parecia improvável. O projeto saiu do papel após uma bolsa do ICFJ (International Center for Journalists), que permitiu a dedicação necessária para desenvolvê-lo. Com um prazo de apenas três meses, toda a produção – desde a pesquisa e análise de dados até o design, interatividade e entrevistas – foi realizada por uma equipe de apenas duas pessoas, em paralelo às demandas diárias.

United States of America,VoteHub,Small,,,Presidential Election Explorer,2024-09-06,"Open data, News application, Map, Elections, Politics","Scraping, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python, ArcGIS API for JavaScript, ArcGIS Hub","VoteHub created the most detailed interactive map to date of the 2020 and 2016 presidential elections, displaying results at a census block group level using precinct results. In addition to the percentage each candidate obtained and the raw vote totals via choropleth symbology, users can toggle bubbles or dot densities to visualize vote volume, as well as pie charts for results in each block group. Finally, users can view the shift from 2016 to 2020 as either a percentage or raw votes.","By visualizing results at a census block group level, the project allowed engaged citizens, journalists, and other curious users to explore voting patterns with greater granularity than ever before.  The tool was shared by a number of users on the X platform, with users highlighting key takeaways and using its maps to illustrate electoral trends. While its direct influence on other journalists is difficult to measure, the project contributed to the broader movement of using highly detailed spatial data to enhance election analysis.  By making the data publicly accessible and fully interactive, our app allowed users to independently investigate shifts in voter behavior, deepening public engagement with electoral trends.","In terms of resource constrains, some important context is that the work was done completely unpaid. Access to the data was quite limited is some jurisdictions, such as counties that do not release precinct results without purchase and some that do not have precinct boundaries in a readily available format. In addition, many states do not have a central reporting platform where we can obtain the data. Over 1,000 hours of work went into creating the platform. Once the data were obtained, they were then disaggreted into block groups using spatial interpolation techniques for a more granular look at the data. Finally, the data were uploaded in a GIS web interface, and the front end was configured as an ArcGIS for Javascript custom application.","We used a combination of web GIS technologies and spatial interpolation to transform precinct-level election results into census block group estimates. This process involved proportionally distributing votes based on population and geographic characteristics to provide a more granular view of electoral patterns.  To develop the interactive map, we built a custom web application using ArcGIS for JavaScript, rather than relying on a configurable ArcGIS Online app. This allowed us to implement key enhancements, including instant pop-up responses for smoother user interaction, a dark mode option for improved accessibility and aesthetics, and layers that are both switchable and can be overlaid.","One key lesson is the importance of accessibility and interactivity in data visualization. By allowing users to explore different mapping techniques—such as choropleths, dot densities, and pie charts—we enabled multiple perspectives on the same data. Additionally, features like instant pop-ups and dark mode improved usability, making complex data more engaging and intuitive.  Another takeaway is that detailed election mapping is possible even with fragmented data sources. Journalists can overcome inconsistent reporting formats by using spatial techniques to standardize and refine election results.

United States of America,"The Marshall Project, DocumentedNY",Big,,,Fact-checking Donald Trump’s Statements About Immigration,2024-10-01,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Video, Politics, Crime, Economy, Employment, Gun violence, Human rights, Terrorism","Scraping, Json, R, Python, See methods above.","Rhetoric about immigration and immigrants was central to the 2024 presidential race. The Marshall Project used computer-aided text analysis and human reporting to process over 350,000 of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’ public statements from Factba.se. Reporters found 13 major false or highly misleading claims about immigration that Trump repeatedly made, some of which he repeated 500 times or more. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris maintained a positive tone but supported harsh policies. Ultimately, Trump’s immigration lies appear to have helped secure his victory.","The technical aspects of this project represent a major contribution in the development and use of natural language processing in journalism. We published the story alongside a methodology piece to provide a reference for how these techniques can aid reporters processing large amounts of text that would be near impossible to process by human effort alone.   The design is a case study of how to efficiently filter mountains of text into smaller amounts that are possible for reporters to review themselves. In this way, we vastly increase a reporter’s capacity for processing information without sacrificing accuracy.  The piece itself reached readers on the web and through our short videos and via our distribution partner, DocumentedNY, who translated it into Spanish along with translating excerpts into Mandarin Chinese. This made fact checks of Trump’s dangerous claims  available as a resource to a broad, diverse audience. Based on web traffic alone, it’s been one of our most widely read pieces since it was published.   Finally, the piece has continued to gain traffic in the weeks since Trump’s inauguration. It appears it has newfound relevance as a comprehensive reference to this critical theme in Trump’s rhetoric and — likely — forthcoming policy.","This project presented major technical and organizational challenges. We discuss the ambitious technical approach in the question below.   The organizational challenge was the scale of the effort — the project had 28 contributors from The Marshall Project and a team of several collaborators at DocumentedNY, our distribution partner. We set up an internal Airtable workflow to manage fact-checking assignments, which involved assigning, writing, multiple rounds of edits with the project editor and editor-in-chief, and finally copyediting. Then, all the material had to be flowed into the final produced post, resulting in a comprehensive, deeply-reported set of fact checks for Trump’s most relevant anti-immigrant claims.  Most of this organization was the result of a productive collaboration between lead reporter Anna Flagg and data project lead, Andrew Rodriguez Calderon, and was supported by The Marshall Project’s talented editing and copyediting team.","The Marshall Project used natural language processing (NLP) to analyze nearly 4,000 transcripts from Factba.se, identifying and categorizing immigration-related statements made by Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.  First, we scraped over 350,000 lines of text using Python with Beautiful Soup and Selenium. A binary classifier, fine-tuned from RoBERTa, identified 12,000 statements about immigration, using active learning to improve accuracy.  To detect repeated claims, we applied sentence transformers to generate embeddings, reduced dimension, and clustered statements. Reporters manually refined clusters, merging and splitting them for accuracy. WizMap visualization aided this process.  Final claim categories were defined, and binary classifiers were trained to count instances of each claim. Every statement was reviewed manually to ensure accuracy, discarding false positives and ensuring a safe floor.  The results showed Trump repeating major false or misleading immigration claims hundreds of times. This process combined automated NLP techniques with human verification, demonstrating how journalists can efficiently analyze large-scale text data without sacrificing accuracy.","This project highlights how journalists can use NLP to analyze vast text datasets while maintaining editorial rigor. By combining large language models (LLMs) with human judgment, reporters can efficiently categorize statements, refine classifications, and verify results. NLP tools like binary classifiers and clustering algorithms allow journalists to surface patterns in political rhetoric that would be overwhelming to identify manually. However, human oversight remains essential — LLMs can assist with labeling and summarization, but final decisions must be made through careful reporting.  Another key takeaway is the importance of quantifying repetition. By setting lower bounds on how often a claim appears, journalists can provide concrete evidence of messaging patterns rather than relying on anecdotal impressions. Visualization tools like WizMap further aid analysis, allowing reporters to explore relationships between statements and refine groupings efficiently. These methods show how computational techniques can enhance investigative reporting, making it possible to tackle large-scale text analysis without sacrificing accuracy.  The methods employed by this project are of major interest for newsrooms trying to use AI and text processing tools.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/11/20/how-we-reported-on-rhetoric-about-immigrants-in-the-2024-election,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/24/fact-check-trump-statements-immigrants-takeaways,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/11/06/election-result-trump-harris-immigration-crime,"Aala Abdullahi, Aaron Sankin, Alex Gilwit, Ana Graciela Méndez, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Anna Flagg, Ashley Dye, Celina Fang, Chris Vazquez, Daphne Duret, David Eads, Doug Livingston, Geoff Hing, Ghazala Irshad, Ilica Mahajan, Jamiles Lartey, Joseph Neff, Kelsey Adams, Kristin Bausch, Lauren Hardie, Mara Corbett, Moiz Syed, Rachel Dissell, Robert Flagg, Ruth Baldwin, Shannon Heffernan, Susan Chira, Terri Troncale","A team of journalists representing several key disciplines collaborated together on this project.

Our entry combines clear visual storytelling with detailed data analysis, providing an impactful narrative on the challenges faced by journalists in Gaza. Through this work, we aimed to present an unprecedented view of  the conditions of journalists and the magnitude of their suffering, emphasizing the sacrifices they made in the pursuit of truth.","To our knowledge, no other media organisation and/or publishing platform was able to do something similar recently (during Oct 2023 - Dec 2024) in scope or visualisation concerning journalists in Gaza. The survey results were published in several global media outlets as a reliable source of data on journalists in Gaza and can help serve as a historical documentation of the conditions the journalists were in. Later, Free Press Unlimited, an international press freedom organisation, published a report on the findings of ARIJ’s survey.","Till Dec 2024, at least 133 journalists had lost their lives in Gaza, according CPJ. Additionally, many journalists had been arrested, others remain missing. In this survey, we aimed to focus on the journalists who have survived and to highlight their struggles to continue their work under such circumstances. It was very challenging to get data amidst chaotic extraordinary 14+ months war conditions.  Collecting data during war is incredibly challenging due to a combination of factors such as communication breakdowns: Internet and telecommunication services are often disrupted, making it hard to gather information, especially considering the continuous displacement of the individuals. ARIJ team was able to collect data, clean it and analyse it to highlight the humanitarian suffering. And then visualize the data in a simple chart that everyone can understand.  The survey includes responses from 383 journalists, most of whom freelancers. The respondents were either in the Gaza strip or were there at some point during the war. The majority of the respondents remain in Gaza, working amid increasingly dire circumstances. The survey results, with charts and visualizations, present a clearer understanding of the profound impact of the ongoing war on their lives and their ability to continue reporting.","A survey was distributed via email and text messages between October 25 and November 7, 2024, collected both quantitative and qualitative data.  Google sheet was utilized to clean and analyze the data, leading to accurate results. Flourish was used to produce initial charts. Later, Figma was used to design the final charts. The emails and phone numbers were verified based on a previous database. Additionally, maintaining confidentiality of data is essential.","Data collection is a difficult task, made even more complex when it involves sensitive issues that impact the lives and safety of individuals and their families. This project was particularly challenging, but persistence and commitment to its execution were crucial in providing these journalists—working in exceptionally perilous conditions—a voice to speak and a platform to share their stories, the struggles of their families, and the severe risks they face as they continue reporting on the events unfolding on the ground. The project includes a section featuring quotes from journalists in Gaza, sharing their struggles. It provides insight into the personal losses, working conditions, and hardship faced by journalists in Gaza. Another key lesson is that data can powerfully convey a human story and illustrate their everyday reality.","English, Arabic",https://arij.net/investigations/gaza-survey-Journalists/index.html,https://muwatin.net/en/70712/a-survey-of-gazas-journalists-during-the-war/,https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20241227-92-of-journalists-have-lost-equipment-in-israels-bombing-of-gaza-poll-finds/,https://newscentral.africa/survey-reveals-92-of-gaza-journalists-affected-by-israels-attacks/,Hoda Osman E’thar AlAzem Abdallah Quqas Aya AlManaseer Saeed Hammad,"Hoda Osman is a New York-based investigative journalist.

We analyzed criminal cases (one resulted in a death),  amount of fines for LGBT-related ’extremist content’, deportations of migrant trans-women, counted police raids of queer spaces. Additionally, we scraped and analyzed Vladimir Putin’s speeches over the past 12 years that related to the LGBTQ+ community and how they influenced public opinion. Also queer organizations provided us with data that showed an increase of people seeking help as a result of this ban.","After the publication, journalists were cooperating with the LGBTQ+ organization in tracing raids against queer spaces and helped to fill in the gaps in data. Some other media cited the report. Also, the project was featured in GIJN’s top-data tories in January.","Today, Russian authorities are trying to conceal as much data as they possibly can, or they are not making it public in full. That is why it is necessary to adapt and to look for other ways to access information about authorities’ activities. Additionally, Russia’s authorities are widely prosecuting journalists that are criticizing government’s point of view, that is why journalists are taking high personal risks by reporting on such sensitive topics.","To gather data about the raids of queer spaces, we have used a Telegram-scraper that connects to API. We selected over a dozen media-channels, key-words and a timeframe. The dataset was later cleaned, and analyzed through python-pandas library to eliminate duplicating mentions of raids, after that the dataset was manually checked for mistakes.  To collect Putin’s speeches we built our own scraper that downloads media transcripts from the Kremlin’s website. After selecting a set of keywords and a time-frame -- starting from the first restrictive law against LGBTQ-people was adopted in 2013. Downloaded speeches were checked for duplications and analyzed through topical clusterization and their frequencies throughout the years.  Through word-cloud tool we were also able to highlight what language Putin used in relation to queer community. That highlighted intesifying homophobic rhethoric.

Netherlands,"OCCRP, Times of Malta,The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, The Boston Globe",Big,,,The Steward Files,2024-06-17,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Corruption, Health, Crime, Economy","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Bbased on a trove of 300,000 internal documents from Steward Health Care, this cross-border investigation exposes how private equity and real estate investment trusts (REITs) drained billions from one of the largest U.S. hospital chains, pushing it into financial collapse. Through leaked documents, financial analysis, and insider interviews, our reporting reveals the systemic flaws that allowed executives and investors to profit at the expense of patient care and public health. This project provides  insight into corporate greed in the health care sector, influencing policymakers and regulators while informing the public about the dangers of private equity in healthcare","A massive leak of internal documents obtained by OCCRP revealed how executives and investors drained billions. Sharing this data with the Boston Globe enabled deeper reporting on Steward’s impact on healthcare systems locally.  In January, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to ban hospital sale-leaseback agreements with REITs,  recognizing, that a key factor in Steward’s decline had been the sale-leaseback deal it had struck with its landlord, the REIT Medical Properties Trust. The new law also fines hospital systems that conceal financial data, limits exploitative real estate deals, and increases regulatory oversight. In pushing for reform, lawmakers had cited the Globe’s reporting and used victims’ stories to highlight concerns.  In Louisiana, a state representative praised OCCRP for exposing wrongdoing.  The series also uncovered Steward’s expansion into Malta, where it took over three public hospitals and engaged in  questionable practices, including hiring intelligence firms to target critics. Steward executives approved payments of up to $170,000/month to these firms while hospitals struggled to afford medical supplies. The Malta hospital deal was later annulled, leading to the country’s largest-ever corruption scandal and bribery charges against multiple officials. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice is investigating potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.","This investigation involved navigating significant legal, financial, and access challenges. Steward Health Care’s opaque corporate structure and aggressive financial tactics made it difficult to track money flows and ownership changes. While leaked internal documents provided crucial insights, verifying their authenticity, cross-referencing them with public records, and mapping them onto real-life events required extensive financial expertise.  The political landscape added complexity. Private equity-backed hospital ownership has powerful defenders in Washington, and health care financing is a politically sensitive topic. Legal threats loomed over our reporting, as stakeholders sought to suppress findings that exposed misconduct.  Accessing hospital staff and affected patients proved difficult due to fears of retaliation. Despite these barriers, OCCRP employed innovative investigative techniques and data-driven analysis to piece together the full story, highlighting the urgent need for greater transparency and accountability in health care finance. A breakthrough came from a whistleblower who provided invaluable insight into Steward’s practices. However, it took 12 weeks for the whistleblower to share data with OCCRP. During this time, OCCRP facilitated pro-bono legal support, verified the lawful possession of the leak, and helped the whistleblower relocate due to intensive surveillance funded by Steward Health Care. OCCRP staff and other journalists also faced physical surveillance.","This investigation relied on a combination of advanced financial forensics, data visualization, and traditional investigative reporting. We analyzed a massive leak of internal documents using structured databases and forensic accounting techniques to track financial flows and identify patterns of misconduct. Public records, SEC filings, and bankruptcy documents were scraped and cross-referenced with internal data to construct a comprehensive picture of Steward’s financial maneuvers, as well as those of their business partners. We used data visualization tools to create interactive graphics that illustrate Steward’s financial collapse, allowing readers to explore the impact of private equity and REIT ownership on hospitals.","The Steward Files demonstrates the power of data-driven investigative journalism in exposing financial malfeasance. It shows the importance of combining financial expertise with traditional reporting techniques to uncover hidden abuses in complex corporate structures. Journalists investigating private equity, REITs, or similar financial schemes can benefit from using forensic accounting methods and leveraging leaks to piece together a comprehensive narrative. This project underscores the need for collaboration, given the huge scope of the dataset involved. We worked with financial analysts, legal experts, and affected communities to ensure accuracy and impact. Partnering with specialists and local journalists can enhance investigative depth and reach.

Using data from the Brazilian Electoral Court and the Environmental Convergence Index (ICAt), it highlights how most elected officials are not aligned with pro-environmental policies. The project reveals discrepancies between mayors and local councils, with many councils opposing environmental initiatives, providing valuable insights into the challenges of implementing sustainable policies in the Amazon and emphasizing the need for stronger alignment between local leadership and environmental agendas.","The project was specifically crafted to provide an exclusive analysis to voters during the 2024 municipal elections, focusing on the environmental positions of elected officials in the Amazon region. Its timely release garnered significant attention, particularly in major national media, and sparked widespread discussion. The report was cited by prominent columnists, including those at Folha de S.Paulo, one of Brazil’s largest newspapers, [where it was mentioned recently](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/opiniao/2025/02/na-amazonia-adaptacao-climatica-pode-ser-a-virada-de-chave.shtml).

The project’s clear, data-driven analysis of the candidates’ environmental stances served as an essential resource for voters, informing their decisions and encouraging them to consider the long-term ecological implications of their choices.  Being featured in the Data Wrapper Blog (Data Vis Dispatch) also underscored the project’s contribution to the field of data journalism. By combining rigorous data analysis with engaging visuals, the report set a standard for how data can be used to enhance public understanding of crucial societal issues, especially those as critical as environmental policy in the Amazon.","The primary challenge of the project was transforming complex, scientific data into a visually compelling and easily accessible story for the public. The project was driven largely by publicly available electoral data, requiring creative use of data visualization to allow the numbers to ”speak for themselves.” The goal was to present the information in a way that resonated with voters, making it not only informative but engaging and easy to understand.  Converting dense, technical information into clear, actionable insights was essential, ensuring that the analysis would be comprehensible to a wide audience, regardless of their level of familiarity with environmental or political issues. The project’s success lay in its ability to take abstract data and translate it into a narrative that highlighted the importance of environmental stances in local elections, ultimately empowering voters to make informed decisions. The innovative use of data storytelling helped bridge the gap between scientific research and public understanding, making complex environmental topics more tangible for those who are directly impacted by these issues.","We used R for data wrangling, combining datasets, and creating initial visualizations. For interactive maps, we used Flourish to make the data more engaging. Additionally, we relied on Git and GitHub for version control, as well as for sharing data and code, ensuring transparency and collaboration throughout the project.","This project demonstrates how journalists can turn complex data into clear, accessible stories that drive decision-making and engage the audience.

We used AI to analyze over 3,000 pages of funding documents in a short period, examining the government’s approved and allocated funds for flood victims in Rivers State, Nigeria.  Additionally, we used AI to fact-check these documents, analyze findings, verify AI-generated results, and create a data visualization of verified documents. We also used satellite images to show how remote the village is, exposing the government’s failure to provide support.","Yes, the investigation had an impact, not just on the public but also on journalists and newsrooms interested in how a small and growing newsroom like ours used AI to analyze over 3,000 pages of documents.

See link to the exclusive interview with Reuters: https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/how-small-nigerian-newsroom-used-ai-flooding-investigation  The story also helped the Nigerian public, especially the affected community, understand the level of funding the government had approved for flood victims, including their own village. They were excited that someone was finally telling their story, as their community is one of the most remote in Nigeria. Our presence made them feel seen and valued.  Additionally, after we contacted the spokesperson of the National Emergency Management Agency in the Federal Capital Territory to discuss our findings, we noticed that just a few days later—before our story was even published—the agency visited the community headquarters to distribute relief materials to farmers.

Our activities are funded solely by our founder, Elfredah Kevin-Alerechi, through stipends earned from freelance investigative reporting.  Like other investigations, I personally funded this one due to the ongoing cries and complaints from the people of Arukwo Village, a remote community in Rivers State, Nigeria. We began this investigation in February 2024 but could only publish it in November 2024 due to a lack of funds for travel and on-the-ground reporting. We visited twice—first before the flood, after receiving calls about the challenges, especially those faced by farmers, and again in October after the flood hit to gather more information from affected residents.  With support from our tech department, JournoTECH, we used AI to analyze over 3,000 pages of documents in a short time. We relied on ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot to identify funding sources, download documents, analyze and fact-check them, and create data visualizations. This AI-powered process significantly helped our newsroom analyze and publish our story within a short period.","We used Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot, and Google Earth. Our goal was to obtain a historical view of the village before the flood, specifically from before 2019 and in 2024, using Google Earth. Unfortunately, Google Earth had not captured the village during that period. We then tried using the Sentinel EO Browser, but cloud cover obscured the village, preventing us from accessing historical images. As a result, we relied on satellite imagery to show the village’s size and how remote it is.   Additionally, we used the Nigerian government’s National Humanitarian Development Peace Framework (2021-2025), the Rivers State government budget (2022-2024), and a disaster management document from the National Emergency Management Agency.","Journalists can learn that AI technology has multiple uses beyond research. When we published our investigation and shared it on the GIJN Africa WhatsApp group, a colleague asked how we used AI to fact-check AI-generated results. Similar questions arose in a Slack channel with journalists from different countries. After explaining the process, I received many likes and emails from journalists filling out the JournoTECH form, requesting training on analyzing large documents with AI.  Another key lesson is patience and attention to detail when using AI for document analysis. Despite successfully using AI in our investigation, we faced challenges. For instance, one large document was saved as a JPG but scanned into a PDF, making it difficult to analyze with ChatGPT. It estimated over 48 hours to process the document, and even now, it remains unanalyzed. However, Gemini completed the task in less than five minutes.  This experience proves that no single AI tool provides the best results. A combination of multiple AI technologies improves accuracy, enhances efficiency, and saves time. Journalists should explore various AI tools to optimize their work and overcome technical limitations.",English,https://thecolonistreport.com/Africa/sinking-homes-and-farmlands-climate-crisis-worsens-in-nigeria/,,,,Elfredah Kevin-Alerechi Faith Imbu Kevin Woke,"Elfredah Kevin-Alerechi is an investigative journalist and the founder and managing editor of The Colonist Report UK and Africa.

Russian Federation,Important Stories («Важные истории»),Small,,,Counting Soldiers: Exposing the Real Numbers Behind Russia’s Military Recruitment,2024-08-01,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Breaking news, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Map","Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Flourish","In 2023, Russia launched a campaign to recruit contract soldiers to keep sending people to war in Ukraine. In our data investigation, More Soldiers at All Costs, we proved that Russian authorities misrepresent its success: the actual number of recruits is almost two times lower than claimed. Our project introduces an innovative way to estimate the real number of contract soldiers by analyzing budget data on one-time payments for signing a military contract. This method offers a more accurate picture of recruitment efforts, challenging official narratives and revealing the true scale of Russia’s attempt to replenish its military forces.","Our investigation, More Soldiers at All Costs, was widely popular with audience. It ranked among the top three most-read stories on the Important Stories website in 2024.  We are especially proud that our approach has inspired other researchers in Russia and beyond to replicate our methodology in their own analyses. This includes both journalists and academics. For example, Meduza, the largest independent Russian media outlet, applied our methodology in its own [investigation](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/12/04/even-after-doubling-its-sign-on-bonus-payment-the-russian-army-s-recruitment-rate-is-falling-losses-may-now-outpace-new-enlistments), citing us as the original source.  Additionally, economist Dr. Janis Kluge from the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) reconstructed our methodology in his [research note](https://janiskluge.substack.com/p/russia-recruited-166000-new-soldiers), crediting us for providing a detailed explanation in the ”How We Counted” section to enable replication.  By making our methodology transparent, we not only confirmed the unreliability of official figures but also helped establish a framework for further research on Russian military recruitment trends.","Information about the Russian armed forces involved in the war against Ukraine is one of the most classified topics in Russia today. This secrecy covers not only military losses but even the number of deployed troops. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, military censorship has been enforced through the so-called ”fake news law,” which bans journalists from publishing any information about the armed forces unless it comes from official sources—essentially, only the Ministry of Defense.  As independent journalists working in exile, we are not subject to this censorship, making it especially important for us to focus on uncovering information about the Russian armed forces—their size, structure, and recruitment. With this investigation, we have shown that the figures provided by the Ministry of Defense are unreliable and that the actual recruitment of new contract soldiers is significantly lower than officially claimed.  Our investigation was conducted amid worsening government transparency in Russia. For example, after the full-scale invasion began, authorities restricted access to data on disabled veterans, preventing journalists from estimating the number of wounded soldiers. In this environment, Russian journalists must develop innovative ways to obtain information—such as our analysis of recruitment levels based on budget data.","To estimate the number of contract soldiers recruited into the Russian army, we divided the total federal budget expenditures allocated for one-time enlistment payments by the fixed amount of this payment. We applied the same method to Russian regions, dividing regional budget expenditures by the one-time payment amount, which each region sets independently. The most challenging task was identifying which specific budget items in the federal and regional budgets were allocated for contract soldiers. Their names are often vague and not always obvious, so we meticulously studied Ministry of Finance orders to find the necessary information.  The budget expenditure data was available in a machine-readable format. For analysis, we used Excel and Python, employing regular expressions to automatically filter military-related payments from thousands of other budget expenses. We outlined all the details of our calculations in a dedicated section “Explaining Our Calculations”.  Visualizations illustrating the true scale of contract recruitment and regional differences were created using Flourish.","We believe our project can teach journalists to take a fresh approach to government budget data—often the most accessible information in many countries. Budget reports are typically used to track spending, but we showed that they can also reveal the number of people benefiting from state programs—in our case, Russian contract soldiers.  This method is especially valuable when governments restrict access to crucial data. Even when direct figures are hidden, journalists can extract insights by analyzing budget data in creative ways. Investigative journalism isn’t just about leaks or anonymous sources; sometimes, the most compelling evidence is hidden in plain sight.  We hope this project encourages journalists not to give up when authorities try to obscure the truth. There are always alternative ways to fact-check government claims, uncover hidden patterns, and provide the public with accurate, evidence-based reporting—no matter how much those in power try to control the narrative.  One of the most inspiring outcomes of our work was seeing other journalists and analysts reproduce our methodology after our investigation was published. This underscores the importance of openly sharing research methods, as transparency not only strengthens credibility but also enables others to build on findings, amplifying the impact of investigative work.","English, Russian",https://istories.media/en/stories/2024/08/01/more-soldiers-at-all-costs/,https://istories.media/en/news/2024/09/09/contract-soldier-recruitment-in-2024/,https://istories.media/en/news/2024/10/04/new-contractors-plan/,https://istories.media/en/news/2024/12/16/belousov-contractors-overstated/,"Sonya Savina (role: author), Katya Bonch-Osmolovskaya (role: author), ”Conflict Intelligence Team” (role: expert assessment; the team members wished to remain anonymous)",**Sonya Savina** is a data journalist with eight years of experience.

Scientific analysis of water samples from three communities examined 27 variables to identify pollution sources. We also uncovered a business link between a Kano tannery and a UK company using UK Companies House records. Findings show that Unique Leather Finishing Company Ltd., linked to a British firm, operates in Sharada industrial area, discharging waste into drainage systems that feed into local rivers, impacting residents and agriculture.","For more than five years, the tannery industrial areas in Kano, Nigeria, have emitted a persistent foul odor, causing discomfort for residents living near the tannery companies. While a few local media outlets in Kano have reported on the smell, their coverage has remained superficial, without an in-depth investigation into its root cause.  Our investigation went beyond speculation to uncover the true source of the odor. As a result, local residents and the government now have a clear understanding of what is causing the smell. The government is also working on plans to mitigate the issue and reduce the odor in Kano.","This nine-month investigation into Kano’s tannery industry revealed that ammonium causes persistent foul smells, while high copper levels affect sugarcane sweetness.

Findings show that Unique Leather Finishing Company Ltd., linked to a British firm, operates in Sharada industrial area, discharging waste into drainage systems that feed into local rivers, impacting residents and agriculture.  Due to the nature of the investigation and to avoid attack, our on the ground reporter had to use a pseudo name for this investigation to avoid attack and or sack from his organisation.  We found this investigation important because The Colonist Report Africa is a small but growing newsroom with no external funding from either large or small media organizations. Despite this, we were able to uncover the true cause of the persistent foul smell and the reason why sugarcane has been unsweetened, as frequently complained about by farmers.","We used documents from the UK’s Companies House to identify and understand the connection between the UK company and the Nigerian company, Unique Leather Finishing Company Ltd. Additionally, we consulted Nigeria’s Corporate Affairs Commission to assess the operational status of Unique Leather Finishing Company Ltd.   We then conducted scientific analysis to determine the cause of the persistent foul smell in Kano, which had not been previously revealed.  As a small and growing newsroom, we faced challenges in conducting the scientific analysis due to the high costs involved. However, recognizing the importance of uncovering solutions rather than reporting without verified facts, we chose to wait until we could secure funding to support the scientific analysis. This enabled us to reveal the scientific cause behind the odors.","Other journalists can learn several important lessons from this investigation. It shows that even a small newsroom without external funding can uncover hidden truths through persistence and resourcefulness. While many media reports on pollution remained surface-level, this investigation went deeper, using scientific analysis to verify the cause of the foul smell and the impact on sugarcane farming. By collecting and testing water samples independently, the team avoided biased results and ensured credibility.  This project also highlights the importance of cross-border investigations. By tracing a tannery’s business links to a UK-based company through official records, the team demonstrated how financial and corporate transparency tools can help expose accountability. Engaging with local communities and listening to residents’ concerns made the story more impactful, turning a long-standing complaint into a well-documented investigative report.  Despite facing challenges, including high lab costs and government silence, the team remained committed to finding answers. Publishing the findings with other media outlets amplified the story, leading to public awareness and government action. This investigation proves that journalism is not just about reporting events but also about driving change, holding corporations and governments accountable, and giving a voice to affected communities.",English,https://thecolonistreport.com/Africa/excessive-ammonium-in-drains-rivers-causes-foul-smells-plaguing-northern-nigeria/,,,,Elfredah Kevin-Alerechi and Mustapha Muhammad,"Elfredah Kevin-Alerechi is an investigative journalist and the founder and managing editor of The Colonist Report UK and Africa.

Sex workers who respond to these advertisements run a high risk of becoming victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation.  Over the past year, Pointer conducted research into human trafficking and sexual exploitation of Eastern European sex workers together with an international group of investigative journalists from, amongst others, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary and Romania.  We have collected almost 45,000 advertisements on 33 different websites in which sex workers are recruited to come from Eastern to Western Europe.","Groenlinks-PvdA MP Mikal Tseggai pleaded with the State Secretary for Justice and Security for a stricter approach to human trafficking, including the establishment of a national police team for human trafficking and more European cooperation. ‘We want to know from the State Secretary what steps he is taking together with his European colleagues to put an end to these practices.’ In his response, the State Secretary confirmed that we have a poor picture of the scale of the problem.  In the slipstream of this investigation, we discovered that the Netherlands is increasingly dropping out of the international investigation of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. And in the meantime, the number of victims that come to the attention of investigative authorities is decreasing. National Reporter on Human Trafficking Conny Rijken fears that the Netherlands is losing its grip on human trafficking and its view of victims. ”If we continue to focus only on what happens in the Netherlands and do not look beyond the national borders, we will not get a picture of the criminal networks.  Then we will have a limited view of human trafficking and that is worrying.”","A few years ago we spoke to Danish journalist Anne Skjerning from the public broadcaster DK. She made a podcast series and an extensive article about Det Brændte Bordel (The Burning Brothel). In it she discovered that a murdered prostitute had ended up in Denmark via Poland via an online recruitment advertisement. This person was exploited by her pimp and then left dead in the brothel that was set on fire.  That was an important insight for us: apparently online advertisements are placed to lure sex workers abroad. And these sex workers may then become victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. However, they themselves are not quick to report this, for fear of reprisals. It is therefore very important that investigative services find the perpetrators.","See the full methodology here: https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/hoe-onderzoek-je-45-duizend-advertenties-van-mogelijke-mensenhandel In the human trafficking hotspots Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary and Bulgaria, we found 33 websites where sex workers are recruited to go abroad. We collected 45 thousand advertisements on these sites via scrapers.  First, we converted the telephone numbers to a uniform format so that we could, among other things, find out the country you are calling. For this we used the dialr package in the statistical software R. We also translated the advertisement texts into English using the Python library Googletrans.  We did not examine the advertisements of private clubs, brothels or individuals, but those of so-called agencies. These are intermediaries who promise to arrange everything for the sex worker: paperwork, travel, accommodation, clients. The risk of exploitation is high with these agencies. In total, we were able to identify 104 of these intermediaries.  Other methods and tools: •Maltego: to analyze certain networks and use automated OSINT. •OSINT.industries: to link phone numbers and email addresses to social media accounts. •Holehe: an automated script to find social media accounts that are linked to contact details. •Midjourney: to create AI-generated photos.

No entanto, o desmatamento ilegal em terras indígenas continuou aumentando. A reportagem mostra os novos caminhos encontrados por criminosos para lavar o ouro ilegal extraído de Terras Indígenas da Amazônia.

Na prática, a lei transformou o Brasil em um grande lavador de ouro ilegal. Por isso ficaram comuns operações da Polícia Federal apreendendo ouro ilegal sendo transportado de países vizinhos como Venezuela e Suriname para o Brasil. Em 2023, o Supremo Tribunal Federal derrubou o artigo que previa a regra da boa-fé, e, de acordo com a análise exclusiva da Repórter Brasil, isso reduziu em mais de 70% a produção declarada de ouro no país nos meses seguintes. Essa redução é ainda mais curiosa se considerarmos que o ouro bateu recorde histórico de valor em 2024. Ou seja, a tendência deveria ser de aumento de produção. A queda da produção declarada do minério acendeu um alerta em autoridades sobre o real volume de ouro ilegal que era lavado no Brasil com base na lei da boa-fé. Além disso, com imagens de satélite, a Repórter Brasil comprovou que, apesar da queda de produção informada de ouro, o desmatamento por mineração em áreas protegidas continuou crescendo na Amazônia.","Com o SQL DB Browser, analisamos dezenas de milhares de dados de declaração de produção de ouro no Brasil, através do imposto por compensação financeira de mineração (CFEM) entre janeiro de 2023 e abril de 2024.

It’s not just obscure podcasts with limited reach: a third of the podcasts we found have been on Dutch podcast charts in recent years. Some are presented by Dutch celebrities, such as Wierd Duk, Giel Beelen and Marlies Dekkers.","Obviously, we cannot listen to all podcasts to assess what is said there. Therefore, we first used the supercomputer Snellius of SURF (the association of Dutch educational and research institutions in the field of information and communication technology) and the transcription software Whispercpp and Whisperx to convert the audio of 150,000 episodes to written text, including time codes. On an average laptop, this could take months to years (depending on the software chosen).  We then analyzed the texts for terms commonly used in the dissemination of misinformation and conspiracy theories. That initial search yielded 7,500 fragments. After that, technology couldn’t help us any further; we had to go through the fragments manually. Because context matters. Just because a term is used does not mean that misinformation or a conspiracy theory is being spread. It can also be contradicted or reported in a news report, for example. In those cases, we did not count the episodes.   As soon as we found misinformation in at least three individual episodes of the same podcast series, we counted them.  Thus, we arrived at 30 Dutch-language podcasts that structurally spread medical misinformation and conspiracy theories.","To listen to all the Dutch-language podcasts from 2023, it would take about 9 years. By applying the transcription software Whispercpp and Whisperx to podcasts, especially in combination with a supercomputer, it is possible to transcribe large amounts of audio. Only in this way could we transcribe all Dutch-language podcasts from an entire year. This produces a searchable file that we have now searched for a limited number of terms but which can, of course, be analyzed for many more.",Dutch,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/kinderbloed-drinken-hiv-vaccins-misinformatie-op-spotify,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/zo-hebben-we-misinformatie-ontdekt-in-150000-podcasts,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/hoe-we-een-supercomputer-alle-nederlandse-podcasts-hebben-laten-luisteren-en-opschrijven,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/omvolking-complotten-en-medisch-advies-30-nederlandstalige-podcasts-verspreiden-structureel,"Jerry Vermanen, Joris Heijkant","Jerry Vermanen is an investigative journalist at Pointer (KRO-NCRV), Joris Heijkant is a freelance investigative journalist and developer."

Através de uma análise textual detalhada, o trabalho revela que quase 10% do programa era dedicado às áreas de ambiente e transição energética. A comparação com programas anteriores destaca tendências e prioridades políticas ao longo do tempo.","O projecto destacou uma perspectiva pouco esperada da importância dada no programa do Governo relativamente às questões ambientais e da transição energética – algo mais comummente apontado a governos de esquerda. Embora a percentagem de texto não seja equivalente à prioridade do tema na governação de um executivo, permitiu analisar as intenções e ideias de um novo governo a partir de um ponto de vista diferente – conhecer uma outra face.","O trabalho foi pensado em vésperas da apresentação do programa de Governo, o primeiro social-democrata em quase uma década. Apesar de os partidos concorrerem às eleições com um programa eleitoral que serve de base para um eventual programa de governo, havia expectativa para perceber de que forma o documento que regeria a governação do novo executivo iria diferenciar-se dos anteriores governos.","De forma a calcular a percentagem de texto dedicada a cada categoria, foi utilizada uma metodologia que já tinha sido aplicada na análise dos programas eleitorais. Recorreu-se à base de dados Manifesto Corpus, que serviu para treinar o grande modelo de linguagem (LLM) RoBERTa para classificar textos políticos em 56 categorias diferentes. Ainda que o modelo tenha sido treinado em manifestos eleitorais e não programas de Governo, consideramos que o conhecimento político deste algoritmo seria suficiente para atribuir uma das 56 categorias ao texto. Como o algoritmo devolvia uma probabilidade (de zero a um) de categoria para cada frase, optou-se maior probabilidade de cada categoia, excluindo-se todas as frases a abaixo de 0,5. Depois desse processo, procedeu-se a uma organização destas frases em 15 categorias maiores, novamente com auxílio supervisionado da tecnologia da OpenAi. A agregação foi feita duas vezes, garantindo que não havia categorias repetidas ou redundantes. Em temos de análise textual, considerou-se o corpus completo de cada programa de Governo, que tinha anteriormente extraído de ficheiros pdf. Procedeu-se a uma limpeza, ainda que não muito aprofundada, do texto extraído, nomeadamente cabeçalhos e rodapés. Também não foi tido em consideração na análise o texto presente no índice.","Este trabalho é mais uma demonstração de como as ferramentas de inteligência artificial podem ser um auxiliar muito enriquecedor do trabalho jornalístico.

We wanted to know to what extent this problem impacts women’s daily lives, how women adapt their behavior, and how it limits women’s freedom and use of public space. We collected stories and incident locations from nearly 10,000 women and girls. The goal of visualizing this massive number of personal testimonies was both to show women they are not alone, and for men and (local) lawmakers to recognize a problem they often are unaware of.","Since our first publication, politicians have been urging both national and regional government to make our public environment safer for women. Multiple municipalities have requested anonymized versions of our data in order to inform their approach to public spaces.

For many women the digital map – completely filled with dots from other women with similar experiences to their own – has helped them in discussions with male friends about the reality of their assaults or their safety concerns. There have also been parliamentary calls for a commissioner for gender-based violence.   The investigation garnered nearly 45,000 online readers and 370,000 tv viewers through Pointer’s channels.","Due to personal circumstances, not as many extensive publications were possible last year as had been planned.

A viagem ocorreu em setembro de 2023, no início do que se tornou a pior seca do rio Negro em 121 anos, em decorrência da combinação dos fenômenos El Niño e do aquecimento do Atlântico Tropical Norte.","Dar visibilidade a essa iniciativa científica é uma forma de conscientizar a população e reforçar a necessidade de políticas públicas no que diz respeito à conservação dos rios da Bacia Amazônica e, consequentemente, garantir a existência de povos indígenas, comunidades tradicionais e populações ribeirinhas que dependem da qualidade deles para seu cotidiano – seus modos de vida alinhados com a conservação da Amazônia são condição essencial para proteger a floresta e, assim, ajudar a frear as mudanças climáticas.   Ao mesmo tempo em que proporciona uma imersão na expedição, a reportagem mostra ao leitor como a sociedade pode utilizar o IQA para entender a condição dos rios que permeiam suas vidas. Com dados científicos em mãos, disponibilizados publicamente, o cidadão pode cobrar ações dos tomadores de decisão diante dos problemas identificados pelo índice e pelo histórico – sejam eles crônicos, como acontece nas bacias poluídas e pressionadas de Manaus, a capital do estado do Amazonas, ou em rios como o Negro que, apesar do alto nível de conservação, ainda carece de infraestrutura relacionada ao tratamento de esgoto e água potável nas cidades, vilas e comunidades ribeirinhas.","Os dados expostos na reportagem partem das coletas de água realizadas pela equipe de cientistas da Universidade do Estado do Amazonas (UEA) e da Universidade de Harvard, obtidos com exclusividade pela Ambiental Media. A reportagem traz especificamente os dados da UEA, para focar no desenvolvimento do primeiro Índice de Qualidade das Águas (IQA) para a Bacia Amazônica. Durante a expedição pelo rio Negro, o repórter Kevin Damasio e o fotógrafo Bruno Kelly acompanharam as coletas nas voadeiras em 50 pontos do rio, separados de 14 em 14 quilômetros, entre Manaus e Santa Isabel do Rio Negro, no Amazonas. Os cientistas coletaram amostras de água para analisar cerca de 160 parâmetros de qualidade, além de registrar as localizações exatas das coletas, para realizarem o monitoramento nas campanhas seguintes. A reportagem acompanhou também o processamento dessas amostras nos laboratórios do barco. Os jornalistas registraram todo esse processo científico, com observações que compuseram a narrativa da reportagem.","Após a expedição, pesquisadores tabularam os dados, analisaram os resultados e definiram os nove parâmetros que compuseram o primeiro IQA para rios de águas pretas da Amazônia. O repórter recebeu esta tabela, acrescentou observações de campo e extraiu dados para compor o texto da reportagem, com a preocupação de tornar informações técnicas e científicas palatáveis ao público.   Transferimos as informações em formato tabular para um formato geoespacial, para processamento e visualização em softwares GIS, e partimos para o desenvolvimento de mapas, gráficos e diagramas iniciais. Optamos por iniciar o material com um grande mapa do rio Negro que inserisse o leitor na história e servisse como um fio condutor para a introdução do material. Plotamos em um mapa os resultados do IQA, que foram utilizados em algumas das peças gráficas do projeto, e identificamos também informações acessórias que poderiam fornecer contextos importantes para a compreensão da problemática tratada, como, por exemplo, o mapa da Bacia Amazônica e o diagrama explicando como é feito o IQA.

Nigeria,HumAngle  TheCable  Vision FM,Small,,,The Forest Exploits of Nigeria’s Blood-Thirsty Terrorists,2024-12-31,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration","Scraping, QGIS, Canvas, PostGIS, OpenStreetMap","This months-long investigation combines on-site reporting with massive open-source data exploration to expose the forest exploits of Nigeria’s brutal terrorists. The report highlights how government abandonment has made forests rich in a haven for terrorists.  The story focuses on the Alawa, Kainji, and Kamuku forests, which are notorious for sheltering terrorists, with local communities suffering significant impacts, including abductions and environmental degradation. The report reveals that efforts to restore forest security are hampered by ineffective surveillance and corruption. It also shows the dire situation in Nigeria’s forests, where terrorists commit crimes such as kidnapping, forced marriages, and illegal logging.","The impact of this investigation was felt almost immediately after publication. After terrorists took control, the Kainji and the Kamuku forests were shut down in 2021 due to insecurity. But certain elements in the National Service, the government agency managing Nigeria’s forests, continued to rake millions in the name of protecting the forests’ biodiversity.  For months,  we contacted Nigeria’s National Park Service to explain why millions were allocated to manage the forests despite being shut down, but there was no response. A few hours after publishing this story on December 31, 2024, the agency reached out to HumAngle, claiming projects were being executed in forests under the total control of terrorists, a claim found to be untrue.  The investigation, however, opened the watchful eyes of other Nigerian journalists, leading many of them to probe the accountability deficits in the management of Nigeria’s forest reserves.  We told this story in a multi-platform fashion. Working with local journalists at Vission FM, we engaged locals in Sokoto and Niger states in live sessions, with many of them charging the government to secure the forests.  Through the live radio sessions, we reached over 500, 000 audiences in Sokoto, Kaduna and Niger states.","For on the ground reporting, we faced security challenges in many of the locations we visited, especially in Niger state, but we were able to blend with locals in the communities to conduct interviews discreetly. Most of the interviews we conducted directly matched our GIS/ open-source investigations.  Also, we experienced deterrence from authorities who thought our reporting could expose their lack of accountability. In places like Kaduna state, where insecurity is even more tense, we worked with local vigilantes who took us to rangers and other forest guards who confirm the collusion of terrorists with some locals to deplete the forest.","As mentioned above, this investigation combines on-site reporting and massive open-source data. It is a data-driven story that deployed the use of geographical information system (GIS) tools to analyse cover losses in Kainji, Kamuku and Allawa forests dominated by terrorists in Nigeria. We obtained stallite photos revealing the massive illegal logging spree in Kainji, for instance, and matched these findings with on-site reporting and human intelligence.  Interestingly, data analyses corroborate our fielding reporting on many occasions. Due to the diverse nature of the forests, we deployed various sets of tools and techniques to uncover the activities of terrorists directly causing massive cover losses. Some of the tools include archival satellite images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor data, field coordinate data and other open-source intelligence tools.  Although we faced the challenge of the absence of high-resolution conventional satellite imagery of the Allawa forest, we used information from multiple sources, including press reports and witness statements, to corroborate our hypotheses.   We also used Govspend, a digital public good and open-source platform, to track the spendings of the National Park Service, exposing the accountability gaps in the execution of projects, amid shutdown of forest reserves in Kaduna, Niger and Zamfara states.","Apart from match massive open and closed data analyses with on-site reporting, one thing I think other journalists can learn from this work is how we engaged different audiences. We targeted policy makers with our texts, which works by getting the attention of the National Park Service after months of ignoring our letters and calls.  We also used the radio platform to break down the data-driven story for locals. Thousands of local listeners were reached through the radio in their local Hausa language. Journalists must learn -- from this work -- that it is not enough to put data together to form a story, it must be broken down to local audiences as down in this report.",English,https://humanglemedia.com/the-forest-exploits-of-nigerias-blood-thirsty-terrorists/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z_N36hUzT4qbrGb61pzcrxIJ4BlQF3gQ/view?usp=sharing,,,Ibrahim Adeyemi is the reporter for this project.,"Investigations Editor at HumAngle.

United States of America,Bloomberg,Big,,,Clandestine Oil Shipping Hub,2024-11-19,"Investigation, Database, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Satellite images",AI/Machine learning,"Officially, China doesn’t import Iranian oil. In reality, it’s Iran’s biggest buyer. An explosion off the coast of Malaysia brought that phenomenon into the spotlight. The tanker was part of a “dark fleet” moving sanctioned oil worldwide. Bloomberg reporters uncovered signs of a growing secret oil hub and ultimately exposed and quantified the world’s largest dark ship fleet.","After this story ran, Singapore issued a directive reminding shipowners, managers and masters about their responsibilities to adhere to pollution requirements and to notify the authorities of any mid-ocean ship to ship oil transfers, and a Malaysian politician said they would be raising questions about the trade in parliament. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control also expanded its sanctions on ships that haul Iranian oil.","The project combined shoe-leather local reporting with innovative data analysis. As Bloomberg Singapore oil reporters tracked the slow salvage of the Pablo, the exploded tanker, they started to detect signs that a major clandestine oil hub was forming in local waters. They noticed more ships gathering in a tight offshore cluster, and a manual inspection of open-source satellite imagery showed many sitting side-by-side: a distinct formation indicative of ship-to-ship transfers at sea. But to establish scale, quantifiable data was necessary.  The data journalists built a database of over five-years of satellite imagery and developed a custom machine learning algorithm to recognize when ships were arranged in the side-by-side formation indicative of an oil transfer. All these leads could then be manually investigated.  After months of painstaking work, Bloomberg reporters were able to confidently estimate that crude worth more than $20 billion changed hands in this expanding hotspot in the first nine months of 2024 alone. Reporting trips to China, Malaysia and Singapore also helped establish how the operators were exploiting maritime regulations that restrict enforcement outside territorial waters and why neighboring countries were reluctant to intervene.","We utilized open source satellite imagery from the European Space Agency across the frequency spectrum, including optical, infrared, shortwave (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar imagery (Sentinel-1) to identify and tally ship-to-ship transfers of oil.   To detect ships positioned side by side in satellite images, we developed custom remote sensing and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms were trained on manually labeled examples from the region, accounting for variations in ship color, shape, and size, as well as seasonal changes in water conditions, ship traffic, and cloud cover. We validated the trained models by comparing them to remote sensing methods that analyze ships’ reflective properties across the electromagnetic spectrum.  To scale the analysis across a large area and time frame, we deployed the algorithms on Google Earth Engine, a cloud-based geospatial data processing platform.","This project is a great example of how innovative technology and solid on-the-ground reporting inform each other and uncover the story. It all started with a local reporter’s hunch. From there, the team used satellite images, wrote algorithms, built datasets, and visualized trends to uncover hidden shipping routes. The satellite imagery analysis even pinpointed key locations, guiding local reporters to conduct on-the-ground investigations. Each discovery led to the next: a reporting trip based on data, ship tracking using AIS data, and real-world verification. This cycle of technology-driven investigation and traditional reporting was key to revealing the truth. The project also demonstrated the power of visual investigations. By creatively using open-source satellite data, the team built its own evidence—proof that would have been impossible to obtain otherwise.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-iran-south-china-sea-oil-trade/,,,,Serene Cheong Clara Ferreira Marques Weilun Soon Krishna Karra Yasufumi Saito,Serene Cheong: reporter Clara Ferreira Marques: reporter Weilun Soon: reporter Krishna Karra: remote sensing analysis reporter Yasufumi Saito: data visualization reporter

Congress had conceived H-1Bs as a main pathway for American businesses to hire the world’s top talent for roles requiring special skills in short supply in the US workforce. Bloomberg revealed how large outsourcing and smaller staffing companies exploited flaws in the visa system to land thousands of H-1Bs for workers with less-remarkable resumes while other US businesses, American workers and talented immigrants lost out.","These stories were among the most widely read on bloomberg.com. Indian news outlets quickly picked up Bloomberg’s story about gaming of the H-1B lottery, forcing an Indian politician at the center of the fraud to face widespread scrutiny back home.   A report published by US immigration authorities in 2023 had described a scheme where 13 related companies exploited the visa lottery by entering each worker’s name multiple times. The government report didn’t name the companies, but by matching the report’s details to the data, Bloomberg reporters were able to link them all to an Indian politician.   The nation’s skilled-worker visa system has been overshadowed in Washington by fights over illegal immigration and border security. Our series for the first time exposed the systematic unfairness and abuse in the US high-skill visa program and generated broad interest among researchers and advocacy groups (an accompanying twitter thread received 1.9 million views and was reposted over 2,300 times).    Less than a week after our last story was published, the Biden Administration finalized a sweeping overhaul of the H-1B visa system, including provisions that strengthen enforcement. The rules had been languishing for more than a year.","Bloomberg News set out on an ambitious FOIA effort to obtain information that the government had refused to release to the public: The full database of H-1B petitions and other data that would provide insight into the US employment-visa system. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, an arm of the Department of Homeland Security, regularly releases some H-1B data on a public portal. But the information is threadbare, making it difficult to track who benefits the most from the program or even how many H-1Bs are approved each year.   After seven of our Freedom of Information Act requests for the underlying data were ignored, Bloomberg News sued the DHS under the FOIA statutes. Before doing so, reporters mastered the regulatory landscape, allowing them to know exactly what information was contained in the H-1B petitions and other datasets. Reporters also developed sources with deep knowledge of the immigration system, including academics who, it turned out, had been able to obtain small slices of the data in the past. After two months of legal filings, the government relented and released for the first time the relevant data for the most recent four years -- more than 1.8 million records in all.","To identify the largest outsourcing companies, reporters manually labeled over 60 corporate entities associated with about 30 outsourcing companies. Then, reporters used manual labeling and statistical analysis to identify more than 3,600 smaller staffing firms. The statistical analysis included companies classified under North American Industry Classification System code 5415 that met either of two conditions: having more than 30% of new H-1B workers staffed at third-party worksites or submitting duplicative names in more than 50% of H-1B lottery submissions. Reporters arrived at those thresholds after conducting an anomaly analysis to reveal the systemic statistical differences between staffing and direct-employ firms. Reporters then used sampling to spot-check over 50 randomly selected companies. Bloomberg reporters wrote computer programs in Python to fuzzy-match thousands of company names to account for spelling variations and typos. Reporters also creatively used the last four digits of each company’s tax ID to match the new H-1B lottery data with data published by the Department of Labor.   To estimate how many H-1Bs were captured by multiple-registration abuse, reporters calculated how many approvals were associated with candidates whose names were submitted multiple times in the same lottery.","Other journalists could examine how we combined shoe-leather reporting, data analysis and open records laws to tackle complex stories. We spent months reporting out the data that the US government collects on H-1B visas, then discovered how academics had obtained small slices of that data to study the immigration system. After speaking with those professors, reporters crafted targeted and very specific FOIA requests that mirrored what the professors had already obtained, only we sought far more data. When the government ignored our FOIA and we sued, the government had no choice but to release the information since it had already done so previously. That opened the floodgates for a thorough examination of the system using the data, which provided us with both underlying, foundational findings that girded the stories as well as a reporting road map for discovering examples that would drive the narrative.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-staffing-firms-game-h1b-visa-lottery-system,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-cognizant-h1b-visas-discriminates-us-workers/,,,Eric Fan Zachary Mider Denise Lu Marie Patino Coulter Jones Kyle Kim,Eric Fan: investigative data reporter Zachary Mider: investigative reporter Denise Lu: data visualization reporter Marie Patino: data visualization reporter Coulter Jones: investigative reporter Kyle Kim: data visualization reporter

It takes the form of a ’road trip’ across South Africa to find the people and places affected by, or likely to be affected by, the transition to cleaner forms of energy. We looked at the technologies being developed and visited with the people living in the areas affected by the coming changes, be they good or bad.",The work was widely read and the data and the charts widely republished. The project is one of the largest explainer pieces published in the country. The project was published in a modular fashion so elements of the project could be republished. We are currently in discussion to have the individual elements translated additional local languages.,"A substantial amount of time was spent researching and sourcing the data used in the project, much of it was otherwise not available. The organising team was very small (around 3 people) so we relied on contributors to do on-the-ground reporting. The key elements of the project are the data visualisations and the photography which is mostly original photos.","For data collection and analysis we use Google Sheets, Excel and R. We also use DataDesk, our in-house data management, to store and manage data. We also build  interactive data visualisations off DataDesk.

Uzbekistan,School of Data Kyrgyzstan (LAMPA Accelerator) cabar.asia,Small,,,How to be a good person in Uzbekistan? Explained by the school-textbook ’Upbringing: Secrets of Happiness and Success’,2024-02-15,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Politics, Culture","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python","Textbooks help the state spread the ideas and values it needs by influencing the way people see history and culture. This process, which Pierre Bourdieu called cultural reproduction, allows dominant norms to be passed on to the next generation through education. In our project, we conducted a detailed analysis of the textbooks ‘Upbringing. Secrets of Happiness and Success’ for grades 1-11,  (2020-2021 published), which are used across the country. We investigated key themes, word frequency and narrative patterns, identifying how the image of a ‘nurtured’ citizen is shaped. Analyses were conducted using quantitative textual analysis and qualitative peer review methods.","Our article was published on one of Central Asia’s leading analytical platforms, cabar.asia (Unfortunately, we cannot confirm the exact number of reads for our story since we have sent a request to cabar.asia and are still awaiting their response. The website itself does not provide this information. The most accurate data we found is that Cabar receives approximately 50,000 to 70,000 views per month, while the subdomain (the longread section where our article was published) gets around 1,200 views per month). In addition, the results of our research were presented at the international conference “Educational Strategies in the Modern World: Lessons for Uzbekistan,” organized by Valeriy Khan at Bucheon University in October 2023. The conference was attended by around 80 education professionals, and high-ranking officials from Uzbekistan and beyond.","Our research was conducted against the backdrop of major reforms in Uzbekistan’s education system. Under President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s initiative to create a “New Uzbekistan” and a “Third Renaissance,” textbooks have become a crucial tool for influence the worldviews. We focused on the Upbringing (1-11) 2020–2021 textbooks, which continue to be used in many schools despite the introduction of new “4K” editions since 2023 that are not yet widely implemented. Although we could not obtain comments from the authors—a significant limitation—the digital text analysis and insights from external experts (such as Valeriy Khan) allowed us to identify key ideological patterns.  There is a noticeable visual difference in the first data scroll between the Russian and English versions. We recommend viewing the Russian version, as it appears more interactive for storytelling through data. (Due to an expired free subscription to Flourish, we were unable to create a similar interactive version for English.)","We used a combination of manual methods and automated tools to analyze the textbooks. First, the ”Upbringing” textbooks (grades 1–11, 2020–2021) were collected and converted into digital text. We manually divided the content into eight categories—such as ’How a child should look and behave’, ’Personal development, success, business’, ’Moral qualities and ethics’, ’Society (friends, mahalla, school)’, ’General knowledge’, ’Homeland and patriotism’, ’Family and family values’, and ’Other’—primarily by examining chapter titles, and when necessary, the chapter texts.  For text analysis, we employed Python and its libraries. We preprocessed the text by removing punctuation, performing lemmatization, and eliminating stop-words. The Mystem library was then used to extract nouns and adjectives, while excluding section headings (like question, activity, and reflection). To compile a list of frequently mentioned personalities, we used the Natasha library for name extraction and manually corrected inaccuracies, especially with multi-word names and variant spellings. Finally, we analyzed word connections by creating a list of key terms (such as ’Homeland’, ’Love’, ’Value’, ’Religion’) and using code to identify their co-occurrence with other words in the same sentences.  *A more detailed description of our methods and tools can be found in the material , in the section: ”How the content was analysed”","Our project demonstrates how digital tools and automation methods can serve as a powerful instrument for analyzing educational content. We as other Journalists can derive several valuable insights.  The analysis of textbooks shows how state ideology is embedded in educational materials, which is crucial for understanding the influence of power on public consciousness. Additionally, collaboration with experts in pedagogy, anthropology, and sociology helps to gain a deeper understanding of the context in which the educational program is formed and its foundations. We believe that such subtle data investigations on seemingly innocuous topics can draw attention to deeper issues and patterns that shape our existence, revealing control even in an unassuming textbook like ”Upbringing.”",English and Russian,https://longreads.cabar.asia/vospitanieuz_en,https://longreads.cabar.asia/vospitanieuz,,,Anastasia Galimova Dilmurod Ruziev Yuri Park Aziza Raimberdieva,"Anastasia Galimova is a freelance journalist and researcher specializing in the anthropology of urban spaces.

United Kingdom,"The Bureau of investigative Journalism, Channel4",Small,,,Greenwashing banks raised $1trillion for fossil fuel gaints,2023-11-13,"Investigation, Database, Video, Environment, Business","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Around five years ago and with great fanfare, numerous high street banks signalled their green credentials by pledging to align their operations and loan and investment portfolios with net zero by 2050. Yet despite this, banks with these commitments helped raise $1trillion for companies expanding fossil fuels in the two-year period since the International Energy Agency warned unequivocally in May 2021 that there could be no new fossil fuel extration project to keep the hope of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C by the end of the century, a TBIJ and Channel4 investigation found.","With lots of number and few obvious things to show, stories about climate and finance can be a hard sell to broadcast media. Few get coverage and fewer still tackle such nuanced issues as the credibitlity of companies’ green transition plans - a key pillar of the sustainable finance architecture. This is despite banks using money that we deposit in our accounts to bankroll fossil fuels. However, alongside Channel4, TBIJ ensured that the issue of ”greenwashing” net zero banks was brought to an audience of millions - and made relatable by incorporating high street names - at a time when UN climate talks were focusing on climate and finance.","Global climate talks in Azerbaijan in 2024 were the third in a row to be hosted by a so-called ’petrostate’ - a country that relies on revenues from fossil fuels. And less than a hundred miles from the conference venue, UK oil and gas major BP was developing a potential ’carbon bomb’ that could release a billion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere. BP, along with other major fossil fuel expanders, have been raising money from international banks that promised only to do business with companies that had ”credible transition plans”.  Josephine used two reputable exisiting datasets - from the Rainforest Action Network’s Banking on Climate Chaos report, and Urgewald’s Global Oil and Gas Exit List in order to produce a list of companies expanding oil and gas production, which had raised money from net zero banks. Cutting these two datasets allowed us to put the tangible $1 trillion figure on the extent of greenwashing by major banks. We faced considerable pushback at the right of reply stage but remaind confident in our reporting and given bp and banks’ very recent renegging on their climate commitments, it has been further ligitimised.","The data was complex but we developed a strong methodology and used Excel to cut the data in such a way as to give us a strong top reporting line. We filtered data provided by RAN and Urgewald for banks that have committed to net zero, and then those funding companies that are expanding production of oil and gas. We used as a starting point the date when the IEA made announcement that there should be no new oil and gas and ended in the most recent calendar year for which data was available. This gave us a list of companies expanding oil and gas production, which had raised money between from net zero banks in the given period. We were also able to use data relating to the emissions of planned expansion projects by companies funded by net zero banks to calculate that they would produce more than seven times the US’ annual emissions in their lifetimes if they went ahead.","There are many opportunities to combine and cut existing datasets to generate compelling new stories, and as many people already know but it’s worth stressing, data collectors can be really amenable to sharing their findings and cooperaitng if you can add value to their research.",English,https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2024-11-13/greenwashing-banks-raised-1-trillion-dollars-for-fossil-fuel-giants,https://www.channel4.com/news/uk-banks-still-lending-to-oil-and-gas-giant-bp-despite-climate-pledges,,,"Jospehine Moulds, Helia Ebrahimi","Josephine Moulds is an award-winning journalist covering climate and finance for the Bureau of Investigative Journalism.

Texty.org.ua went through the 285,000 comments to 2,300 videos in YouTube. Aggression, harassment, sexism, and threats against journalists are all examples of gender-based violence online. Although YouTube has strict policies against hate speech, its moderation algorithms often miss it, removing hundreds of thousands pieces of content but leaving “just a stupid chicken” under videos from Ukrainian media. It doesn’t matter if you have 100 comments or 1000 comments under your video. The analysis unveiled that 8-10% of all comments are gender-based aggressive, for most of the tracked channels.","The project has generated a lot of discussion in the Ukrainian journalistic community, which is to be expected. Less expected was the strong reaction on social media from the general audience. In particular, on Instagram and TikTok, short videos about the project have received tens of thousands of views (although the audience of our channels in these social networks are rather symbolic). Our main conclusion is that the comments on social media about the project perfectly illustrate our research.",The research topic was initiated by the Ukrainian NGO ”Women in media” as a reaction to the fact that YouTube’s existing policies and algorithms are not coping with the significant spread of aggressive language towards Ukrainian female journalists in the comments.,"For this project, we conducted automated comment analysis using the YouTube API and GPT-4o accessed through OpenAI API calls. We extracted first-level comments (excluding replies) from playlists of 15 popular Ukrainian-language news YouTube channels and media outlets from the whitelist of the Institute of Mass Information. To reduce noise, we filtered out comments shorter than three characters. GPT-4o, accessed via the OpenAI API, was used to categorize comments into ten types of online violence, including misogyny, threats of physical violence, and discreditation. We developed a detailed classification prompt with descriptions of each type of violence, incorporating examples in Ukrainian and Russian to enhance accuracy. Additionally, we attempted to identify comments likely posted by Russian accounts by analyzing markers such as anti-Ukrainian rhetoric, Russian self-identification, or specific symbols. To assess accuracy, we manually verified 456 randomly selected comments, finding that GPT-4o correctly classified 87% of them. By integrating automation with human validation, we ensured a high-quality, data-driven analysis of online violence in YouTube comments.","1. In general. As a result of the project, we compounded [the list ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d17M2kMYGINekNBWPs9ZtMbcY06rKE1XU6I2U42rzhU/edit?gid=1310948060#gid=1310948060) of certain words as examples of hate speech in comments. On their YouTube channels, media can define words that will cause comments to be reviewed by the channel administrator before they are published (or never published).  Channel and media owners can limit the ability to leave hateful comments under their videos — by creating their own blacklist of words prohibited in comments, as [Google recommends](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9483359). 2. Within Ukrainian context A lack of understanding of the context in a full-scale war creates a huge gap between what seems obvious to Ukrainians and what is “obviously unacceptable” from the point of view of “peaceful” Western-centered algorithms. Ukrainians know better than anyone how often moderation algorithms work against our attempts to tell the world about the war. Similarly, in our study, GPT sometimes made mistakes, for example, when it labeled comments criticizing sexist remarks, phrases reminiscent of massive cases of sexual violence during the occupation, or sarcasm as gender-based online violence.","Ukrainian, English",https://texty.org.ua/projects/114050/spoon-of-hate-online-violence-against-ukrainian-female-journalists-in-youtube-comments/,https://www.instagram.com/texty.org.ua/reel/DE5CM7xppKw/,https://wim.org.ua/en/useful/,,"Nataliia Romanyshyn, Yuliia Dukach, Oleh Hebura, Nadia Kelm","Nataliia Romanyshyn (Lviv, Ukraine): NLP Researcher / Data Journalist at Texty.org.ua (May 2023 – Present).

En el primero, se mostró que 269 víctimas que no aparecían como casos confirmados de desaparición sí lo estaban y exhibió deficiencias de las clasificaciones del gobierno. El segundo, demostró que 30 personas que aparecían como localizadas continuaban desaparecidas, según confirmaron sus familias.","El principal impacto fue informar a las familias de personas desaparecidas que los resultados del censo, que tanto les angustiaba por no saber qué implicaba para la búsqueda de sus seres queridos, no podían darse por válidos en tanto logramos demostrar cientos de errores. La publicación del trabajo estuvo acompañada de un video explicativo para que las familias de personas desaparecidas buscaran en la plataforma del gobierno en qué clasificación habían puesto a su ser querido. Realizamos reuniones públicas y privadas con organizaciones que acompañan a las familias buscadoras y con colectivos de familias buscadoras para enseñarles cómo hacerlo. Los reportajes fueron ampliamente difundidos en medios nacionales y locales y sirvió para confirmar que los errores durante la implementación del censo eran evidentes en sus resultados. Esto ayudó a que el presidente López Obrador no pudiera imponer su narrativa de que las personas desaparecidas no eran 111,000 sino apenas 12,337.","Las principales dificultades fueron técnicas al contar con datos de mala calidad y masivos (más de 100,000 registros), que provenían de distintas fuentes y que había que comparar en distintos cruces masivos mediante nombres, fechas y lugares de desaparición. Adicionalmente, fue un reto confirmar con las familias que cientos de personas continuaban desaparecidas a pesar de los resultados mostrados por el gobierno. Esto fue especialmente complejo porque el acercamiento tenía que ser cuidadoso para evitar generar más revictimización de la que el gobierno ya les había generado. El trabajo también fue colabortivo, aunque el autor de los reportajes realizó los cruces masivos de datos y obtuvo las bases de datos, un grupo de trece periodistas (incluido el autor) realizaron revisiones manuales, entrevistas y comunicaciones directas con familiares para confirmar los casos.

For months, it remained unclear what its leader’s death would mean for the Wagner Group, a private military company with GRU connections in Moscow and private business interests in Africa. After an analysis of Wagner Group aircraft activity throughout the continent, The Insider can report that the private military company’s flights to key destinations including the Central African Republic, Libya, and Mali remain active.","Some of the aircraft mentioned in the investigation were already under scrutiny by UN Expert Groups (on CAR, Mali, and Libya), and some of their operators had been sanctioned under UN resolutions — though unsuccessfully, as the aircraft changed ownership. After The Insider investigation was published, the Russian company Abakan Air — one of the key transport providers for Wagner and Russian Ministry of Defence mercenary groups in Africa — along with its parent company Avializing Invest, which had not previously been the focus of any organization’s attention, were sanctioned by OFAC (https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20240612).

This is particularly evident when Angat Dam—which supplies 98 percent of Metro Manila’s potable water—breaches its minimum operating levels during the dry season. The series also highlights how Metro Manila’s growing population affects the efficiency of water distribution and how inequality determines who does and does not have access to water, both in times of abundance and scarcity.","It is worth noting that the lowest water level of 173.20 meters in 2024 was significantly higher than in 2019, when Angat Dam recorded its lowest level at 157.96 meters, despite the threats of El Niño. While this welcome outcome may not be directly attributed to the publication of the story, raising awareness about the issue could have encouraged the public to be more mindful of their water consumption and may have contributed, in a small way, to more efficient water management.  The story also amplified calls from communities severely impacted by the 2019 water cuts for the government and water concessionaires to improve water management and governance to mitigate future threats and prevent a recurrence of the 2019 crisis, where certain barangays went without water for more than a week.  Additionally, solutions and calls to action were highlighted to emphasize how individual efforts can contribute to water conservation, especially as the Philippines faced the threat of El Niño in 2024.",The author requested feedback from the National Water Resources Board (NWRB) and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) but did not receive a response despite multiple requests and follow-ups during the writing of this story. Engineers from the NWRB had prepared their response but were unable to share their feedback due to a lack of authorization from the Environment Secretary.,"The author utilized data from multiple sources, including the National Power Corporation (Napocor), the National Water Resources Board (NWRB), the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) – Climate and Agrometeorological Data Section (CADS), the e-FOI site of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System Regulatory Office, the Commission on Audit’s Citizen Participatory Audit report on the Availability, Adequacy, and Quality of Water Services in Quezon City (published in 2020), and Manila Water, Inc.

Our story looked at how Ukraine was able to re-open this crucial shipping corridor for grain, scaring off Russian warships through the use of relatively inexpensive naval drones, crafting an innovative insurance agreement, and establishing a new shipping corridor. Our analysis of ship tracking data showed that by early 2024, vessel traffic out of Odesa-area ports was back to nearly pre-war levels.","The story was well-read and received and drove conversation around what, at the time, was a fairly understated front of the war. We noticed more coverage of the recovering grain exports in subsequent weeks, such as a story by the New York Times published on May 12.","There are some fairly conspicuous constraints here, typical of stories covering the Ukraine war, and particularly given the satellite tracking of Russian fleet vessels. I’ve covered more on data access and technologies in subsequent answers, but there’s not much further that wouldn’t be apparent from the work.","We used AIS ship tracking data from Spire to map vessel traffic out of each of Ukraine’s sea ports and conduct an analysis of both the total volume of ships leaving the Black Sea, as well as understanding when and where the main shipping corridor had shifted. This involved (though use of some pretty hefty python scripts) pulling down and processing millions of raw ship position pings, associating them with ports and shipping routes and aggregating this into an analysis presented mid-way through the piece.  We conducted an analysis with BlackSky using satellite imagery to identify the locations of Russian fleet vessels. This was used to identify Ukrainian drone attacks and to map the naval vessels to eastern ports, where we showed evidence of new fortifications having been installed.

One of the hardest things that we do as data/visual journalists is creating novel, meaningful datasets from raw data or observations. We did that several times in this story.  There was no clean, available dataset showing shipping paths for vessels leaving Ukrainian ports, we had to construct one from the raw AIS data, connecting vessels to ports and shipping paths to vessels. We then used this dataset in maps to show traffic changes and to calculate meta statistics about volumes.  There was no clean dataset describing positions of Russian warships or fortifications of naval ports. We had to create one through a satellite analysis, working with BlackSky to identify changes in fleet vessel locations or port fortifications.

But amid Israel’s war on Gaza, abundant harvests have given way to devastation and a dire humanitarian crisis.  In this story, Al Jazeera’s digital investigation team, Sanad, analysed dozens of satellite images, revealing that more than 60 percent of Gaza’s farmland—vital for feeding its war-ravaged population—has been damaged or destroyed by Israeli attacks.

Italy,Facta.eu,Small,,,Swampower,2024-05-01,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Map, Satellite images, Environment","Scraping, QGIS, Google Sheets, CSV, AI analysis of satellite imagery","This investigation (originally in Italian) looks into how commercial interests decimate Italy’s remaining wetlands, as national authorities ignore this ongoing exploitation. From unwanted to protected, wetlands - salt marshes, lagoons, deltas, swamps - are powerful natural weapons to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. Combining data science, AI analysis of satellite imagery and field reporting, we focused on the Oristano’s wetlands (Sardinia), where there is a long-standing plan for a much-discussed protected area, and the saltmarsh in Cervia (Emilia-Romagna) affected by disastrous flooding. We revealed that political and commercial interests prevented the application of effective protective policies, further damaging the environment.","The project was published on Facta.eu, an independent media applying the scientific method to investigative and data journalism, in syndication with Il Bo Live, an award-winning magazine edited by the University of Padua and the largest cultural digital magazine in Italy with 280.000+ average daily users, 50/50 gender split and a strong readership in the 25-40 years of age. The investigation also reached Facta.eu’s community of researchers, scientists, activists, NGO representatives and teachers. We received good qualitative feedback on the project’s results, which were used at the local level for advocacy activities to protect wetlands. Moreover, readers have suggested further investigation of Italian wetlands, and we are exploring opportunities to expand the project. Some of the investigation’s results were published in the independent magazine Indip, focusing on investigative journalism in Sardinia and strongly connected to local communities on the island. We gave several seminars and practical sessions to present the project’s steps and results at the SISSA post-graduate School in Trieste. The investigation was also presented during the 2024 Climate Arena Conference in Bologna. The panel included two journalists and a data scientist involved in the project, who discussed their investigative approaches encompassing data science, satellite journalism and field reporting.","We would like to highlight the innovation of the method proposed by this investigation. The project has served as a pilot to develop a collaborative approach between science and investigative journalists and a group of data scientists based at SISSA post-graduate School in Trieste, Italy. We proposed a “peer-review journalism” approach, where different researchers and experts were involved throughout the whole investigation process, validating the investigation’s data and findings. This approach aims to propose a solid methodology for journalistic work and to redesign the way we produce and distribute content in collaboration with our community. Some data visualization, graphic design and scrolling techniques were also used in the final publication. Overall, the proposed method was well-received by the journalistic and scientific communities where the project was presented, and two more investigations using the same “peer-review journalism” approach stemmed from this project.","We combined different techniques and approaches: Scientific literature collection: Excel database of hundreds of wetlands-related relevant papers, reports and documents Data scraping, data cleaning and database building Data visualization AI analysis of selected satellite imagery (in collaboration with a team of data scientists) Creation of images and visualizations using QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) Production of a Blueprint describing the methodology and work phases, allowing the replicability of the collaborative process between journalists and researchers","Other journalists can benefit from this project both at the content and the methodological level. The investigation’s focus, wetlands, is a key example of a complex, underreported environmental story. Wetlands are an ecosystem capable of locking up carbon for thousands of years. They cover 3-5% of the Earth’s surface but sequester as much CO2 as forests. Coastal wetlands are home to great biodiversity and are nature-based solutions in combating flooding and protecting coastlines from sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. In 1971, several countries signed the Ramsar Convention for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. Yet, wetlands remain among the most threatened ecosystems as countries actively encourage exploitation, investing in intensive agriculture, industrial extraction, urbanisation, and mass tourism. For this reason, degraded wetlands in different countries could be a relevant topic for environmental and investigative reporting, including cross-border journalism. Part of our story (supported by Journalismfund) was also done with an international consortium of colleagues based in other countries with significant wetlands loss: Ireland, which has lost 90% of its wetlands, and Germany (80%). At the methodological level, other journalists could adopt the same “peer review journalism” approach, involving experts and scientists during the whole investigation process.","English, Italian",https://facta.eu/focus-on/swampower/,https://facta.eu/sardinias-hidden-treasure/,https://facta.eu/cervia-the-flooded-salt-pan-in-romagna-2/,https://facta.eu/maristanis-the-incomplete-the-park-that-never-was-between-wind-farms-and-pesticides-2/,"Elisabetta Tola, Giulia Bonelli, Benedetta Pagni, Raffaele Angius, Andrea Carboni","The team is made up of five reporters from Facta.eu, an Italian non-profit independent media applying the scientific method to investigative and data journalism, and Indip, an independent investigative media focusing on Sardinia.

Spain,El Confidencial,Big,,,Todas las maneras en las que Israel está destruyendo Gaza,2024-04-07,"Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Human rights","Animation, Scraping, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap","The article ”All the Ways in Which Israel Is Destroying Gaza” analyzes the devastation in the Gaza Strip after six months of conflict that began on October 7, 2023. It highlights the systematic destruction of essential infrastructure such as hospitals and schools, as well as the loss of cultural heritage, which has turned Gaza into an ”unlivable place.” Additionally, it highlights with data the deaths of approximately 33,000 people and the proposal of Israeli real estate projects over Gaza’s ruins, suggesting an intention to rebuild in a way that could significantly alter the identity and future of the Palestinian enclave.","The article ”Todas las maneras en las que Israel está destruyendo Gaza” significantly shapes public perception by exposing the scale of destruction, the loss of cultural heritage, and the humanitarian crisis. It raises awareness, challenges mainstream narratives, and increases global scrutiny of Israel’s actions. Readers who may have been uninformed are confronted with the depth of the crisis, potentially shifting opinions and fueling political discourse.  Beyond informing the public, the article influences policymakers, NGOs, and advocacy groups, contributing to calls for humanitarian aid, ceasefires, and legal action. It strengthens activism by providing material for protests, petitions, and human rights campaigns, amplifying demands for accountability.  However, it also fuels debate and polarization, reinforcing or challenging existing beliefs. While some view it as an essential exposé of war crimes, others may see it as biased. This dynamic sparks broader discussions on media framing and international responses.  Ultimately, the article’s impact extends beyond reporting; it shapes narratives, influences policy debates, and mobilizes action. By highlighting not just destruction but also the erasure of Palestinian identity, it deepens the conversation on justice, human rights, and the long-term consequences of war.","Since the start of Israel’s offensive in Gaza, reporting on the conflict has faced major challenges: restricted access to the Strip, efforts by both the Israeli army and Hamas to control information, and the sheer brutality of war. These limitations required a new approach beyond traditional war journalism to effectively convey the reality of the situation.  The team adopted a different perspective—looking not only at present destruction but also at its long-term consequences. Everything being destroyed today is, in reality, the destruction of Gaza’s future. The deaths of children mean a lost generation unable to rebuild society. Destroyed hospitals lead to untreated diseases and disabilities—Gaza has faced cholera outbreaks and amputations that might have been avoidable if hospitals had remained functional. The destruction of schools and universities deprives society of future professionals, while the contamination of farmland will result in hunger and dependence on humanitarian aid.  This idea forms the backbone of the project: present destruction and its future implications. Instead of relying on a single journalist’s on-the-ground perspective, we built a data-driven framework, cross-referencing multiple sources and satellite images. The findings are visually represented through multimedia infographics, illustrations, and satellite-based maps.","To carry out this comprehensive report with illustrations, data, and infographics, the following tools and methodologies were used:  * Figma for the design and layout of the entire format before moving on to development. * HTML to organize the content, SASS to style it more easily, and JavaScript to make it interactive. One of the highlights of our work is an interactive graph that shows the number of deaths in Gaza from October 7, 2023, to March 2024, just before the report was published. This graph was created entirely with JavaScript. The data we used comes from the Palestinian Ministry of Health and UNOCHA, and is organized by month, total deaths, and is also divided by gender and age: men, women, and children. * QGIS to read the data from Jamon Van Den Hoek’s analysis, exported in SVG format to be processed in the infographic with its own style. * Photoshop to create the illustrations for each section.","Other journalists can learn from this project about the importance of using comprehensive data visualization, including interactive graphs, to represent complex situations. The piece exemplifies how to handle sensitive and evolving stories with transparency, utilizing sources like health ministries and international organizations. The integration of infographics, illustrations, and storytelling around a difficult topic (such as the Gaza conflict) helps audiences grasp the human and infrastructural toll of war.

Finally, women choose to give up on being professional esports players, because their income is not enough to support their lives.","I find it hard to say that this article has had a big and widespread impact. While I interviewed players, regulators and game developers, none of them were aware of the major issues that women face in the esports scene. This is due to the normalization of masculine behavior and marginalization in the name of an open space that has standards that are not friendly to women.

Through this novel approach, the investigation uncovered the killing of more that 400 civilians from strikes in Gaza that the Israeli military itself published footage of on social media.   Made by the investigations team of the civilian harm watchdog Airwars, in collaboration with Sky News, the 20-minute film merges 3D reconstructions and witness testimonies, revealing how the videos could ultimately be used against Israel in court.","The impact of the film crossed social, legal and political boundaries with a major influence in the civilian harm field. The innovative technical approach of the project prompted a feature by the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard, expanding on the originality of our method in determining civilian casualties from Israeli strike footage. In January 2025, CBS 60 minutes recreated a section of the film investigating the Al-Taj strike - pushing OSINT driven-data to a mainstream audience. Crucially, the transparency of our methodology resulted in the findings being used to support major legal mechanisms, which we would be happy to explain to the panel in a private setting. Additionally, the film focused on a family who lost 15 members in an Israeli strike on the Al-Taj Tower. This interview formed the heart of the film, which was well received by loved ones of the family.","With international journalists prevented from entering Gaza throughout the war, it has been immensely challenging to assess and capture the full scale of loss. The strike footage posted by the IDF aimed to project a narrative of precision, despite thousands of accounts of civilian harm published on social media.    Locating the strikes in the footage to build our dataset was a major challenge – the imagery was typically blurry and greyscale, often with five or more strikes spliced into a single video. Whilst the captions stated the military are striking Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups, there was usually no or little evidence for this claim. To overcome this restriction, we devised a detailed and laborious geolocation methodology, conducted over more than six months and relying only on freely available tools such as Google Earth Pro and Wikimapia.  Despite these obstacles, 72 IDF strikes were geolocated - 17 of which were matched to civilian harm incidents, formulating a rigorous dataset gathered through open source methods.   In addition to the film, these incidents were published in a transparent database archive, including the coordinates and geolocation notes, creating public access to our data. In these incidents alone, more than 400 Palestinians died.","The team created an innovative methodology to turn the thousands of clips released by the IDF into a dataset to be analysed, parsed through and ultimately form the base of our investigation into civilian harm.  In order to link incidents of civilian harm with IDF strike footage, the team reviewed more than 600 clips of strikes released by the Israeli military and assessed the ‘geolocatability’ of each one. Each was assigned a number between 1-5 based on how clear the imagery was, if the strike hit a distinctive building such as a mosque or school, or if there were any unique urban features that would make it more noticeable in satellite imagery. We then prioritised geolocating the ‘high scoring’ videos. This allowed the team to focus their attention on the most important datapoints.  The team also used 3D modelling techniques to recreate a mosque destroyed by an Israeli strike, in order to make a data-driven story feel human and powerful.","Transparency and replicability was an essential aspect to our open source investigation. In theory, any researcher using our published dataset could replicate the process and test the findings of our work. The public access Airwars archive, along with transparent methodology, allows other journalists to continue identifying civilian harm in IDF footage.   Additionally, the combination of OSINT tools and data with human testimonies shows the use of both open and closed sources in illustrating a picture of civilian harm that still centres those affected by conflict. The wider aim is to not only uncover the human cost of war, but to preserve the testimonies of civilians who are reporting the impact of airstrikes and to ultimately use this to advocate for affected civilians in legal, political and military realms. The information that served as the bedrock of our data was posted online in a transparent fashion  - hopefully inspiring other data journalists to continue to question the rhetoric of militaries in their approach to civilian harm, and to uncover the reality of what is happening on the ground in conflict zones.",English,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esvn44GEoAk&t=1s,https://idf-tweets-gaza.airwars.org/,,,"Rowena De Silva, Nikolaj Houmann Mortensen, Joe Dyke, Sanjana Varghese, Nathan Walker, Rosie Harris-Davison, Maia Awada, Azul De Monte, Giacomo Nanni, Mohammed Shatat","Airwars is a not-for-profit transparency watchdog which tracks, assesses, archives and investigates civilian harm claims in conflict-affected nations."

Entre 2021 e 2023, mais de 100 toneladas de cocaína foram apreendidas em portos e aeroportos do país, com destino a 92 países, sendo a Europa o principal mercado. A reportagem destacou o crescimento alarmante do tráfico para Ásia e Oceania, com aumento de 3.600% nas apreensões para Hong Kong. Além dos dados, a equipe acompanhou prisões em flagrante de pessoas em situação de vulnerabilidade, revelando o papel das mulas do tráfico no crime organizado globalizado.","A investigação trouxe à tona dados inéditos que mudaram a compreensão do tráfico internacional de drogas no Brasil. A série revelou o crescimento exponencial da exportação de cocaína para mercados emergentes, especialmente Ásia e Oceania, e mostrou como o Brasil se tornou um dos principais corredores do tráfico global.  O impacto do trabalho foi imediato: autoridades de segurança utilizaram os dados da reportagem para embasar investigações e reforçar o monitoramento em portos e aeroportos. Depois da reportagem, instalaram scanners corporais capazes de identificar drogas engolidas. Especialistas e políticos citaram os achados para defender mudanças em políticas públicas e um maior controle nas fronteiras.  Além do impacto institucional, a reportagem também gerou um debate social importante sobre a exploração de pessoas vulneráveis pelo crime organizado. Ao mostrar casos reais de grávidas e pessoas em situação de extrema pobreza recrutadas como ”mulas”, o trabalho expôs a vulnerabilidade social.  A investigação demonstrou o papel essencial do jornalismo de dados na segurança pública, ao revelar padrões de tráfico e pressionar por ações concretas. Além disso, inspirou outros veículos de imprensa a aprofundarem investigações sobre o narcotráfico e suas conexões internacionais.","A realização desta investigação enfrentou diversos desafios, desde barreiras no acesso a informações oficiais até questões de segurança para os repórteres envolvidos. O levantamento se baseou em pedidos via Lei de Acesso à Informação (LAI), mas algumas solicitações foram negadas ou entregues de forma incompleta, exigindo um trabalho minucioso e persistente.   Além disso, a complexidade do tráfico internacional de drogas exigiu um aprofundamento investigativo para entender como as rotas evoluíram nos últimos anos. A equipe analisou 1.330 registros de apreensões, mapeando destinos e identificando padrões inéditos.  O cenário político também influenciou a investigação. Nos últimos anos, o Brasil tem enfrentado desafios na cooperação internacional contra o tráfico, enquanto organizações criminosas expandem suas operações para novos mercados, muitas vezes se valendo de brechas no controle alfandegário.","A equipe utilizou a Lei de Acesso à Informação (LAI) para obter dados inéditos sobre apreensões de cocaína em portos e aeroportos entre 2021 e 2023. Para processar e analisar esses dados, foram empregadas ferramentas de planilhas avançadas (Excel, Google Sheets) e softwares de análise de dados (Python, SQL), permitindo identificar padrões, tendências e correlações entre rotas e destinos.   A apuração incluiu verificação cruzada de fontes, com entrevistas a autoridades, especialistas e investigações em processos judiciais. A equipe também acompanhou prisões em flagrante com autorização das autoridades.  A combinação de dados estruturados, reportagens em campo e análise global do problema foi essencial para aprofundar o impacto da investigação e revelar um cenário inédito do tráfico de drogas no país.","Esta investigação jornalística oferece lições valiosas para jornalistas investigativos, especialmente aqueles que lidam com jornalismo de dados e cobertura de crimes transnacionais. Um dos principais aprendizados é o uso estratégico da Lei de Acesso à Informação (LAI) para obter dados exclusivos e gerar investigações com profundidade. A reportagem mostrou que cruzar dados oficiais com fontes independentes pode revelar padrões ocultos e tendências globais.  Outra lição importante é a necessidade de combinar dados com jornalismo de campo. O projeto não se limitou à análise de planilhas, mas acompanhou prisões e ouviu pessoas envolvidas, o que humanizou a investigação e trouxe contexto ao problema.

The timeline of 1,000 murders was published as a stand alone publication alongside 21 in-depth features covering many of the cases in the database. I then pinpointed the location of all 1,000 murders to produce an interactive map which was published on Reach regional websites with information about the cold cases. The final series covered every police force in England, Scotland and Wales.","The print edition was one of Reach’s best selling stand alone titles last year, selling more than 14,000 copies, which outstripped the daily circulation of every Reach regional title, and all but three regional newspapers in the UK.  Reach regional brands also went into their own archives and linked previous reporting to the interactive map. More than a dozen regional titles have published articles based on my research including the Manchester Evening News, Wales Online, Liverpool Echo, Birmingham Live, Chronicle (Newcastle) Live, Bristol Live, Grimsby Live, North Wales Live, Cornwall Live, Devon Live, Gloucestershire Live and Yorkshire Live. The features, timeline, and interactive map shone a light on many shocking crimes that had been largely forgotten about and in some cases, had not been covered in decades.  It brought these cases back into the public focus and highlighted the ongoing wait for sustice endured by many families. Data graphics used in the project provided supporting evidence for an included interview with criminologist Professor David Wilson, who warned that at least two serial killers are likely to be still on the loose in Britain.  A second edition, podcast, and weekly newsletter are now planned as follow-ups to the original work.","After lodging appeals against the police forces which had rejected FOI requests, and also submitting several FOI to the National Archives, I started on my own detective work. I spent nearly a year - in between my regularly duties - researching local press reports on the British Newspaper Archive for cold cases in the areas of the country where the police information was missing. Featured cases involved trawling through the archives to examine how they were reported and investigated at the time, uncovering many details which would otherwise have been missed. In some cases this included errors made by detectives at the time. FOI requests revealed a victim’s name and date of murder, but often little else. Every case in the timeline (and many others which were filtered out for a variety of reasons) were extensively researched to uncover the full details of each crime.  These cases dated back as far as 1939 and in many cases, no information was available online. Many hours were spent trawling through archives to find contemporary newspaper reports and interviews. One of the challenges was to stay on top of breakthroughs in historic cases. Several were solved and replaced in the timeline before publication.","I used FOI requests and appeals for much of the information, alongside extensive research online and in the British Newspaper Archive.  After map locations had been found, I used AI (Chatgpt, Notebooklm) to sort data into an accessible style, and retrieve postcode locations, which were all checked by hand. Doogle batch geocoding and Google maps were used to pinpoint the latitude and longitude of each address which was fed into the map template. The spreadsheet was pulled together using Google sheets and a variety of lookups and code to make all the information uniform and accessible. Many of the cases that didn’t appear in FOI requests were initially sourced online from Google searches, which were then checked using archive newspaper reports.","Britain’s 1,000 Unsolved Murders demonstrates that innovative designs can still be used in print, and that print can still be a successful way to distribute a project. It also shows how a major project can be a success in parallel  both online and in print, without impacting on its success in either form.

Depois de uma maioria absoluta em 2022, as sondagens apontavam para uma mudança de cenário. Tal veio a confirmar-se. Os ventos mudaram de sentido — e o rumo do país também. Mapeamos as vitórias e derrotas eleitorais no regresso social-democrata ao poder.","Este projecto foi publicado três dias depois da noite eleitoral e debruçou-se maioritariamente sobre os fenómenos locais de alguns partidos – mas não só. Procuramos também encontrar respostas para algumas das perguntas que surgem nas primeiras horas após o encerramento das urnas. Para tal, cruzamos os resultados eleitorais com indicadores socioeconómicos. O artigo foi dos mais lidos nos dias que se seguiram à noite eleitoral.","No reporte das eleições, há sempre uma série de pontos obrigatórios a cumprir: resultados, rescaldo, primeiras conclusões a tirar das projecções e das contagens que vão encerrando ao longo da noite. Algo que cativa sempre é a análise à lupa de todos os pequenos fenómenos que compõem os resultados nacionais de umas legislativas. Quem cresceu e em qual freguesia, concelho, distrito? A visualização de dados, neste caso o scrollytelling, é a ferramenta ideal para ir mais além na análise pós-eleitoral.","Os dados foram recolhidos usando R através da API oficial. Como o objectivo era conseguir ter a peça publicada nos dias imediatamente a seguir à divulgação do apuramento dos resultados eleitorais para todos os círculos eleitorais, adaptamos o script que tínhamos em R das últimas eleições, com base na API que tinha sido disponibilizada para esse momento de sufrágio (esperando que não houvesse grandes mudanças na estrutura de dados). Isto permitiu-nos gerar um relatório com as principais conclusões e algumas visualizações logo no momento em que os resultados fecharam. O trabalho foi desenvolvido usando o mapbox. Mas não era possível fazer grande preparação antes da noite eleitoral uma vez que não sabíamos qual poderia ser a história destas eleições. Deixámos por isso o máximo possível preparado para que, depois de recolhidos e analisados os dados, fosse apenas necessário escrever a narrativa e guiar o leitor no mapa.","Num trabalho em que já temos uma parte do processo pronta para arrancar mal tenhamos os dados disponíveis, há sempre mais espaço para procurar inovar e surpreender. Com base num trabalho semelhante feito em 2022, sabíamos mais ou menos com o que contar. Sendo assim, porque não experimentar algo novo?

Portugal,PÚBLICO,Big,,,Dating eleitoral: Com que partido sairia para jantar?,2024-03-01,"Quiz/game, Database, News application, Mobile App, Illustration, Elections, Politics","AI/Machine learning, Json, Google Sheets","Este trabalho avaliava a compatibilidade do leitor com os programas eleitorais dos partidos com assento parlamentar que concorreram nas eleições legislativas portuguesas de 2024. Recorrendo a inteligência artificial, analisamos os programas eleitorais para identificar as principais propostas e estabelecer matrizes políticas para cada partido, permitindo ao utilizador explorar e compreender melhor as propostas dos partidos e perceber a sua compatibilidade com os candidatos.","A ferramenta teve um impacto imediato nas discussões diárias sobre as eleições. Foi amplamente partilhado pelos leitores nas redes sociais, com um feedback geralmente muito positivo relativamente aos resultados de compatibilidade e aquilo que eram as ideias preconcebidas de quem respondia às perguntas – um sinal de que a elaboração do algoritmo foi bem-sucedida. A dimensão da base de dados das medidas disponíveis para testar a compatibilidade também foi um factor diferenciador destacado pelos leitores - recebemos, inclusive, e-mails de utilizadores que se ”queixavam” de não conseguir terminar o quiz (não é nada fácil chegar ao fim de cinco mil medidas). Outra prova do impacto foram as métricas de acessos ao trabalho, que mostraram uma procura pela página (pelas palavras “Dating eleitoral”) nos motores de pesquisa. A isto também se deve o facto de este ser o segundo trabalho nestes moldes – o dating leitoral aqui submetido é uma versão melhorada (bastante mais complexa e sofisticada) de uma outra news application que elaboramos em 2022. Apesar de um contratempo na monitorização do tráfego durante as primeiras horas de publicação, o Dating eleitoral acumulou perto de 1,2 milhões de pageviews e foi utilizado por um total de quase 47 mil utilizadores.","Uma preocupação constante e desde o início do desenvolvimento desta ideia foi a necessidade de deixar claro que o trabalho foi concebido não para ajudar a definir o sentido de voto, mas sim para avaliar a potencial compatibilidade do inquirido com os programas eleitorais. Paralelamente, partiu-se para este projecto com o objectivo claro de inovar. O trabalho de 2022 teve uma recepção muito positiva por parte dos leitores e motivou a equipa a fazer algo ainda melhor e mais ambicioso nas eleições seguintes. Decidimos passar de uma lista fixa de 50 perguntas para um conjunto de mais de cinco mil medidas dos programas políticos em que os leitores podiam escolher quando terminar o seu ”date” – e aliando isto com o desafio de tornar os resultados de compatibilidade ainda mais fidedignos. Relativamente a restrição de recursos, a elaboração do trabalho requereu a utilização da API da OpenAI devido ao nível de computação necessária para analisar e dissecar todos os programas eleitorais. Um custo justificado com o volume de trabalho que a ideia apresentava. Na resposta seguinte desenvolveremos a forma como recorremos à inteligência artificial para elevar a ideia do Dating eleitoral a um novo patamar.","Para chegar ao Dating Eleitoral, recorremos à ajuda de inteligência artificial em dois momentos distintos deste trabalho. Procurou-se sempre garantir que esta utilização não introduzisse nenhum viés ideológico através de uma verificação das tarefas executadas. Numa primeira fase, recorreu-se à base de dados Manifesto Corpus, um projecto que recolheu e catalogou milhares de manifestos e programas eleitorais de todo o mundo. Foi com base nesta colecção que um grupo de cientistas de dados treinou o grande modelo de linguagem (LLM) RoBERTa para classificar textos políticos em 56 categorias diferentes. A partir daqui, foi possível identificar as matrizes definidoras de cada um dos partidos e os temas mais abordados nos seus programas. A segunda instância foi na análise dos programas eleitorais para deles se extraírem as medidas propostas. Para isso, delineámos instruções claras e precisas para que o modelo de última geração da OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo) analisasse cada excerto dos programas, tendo ainda em consideração o contexto da frase anterior e da frase seguinte. Dividiram-se depois as medidas em 200 aglomerados temáticos, e a selecção das perguntas que aparecem aos leitores foi feita por um modelo que combina cálculo combinatório com critérios de relevância e distintividade.","Este projecto é uma demonstração de como as ferramentas de inteligência artificial podem ser um auxiliar poderosíssimo do trabalho jornalístico. A possibilidade de utilizar modelos de linguagem para categorizar e analisar grandes volumes de texto não está limitada a trabalhos como o que aqui é submetido, numa lógica interactiva e de news application – é também uma forma de monitorizar e escrutinar a actividade política (e não só) de uma forma rápida e mais ampla, numa lógica de análise preliminar e superficial de relatórios e outros documentos que, de outra forma, passam muitas vezes despercebidos ou requerem um grande dispêndio de tempo ainda antes de se partir para a elaboração de uma história. Para o cálculo da compatibilidade, foi também utilizada uma correlação de Spearman. Um exemplo também do valor que a estatística e a análise de dados podem ter para lá da elaboração de gráficos ou outras visualizações simples, contribuindo para um jornalismo baseado em matemática, mas capaz de ser apelativo e compreensível para os leitores.",Português,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/legislativas-2024-dating-eleitoral/,https://www.publico.pt/2024/03/01/politica/noticia/metodologia-detras-dating-eleitoral-2024-2082180,https://github.com/publico-data/match-eleitoral,,"Rui Barros, José Volta e Pinto e Ana Maria Henriques","Rui Barros: jornalista de dados licenciado em Ciências da Comunicação.  Começou na Rádio Renascença.

This investigation revealed a pattern of targeted killings of Indigenous Guajajara amid the expansion of illegal cattle ranching and logging in the Arariboia Indigenous Territory. The findings unfolded several dozen illegal activities in the region and made a correlation with crimes that remain unpunished.  With four Guajajara people killed and three others surviving death attempts, 2023 marked the deadliest year for Arariboia since 2016. Between 1991 and 2023, 38 Guajajara Indigenous were killed in Arariboia, almost half of the killings in Maranhão state. None of the perpetrators were tried.","The Federal Police, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office and Brazil’s federal environmental agency IBAMA said the investigation’s findings are unprecedented and will be key in operations to remove illegal cattle from the Arariboia. On Feb. 10 they launched an operation to remove invaders from Arariboia using information from this investigation. The Guajajara people also used the investigation in their request to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to protect Arariboia.  Federal prosecutor Alfredo Falcão, who leads the legal case of the murder of Indigenous leader Paulo Paulino Guajajara, said the investigation revealed an excellent correlation between illegal deforestation and killing of Indigenous people and he’ll use it to help Paulo’s case.   In December 2024, the investigation won an Honorable Mention in Brazil’s ARI Banrisul Journalism Award. It was also quoted in the book What Will YOUR Legacy Be? – Conversations With Global Game Changers About The Climate Crisis” released in the UK in February. The book is number 46 on Amazon for Hot New Reads and is already in reprint. In January, it was taken to the World Economic Forum, where it was presented to sustainability leaders. The book will also be released in the US and India.","The Arariboia territory is one of the most threatened Indigenous lands in Brazil — and one of the most dangerous. When Karla was in Arariboia, she heard gunshots as she climbed a mountain inside Arariboia to see the contrast between the vegetation inside and outside the territory. Inside the Indigenous land, the vegetation is green and preserved; outside it is deforested and has been taken over by pasture and cattle farms. The shots came from a farm on the border with Arariboia. Back to her first trip to Arariboia in 2019, she also heard gunshots after visiting an illegal logging campsite in Arariboia that was destroyed by the Guardians.   There were also data constraints to reveal who was behind the tracked environmental crimes. Like most states, Maranhão doesn’t disclose information about the individuals behind self-declared environmental rural registration (CAR) — a key document to investigate land change use in Brazil — claiming secrecy issues under the argument that the information is personal. But Karla obtained the names and the tax IDs of the farmers behind the registrations through her network of high-ranking sources. With that information, she identified  several lawsuits targeting the farmers for environmental crimes and corruption through Jusbrasil platform.","This investigation combined field reporting, data and spatial analysis, satellite imagery, and court documents. A rigorous risk analysis was carried out before going into the field, accompanied by detailed planning of the entire investigation in the field. Dozens of interviews were conducted and public and private databases were analyzed.    We collected all the coordinates where we witnessed illegal cattle ranching and other environmental crimes inside and outside the Arariboia Indigenous Territory.  On the return, we began intensive work analyzing satellite images of the areas where crimes and signs of environmental crimes had been detected. We carried out a spatial analysis using the QGIS program, which proved that the deforestation at the headwaters of the Buriticupu River and an airstrip were illegal, as they overlapped with protected areas, among other crimes.  After lifting the data constraints about the land owners, we disclosed the identity of those responsible for the environmental crimes, along with lawsuits targeting them for corruption.   We built databases on environmental crimes and reports of illegalities on various fronts: images and coordinates collected in the field, images and coordinates collected by the Guajajara people, fines and embargoes for environmental crimes, and target areas of police raids in the region.","One of the key takeaways of this project is the power of QGIS to investigate environmental crimes and how spatial analysis of land change use is key for environmental investigative reporting.    In Brazil specifically, investigative reporters can use QGIS to investigate the self-declared environmental rural registration (CAR), a key document to investigate land change use in Brazil that brings detailed spatial information, including protected areas that should remain untouched within the properties registered in the database.   Using this approach, this investigation shows how QGIS software was crucial to reveal environmental crimes in and around Arariboia. Through QGIS and satellite imagery, it proved that deforestation on the banks of the Buriticupu River headwaters and the construction of an airstrip in Arariboia’s surrounding areas were illegal. QGIS analysis also showed indications of land grabbing in these areas, including the overlap of a farm with an Indigenous territory.  This methodology can be replicated in other investigations.

United Kingdom,BBC World Service’s BBC Eye Investigations,Big,,,The Watermelons: Soldiers spying for pro-democracy rebels,2024-12-20,"Investigation, Cross-border, Documentary, Podcast/radio, Chart, Video, Map, Audio, Politics","QGIS, Google Sheets, R, RStudio","A BBC investigation reveals the limited extent of control by the Burmese military junta, which has wielded power in Myanmar since February 2021. An incredibly detailed assessment of more than 14,000 village groups shows the military now has full control of less than a quarter of the country’s landmass. A patchwork of ethnic armies and resistance groups control 42%, while the rest is largely contested. BBC conversations with rebel leaders also uncovered one possible explanation: the military is riddled with double agents loyal to the opposition. These soldier spies are known as ”Watermelons” - green on the outside, rebel red within.","The story was produced for multiple platforms including a full-length video documentary, podcast, shorter news packages for the main TV and radio bulletins, social media and online articles in English, Burmese, Thai and other languages. The film on YouTube gained an initial 1.2 million views, with high engagement in Thai, Burmese and Indonesian, and the online article in English was read more than 370,000 times. The story was shared by influential accounts on social media with a strong focus on the data findings which have also been cited in reporting by competitor news organisations.","To determine control in each village group, the BBC’s researchers contacted sources across the country to ask a series of questions that would inform a classification - without asking direct questions about a party in power. Due to the security situation, several of the researchers were based abroad and almost all interviews were necessarily conducted by phone. This traditional method was nonetheless aided by modern technologies like secure messaging platforms for the safety of both the researchers and their contacts.   In Myanmar’s complex political environment, several place names have evolved, can be identical or else have multiple ‘local names’. Particularly when physically removed, the researchers had to take extra care to ensure they were recording data for the correct village group. This often required diligent cross-checks of hundreds of datapoints against maps produced across multiple years.  Data collection was an iterative process and was repeated several times over the course of 2024. The results could therefore be checked multiple times against reports from local media, NGOs, the military and armed groups before a final analysis. Development of the methodology was supported by an independent academic with extensive knowledge of the Burmese political landscape.","All data was originally recorded in Burmese in 330 Google spreadsheets - one per Myanmar township. A Burmese journalist then created a duplicate copy in English to be shared with the UK data team and stored in secure shared folders. The data team used R to ingest and clean the data. This was a painstaking process of matching the original dataset with the shapefile containing every village group in Myanmar and a third dataset listing both the names and the polygon codes which could serve as a lookup. At every stage, data needed to be thoroughly checked to ensure all expected matches had been made and no duplicates had crept in.  With the village group’s control status assigned to its respective polygon, the data team performed a spatial analysis to sum the areas of all groups with the same control status and calculate that area as a share of the entire territory. This produced the main data points that headlined the story. An R markdown of all major data findings was circulated to the full team of reporters.  Maps and graphics were produced initially in R, but cleaned up in Qgis and styled using Photoshop and After Effects for different platforms.","Data stories in or about conflict zones often require greater care than usual.   In developing a methodology, our chief consideration was balance. Perception can sometimes be just as influential as brute force in a conflict, and the media-savvy opposition groups were keen to assert their control of an area, while the military ignored requests for interview. We made every effort to contact impartial sources and the military to try and counteract the risk of outsized influence from opposition propaganda.  We understood how a population under attack by a well-armed ruling junta might have greater sympathy for local resistance groups and might be inclined to name the group they _wished_ were in control if asked. As such, it was important our researchers did not ask direct questions about control of an area, but rather focused on mundane aspects of what effective control would look like - asking questions about who ran the schools, courts, police, etc. - and triple-checked everything.  In presenting the findings, we also exercised great caution in designing the map to prevent the non-military groups being perceived as a united bloc: hatched colouring, careful language, and strategically placed labels make removing these guardrails difficult for opportunistic media teams.","English, Burmese, Thai, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Hindi, Bengali, Korean",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c390ndrny17o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8cDs0FgHhc,https://www.bbc.com/burmese/articles/c4g2z59wrg3o,,"Rebecca Henschke, Ko Ko Aung, Jack Aung, Hla Hla Win and the Burmese research team, Charlotte Attwood, Becky Dale, Callum Thomson, Phil Leake, Muskeen Liddar, Pilar Tomas, Kelvin Brown","Rebecca Henschke is a senior reporter with BBC World Service investigations.

Following the publication of this series, numerous messages were received from small-scale fishers via social media and email, expressing a continued commitment to advocating for fisheries issues in Indonesia, which government officials have been accused of exploiting for personal gain.","In December 2023, Indonesia was listed as the sixth worst country out of 152 countries in dealing with illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing).The mass media in Indonesia does not cover corruption and fisheries crime very much, even though 63% of the country is ocean. This happened at the same time as government officials abusing their power and the mainstream media not being able to expose it because they are connected to the oligarchs.The VMS, which is a system to track the movements of fishing and transport vessels operating in Indonesia, was not being used well. Because of this, we used different methods to expose illegal fishing practices in Indonesia.

A investigação analisou 774 processos judiciais e expôs crimes, abusos de autoridade, violações de direitos humanos e falta de transparência. Em 61% dos casos, as imagens não foram entregues à Justiça, comprometendo investigações. A série gerou ampla repercussão, mobilizou o Ministério Público a abrir investigações e resultou no afastamento e prisão administrativa de policiais. Com um olhar equilibrado, mostrou tanto os problemas quanto boas práticas, instigando o debate sobre segurança pública e transparência.","A série teve um impacto imediato e profundo. Revelou falhas sistêmicas na transparência policial, levando o Ministério Público a abrir 12 investigações e a Polícia Militar a afastar e prender administrativamente 15 policiais envolvidos em irregularidades. A repercussão impulsionou o debate sobre controle externo da atividade policial e o uso de tecnologia para garantir direitos. Além disso, ao humanizar agentes e evidenciar boas práticas, a série contribuiu para uma visão mais equilibrada sobre a segurança pública no Brasil, reforçando o papel do jornalismo investigativo na defesa da democracia e dos direitos fundamentais. Além disso, Lente de Aumento inspirou outros jornalistas a aprofundarem suas investigações sobre o uso da tecnologia na segurança pública. A metodologia utilizada — cruzamento de processos judiciais, análise de dados e investigação de campo — tornou-se referência para novas reportagens sobre controle externo da atividade policial em outros estados. A série também foi citada em seminários acadêmicos e debates sobre jornalismo investigativo e direitos humanos, reforçando seu impacto duradouro.","A série Lente de Aumento foi produzida em um cenário político e institucional de forte resistência à transparência e ao controle externo das forças de segurança. A implementação das câmeras corporais pela Polícia Militar do Rio de Janeiro foi completada em 2024 após decisão do Supremo Tribunal Federal em 2022, mas a investigação jornalística revelou que, na prática, essa tecnologia ainda opera com falhas graves de transparência, dificultando o acesso da Justiça e da sociedade aos registros essenciais para investigações e defesa jurídica.  O trabalho enfrentou restrições significativas de acesso a dados. A equipe solicitou os dados via Lei de Acesso à Informação, mas foi preciso recorrer à última instância, porque os prazos para entrega da documentação não foram cumpridos.  A equipe analisou 774 processos judiciais em que a PM foi intimada a fornecer imagens das câmeras corporais. No entanto, grande parte dessas solicitações foi negada ou atendida de forma parcial, o que exigiu uma apuração minuciosa para demonstrar as irregularidades.  Além das dificuldades institucionais, o projeto foi realizado em um contexto de restrição de recursos, com uma equipe reduzida. O trabalho também foi conduzido em meio a um ambiente de crescente hostilidade contra o jornalismo investigativo no Brasil.","A equipe utilizou uma combinação de técnicas de jornalismo investigativo, análise de dados, checagem documental e cruzamento de informações processuais. A equipe acessou e analisou 774 processos judiciais em que a Polícia Militar do Rio foi intimada a fornecer imagens das câmeras corporais. Foram aplicadas técnicas de cruzamento de dados para identificar padrões de omissão no fornecimento das imagens, revelando que em 61% dos casos os registros não foram entregues à Justiça. Analisamos horas de gravações de câmeras corporais, comparando as imagens com depoimentos e outros documentos judiciais. O projeto utilizou planilhas avançadas e softwares de análise de dados (como Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets e Python para organização e tratamento de informações). Ferramentas de OCR (reconhecimento óptico de caracteres) foram usadas para digitalizar e extrair informações de documentos físicos e PDFs não pesquisáveis. As informações foram armazenadas em servidores seguros, com controle de acesso restrito à equipe envolvida na apuração. Para complementar os dados processuais, a equipe realizou entrevistas com advogados, promotores, policiais e especialistas em segurança pública.","A série Lente de Aumento oferece lições valiosas para jornalistas interessados em investigações, especialmente no cruzamento de dados e no uso de tecnologia para analisar processos judiciais. Um dos principais aprendizados é que jornalismo investigativo exige persistência e inovação. A equipe enfrentou barreiras de acesso à informação, mas superou esses desafios combinando análise de dados, entrevistas e verificação independente. Ao longo de seis meses, analisaram horas de gravações, leram documentos e acessaram processos judiciais.  Outro ensinamento importante é a importância da transparência metodológica. Ao documentar cada etapa da apuração e cruzar diferentes fontes, a série garantiu a credibilidade dos achados, um aspecto essencial para reportagens que lidam com temas sensíveis.  Por fim, a série reforça que o jornalismo não deve apenas expor problemas, mas também buscar um olhar equilibrado. Ao destacar boas práticas policiais e os desafios do uso de câmeras corporais, a reportagem qualificou o debate público e teve impacto real, inspirando mudanças institucionais.

By examining over 1,000 financial reports and 500,000 donations, we uncovered critical transparency gaps: 70% of private donations remain anonymous, totaling €660 million in unaccounted funds. While most parties rely on state subsidies, German parties receive substantial private funding. Additionally, far-right and far-left parties secure 25% of all private funding, demonstrating the financial benefits of political power. This project illuminates crucial democratic accountability issues affecting European political systems.","The ”Transparency Gap” investigation exposed the critical lack of transparency in European political funding landscapes, establishing itself as the definitive resource on party financing across the EU. As the first comprehensive cross-border analysis of its kind, the project assembled the most complete dataset on political party funding ever compiled for all 27 EU member states. The investigation generated global attention, with media outlets across continents amplifying its findings. News organizations in South Korea, the United States, Mozambique, and even Russia featured the results, demonstrating the universal relevance of political funding transparency. Transparency-focused NGOs have incorporated the data into their advocacy work, using our findings to strengthen campaigns for stricter disclosure requirements and democratic safeguards. The academic community has expressed strong interest in accessing this valuable dataset for research purposes, recognizing its potential to support empirical studies on political financing and democratic accountability. The database has become a foundational investigative resource, enabling journalists to conduct deeper investigations into specific donors and funding networks. Numerous media organizations have requested access to the data for follow-up reporting and ongoing accountability journalism.","The investigation faced significant challenges due to the fragmented and inconsistent nature of political funding transparency across the EU. Each country has its own legal framework governing the disclosure of donations, with varying thresholds for public reporting and differing interpretations of GDPR. While some nations provide real-time access to donation records, others only release data retrospectively—or require journalists to physically inspect records without the ability to copy or download them, making large-scale analysis nearly impossible.  Navigating this legal and technical patchwork required an innovative, multi-faceted approach. Our team deployed diverse data collection techniques, from scraping and structured database queries to manual transcription in countries where digital access was restricted. Once gathered, the data had to be harmonized into a standardized format, overcoming inconsistencies in reporting structures, currencies, and donor categorizations.  Ensuring data hygiene was another major challenge, as discrepancies, missing values, and varying definitions of ”donations” across jurisdictions required meticulous validation. This project was not just about uncovering the numbers but also about making sense of them in a way that allows for meaningful cross-border comparisons. The complexity of this endeavor underscores why such a comprehensive dataset had never been compiled before.","Each EU country publishes political funding data in a different format, requiring a diverse set of technologies to collect, process, and analyze the information. We employed web scraping for countries with digital records, while for others, we extracted data from PDFs using tools like Tabula and Pinpoint.  Once collected, the data was cleaned and standardized using Python to ensure consistency across jurisdictions. We then stored the structured data in a PostgreSQL database, integrating Metabase as a dashboarding tool. This setup allowed our collaborating journalists to explore, filter, and export data efficiently for their investigations.  To streamline the data collection process, we later used Metabase itself for structured data entry, implementing strict controls to prevent errors commonly introduced by spreadsheets. While some journalists continued working with Google Sheets for specific tasks, we maintained a single, authoritative source of truth within our database.  This technical infrastructure enabled seamless collaboration across borders, ensuring that all team members could access accurate, up-to-date data. The combination of automation, database management, and dashboarding tools was essential to handling the complexity of this unprecedented cross-border investigation.","The investigation offers valuable lessons for journalists tackling complex, cross-border data projects. One key takeaway is the importance of collaborative journalism—pooling expertise from different countries allowed us to navigate diverse legal landscapes, language barriers, and data accessibility challenges more effectively than working in isolation.  Another lesson is that data collection requires flexibility. Each country published political funding data differently, forcing us to adapt—using scraping, manual transcription, or PDF extraction as needed. No single method worked everywhere, so being open to different approaches was essential.  Data standardization is crucial. Political funding data came in different formats, currencies, and structures. To compare them meaningfully, we had to clean and harmonize everything. This step is time-consuming but necessary for making valid cross-border comparisons.  We also learned that a centralized database improves efficiency. By storing all collected data in a PostgreSQL database with Metabase for visualization, journalists across Europe could easily explore, filter, and export information without constantly requesting files.  Finally, data hygiene matters. Maintaining a single source of truth and implementing controls against errors prevented misinformation. These lessons apply beyond political funding—any journalist dealing with fragmented data can benefit from these strategies.","English, Dutch, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Slovenian, Croatian, Italian, Estonian, Greek, Turkish, Finnish, Hungarian, Slovakian",https://www.ftm.eu/articles/eu-party-finances-transparancy?share=oJbcvytTVh36WSPaadqw7pgncHoi2/CrUbPEGSrQAJCEJI%2B4kd/YOwgvW5S1n/A%3D,https://www.ftm.eu/articles/eu-party-finances-populists-are-getting-richer?share=REAAFycduRsBYWqAEGKgYEj372wjNlibC3Pj/roLM9O3yiVt06fXy/c%2BaaHHsF0%3D,https://www.ftm.eu/articles/eu-party-finances-background?share=/A5qvNmigmgi6J%2BY1hneOK1ubpWagf/IhPtX2HCol4hKGprJImNuaE6rYO77M6s%3D,https://www.ftm.eu/transparency-gap,Full list available upon request (approximately 50 journalists),Full list available upon request (approximately 50 journalists)

It examines integrity scandals involving (candadite) Members of the European Parliament. The investigation reveals widespread misconduct, from corruption and fraud to conflicts of interest and harassment. Findings show that nearly one in four sitting MEPs and one in five leading candidates have been implicated in scandals. By analyzing media reports and political records, the project sheds light on the lack of accountability within EU institutions, highlighting the urgent need for stricter ethics enforcement and transparency reforms.","The EU Misconduct Investigation contributed to the debate on political integrity ahead of the 2024 European elections. The first round, which focused on sitting MEPs, led to a follow-up investigation into election candidates, allowing for a broader assessment of political misconduct within the EU. While the project did not spark widespread discussions, it was picked up by various media outlets across different countries, ensuring that the findings reached a relevant audience.  Additionally, the team developed a reproducible methodology for investigating political misconduct. This can be used in future research to track integrity issues over time and assess whether reforms in the European Parliament have had any effect.  Although the project did not lead to immediate political action, it provided concrete data on corruption, fraud, and ethical violations among EU lawmakers. It offered voters additional information about the candidates and highlighted the need for better transparency and accountability. While the overall impact was limited, the investigation contributed to keeping political integrity on the agenda and laid the groundwork for further scrutiny in the future.","A key challenge in this project was ensuring consistent interpretation of political scandals across different countries. Cultural differences made it difficult to align on the severity and meaning of certain terms, as what is considered a serious ethical breach in one country might be viewed as minor elsewhere. To address this, the team developed a methodology, designed to minimize subjective judgment and ensure comparable results across borders.  This approach allowed journalists from diverse backgrounds to work together effectively while maintaining a standardized way of categorizing and assessing misconduct. It also ensured that the findings were as objective as possible, relying on publicly available media reports and clearly defined criteria rather than individual opinions.  Additionally, navigating varying levels of data accessibility across EU member states was a challenge. Some countries have strong traditions of investigative journalism, while others have more restrictive media environments, limiting the availability of public records or in-depth reporting on (political) misconduct.  Despite these obstacles, the project successfully brought together journalists from different backgrounds, creating a scalable investigative model that can be reused for future elections. The methodology ensures that findings remain transparent, repeatable, and resistant to political bias, providing a solid foundation for continued scrutiny of lawmakers.","For this investigation, we used a combination of web scraping, data sharing platforms, and structured data collection tools to ensure consistency and accuracy.  We scraped multiple sources, primarily news websites, to compile a broad dataset on integrity scandals involving MEPs. This data was then shared with colleagues via Aleph, an investigative data-sharing platform. By making pre-scraped data available, we streamlined the research process, allowing journalists to review existing information before conducting their own investigations.  For structured data collection, we used Metabase, a dashboarding tool that enabled real-time data entry. Instead of relying on spreadsheets—where formatting inconsistencies are common—we opted for a database-driven approach. Our colleagues entered information directly into a database, ensuring standardized input fields and reducing errors. This setup provided instant updates, allowing us to track and refine the dataset as new information emerged.  By integrating these technologies, we maintained data integrity, minimized human error, and improved collaboration across multiple countries. The combination of scraping, database structuring, and real-time dashboarding ensured that the investigation remained organized, efficient, and scalable, ultimately allowing for a more rigorous and reproducible analysis of misconduct among EU lawmakers.","This project demonstrates how structured data collection and cross-border collaboration can enhance investigative journalism, especially when dealing with political misconduct. One of the key takeaways is the importance of standardization—cultural differences in interpreting scandals can make comparisons difficult, but using a neutral methodology helps ensure consistency across countries.  By using a database instead of spreadsheets, we avoided common pitfalls like inconsistent data entry and formatting issues. Other journalists can learn from this approach by leveraging structured data tools such as Metabase or similar dashboarding software to maintain clean, up-to-date datasets. This ensures that findings are reliable and reproducible, even in long-term investigations.  Additionally, the use of data-sharing platforms like Aleph made collaboration across borders smoother. Journalists could review existing datasets before gathering their own information, preventing duplication of work and saving valuable time. This is especially useful when working on large-scale investigations involving multiple teams.  Another key lesson is the power of automation in data collection—scraping news websites allowed us to compile large datasets efficiently. For journalists looking to undertake similar projects, integrating scraping techniques and database-driven workflows can help manage vast amounts of information while maintaining accuracy.","Dutch, French, Bulgarian, German, Estonian, Finnish, Greek, English, Croatian, Polish, Romanian, Slovenian, Slovakian, Spanish, Hungarian, Italian",https://www.ftm.eu/eu-misconduct,https://www.ftm.eu/articles/eu-misconduct-investigation-the-candidates?share=8pO6qDmzqsvbCZ/UxFA0vGfjKQ3tW964xj6WKNhwZ6ar0LAjeMgzB5JyUzOoDuk%3D,https://www.ftm.eu/articles/european-parliamentarians-involved-in-hundreds-of-scandals?share=aBPAuZVDuc4wQcqzZjZcevA2i4ZqwHN5gE3McmjxnsW4Ey1etQYnYx5FgfTUrRU%3D,https://www.ftm.eu/bad-press,Full list available upon request,Full list available upon request

We identified some 14 thousand fields (over 42 thousand hectares) where farmers used glyphosate in the early spring to make them cultivable. This could be done by detecting the distinct yellowing of these fields in the early spring. We used this data to calculate the proximity of these fields to schools, protected nature reserves, and drinking water protection zones. We revealed that 700,000 Dutch people live within 250 meters of such fields.","The method we developed for this article produced novel results, which garnered a lot of attention. The article was the best-read article of the year at FTM and the results were published in 7 other regional media, and the main findings were published by the NOS(Dutch public broadcasting company) as well. The analysis gives valuable insights into the far-reaching consequences of the effects of widespread pesticide use in a country as densely populated as the Netherlands. Our article contributed to an ongoing (political) discussion on restricting pesticide use, and as a response, parliamentary questions were also asked. The ability to detect pesticide-use with the help of remote sensing (RS) techniques had never been done before. Therefore, we are also cooperating with the Wageningen University and Research to publish a scientific paper to present our results alongside those from a similar research project.","Restricting the use of pesticides, and the use of glyphosate to completely clear agricultural fields in particular, has been a contested subject in Dutch politics, since around 2018. Over the years, however, several parties from the left and the right have agreed on a reduction in the use of pesticides. The current Minister of Agriculture, a member from one of the parties in the Dutch ruling coalition, the BBB (Party for Farmers and Civilians), is now preventing any progress in this case. Our article has shown how drastic the effects of the widespread pesticide use are and how a large part of the Netherlands is affected by it.  Our methodology breaks new ground in data journalism by harnessing gigabytes of open-source satellite data to reveal environmental impacts invisible to the naked eye. Developed in collaboration with remote sensing experts and reviewed by independent researchers, our approach elevates journalistic investigation beyond traditional reporting. While remote sensing has transformed scientific research, its sophisticated applications remain underutilized in journalism. Our project demonstrates how advanced analytical techniques can transform raw satellite data into powerful visual evidence of widespread pesticide impact, creating accountability where conventional reporting methods fall short.","Our analysis is entirely based on and made with open-source software and data. We retrieved and pre-processed satellite images (European satellite Sentinel-2) from Google Earth Engine. To process the satellite data for the Netherlands, we used the Basisregistratie Gewaspercelen (base register of crop parcels), a public dataset, issued by the Dutch government. The analysis itself was newly constructed for our article, but it is based on peer-reviewed scientific articles. The data that we retrieved was further analyzed, completely in Python. We published the code on GitHub, so peers can check, use, and enhance our methodology. It required lots of geo-data analysis, for which we used well-known libraries like geopandas and numpy. To visualize our results, we also made use of QGIS. We were able to retrieve open data on our living environment to contextualize our detected glyphosate-use. Additionally, we also scraped geo-data from two websites that we then used for our spatial analysis. The model was validated by manually checking more than 5000 satellite images on pesticide application.","Our project demonstrates how open-source software and open-source data can be used to create a very comprehensive research and a novel methodology. Our article is merely an example of the many possibilities that RS data and RS technology can provide. Working with satellite and geodata is, in our opinion, still underused in journalism, while it could aid massively in creating stories that deal with our living environment. It further demonstrates that you do not need expensive data (from Maxar, or Planet Labs) or expensive software (like ArcGIS pro) to undertake such large projects. The published code serves as a starting point for other journalists to be adjusted for their specific use case.

We used this project as an opportunity to reimagine how we could present deep-dive data stories, to help even our most data-averse readers find value and insight into their own lives.","Since publication, Are you rich? has hurtled to the top of the newsroom’s leaderboards for article engagement and subscriptions. On those measures it’s the best performing piece of content since our current metrics system was introduced in 2021.  It’s an unprecedented acquisition driver across every single one of our platforms, including homepage, app, social and newsletters. Its success on paid social is one the primary reasons for the business’s focused investment in the channel in 2024.  What’s more, we’ve also seen a pattern of low subscriber churn on our money tools, suggesting readers truly value being taken ‘under the bonnet’ of a data story to help them understand their own finances.  Our tool has been cited by Forbes as one of just two tools in the market to “help you calculate where you sit concerning British society” - the other being the ONS.  Are you rich? highlights inequalities in society and speaks to a natural curiosity about wealth and how much you earn - a topic that people (especially the British!) don’t typically talk about in real life.","The backdrop and driver to this project was the cost of living crisis. Anxiety about the economy and wealth was high. This flagship project kicked off a wider cross-departmental effort to ‘toolify’ our Money content, giving Telegraph readers the ultimate news-you-can-use experience to help them understand their wealth at a time of great uncertainty.  The design of this project was also crucial to its success. We collaborated with creative motion designers, not just infographics designers, to create an irreverent visual identity to reach as wide an audience as possible.  Animations of tongue-in-cheek signifiers of wealth (Sleek thoroughbred horses! Lobsters! Supercars! Gold!) transform the tool from financial calculator into something approachable and fun - literally making it jump out of the screen, wherever our readers encounter it.   In our business we are well versed in creating fast-turnaround calculators and nifty personalised tools to bring the news to life for readers. Are you rich? represents a huge leap forward - a new and immediately recognisable flagship product for the Telegraph.","Our project involved working with nine different datasets, using Python and the pandas library for in-depth data analysis. By using pandas, we efficiently cleaned, processed, and extracted key insights from the data. To keep everything organised and easy to collaborate on, we structured the data in Google Sheets. Finally, we converted it into JSON format, making it ready for seamless integration into the final project.  We built the application using React as a front-end framework, along with state management, ensuring a fast, responsive experience across both the website and app. Instead of using heavy chart libraries, we custom-built our own, keeping everything lightweight and tailored to our needs. Some charts were tricky to implement, especially when handling edge-case values, but our bespoke approach made it easy to tweak and improve them quickly. This gave us full control over performance, design, and customisation.","This project highlights several key lessons for journalists. First, listening to your audience is crucial – understanding what engages them can shape more impactful storytelling. Secondly, making data-driven journalism fun and engaging helps broaden its reach. Thorough research is essential, especially when creating something truly unique; in this case, nothing similar existed in the British media. Collaboration was also at the heart of the project – one of the biggest cross-team efforts of the year. By involving creative designers (not just infographic specialists), developers, data and visual journalists, paid marketing, social teams, newsletters, SEO experts, and commercial teams, we gave the project a fresh, distinctive feel.

United Kingdom,The Sunday Times,Big,,,Every scary thing Meta knows about me — and you,2024-03-16,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Illustration, Chart","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","This investigation was conducted using open-source intelligence techniques, using subject access requests to retrieve my personal data from Meta and a combination of R Studio and Excel to analyse almost 20,000 HTML files, containing every interaction with Facebook, Instagram and third-party sites where Meta had tracked me. Investigating the opaque data harvesting practices of technology companies is near impossible – so I used my personal data as a microcosm to shed light on these secretive practices.","The article has now been read by 80,000 people, who stayed on the page for almost five minutes on average. It also led to coverage on the BBC, amongst other outlets, and will be central to an upcoming TV documentary. I was also invited to talk about the work at a technology conference in Vilnius, for tech start-ups and other journalists to learn from my techniques and story. Fifteen local councils, several health charities and two NHS Trusts ceased their usage of Meta pixels to track users after seeing the results of this investigation. The Information Commissioner’s Office is also considering further action against health and education companies still using the technology, uncovered by my reporting. Additionally, I worked with The Times’s podcast team to create an episode of ‘The Story’ that could be embedded within the article, to give readers further insight into such a complex topic. It became one of The Times’ most popular podcast episodes at the time.","Data harvesting practices are opaque by design. Subject access requests are one of the only ways to truly interrogate the minutiae of the data companies like Meta collect. During the course of this investigation, I corresponded with Meta and with 63 website and app owners sharing user data via Meta pixels. I worked closely with The Times’s internal legal team to ensure each company mentioned was given adequate time and space to provide a response. After the project was complete, I also spent time helping organisations which had been awakened to the dangers of this technology to remove or limit their usage. Many were not even aware that there were Meta pixels on their websites, and the consequences of this.","The data given to me, in response to my subject access request, was in the form of almost 20,000 HTML files. I built a web scraper in R that pulled together the information on each page - about every app and website that had been sending my activity data to Meta - ready to analyse. I then used an extensive series of pivot tables and other analysis techniques, both in R and in Excel, to interrogate the data. I used the data to create interactive charts, inviting readers to explore the data Meta collected on me in a day and in a year and offering a visual representation of the sheer extent of data being collected from individual users. The interactivity of these elements gave readers the opportunity to engage with the breadth and depth of the data behind this reporting. An animated GIF at the end helped readers to act on that information, guiding them to turn off Meta’s third-party tracking in their own Facebook and Instagram accounts. Together, all of the visual elements sought to demystify data harvesting, and make understanding the practice accessible to the lay reader.","Sometimes, the only way into a story is through you. Subject access requests are a powerful and underutilised tool to interrogate private companies and make inferences about how their practices affect entire populations.  Additionally, there is a large audience of people who have little knowledge of how the internet operates and how companies are collecting their data, but want to understand.

United States of America,InSight Crime,Small,,,InSight Crime’s 2023 Cocaine Seizure Round-Up,2024-03-20,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Database, Open data, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Corruption, Crime","Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","InSight Crime’s 2023 Cocaine Seizure Round-Up analyzes the international cocaine trade from seed to seller. Based on our daily news monitoring, official statistics, and data obtained via public information requests, we identified and analyzed the cocaine trafficking trends in production, transit, and consumer countries for 2023. We combined the data with our extensive fieldwork to better understand the cocaine trade dynamics in the world.  We published this special in both, Enlish and Spanish, and as a PDF.","InSight Crime’s 2023 Cocaine Seizure Round-Up  got 48,755  and generated 1,961downloads, a clear indicator that users found the content engaging.  Media outlets from Trinidad and Tobago, Honduras, the United States, Paraguay, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Spain, Peru, Mexico and Ecuador cited our special. Also, the GJIN included our Round-Up in the Data Journalism Top 10.","As a nonprofit media outlet, InSight Crime published this special in two languages, with resource limitations. Everyone involved had to take on multiple roles, and every part of the process had to be done twice. This was further complicated bythe fact that many governments gave us preliminary data, only to then publish significantly different figures, which meant we had to update graphics, maps and our analysis in both languages. In order to get the data we had to write and file 31 public information requests following different formats in 5 different languages.   Many of these requests were ignored, denied or responded to with incomplete, poorly formated or unreliable data. In these cases, we then had to search public databases, reach out to our sources on the ground, and monitor media outlets to get realiable data through other means.  Getting insights into criminal dynamics from cocaine seizure data is challenging due to the variety of causes that can create an increase or decrease. For example, an increase could be due to more trafficking, better law enforcement strategies, or new inexperienced criminal grups. Knowing which applies to each country requires a lot of desk and field research.","InSight Crime used an AI-assisted monitoring system to hourly scrape news articles from nearly 400 regional and international media outlets, and refine them to the most relevant results. Human researchers further refined the articles, verified the information and built a database to feed our analysis. This database has been updated monthly for over 5 years and includes data on quantity of cocaine seized, means of transportation, seizure country, origin country, destination country and transit countries.   The team utilized AI tools to create freedom of information request templates, and translate and copy-edit the Cocaine Seizure Round-Up related content, before humans revised the final versions.   Graphics were made using JavaScript D3 and Adobe Illustrator.","1. How to combine quantitative data and text on a map to explain complex processes.  2. The importance of telling the stories behind the data. An uptick in Argentina had been claimed as victories against traffickers, but we found that most of the cases were related to small time dealers, not international drug trafficking. 3. The importance of analyzing the data understanding the terminology used in each country. Some countries combine cocaine base with cocaine powder. One dose of cocaine base weighs more than a dose of powder, comparing tons seized without the disaggregated data could mislead the analysis.  4. The importance of including every part of the story to give a complete analysis, even if that leads you to cover geographic areas or topics outside your scope of work. We investigate organized crime in the region, but for this Round-Up we looked at seizures in consumer countries, otherwise we’d have missed half of the story. 5.

Spain,"Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, PumaPodcast, Commoner, Pulitzer Center",Big,,,Grab Fares Surge Under Opaque Algorithm,2024-07-12,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Podcast/radio, Chart, Economy","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, * Rotative VPNs (ProtonVPN, + Tunnelblick + tunblkctl) * Google Maps * Statistical analysis","For six months, our project investigated the fare system of Grab, the most popular ride-hailing app in the Philippines, used by millions of Filipinos. The company advertises that the price for their rides depends on supply and demand, but the way its algorithm calculates these fares is opaque.  Our investigation revealed that customers always pay a so-called surge fee, regardless of booking time and location, which can double the cost of a ride. We also found that higher fees didn’t necessarily mean shorter wait times, which was one of the objectives of surge pricing in the first place.","Our investigation, the first of its kind in the Philippines, exposed how technological innovations like ride-hailing apps are supposed to improve people’s lives, but because their advancement has far outpaced existing laws, benefits tend to be unevenly distributed, with the companies often having undue advantage.  The reports were widely received and sparked public discourse on the use of these widely popular apps. It was PCIJ’s top story of the year. The podcast, aired by PumaPodcast, also gained significant plays.   The coverage also triggered more reporting on platform services using the accountability lens. Reporting went beyond PR-driven or earnings stories.  In December 2024, Philippine Senator Raffy Tulfo led a probe on surge fees imposed by the Transportation Network Vehicle Services in the country, including Grab Philippines.  The lawmaker also sought to investigate the senior citizen and persons with disability discounts that app companies pass onto workers when it should be the companies carrying these costs. This prompted the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board to look into the matter.  Seven months after the publication of the stories, at least two more apps, InDrive and Lala Ride, were launched. Although Grab still dominates the market, customers are able to explore other options.","A combination of factors kept a big tech company like Grab in a favorable position for years.  Ride-hailing apps have outpaced regulations, making oversight problematic. Meanwhile, media ownership and the 24-hour news cycle have made it difficult for many newsrooms to cover technology using an accountability lens.  Philippines cities have one of the worst traffic conditions in the world. Similarly, it suffers from high underemployment. Ride-hailing apps were embraced by many Filipinos because of the immediate benefits.   But this all came at a cost when Grab acquired Uber, nearly monopolizing the two-wheel car service in the country. While other players exist, Grab dominates the market, effectively allowing it to raise prices due to the lack of real competition.  Complaints about Grab -- from irate customers to labor groups -- regularly surface but they often go unnoticed because the stories are essentially anecdotal.  Our investigation set out to provide evidence on one of the most pressing complaints -- that Grab has exploited the country’s dire transportation system by setting premium prices with minimal regulatory oversight.    By building our own dataset, we were able to test Grab’s claims about its surge fees. The irregularities we uncovered underscored the broader issue: the need for algorithmic transparency.","To audit Grab’s fares algorithm, we designed an original methodology for dual data collection, both manual and automatic.  1. We chose 10 routes with pick-up and drop-off points in Metro Manila (train stations, universities, etc.). 2. For one week, a group of 20 researchers attempted to book trips on the app for these 10 routes every hour and logged the data (fare, waiting time, route). We used Google Maps to also calculate the distance. 3. During the same period, a Python bot automatically captured data non-stop every 15 minues for the same 10 routes from a Grab’s API. To avoid bans, we implemented rotating VPNs. 4. We obtained data for more than 8,000 rides. 5. For each ride, we compared the price that would be paid with no surge fee (only time + distance) with the price actually offered by Grab. 6. With the help of statistical experts, we explored other angles, such as the correlation between high fares and waiting times. 7. After analyzing the data and drawing conclusion, we created interactive charts to present the story in a clearer way.  During the investigation, we also used traditional jounalistic techniques such as document analysis, interviews, testimony collection, and field reporting.","Here are some tips we learned in this project about AI accountability:  * Although you can’t get into the ”black box” of an algorithm, you can obtain relevant findings by analyzing its inputs and outputs. The key is to design a methodology for systematic data collection. * You don’t always need advanced coding skills to audit an algorithm: a collaborative/crowdsourced manual data collection can be enough. But it’s important to do a dry run with the research team to set a consistent baseline for how to work with the data, identify weaknesses, and correct errors. * When auditing an algorithm, look for data sources that can supplement missing information. For example, Google Maps allowed us to establish the estimated distance of the rides, a piece of information that Grab’s systems didn’t show. * If you have a lot of data, different variables to analyze and the relationship between them are complex, talk to statistical experts. They will help you identify patterns, strengthen your evidence, and avoid hasty assumptions. * When investigating an algorithm, never lose sight of the human behind the machines. Real testimonies from users and drivers allowed us to show how these systems affect people and the true magnitude of the problem.",English,https://pcij.org/2024/07/12/grab-fares-surge-under-opaque-algorithm/,https://pcij.org/2024/07/12/methodology-pcij-investigation-grab-surge-pricing-model/,https://shows.acast.com/teka-teka/episodes/668f762aa0179c311c251486,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-H1aL6j6VU9qeOADkzAbSBZiYFX13_EWQl714aV9IHI/edit?usp=sharing,"This reporting project was a collaborative effort across multiple disciplines, including journalism, data science, art, and graphic design.

The aim of this data visualization was to not only present the numbers but also depict America in a more realistic and nuanced way — showing a nation that is much more purple and interconnected than the typical red-and-blue maps suggest.",The challenge was to create an innovative representation of the 2024 presidential election results that went beyond traditional approaches. The aim was to not only present the numbers but also depict America in a more realistic and nuanced way—showing a nation that is much more purple and interconnected than the typical red-and-blue maps suggest.  Experts in the field such as Andy Kirk or Kenneth Field said about this project: “One of the best visual concepts I’ve seen all year. (…) Just brilliant.” and “I really enjoy creative ways to map data that’s been mapped a thousand times before. It’s hard to do something new. This acts like a dasymetric dot density map but with a twist by building up in the third dimension”,"The visualization sought to highlight the power of each vote, recognizing the razor-thin margins that have defined recent elections, including those that put Presidents Trump and Biden in the White House in 2016 and 2020. The concept of representing all 160 million votes as grains of sand was developed to convey both the magnitude of voter participation and the complex patterns within the electorate. This approach transformed the data into a dynamic, topographical story, offering a fresh perspective on the election’s results.  This project presents a straightforward yet compelling look at how votes were distributed across the country. Blender was used to simulate millions of particles, each representing a single vote. QGIS handled the geographic data, ensuring accurate placement of votes. Generative AI played a role in building helper-applications to manage repetitive tasks. The result is a map that goes beyond red and blue to showcase the nuanced geography of the election.","This project presents a straightforward yet compelling look at how votes were distributed across the country.

Provided exclusively to the ABC, the custom data spanned two censuses 20 years apart, including same-sex couples for the first time. Our final analysis covered more than 70,000 job combinations across both censuses.  We’re especially proud of this piece because it filled a gap in the academic research in Australia and centres on our own independently-designed methodology. Our visualisations are also unique, blending different chart types to come up with new and innovative ways to truly showcase previously unseen data.","In a world dominated by reports of war, bloodshed, economic turmoil and climate disasters, this story sparked a national conversation about love.   We brought the data to life by weaving real love stories into the numbers. Our public call out for stories (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-21/opposites-attract-or-exactly-the-same-couples-callout/104122752) received over 500 submissions, which we managed, categorised and processed through Zendesk. The final selection was chosen to represent a wide cross-section of jobs, locations, ages, sexualities, physical and mental capacities, and experiences.  Our heatmap, in particular, struck a chord with the data community.

It also generated widespread broadcast coverage, lighting up talkback radio and television panels, and inspiring a podcast episode https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/quick-smart/relationships-/104567092","This project began when our data journalist noticed something odd about her married friends. (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-21/opposites-attract-or-exactly-the-same-couples-callout/104122752) An oddly high proportion of spouses were in the same job – unlike she and her own partner. She set out to find out who was weird: them or her?  But while assortative mating (the tendency to choose partners like ourselves) by job has been studied abroad, no research has focused on this question among Australians. This led to our first challenge: obtaining the right data and designing a methodology that would fill this gap.  What followed was weeks of preliminary discussion with researchers in the field and consultants at the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). We wanted a dataset that would allow us to track changes over time, maximise the granularity of job classifications while minimising low values, and include same-sex couples (something ABS consultants originally advised was impossible). We achieved all these goals.  Data now in hand, key steps in processing included:  * Matching jobs across two decades of workforce changes * Accounting for “mirrored pairs” (e.g. a nurse-police couple duplicated as a police-nurse couple) * Calculating percentages and marriage rates compared to the general population","To blend subjective experience with objective data, this project combined handcrafted digital artistry, authentic user stories, and web development techniques.  A key challenge was working out how to visualise such an enormous and detailed dataset for a busy lay audience. Each of our visualisations fulfilled one of two aims: 1. To show overall patterns in the data (the “big picture”) or, 2. To show people where they fit in the data (the “personal”).   Our early experiments with network charts, chord diagrams and other chart types convinced us that none would tell a clear story: we needed to create something new.  In the end, we adapted our main visualisation (“Who marries whom”), built using D3, from blending a network chart with a treemap. One advantage of the treemap was that it better illustrated the class structure of the workforce. Drawing lines between jobs on this “social map” produced a clear snapshot of the “inwardness” or “outwardness” of any given job: romantic matches that crossed the class divide required a longer linking line, while jobs that kept to themselves or their industry had shorter lines.","This project is an example of the importance and beauty of data in the quotidian. Journalists can learn the value of applying a data-driven perspective to everyday experiences, and how to use deep data analysis to answer what might otherwise seem like banal questions. This story demonstrates how to work with experts in the field to find and customise a complex dataset, design a methodology to answer a data-driven question and use these techniques to fill a gap in the academic research.  Journalists can also learn how to visualise vast amounts of complex data in a way that is both engaging and accessible without “dumbing it down”. It illustrates the importance of thinking beyond standard charts to find the visual form that best represents the story you want to tell. It shows how data stories can still be impactful and uncover hidden trends and nuances, while also being playful and fun.   Lastly, this story demonstrates how to bring quantitative data to life by interweaving it with qualitative data, gathered from a large-scale public call out.

Over months, we obtained vast amounts of police data using freedom of information requests. We combined it with figures from the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research and Australian Bureau of Statistics to create an expanded dataset spanning 20 years and 4.3 million police searches.  We found that searches had soared six-fold over 20 years and that lower socioeconomic, migrant and Indigenous areas were searched at higher rates, despite these searches being no more likely to find anything.","This story raised critical questions about civil liberties and human rights. At a time when the New South Wales Police has been under immense public scrutiny,  it investigated the actions of police and challenged the official narrative justifying police powers to stop and search people without a warrant.

We then analysed this expanded dataset for demographic, geographic and per capita trends, in consultation with independent experts, including statisticians and former police.  Our reporters also made special efforts to include testimony from Indigenous man Raymond Munro, who had previously filed a civil claim against police alleging unlawful searches. It took weeks to find an indigenous person willing to speak on record for this story, as many are understandably fearful that media attention would make them a further target for police.","The challenge was showing why this story should matter to a broad audience, most of whom have never been subjected to a police search.   We opened the story by zooming in on a single data point: a routine stop-and-search gone wrong and caught on camera. Using footage never previously shown outside court, we showed step-by-step how quickly searches could go wrong, and the broader consequences the public. We then “zoomed out” to reveal the scale of the problem and how this was just one among potentially millions of unlawful searches.   We sought to humanise the data by using data-driven illustrations to convey the enormous scale and frequency of searches. These illustrations incorporated testimony (in first-person quotes) from accounts of actual searches in the dataset. We compiled these from law enforcement commission reports, academic research and court documents.   To underscore the unequal application of police powers, we used a series of data visualisations to compare and contrast the pattern of police searches in different parts of the state, e.g. wealthy, disadvantaged, urban, regional, indigenous, etc. We further highlighted this geographical variation using an interactive search that allowed users to explore the data for their area.","Traditional crime reporting often seeks to expose errors or miscarriages of justice through re-examining an isolated case or crime. This story takes this approach further, widening the investigation of a specific case of potential police wrongdoing to examine the broader context and impact of data-driven policing.   This story demonstrates how journalists can use freedom of information laws to unearth vast amounts of data and how to combine that data with other publicly-available datasets to expand the analysis. Journalists can also learn how to blend shoe-leather reporting with data-driven investigation and compelling visualisations to create engaging and impactful stories.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-18/how-proactive-policing-quotas-sent-nsw-police-searches-soaring/103579210,https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/backgroundbriefing/03-stop-and-search-the-numbers-game/103583580,https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/backgroundbriefing/stop-and-search-where-s-brad-01/104214482,https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/backgroundbriefing/stop-and-search-last-moments-before-gunshots-police-nsw-shooting/104214484,"Paul Farrell, Inga Ting, Alex Lim, Thomas Brettell, Katia Shatoba, Jack Fisher, Benjamin Sveen",Reporting: Paul Farrell and Inga Ting Data: Inga Ting  Design and illustration: Alex Lim Development: Thomas Brettell and Katia Shatoba Photography and video: Jack Fisher Fact checking: Benjamin Sveen
Germany,SWR (local chapter of ARD that is the biggest German public braodcaster),Big,,,Cardiac arrest can affect anyone - every second counts,2024-07-16,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Infographics, Health","Animation, Personalisation, Scraping, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostGIS, Python, Node.js","In which region does the ambulance arrive too late? In which rescue service areas is quality management lacking? Where is modern technology, such as first-responder-apps, not being used?  The SWR Data team has uncovered massive shortcomings in the German rescue service. Rescuers are too often too late, especially when it comes to resuscitation and cardiac arrest. From the recognition of cardiovascular arrest to lay resuscitation and rescue by professional rescuers, there is a lack of nationwide and scientific standards in too many regions. The reporters came to this conclusion in an extensive data survey of over 300 rescue service areas.","Following the publication, the minister of health, Karl Lauterbach, acknowledged the shortcomings in the new ”emergency reform”: These standards could save thousands of lives every year.  The interacitve webstory ist personalized (users enter their name, gender and age) and regionalized (place of residence), so users can check their very individual situation. The story provides information about cardiovascular arrests, gender-specific characteristics and important preventive measures. The consequences of delays in treatment are also highlighted, the personal risk becomes clear. The web story also shows constructive approaches, e.g. to the question of what can first responders do?","In addition to the extensive data retrieval and analysis and around 1 1/2 years of research, the Data team worked with so-called “data reports” - automatically tailored for all reporters in ARD (biggest German public broadcaster, where SWR is part of) for each of the almost 300 rescue service areas.  Federal state data reports were also compiled. With these data reports, the colleagues were able to go out and research relevant stories on the local level, consult experts and confront responsible institutions. This networking within ARD had never existed before. This way of researching - working with tailored and automated data reports -, focused on sharing research results and intensive collaboration with colleagues, has the potential to place important topics in a targeted manner, stimulate societal discussion and make tech-driven methods usable for all reporters. As a result of this networking, more than 20 million people in Germany learned about the results of the research on the two publication days in July 2024 - through national news coverage in print, radio and television.","The team created 300 data reports - automated and tailored to the individual 300 rescue service areas. These data reports summarized individual data evaluations, visualizations, interpretation aids and local contacts. With the help of these reports, the reporters on site were able to get a comprehensive picture of how well the rescue service area in their region is functioning. This made it possible for reporters who otherwise have little or no data skills to conduct data-driven research and confront authorities with the results.","Automation and the sharing of research results with colleagues throughout ARD means that research teams are able to make topics truly relevant nationwide. This means that local reporters benefit just as much as, for example, colleagues who do investigative and national work.",German,https://notfallrettung.swr.de/,,,,"Authors: Jan Russezki, Maren Krämer  Research Team: Gina La Mela, Tom Burggraf, Patrick Hünerfeld, Katharina Forstmair  Webdevelopment: Simon Jockers, Felix Michel, David Will  Data analysis and Automation: Ulrich Lang, Ina Kohler, Natalie Widmann  Data Engineering: Heiko Sonnenberg, Michael Kreil  Editors / Production: Nico Heiliger, Johannes Schmid-Johannsen, Elisa Harlan  Design: needs people GmbH","SWR’s data journalism team researches connections, backgrounds and new findings with the help of data and technology.

I spent three days documenting how these survivors have created resilient systems of agriculture, education, and community despite regular attacks and institutional neglect. The report contrasts official narratives of ”controlled situations” with harsh realities where children are born without documentation and gunfire interrupts daily routines. Through personal stories of women like Aïssata, who carries seven names of buried loved ones, the piece reveals how mere existence becomes revolutionary in contexts of deliberate forgetting.","The most profound impact of ”Seeds and Bullets: Aldjé Women’s Reality” manifested in the transformation of women themselves.  ”For years, I dug graves and planted seeds without anyone noticing our existence,” Aïssata told us during our follow-up visit. ”Now when I speak, I feel heard. The weight of my words carries beyond our forgotten land.”  Most significantly, inspired by our visit, the women established their own storytelling collective, documenting their experiences with determined authenticity. ”We were subjects in your story,” Hauwa told us, her voice steady with newfound purpose. ”Now we are the authors of our own.”  Local government officials called the piece ”eye-opening,” though actions have lagged behind words. Participating in an international competition like the Sigma Awards will amplify these women’s reality to the world and create essential pressure for the government to move beyond acknowledgment to meaningful action.  ”Your story didn’t save us,” Falmata stated clearly, her eyes reflecting both caution and hope. ”It reminded the world we exist, which could allow us to be saved.”  The true measure of impact comes from Maimouna, the 71-year-old keeper of village memories: ”When we tell our grandchildren this story, your visit will mark the day we stopped being forgotten.”","Our investigation into Aldjé camp took place under increasing governmental restrictions on press access to conflict zones in northern Cameroon. While the government claims the Boko Haram threat is “under control,” informal camps remain deliberately unrecognized to keep official displacement numbers low.  Gaining access to Aldjé required weeks of planning and an anonymous source within the World Food Program. As an independent journalist, I had to work without press credentials to avoid being turned away. A so-called “minor skirmish” in the article was more severe than reported; we deleted footage to prevent potential accusations of spreading “terrorist propaganda.”  sØulscript operates without major institutional support. Our small team lived inside the camp, offering unprecedented access. Local fixers risked their safety to document these overlooked communities.  Official data had to be cross-checked with multiple sources. NGO workers provided confidential records anonymously. Women, fearing reprisals, could only speak through coded interviews.  This story marks the start of a year-long documentation project, with quarterly returns to continue shedding light on the realities of displacement in Aldjé.","As an independent journalist with limited resources, I relied on simple yet effective tools and approaches:  Equipment - Small, consumer-grade camera (Sony) that didn’t attract attention -A smartphone to avoid being detected in some places - Zoom H5 audio recorder - Notebook and pen when technology wasn’t safe to use  Reporting Techniques - Lived in the camp for 72 hours instead of visiting briefly - Conducted interviews in local languages with trusted translators - Used coded conversations when discussing sensitive topics - Protected identities by photographing far  - Recorded environmental sounds to capture gunfire and warning systems  Verification Methods - Built relationships with five local contacts who could verify incidents - Cross-checked stories between multiple sources - Compared testimonies with available NGO data - Used clear consent process at multiple stages  Storytelling Approach - Combined personal stories with factual analysis - Used descriptive language to bring readers into the environment - Created a WhatsApp direct support channel where readers can help the community  This approach allowed me to document this forgotten crisis authentically despite governmental restrictions and limited resources.","The power of sustained presence cannot be overstated. By spending three full days in Aldjé, I witnessed daily routines, night conditions, and a ”minor skirmish” that revealed how violence has become normalized. These insights are impossible through brief visits.  Safety often comes through simplicity. My consumer-grade camera attracted less attention than professional equipment, and sometimes a notebook proved safer than digital tools. Blending in protects both journalist and sources.  In regions where traditional verification is impossible, building a network of local contacts creates a reliable fact-checking system. Multiple perspectives on the same event strengthen reporting integrity when official sources are unreliable.  The women of Aldjé aren’t just victims – they’re active agents of survival. Highlighting their agricultural initiative demonstrated resilience without minimizing suffering, countering both exploitation and condescension in crisis reporting.  Establishing ongoing communication after leaving creates accountability. The promise ”We will return” must be kept to build lasting trust in communities accustomed to abandonment.  Literary techniques aren’t decorative, they’re investigative tools that convey emotional truths traditional reporting misses. The narrative itself becomes evidence.",English,https://soulscript.ghost.io/the-forgotten-women-of-aldje/,,,,Aïsha Moyouzame | Independant journalist,"Aïsha Moyouzame is an investigative journalist specializing in African development, human rights, and multimedia storytelling.

Egypt,"Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ), The New Arab, The Immigrant",Small,,,”Syrian Palestinians” in Egypt.. When children are kept out of the classroom in the name of the law,2024-07-21,"Investigation, Cross-border, Immigration, Human rights",Microsoft Excel,"Investigation provides that Palestinian Refugees from Syria in Egypt, are almost systematically denied access to education. because of the Egyptian government’s refusal to issue residency permits for this specific sub segment of the Palestinian population (with Syrian Travel Document)  and, refusal to give UN agencies (UNHCR, UNRWA) a mandate to provide services to them. So hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Palestinian children have been sitting outside of schools, many of them for more than a decade, after their families fled the war in Syria to start a new life in Egypt. Some children have never been in a class Ever.","The investigation generated significant reactions, as the UNHCR representative in Egypt met with the Egyptian Minister of Education to discuss the deprivation of Palestinian children, along with other refugee children, of formal education in Egypt. As a result, the Ministry allowed Syrian, Palestinian and Sudanese refugee students to be re-registered and enrolled in public schools. An Egyptian opposition MP Tareq Radwan submitted a request to discuss the issue in parliament. Human rights and civil society organisations launched campaigns in solidarity with Palestinian refugees in Egypt. Some of these groups offered to provide legal and psychological support to the families mentioned in the investigation. An action group based in the UK which is Action Group For Palestinians of Syria  praised the investigation, hoping that it would lead to an international response to this humanitarian crisis. The investigation was published in “The New Arab”, a London-based news website with an established UK audience. The investigation was published in ARIJ and “The New Arab” and The “Immigrant”. Between publication till now the article’s webpages had nearly More than 60 000 Views.","Although obtaining information on these refugees appears nearly impossible, as UNRWA does not maintain records on them, the ARIJ network managed to gather data on approximately a hundred Palestinian families holding Syrian refugee documents. The findings reveal that Palestinian children are being denied access to education. We undertook an unprecedented effort to distribute questionnaires to around 100 Palestinian families from Syria. Maintaining the confidentiality of the documented information was a crucial and sensitive matter to ensure these individuals were not exposed to risk or legal repercussions. A third of the respondents have been completely deprived of education, including online learning resources and tutoring groups, while nearly half have been studying outside formally recognized schools.   Palestinian refugees from Syria in Egypt are also unable to obtain legal representation. Their voices are therefore silenced when crimes are committed against them. The investigation came at an important time, coinciding with international calls and plans to deport Palestinians to Egypt. Moreover, UN agencies such as UNRWA, UNHCR, and even NGOs do not have any data or statistics on the number of Palestinian refugee children holding Syrian documents living in Egypt.","The data was collected by a structured survey. Microsoft Excel was used to store and clean data. Also, Excel was utilized for analysis. Flourish was employed for data visualization. In the investigation, we relied on data collection by distributing questionnaires to hundreds of families whose members hold Syrian Travel documents. Subsequently, Several families highlighted in the survey were interviewed, and we obtained parental consent to speak with the children. Figma was used for design.","Before starting the investigation, we reached out to international organizations, including UNRWA and research centers specializing in writing about Palestinian refugees, in an effort to obtain data on the Palestinian Refugees from Syria (PRS). However, the responses from these organizations revealed that none of them had data on these individuals, as if these refugees were an invisible community. This made us even more determined to carry out the investigation, and we decided to collect data ourselves. Investigations help Journalists to make a courageous decision to uncover untold stories of  marginalized communities. Investigative work requires significant effort, and the absence of official data does not necessarily mean that the investigation cannot be conducted. A journalist’s access to the affected community and gaining the trust of those impacted play a crucial role in obtaining data, and giving them a voice through which they can speak about their suffering. Additionally, maintaining confidentiality of data is essential. Furthermore, analyzing data in an impartial and objective way is crucial to uncover stories that accurately reflect the reality people are living.","English, Arabic",https://arij.net/investigations/syrian-palestinians-egypt-en/,https://www.newarab.com/investigations/syrias-palestinians-egypt-denied-right-education,,,"Ehab Zidan, Andrea Glioti, Anas Ambri","Ehab Zidan  Ehab is an Egyptian investigative and Data journalist. specialized in covering Refugees, Migrants, Minorities, and Human Rights, in addition to having significant expertise in Environmental Journalism.

United States of America,"Bloomberg News, Airfinity",Big,,,Global Surge in Infectious Diseases Post Pandemic,2024-06-14,"Explainer, Database, Podcast/radio, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment, Covid 19, Health","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL","Bloomberg News reached out to Airfinity in April 2024, investigating a story on why people around the world are getting sick at a seemingly higher frequency after the pandemic than pre-COVID times.  The journalists had noticed a surge in a variety of different diseases and needed a clear independent dataset that illustrated whether diseases were claiming a resurgence, where this was occurring, and what were the drivers.  Airfinity’s data-driven approach helped pinpoint where and why these trends were occurring, offering valuable insights into the global health landscape and the ongoing impact of pandemic-related disruptions on infectious disease patterns.","Our analysis illustrates a resurgence of all 13 diseases investigated, with cases higher than before the pandemic in many regions. More specifically, 44 countries or territories reported at least one infectious disease resurgence that is 10-fold or more over their pandemic baseline. The findings highlighted three key drivers behind these outbreaks: falling vaccination rates, declining population immunity and climate change disruptions.  The study was published as the top story across all Bloomberg News’ platforms and territories, including use in its newsletters and podcasts, receiving over 150,000 direct views online and over 3 million on Apple News. The podcast episode recorded more than 50,000 downloads. The work was subsequently picked up by CNN, in The Telegraph, British Medical Journal, Tortoise News, Mirror, in the Global Investigative Journalism Network Top 10, and other European outlets from Switzerland, Spain, and France.   We believe this collaboration provided valuable insights into the global health landscape and the ongoing impact of pandemic-related disruptions on infectious disease patterns. The report brought greater awareness toward public health challenges that might otherwise remain overlooked and spotlighted where policy makers needed to focus their efforts.","This project aimed to address a major information gap in public health intelligence by assessing how infectious diseases rebounded after the disruptions caused by COVID-19.   Surveillance reports typically focus on multiple diseases within a single country or a single disease across a region, often with limited time granularity. This highlights the absence of large, collated datasets that provide the most up-to-date information. This project addressed that gap by delivering a comprehensive, near real-time, multi-disease global comparison—an innovative approach not previously attempted at this scale.  The study faced several data accessibility challenges. Data was compiled from over 60 organizations and public health agencies, each with varying reporting standards. Many low-resource settings lacked consistent surveillance, requiring the team to manually supplement gaps using news reports and alternative sources. Another challenge was data inconsistency, as reporting formats and case definitions differed across countries and organizations, necessitating extensive data standardization.  On Airfinity’s platform, we added an interactive spike map to showcase the study with more granularity for the public. This bespoke visualization method allowed for intuitive comparisons. By quantifying fold-changes in reported cases across multiple diseases and regions, this work provided new, actionable insights for policymakers and global health organizations navigating the post-pandemic recovery.","This project leveraged Airfinity’s multi-level database that collects, curates and standardizes data from a variety of sources, advanced programming techniques, and validation methods to ensure the most comprehensive and accurate dataset possible.  The data pipeline began with querying Airfinity’s database that filtered national-level case counts, aggregated reports from different time intervals, and standardized cumulative values.   To analyse trends, an R script was developed to programmatically select appropriate pre- and post-pandemic baselines considering disease epidemiology, and calculate fold-change for each disease-country combination.This automated approach allowed for rapid, unbiased comparisons across the dataset, reducing the risk of manual selection bias.  A key innovation was the use of spike maps, where spike size represented the fold-change between the baseline and post-pandemic years. This visual representation method was particularly effective in highlighting geographical trends in disease resurgence that would have been difficult to interpret using raw tables.  To ensure data quality, supplementary manual validation was conducted. Specialists cross-referenced figures with alternative sources, direct public health agency reports, and ad-hoc Google searches to identify discrepancies. This rigorous approach ensured that the final dataset was both highly accurate and actionable for decision-makers.","This collaboration between Airfinity and Bloomberg News showcases the power of data-driven journalism in uncovering and contextualizing global health trends.  By leveraging Airfinity’s analysis of data from over 60 organizations and public health agencies, Bloomberg was able to build a comprehensive, evidence-based story. This partnership strengthened both the depth and credibility of reporting, combining cutting-edge analytical expertise with compelling journalistic storytelling to engage a broader audience.  The project also shed light on an underreported global health issue. The analysis revealed that declining vaccination rates, reduced population immunity, and climate change are driving the resurgence of diseases such as measles, whooping cough, and dengue. By highlighting these underlying causes, the report brought greater awareness to critical public health challenges that might otherwise remain overlooked.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-06-14/why-is-everyone-getting-sick-behind-the-global-rise-in-rsv-flu-measles,https://us-east-1.envoy.cirrus.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-14/sick-with-covid-flu-or-rsv-here-s-what-s-behind-the-global-illness-surge?srnd=undefined,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-17/yes-people-really-are-getting-sick-more-often-after-covid?srnd=undefined&sref=KodwJrjT,https://www.airfinity.com/articles/global-surge-in-infectious-diseases-as-over-40-countries-report-outbreaks-10,"Bloomberg News team: Jinshan Hong, Bhuma Shrivastava, Rachel Chang Airfinity team: Kristan Piroeva, Jaqueline Buchanan, Lucy Pelton","In Bloomberg News: Jinshan Hong is a data journalist covering business dynamics and public health topics.

The BBC Eye film hears from Uyghurs who say they were forced to pick tomatoes and were severely punished, even tortured, for failing to reach quotas. It follows the trail of the paste charting, for the first time, the route from start to finish. Using cutting-edge testing , the film shows how tomato purees sold as Italian in UK and German supermarkets are likely to actually be Chinese.","The investigation had significant impact in the UK Parliament. The film was discussed in both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and the government is now reassessing labelling and is reviewing the Modern Slavery Act. The Business and Trade Select Committee also addressed the issue, with Tesco acknowledging technical failings at a supplier and ceasing operations with them. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has launched an inquiry, inviting the BBC team to provide evidence. The investigation has reached millions globally, inspiring further journalistic inquiries worldwide.","The investigation Blood on the Shelves was carried out under particularly difficult and sensitive circumstances.  The investigation faced significant challenges due to the restrictive environment in Xinjiang, making it impossible for journalists to report directly from the region. This necessitated the use of open-source investigative techniques to gather evidence. Moreover, the subject of the treatment of Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities inside Xinjiang is an incredibly sensitive topic   The team had limited access to human sources on the ground, relying heavily on testimonies from exiled Uyghurs and Kazakhs. They also faced difficulties in obtaining customs data, requiring collaboration with organizations like C4ADS to analyse shipments.  The team used innovative methods to access and analyse data, including satellite imagery, social media videos, and shipping records. This was crucial in tracing supply chains and verifying claims of forced labour.  Advanced technologies were used to analyse the chemical profile of tomato puree, showing it to be likely that the puree was made using Chinese tomatoes rather than Italian ones. This technology played a pivotal role in exposing the issues within supply chains.","The investigation used social media videos, often available briefly before being removed by censors. These provided evidence of the mass movement of ethnic minorities under ”poverty alleviation” schemes. By piecing together elements like license plates and bus signage, the team highlighted how individuals are moved under duress hundreds of miles from home to work in industries like tomato processing. The videos captured officials collecting people from their homes for transfer to work, corroborating policy documents and leaked directives gathered by the team.  The team traced shipments of millions of kilograms of tomato paste from Xinjiang to Italy by train and sea. This represents the first comprehensive overview of this supply chain. For months, the team struggled to find customs data showing regular shipments. Working with C4ADS, they analyzed numerous data providers, product codes, and routes.  The team uncovered huge shipments from Xinjiang Guannong, a US-sanctioned tomato company owned by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, to Italian companies. These companies are major suppliers to UK and German supermarkets. Using advanced technology, the team demonstrated that the profile of own-label tomato puree in many European supermarkets matched Chinese tomatoes rather than Italian tomatoes.","The investigation offers valuable insights into journalistic techniques, particularly in challenging environments like Xinjiang.   The investigation shows the utility and importance of open-source intelligence, including social media, satellite imagery, and corporate records to uncover evidence when direct reporting is difficult. This approach allows journalists to gather data without being physically present.  The team collaborated with experts like Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists and used advanced technology to analyse data and track shipments showcasing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in investigative journalism.  By analysing shipping data and tracking routes, the team was able to follow the supply chain from Xinjiang to European supermarkets. This shows how data-driven journalism can reveal complex networks and supply chains.  Incorporating testimonies from those affected, such as Uyghurs and Kazakhs, adds depth and human perspective to the story. This emphasizes the importance of personal narratives in investigative reporting.","English, Mandarin, Uyghur",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtv_1eafJn4,https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0k7wllr,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crezlw4y152o,,"Runako Celina, Alison Killing, Storm Theunissen, Max Hudson, Nick Follows, Reva Childs, Mike Rudin, Liz Gibbons","BBC Eye is the investigations unit within the BBC World Service producing high quality investigative documentaries on subjects as varied as sexual abuse scandals within the K Pop industry, the role of Bulgarian organised crime in the downfall of the Missing Cryptoqueen, and uncovering the perpetrators of devastating loan scams in India."

The project analyzed over 72,000 letters sent by citizens to the Constituent Assembly, uncovering key themes and profiles of the authors. It also made the archive accessible through an interactive platform that allows users to explore the letters. By combining visual storytelling and artificial intelligence to analyze unstructured data, the report bridges past and present, fostering transparency and highlighting the importance of civic participation in shaping democracy.","The project received widespread positive feedback and had a significant impact in multiple areas. On social media, educators shared plans to use the content as teaching material in classrooms, while researchers used the project as a source for developing new academic studies. Citizens rediscovered letters written by relatives and friends more than three decades ago, reviving personal and historical memories. Journalists were also influenced: O Estado de S. Paulo, one of Brazil’s most prominent newspapers, used the data to produce a new story, interviewing letter authors and expanding the initiative’s reach. Additionally, making the database available for download promoted public transparency and empowered academic and journalistic communities. The project demonstrated how historical archives can be revitalized with modern technologies to engage diverse audiences and inspire meaningful conversations about democracy and civic participation.","Brazil is currently experiencing intense political polarization, with significant challenges to democracy and civic engagement. In this context, ”The Dream Constitution” offers an inspiring example of citizen participation during a period of democratic renewal. The project faced significant technical challenges: the letters dated back to the 1980s, a largely pre-digital era, requiring digitization and organization into an accessible database. Additionally, analyzing the textual content of the messages demanded the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to categorize unstructured data into key themes in a way that could be easily understood by readers from diverse backgrounds. Despite these barriers, the team succeeded in transforming a historical archive into a modern, visually engaging interactive tool.","The project used a robust set of technological tools to transform a historical archive into an interactive digital experience. Textual analysis of the letters was conducted using artificial intelligence algorithms—including semantic vectorization and clustering—implemented in Python. This approach made it possible to identify thematic patterns in the messages sent by citizens. The web application was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive interface accessible on both mobile devices and desktops. The interactive search tool was powered by a JSON-structured database, optimizing processing within the browser. The entire design prioritized UX (user experience) principles, ensuring intuitive and functional navigation. These technological resources not only modernized the presentation of historical content but also made the data accessible to the general public.","“The Dream Constitution” highlights how modern techniques can revitalize historical archives, turning them into appealing narratives for diverse audiences. The combination of artificial intelligence techniques with visual storytelling provides a replicable approach for journalists working with large volumes of unstructured data, such as the content of these letters. Additionally, it reinforces the importance of public transparency: by making the entire database open for download, the project fostered civic engagement and empowered academic and journalistic communities.

The series was republished by other publications and inspired interviews, forums, roundtables, and more reports.","Data about political families or politicians in general have become difficult to map because of the lack of or the limited access to documents such as the Statement of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth (SALN), which includes a portion about their business interests, financial connections, and relatives in government. Today, only two of the seven repositories of SALNs allow for requests to be made. The rest either require permission from the SALN declarant themselves or the request needed to be deliberated by the all Supreme Court justices or members of the House of Representatives.","PCIJ has a rich database on political dynasties in the Philippines, but the dataset needed to be updated. The same families appeared to control politics in the country, but the children have replaced their parents in the positions. To update the data, the PCIJ editorial staff worked together with 9 interns to map the political dynaties seeking positions in the 2025 midterm elections. It was important to produce quick data that will inform public discourse soon after filing of candidacies. With the guidance of the PCIJ editors, the research team looked at all available data including Comelec lists, reports from reliable news agencies, and the social media pages of the candidates, who posted photos of their own certificates of candidacies. Each name in the datasets was individually vetted by PCIJ editors. The data made use of Flourish and Datawrap to visualize the data in maps. A talented artist also provided illustrations. The series began as quickly as two weeks after the filing of candidacies.","Despite access limitations, there are other ways to report on political dynasties.

Spain,Newtral,Big,,,’Is my building at risk of flooding?’: Using cadastral data to inform about the streets and buildings built in flood-prone zones of Spain,2024-11-27,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, Illustration, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Economy","Python, Linux subsystem on Windows, Tippecanoe","In the context of Spain’s extreme weather phenomena, such as the DANA of Valencia, which last year caused a death toll of over 200 people, Newtral’s data-driven investigation of flood-prone buildings, reveals that at least 200,000 structures are at risk of flooding, compromising thousands of citizens’ lives all over the country.  This data project crosses traditional urban and soil studies of flood-prone areas in Spain with data from the National Cadastral, allowing us to map vulnerable buildings city by city and street by street, and providing audiences with key risk-prevention information.","Our project had a significant impact by revealing the scale of flood risk in Spain, identifying over 200,000 buildings in high-risk zones. Following the DANA that devastated Valencia and caused over 200 deaths, our interactive map serves as a crucial tool for raising awareness among residents, policymakers, and urban planners. By combining official flood hazard maps with cadastral data, we provided an unprecedented street-level view of vulnerable buildings. This approach made the information more tangible and actionable, helping communities understand their risk-exposure in the case of extreme weather events. The investigation sparked discussions among urban planners and environmental policymakers, emphasizing the need for better urban resilience and flood prevention measures. Our methodology, which optimizes large geospatial datasets for clear and accessible visualizations, offers a scalable model that can be applied to other regions in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean area, where extreme weather events and flooding are on the rise. The project’s interactive nature also encouraged public engagement, allowing users to explore their neighborhoods and assess their risk. As floods become more frequent due to climate change, this work highlights the urgent need for data-driven policymaking to further regulate hazardous construction models, and protect communities and infrastructure from future disasters.","This project was developed in the context of increasing climate-related disasters in Spain, particularly in the Mediterranean region, where extreme weather events such as floods are becoming more frequent and severe. The DANA that struck Valencia, leaving over 200 deaths, highlighted the urgent need for accurate, accessible data on flood risk to inform both policymakers and the public. One major challenge was data access and processing. While Spain’s Ministry for Ecological Transition provides flood hazard maps, they are not directly linked to cadastral data, making it difficult to quantify how many buildings are at risk. To overcome this, we extracted geospatial data from the national cadastral system, which is only available province by province, requiring extensive automation using Python scripts. Another key challenge was data visualization. Handling large datasets in Mapbox initially proved unmanageable due to performance and cost constraints. To solve this, we implemented Tippecanoe, a tool that converts large geospatial datasets into tile-based formats, optimizing performance without losing accuracy. This project stands out for its innovative use of open data, geospatial programming, and advanced mapping techniques, making it a scalable model for flood risk assessment in Spain and beyond.","To execute this project, we relied on a combination of geospatial data processing, programming, and advanced mapping technologies to handle large datasets efficiently and visualize them in an accessible way.  **Data Collection & Processing** - Python: Used to automate the extraction of cadastral data from Spain’s national database, which is only available province by province. We wrote scripts to batch download, extract, and process the relevant geospatial files. - GeoJSON: Format used to structure and analyze geospatial data, allowing us to overlay flood risk zones with building locations. **Data Analysis & Optimization** - Geospatial Python libraries (GeoPandas, Shapely): Enabled us to compare and quantify how many buildings are located in flood-prone areas. -Tippecanoe (by Mapbox): A crucial tool that converted large geospatial datasets into tile-based formats, allowing us to optimize performance and ensure smooth visualization in web browsers. **Visualization & Mapping** - Mapbox: Used to build an interactive, scalable flood risk map. The use of tile-based mapping allowed us to dynamically load data, reducing processing weight and improving accessibility.  This combination of tools allowed us to transform complex geospatial data into a clear, interactive, and impactful visual tool, making flood risk assessment more accessible to the public.","This project provides valuable lessons for journalists working with geospatial data, open-source tools, and large-scale mapping projects.    **1. Working with Open Data Effectively** Journalists can learn how to source, clean, and process public datasets—even when they are not readily available in a structured format. In this case, we combined flood risk maps from the Ministry for Ecological Transition with cadastral data, which had to be manually downloaded and processed province by province. **2. Automating Data Processing**   Handling large datasets manually is impractical. By using Python and geospatial libraries, journalists can automate repetitive tasks, such as downloading, cleaning, and structuring information. This saves time and allows for more ambitious investigations.   **3. Optimizing Data for Visualization** Large datasets can be difficult to display interactively. Tippecanoe allowed us to transform heavy geospatial data into tiles, making them load efficiently on a web map. This technique can be applied to other projects, such as mapping wildfires, urban development, or war damage.   **4. Translating Data into Public Impact** Beyond technical skills, this project shows the importance of making data understandable. A clear, interactive visualization helps citizens grasp risks in their area, demonstrating how journalism can drive awareness and policy discussions on climate-related issues.",Spanish,https://www.newtral.es/edificios-riesgo-inundacion/20241127/,,,,Miguel Ros,"Data journalist passionate about technology and communication.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,,,Housing Crisis in Spain: How Concentration of Property and Rising Rents are Increasing Inequalities,2024-09-07,"Investigation, Explainer, Breaking news, Database, Chart, Map, Economy","Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, CSV, R, RStudio","This project delves into Spain’s housing crisis, focusing on key issues such as large property ownership, rising rents, the seasonal rental boom, and the increasing inequalities between landlords and tenants. Through a series of stories, it sheds light on the growing concentration of housing in the hands of a few landlords, the dramatic rise in rental prices across the country, and the impact of short-term rentals on availability. Using data-driven insights and visual elements to show unpublished data, the project highlights the social and economic consequences of these housing trends, providing a comprehensive view of Spain’s escalating housing affordability problem.","This series collaborated to the rising awareness of the housing crisis in Spain, a problem that deeply affects citizens, providing concrete and new data on the concentration of property ownership, rising rents, and the seasonal rental boom, among other issues.  The interactive maps and data visualizations made the complex housing issue accessible and relatable for a wider audience, empowering readers to understand and put numbers to how these trends affect their daily lives.   Some of the data was published for the first time, like the multiple owner’s article, the data of which came from an FOI request about anonymized data of all dwellings landlords in Spain. Or the increasing seasonal rental offer, published after multiple data scrapping of major listing platforms, developed by this media for the first time in Spain. This revealed how homeowners bypass the law designed to reduce rent prices and added a data-driven perspective on how this new law impacted the rental market.  In other cases, we used an innovative approach to publish the data, like the rental map which showed the percentage of the user’s income which should be spent to rent a home in each housing block in Spain.","The housing crisis in Spain is an issue on top of the country’s political agenda. Housing is one of the most mentioned as the first problem in Spain nowadays, especially among young people.  The project was developed at a time when housing was becoming an increasingly contentious topic, with political parties across the spectrum proposing different measures to address the crisis and following multiple demonstrations in different Spanish cities. The data team used that this topic was hot on the agenda to unveil data that was not published transparently or that was hard to get for the public, using FOI requests, scrapping, and granular data analysis.  For example, by the analysis of survey microdata, we could show the increasing inequalities between tenants and landlords, with findings such as the share of tenants who pay more than 30% of their income for housing and the widening gap between landlords and tenants’ wealth.","The project utilized a variety of tools and techniques to collect, analyze, and present data. Data scraping techniques were used to gather information on rental prices for the seasonal rentals article, official data analysis was used for the rental map, and a long FOI request was the basis for undercovering landlords who own multiple dwellings and publish this data by municipality.   R and RStudio were used for data wrangling and analysis. To present the data in a compelling way, the team used data visualization tools such Datawrapper, Flourish and the Javascript library D3. These visuals helped illustrate the rise in rental prices and the concentration of property ownership across Spain, making the complex data more accessible to a broad audience.  Additionally, Mapbox was the tool used to program the map of rental price trends at a street-by-street level, offering readers a detailed look at how the crisis plays out in different regions of Spain. This map was also interactive, adapting its scale to the proportion of the reader’s income he would have to spend to pay the rent in each city block.","This project demonstrates the power of data journalism in uncovering hidden stories that have a profound impact on society. It can be an example of how to tackle complex, multifaceted issues like housing by breaking them down into concrete topics using data analysis. The project shows that, even with limited resources, it is possible to produce high-impact journalism by leveraging open data sources, creative analysis, and compelling visual storytelling.  A key takeaway is the importance of accessibility in data presentation. By using interactive maps and easy-to-understand graphs, the team ensured that even non-expert audiences could grasp the implications of the housing crisis. This highlights the role of visual storytelling in making data more engaging and relatable.  Finally, the project underscores the importance of persistence and thorough research in data journalism. Gathering accurate data, compiling FOI requests, and identifying trends requires time and effort, but the result can be a powerful tool for driving social change. Journalists can learn how to combine investigative rigor with innovative data techniques to create impactful stories that resonate with the public and influence policy discussions.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/espana-millon-viviendas-manos-grandes-propietarios_1_11844846.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/mapa-alquileres-disparan-precio-ciudades-espana-calle-madrid-barcelona_1_11628723.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/boom-alquiler-temporada-30-pisos-anunciados-capitales-ofrecen-meses_1_11670769.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/aumento-precio-alquiler-especulacion-avivan-protestas-derecho-vivienda_1_11726321.html,"Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres, Yuly Jara, David Noriega","Raúl Sánchez (coordinator), Victòria Oliveres, and Yuly Jara make up the Data and Visualizations team at elDiario.es.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,,,How Low Incomes Boosted in Spain: Breaking Salary Myths and Workers’ Pay Scale Perception,2024-10-07,"Explainer, Database, Fact-checking, Chart, Economy, Employment","D3.js, JQuery, R, RStudio, Node.js","This journalistic investigation reveals how labor reform, which reduced temporary employment, and the rise in the minimum wage have significantly boosted the income of Spain’s most vulnerable workers. By analyzing microdata from over 250.000 wages, we demonstrated that the income growth of lower-paid workers doubled that of others, following a law that ended abusive temporary employment practices and a 50% increase in the minimum wage between 2018 and 2022. Using the same data, we created an interactive calculator allowing hundreds of thousands of readers to discover their position on Spain’s salary scale, challenging preconceived notions about income distribution.","The project had a powerful impact on public discourse, sparking a widespread debate on how Government policies can reduce income inequality in Spain. It was widely shared on social media and referenced in mainstream media discussions. Hundreds of thousands of readers used the salary calculator, which became a viral sensation, allowing them to compare their earnings with national benchmarks—often leading to surprising revelations about perceived and actual income distribution. Responses were charted in real time  on the interactive calculator to show how people with similar incomes position themselves on Spain’s salary scale. These data helped us to discover a tendency for individuals to place themselves within the average.  Beyond its digital impact, the project contributed to fact-checking political claims, offering hard data to counteract misinformation about labor policies. It provided policymakers and journalists with a reliable tool to assess the effects of labor reforms, reinforcing the role of data-driven journalism in shaping informed public debate. By making income data accessible and interactive, we engaged a broad audience, from policymakers to everyday citizens, in a critical conversation about labor rights and economic inequality.","This project is set against a backdrop of political polarization between the left and the right over labor policies, including a major labor reform and successive increases in the minimum wage. While the opposition claimed these measures would destroy jobs and impoverish workers, this project was the first to analyze, using microdata from the Wage Structure Survey, how wage earnings evolved between 2018 and 2022.  By applying weighted calculations and analyzing salary changes for over 250,000 workers—segmented by gender, annual earnings, sector, and company seniority—we provided an in-depth, data-driven perspective on how these policies impacted the most vulnerable workers. The investigation revealed that lower-income employees experienced the greatest wage increases, largely due to the reduction of precarious temporary contracts and the boost in minimum wage.  Amid political debates filled with speculation, this project introduced empirical evidence, giving the public and policymakers a factual basis to assess the real impact of labor policies.","We utilized a combination of tools and technologies to conduct a comprehensive analysis. R and RStudio were employed for data compilation and analysis of microdata of over 250,000 workers wages. The salary calculator and the interactive narrative, which explains how low-paid workers boosted their income after labor reform and the rise of minimum wages, were programmed using D3.js, Google Cloud, Node, Canvas, and Javascript. This tool gathered the users’ answers and updated a chart with real time data allowing comparison among the audience. For the creation of straightforward charts, we utilized Datawrapper.","This project demonstrates how journalists can leverage interactive tools and data storytelling to make complex economic topics accessible and engaging. By developing a personalized salary calculator, we encouraged readers to interact directly with the data, sparking a widespread discussion on income inequality and the impact of labor policies. One key takeaway for journalists is the importance of combining statistical rigor with user-friendly visualizations. Using open government data, weighted calculations, and interactive design, we transformed dense economic information into an intuitive experience for a broad audience.  Furthermore, this project highlights the value of fact-based journalism in countering political misinformation. While debates on labor policies often rely on speculation, our approach provided clear, empirical evidence, allowing readers to form informed opinions. This methodology is replicable in other countries—journalists can analyze national wage structures, develop interactive salary tools, and assess policy impacts with publicly available data. By doing so, they can challenge misconceptions, uncover hidden inequalities, and drive meaningful conversations about labor rights and economic justice.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/disparan-sueldos-trabajadores-peor-pagados-recorte-temporalidad-subidas-smi_1_11745887.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/calculadora-salarios-espana-2024_1_11696038.html,,,"Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres, Yuly Jara, Laura Olías, David Velasco","Raúl Sánchez (coordinator), Victòria Oliveres, and Yuly Jara make up the Data and Visualizations team at elDiario.es.

On 3 April 2024, our team received an email from a user asking us to verify something. In the following months, we received over a hundred such claims.   These claims mainly targeted events happening around the world and the countries imposing sanctions on Russia.  This led to our team producing this multimedia immersive to debunk the pro-Russian propanganda and bring the truth to our readers.","In the beginning stages of the immersive, we had reached out to few fact-checkers around the globe who praised us for doing a deep dive into the ’operation’ that the pro-Russian accounts had been running on different social media platforms, such as X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram.   The immersive was intended to show people what effects and impact can dedicated m/disinformation can have in the society and the real life harms that can come with it. After it was published, some users reached out to us appreciating us for our work.   The impact was not local and so wasn’t the audience. After a few days of the report, our fact-checking team received appreciation from the French embassies and more.","Since ours is a small team, we quickly realised how difficult it would be to check large numbers of claims that we were receiving everyday. However, after a few days of investigation, we found that it was deliberately done to distract fact-checkers from their job.   This prompted us to come up with the immersive and expose this targeted disinformation campaign to the general public, aiming to add transparency to the work of a fact-checker. The aim was to show other smaller fact-checking organisations to avoid falling for such pro-Russian propaganda.  Our team also hoped to show the layperson how bad actors were going after fact-checkers to distract them with fabricated and irrelevant disinformation, in order to distract them with inconsequential, false ’narratives’ that did not exist outside of this network of pages","With basic fact-checking methodologies such as reverse image search and geolocation, we found that the photographs, many of which showed graffiti on walls in different places, were not pictures of pre-existing imagery.   We ran the viral visuals through AI-generated content (AIGC) detection tools to show readers that not only were the images fake, but they were made using sophisticated AI as they did not show any of the general characteristics of AI-generated images.  The tools we used, such as TrueMedia and Hive Moderation, were free to access, so users could cross-check the image themselves and learn about handy tools for future use.","The immersive could help journalists to learn how these intricate pieces of misinformation were designed to ensure that they as well as fact-checkers dedicated their resources to combating pointless misinformation so that they would have to let go of real and consequential misinformation that misled and fooled people.   This would not only keep the journalists busy but ensure that false claims, propaganda, and bot-facilitated social media campaigns could flourish unchecked.  It also highlighted how the threat of AI visuals are increasing and why raising awareness and media literacy among the frontline soldiers (journalists) becomes more important by each passing day.",English,https://www.thequint.com/quintlab/russian-accounts-targeting-fact-checkers-by-bombarding-fake-news-content-propaganda-against-ukraine-fabricated-reports/,,,,"Abhishek Anand, Reporter  Aishwarya Varma, Reporter Abhilash Mallick, Senior Editor Naman Shah, Creative Director Kamran Akhter, Cover Graphic Anoushka Jain, Production Assistant","Abhishek Anand is a senior-correspondent for WebQoof at The Quint.

Slovenia,"Oštro, a center for investigative journalism in the Adriatic region",Small,,,The Asset Detector,2024-01-15,"Investigation, Cross-border, Database","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap","The project is the first example of systematic public disclosure of political officials’ assets, which, due to the non-disclosure of such data, is carried out exclusively using the methods of investigative and data journalism.  The publication took place in multiple phases: in Slovenia the journalists first focused on government members plus associates and in Croatia on county prefects (2023); in the second phase both teams focused on state secretaries and members of the parliament (2024).  The work resulted in several breaktrough findings, and respective institutions for the prevention of corruption in both countries reacted by introducing measures against the officials.","For the Asset Detector 2.0 and 3.0, published in 2024, our investigative teams in Ljubljana and Zagreb have identified and verified 760 assets of Slovenian MPs and 992 of Croatian MPs, which they complemented with several investigative stories about irregularities they found. Overall, 1297 assets have been identified in Slovenia and 2439 in Croatia.  Breaches of law were revealed, and respective institutions for the prevention of corruption in both countries reacted by introducing appropriate measures.  Numerous cases described in the investigation have alerted the Slovenian Commission for the Prevention of Conflict of Interest, as well as the Croatian Commission for the Resolution of Conflicts of Interest.  On the basis of Oštro’s findings in Slovenia, the commission initiated misdemeanour proceedings against seven ministers and finally issued them with a warning.  Key Slovenian stakeholders declared their political will to draft legislative amendments concerning the public disclosure of information on the assets of officials to make the process of asset declarations more transparent.  In Croatia, after Oštro warned of errors when registering asset declarations, three of the prefects corrected them. The Commission initiated proceedings against at least one county prefect and opened cases for all those who have not submitted their asset declarations.","In Slovenia and Croatia, young democracies facing several obstacles and shortcomings in their democratic processes, public scrutiny of assets of politicians is significantly hindered. In publications, we have stressed warnings by several anti-corruption experts that public disclosure of politicians’ assets is crucial for monitoring conflicts of interest and possible misappropriation of funds.  In Slovenia, the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (CPC) points out that due to staffing problems, controls are carried out only to a limited extent – the control over the assets of more than 20,000 taxpayers is currently carried out by 2 employees.  In order to get a complete picture of the assets of the functionaries and verify the correctness of their reporting to the CPC, Oštro requested from the commission copies of the forms on which members of the government, secretaries of state and parliamentarians reported changes in assets. The Commission rejected the request. At Oštro, we believe that the limited extent of data publication does not align with either the content or the purpose of the law.  Oštro therefore filed a lawsuit against the Information Commissioner in the Administrative Court.","Both national teams created a shared methodology and investigated each other’s politicians in their respective countries. Journalists collected, reviewed, and analysed data for each phase over several months.  They’ve used numerous domestic and international databases to search for useful data that could lead them to information about the officials’ assets. In some cases, a simple search through web browsers was sufficient, while in others, journalists examined land registry records for properties they suspected were owned by the official or a related person.  We collected asset-related data from publicly accessible registries and specialised databases, such as business registers, the land registry, the Central Securities Clearing Corporation’s records on securities, the registry for reviewing transactions of public institutions and state-owned companies, and others.  Oštro also collected data on the assets of close family members, but we redacted this information to the extent necessary to ensure anonymity and the security of personal data. They identified the family members of the politicians based on media reports and social media posts, followed by land registry records.  In accordance with Oštro’s code of ethics, all data was internally verified before publication by a member of the editorial team who was not involved in its collection.","With Asset Detector, Oštro wanted to raise awareness among the public and other journalists in Slovenia and Croatia about the importance of public information on the assets of political officials and the lack of transparency in this regard.  Other media have reported on our findings. The results are fully accessible to the public and are a useful source for further journalistic investigations.

Mexico,Al Majalla Magazine,Small,,,Rogue operators: An in-depth look at Iraq’s powerful militias,2024-02-01,"Investigation, News application, Chart, Politics, Crime, Gun violence, Terrorism","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel","Data visualization project for Al Majalla magazine, February 2024. This double-page visualization provides an in-depth analysis of militias in the Middle East, offering an ‘X-ray’ view of their evolution, structure, and influence. It categorizes different types of militias, highlighting their roles in regional conflicts and alliances.  Designed in English and Arabic, the layout adapts to different reading directions, ensuring accessibility for diverse audiences. The project integrates data-driven storytelling, using clear visuals to simplify complex information. By combining research, design, and innovative visualization techniques, it aims to inform policymakers, journalists, and the public about the region’s shifting power dynamics.","Iraq’s militias have deeply embedded themselves within the state apparatus, exerting significant influence over political and security affairs. While they operate with brutal tactics—including assassinations, kidnappings, and intimidation—their actual political support remains relatively weak. Despite their limited popularity, their entrenched presence enables them to shape key decisions, often prioritizing their own survival and influence over national stability.  Should tensions escalate further, these militias, despite lacking widespread public backing, would not hesitate to confront the Iraqi populace or suppress opposition with force. Iraq remains a fragmented landscape of competing militias, many of which possess both the capability and intent to fuel unrest, not only within the country but across the broader region. Some are aligned with external powers, leveraging their influence to serve geopolitical interests rather than national cohesion.  Breaking their grip on power remains a formidable challenge. Their influence extends beyond military control, permeating political institutions, economic structures, and even social networks. Without significant reforms, disarmament efforts, or external pressure, Iraq will continue to struggle under their dominance. The challenge lies not just in curbing their immediate power but in preventing future generations of militias from emerging and perpetuating the cycle of violence and instability.","This project was developed in a highly complex and sensitive political environment. Militias in Iraq do not operate in isolation; they are connected to regional actors with geopolitical interests in the Middle East. Addressing their influence and power is a challenge, as it involves discussing diplomatic and security implications.  One of the main obstacles was access to reliable data. Much of the information on militias comes from government sources, human rights organizations, and local media, but these data sets are often fragmented or biased. A rigorous verification process was required to ensure the visualization presented an accurate and balanced picture.  Additionally, there were resource limitations. The project needed to present complex information within a limited space, ensuring accessibility for both English and Arabic readers, which posed challenges in design and visual adaptation.  Finally, the use of innovative data visualization technologies enabled structuring the information in a clear and impactful way. This approach not only facilitates a better understanding of the conflict but also paves the way for future journalistic investigations on the role of militias in regional stability.","For data management and processing, Microsoft Excel was used to organize, clean, and analyze the dataset, ensuring accuracy and consistency.  For data visualization design, Adobe Illustrator played a key role in structuring and refining the graphics, allowing for a clear and engaging representation of complex information.  Additionally, Adobe Photoshop was used to enhance and integrate photographic elements, ensuring a cohesive visual narrative. The combination of these tools enabled the creation of a compelling, well-structured, and visually impactful data visualization that effectively communicates insights to a diverse audience.","This project highlights the power of visual storytelling in journalism, demonstrating how data visualization can provide an X-ray view of the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. By using visual tools, journalists can break down complex geopolitical situations, making them more accessible and understandable for a broader audience.  One key takeaway is the strategic use of color to differentiate various militant groups. Rather than presenting them as a single entity, the design visually emphasizes that these groups have distinct political and social ideologies, helping the audience grasp the nuances of the conflict.  This project serves as an example of how effective design choices can enhance the depth and clarity of reporting, allowing journalists to present intricate issues in a way that is both informative and engaging.",English and Arab,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xpBqe7cVDDzNq62cFYTm0rP6RXXeFRvh/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VGxfaPo1pz7rBH0tsqu6j0irqwlSO_bh/view?usp=drive_link,,,1.

The piece utilises war-related fires data provided by the Centre for Information Resilience, thermal scarring analysed by researchers at Yale as well as satellite imagery, video and building footprint data.   Analysis of scorched Zaghawa neighbours and villages in and around el-Fasher indicates ethnically motivated targeting by the RSF. It continues by visualising the many health facilities that have been damaged or destroyed as well as the flooding that refugees faced after evacuating the city.","Sudan receives a fraction of attention from news media compared to conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Around 600 articles per month since the beginning of 2024 as opposed to 100,000 per month for Gaza and Ukraine each according to Chartbeat. However, the impact that Sudanese people are facing from the war and famine is catastrophic and deserves extensive coverage.   The piece was the visual side of a larger cover package from The Economist and received a positive response from Yale and CIR for the use of their research.   Overall the piece received 83k views online and 57k views on The Economist app.   The project was published alongside two short form videos describing the el-Fasher siege utilising maps and on the ground footage. Collaboration on projects between the films team and the data team is uncommon but the positive reception of the project has since inspired further collaborations, principally a visual story and video on the Myanmar civil war.","This project was worked on by a small team - one developer, an editor, an Africa correspondent and one video producer. Initially the task was just to have simple maps or satellite imagery to be embedded in a standard article but we pushed for a more ambitious visual project that explained the siege in-depth.   Accurate building footprint data was challenging due to the lack of coverage in parts of Africa, especially when we focused on the Zamzam refugee camp. Marking the coordinates of targeted health facilities was also a challenge. Alongside our own geolocation efforts and working with researchers at CIR we were able to confidently plot these on the map and show video of the burning dialysis centre linked to its location.","We used Svelte, a Javascript framework, and Maplibre to build the map and interactive parts of the project. QGIS was used throughout the project to develop and style the map elements using geographic data. Raster tiles of the satellite images provided by Maxar were generated using QGIS so they could be overlayed onto the map to visually show the location of structural damage.   Locations of war-related fires used analysed data from NASA FIRMS and building footprint data used the Google Open Buildings dataset.   Optical satellite imagery from Maxar was also analysed by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab to show the locations of flooded areas at Zamzam refugee camp.","That open source data, collaboration with other researchers and the use of general-purpose tools like QGIS and Maplibre can be combined effectively to create engaging visual stories. Visual journalism can provide context to complex conflicts, by using satellite imagery and data visualisation it helped explain the siege in a way that made the situation more comprehensible to our readers.  This project began as a simple request for data but it lead to a more ambitious visual project. What could have been a static map or chart had evolved into an in-depth visual explainer that aided the rest of our Sudan coverage.

"Korea, Republic of",서울신문(Seoul Newspaper Daily),Big,,,Toxic Workplace: Investigating the Culture of Workplace Harassment in S.Korea,2024-07-09,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, Infographics, Employment, Human rights",SPSS,"”Toxic Workplace” is an investigative series that examines workplace bullying in South Korea five years after the implementation of anti-bullying legislation. Through the analysis of 27 high-profile cases and comprehensive survey data from 1,471 workers, we uncovered structural problems in how companies protect perpetrators while victims are left vulnerable. The investigation revealed a disturbing pattern: victims often suffer in silence due to family obligations and societal expectations, sometimes leading to suicide. Our reporting triggered significant legal and institutional changes, including amendments to civil servant regulations and the enactment of anti-bullying ordinances in 24 local governments across the country.","The ”Toxic Workplace” series catalyzed concrete social and institutional changes across multiple levels of Korean society. Most notably, prosecutors adopted a more proactive approach toward asset recovery from Yang Jin-ho, the notorious executive whose brutal abuse of employees had originally prompted anti-bullying legislation. The whistleblowers in his case, who had remained victims of systematic retaliation for years, finally received relief when the company ceased its barrage of legal counterattacks following our reporting. Our investigation prompted 24 local governments to establish new anti-bullying ordinances, while national government bodies strengthened protections by amending civil service regulations to restrict the promotion of bullying perpetrators.  Our generational and gender-based survey of 1,471 workers revealed critical insights into how different demographic groups experience workplace interactions. For instance, women in their 20s showed stronger aversion to physical contact, reflecting their generation’s heightened awareness of sexual crimes. Through exclusive access to 200 suicide-related workers’ compensation cases obtained from the National Assembly, we discovered that 61 were directly linked to workplace bullying. Our analysis of suicide notes revealed how S.Korea’s distinctive educational culture—where parents invest heavily in private education—creates overwhelming pressure on victims who feel they’re betraying family sacrifices by leaving toxic workplaces.","Our investigation confronted significant challenges regarding data accessibility. While workplace bullying has been a recognized legal concept in S.Korea since 2019, there is no centralized database of cases, making it impossible to systematically analyze patterns through official records. To overcome this barrier, we meticulously compiled, from 20,894 media reports, 27 high-profile cases that received substantial coverage between 2020 and 2024. Access to suicide victims’ personal documents presented both ethical and practical challenges. We gained rare access to suicide notes and workers’ compensation rulings for workplace bullying-related suicides through collaboration with National Assembly members. This unprecedented access allowed us to perform content analysis that revealed how Korean family dynamics and societal pressures often trap victims in abusive workplaces. The investigation itself faced potential legal threats. Many perpetrators involved in our cases were powerful individuals in corporations and public institutions who could leverage their resources against journalists. Some had already demonstrated their willingness to use legal intimidation by filing numerous countersuits against victims. Despite these constraints, we were determined to follow cases to their conclusion rather than simply reporting on initial incidents. This longitudinal approach—tracking what ultimately happened to both victims and perpetrators years after bullying incidents—was revolutionary in Korean journalism.","Our investigation employed a novel combination of traditional investigative techniques and innovative technological approaches: 1. AI-Assisted Content Analysis: We utilized generative AI to help systematically analyze and categorize the 27 high-profile bullying cases. After manual input of detailed case information, the AI helped identify recurring patterns in victim and perpetrator outcomes, which we then verified through consultations with labor attorneys, certified labor consultants, and academic researchers. This led to our groundbreaking typology of perpetrator protection mechanisms. 2. Comprehensive Survey Design: In collaboration with the Happy Work Research Institute (affiliated with a labor law firm), we designed a specialized survey capturing generational and gender differences in perceptions of workplace bullying. This methodological innovation revealed how different demographic groups experience workplace interactions differently based on their historical-social contexts. 3. Document Analysis of Suicide Notes: We developed a systematic methodology for analyzing suicide notes and workers’ compensation rulings for workplace bullying victims, revealing the profound impact of family obligations on victims’ decision-making processes. 4. Longitudinal Case Tracking: We employed a rigorous methodology to track long-term outcomes for both victims and perpetrators, revealing that perpetrators typically faced minimal consequences while victims endured lasting damages or were forced to leave their positions.","”Toxic Workplace” demonstrates the power of structural approaches to seemingly individual problems. Rather than treating workplace bullying as isolated incidents, we revealed systematic patterns in how organizations protect perpetrators while abandoning victims. This holistic methodology can be applied to many social issues that are typically reported episodically. Our project showcases how journalists can effectively use AI as an analytical tool while maintaining human oversight. By using generative AI to help identify patterns across cases and then verifying these findings with domain experts, we developed a reliable methodology that other journalists can adopt for investigating complex social phenomena. The longitudinal tracking approach we employed—following cases years after they first made headlines—represents a crucial innovation in accountability journalism. Other journalists can learn that the true impact of bullying, harassment, or discrimination cases often becomes visible only after the initial media attention has faded. Our successful collaboration with academic researchers and specialized institutes shows how news organizations can leverage external expertise to design methodologically sound research that enhances reporting. The survey we designed with the Happy Work Research Institute became a valuable resource cited by policymakers.",Korean,https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/plan/Villain-office/2024/07/24/20240724500198,https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/plan/Villain-office/2024/08/08/20240808009002,https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/plan/Villain-office/2024/08/08/20240808008002,https://www.seoul.co.kr/news/plan/Villain-office/2024/07/10/20240710001005,"Hee-Gyung Hong, Eun-Ju Lee, Seong-Eun Kim","The team members were all part of the Special Investigation Unit at Seoul Newspaper Daily(https://www.seoul.co.kr), S.Korea’s oldest newspaper with the most extensive history.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,,,How food diary videos on social media can impact your body image,2024-12-31,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart","Three.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, RStudio","The relationship between media and body image is a concern, especially with the rise of visual-focused social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram.  While explicit content, such as posts actively promoting eating disorders, is considered sensitive and clearly violates content guidelines, we were interested in exploring the ‘grey area’—content or hashtags that, while not explicitly promoting unrealistic beauty standards, may still negatively impact vulnerable individuals.  One such hashtag in this grey area is #whatieatinaday, which we used as the focus of our piece to address a broader issue: how and why videos associated with such hashtags can be potentially harmful.","We published the piece at the end of December, during the holiday season—a time when people are feasting and often making New Year’s resolutions, such as losing weight. We hoped this piece would remind readers that what they see on social media isn’t always reflective of reality and encourage them to be cautious about the types of content they consume on these platforms.","Body image and eating disorders are often considered taboo topics and are rarely discussed in local media. We noticed a lack of conversations around body image, despite it being a common experience. In fact, one of our newsmakers—an expert in body image studies—shared that most people encounter body image issues at some point in their lives.  This conversation is even more pressing in today’s social media landscape, where platforms like TikTok are highly accessible. The debate over limiting social media usage, particularly for children, continues to gain traction. [Following Australia’s decision to ban social media for users under 16](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89vjj0lxx9o) at the end of last year, Singapore has also been exploring [legislation to introduce age restrictions on social media platforms](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/spore-in-talks-with-australia-over-social-media-ban-for-young-users).","3D data visualisation: We created a 3D data visualization to showcase all the What I Eat In A Day (WIEIAD) videos in our dataset. Using scrollytelling and smooth transitions, we highlight different characteristics of a WIEIAD video—such as sound type, shot type, and emphasis on weight—one at a time. This visualization was built using Three.js.  Scrolly: To analyze the editing techniques used in WIEIAD videos, we broke down an example video into individual clips. This was done using Three.js and a technique called texture atlas, which allowed us to stitch all the video clips into a single MP4 file.   Buttons and sound: We integrated interactive buttons within the text, allowing readers to engage with the different soundtracks used in WIEIAD videos.  R to chart and process data: The violin plot highlights how individuals with eating disorders are more likely to receive dieting, exercise, and toxic eating disorder-related content. While the data was open source, the original dataset was large and required processing. We used RStudio to clean and prepare the data before charting the violin plot.  Python and scraping: We used python to scrape and gather data from the #whatieatinaday hash tag on TikTok.","No matter how visually impressive a data visualization is, it must make sense to the reader—especially in data journalism. Initially, we explored clustering methods like K-means and UMAP. However, when we tested them, the resulting trends and clusters weren’t as clear as we had hoped. (We even built an [interactive link](https://qa.st-visuals.com/proj-test-video-cluster/index.html) to explore how different variables interacted and influenced one another.)  In the end, we opted for a simpler approach. Instead of using UMAP to calculate video positioning in the 3D matrix—which would have required extensive explanation—we used a circle-packing method that was more intuitive for readers.  Start small, then expand. At first, we aimed to analyze a large dataset of 100 hashtags, but we quickly found ourselves stuck in endless debates: What counts as a popular hashtag? Which ones should be included? The scale of the task felt overwhelming, and we nearly abandoned the project. Instead, we decided to start small—focusing on just one hashtag and seeing where it led. That approach paid off. By analyzing a single hashtag, such as #whatieatinaday, we uncovered meaningful insights that allowed us to tell a much larger story.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2024/12/social-media-body-image/index.html,,,,"Alyssa Mungcal, Digital graphics designer; Charlene Chua, Digital graphics journalist; Chee Wei Xian, Data visualisation developer; Elizabeth Law, Correspondent; Stephanie Adeline, Digital graphics journalist; Hannah Ong, Digital graphics journalist; Khoo Zi Qi, Data visualisation developer intern","Alyssa Mungcal, Digital graphics designer; Charlene Chua, Digital graphics journalist; Chee Wei Xian, Data visualisation developer; Elizabeth Law, Correspondent; Stephanie Adeline, Digital graphics journalist; Hannah Ong, Digital graphics journalist; Khoo Zi Qi, Data visualisation developer intern"

The investigation found that as pro-China propaganda began targeting civil society, it continued leveraging pseudo experts and coordinated inauthentic behavior to spread pro-China narratives in the Philippine online space. These narratives baselessly claimed Atin Ito was linked to the US and Philippine governments, as well as the Project Myoushu initiative that started at the Stanford Gordian Knot Center.","This project shows how pro-China propaganda in the Philippines continues to evade accountability on platforms, even when it continues to use the same propaganda tactics included in previous reports from journalists and academics. Despite the continued use of pseudo experts and pseudo intellectual content, the report also underscores how pro-China propaganda can evolve by attacking new targets dedicated to upholding Philippine sovereignty in the West Philippine Sea.",This story was made in collaboration with data forensics company The Nerve.,"The team looked at TikTok posts to analyze the sentiments of users talking about the West Philippine Sea. The team processed the videos by converting their audio into text, and using NLP to surface significant narratives. This story showcased the team’s capabilities in analyzing content in video format, which sets a new standard for multimedia investigations in the digital age.  The team also investigated the discussions on Facebook by looking at public posts talking about the West Philippine Sea. We went deeper into the comments on Philippine-based media organizations’ news reports about the tensions, and tracked the narratives containing pro-China propaganda.  We then looked into the audiences of the top-shared posts including pro-China propaganda, and found that these claims were being seeded into three distinct communities, indicating coordinated inauthentic behavior.  The report also featured interviews with a co-convenor of Atin Ito, the lead for Project Myoushu, and a political analyst, which contextualized the pro-China attacks analyzed by the researchers.","Other journalists can learn how pro-China propaganda narratives and tactics can take new forms, identify new targets, or employ long-standing techniques and strategies in promoting Beijing’s interests.

This project examines the impact of climate change and urbanization on Singapore’s butterfly population. Butterflies, highly sensitive to environmental changes, face challenges such as habitat loss, rising temperatures, and erratic rainfall, disrupting their life cycles. This interactive experience follows the common rose, Singapore’s national butterfly, to explore why butterfly populations are declining. It uses data visualizations, 3D models, and maps to highlight the challenges these species face.","The story was published in December 2024, this project built on the momentum of the UN biodiversity conference COP16, exploring global issues through the lens of Singapore’s national butterfly, the common rose. It received positive feedback and was widely shared, including being featured in Data Vis Dispatch as one of 2024’s favourite visualisations. It garnered ~10k page views.","Singapore has a wealth of data on butterflies, often regarded as the most beloved insects. However, their story reflects a wider crisis facing the insect world. Pesticide use, climate change, and deforestation are driving butterfly declines – along with the broader disappearance of insects.  Our project draws on Singapore’s extensive butterfly data, transforming it into a compelling visual narrative to highlight the plight of insects as a whole. We sifted through multiple data sources, consulted experts, and aimed to present a balanced perspective. While climate change and habitat destruction pose significant threats, there is also hope. Singapore has made notable efforts to protect butterflies and other insects, though more needs to be done.  By combining data and storytelling, we aim to shed light on both the challenges and the progress, ensuring that insects – so vital to ecosystems – remain in focus.","- Visualising all 487 butterfly species: We created a low-poly style data visualisation of all 487 butterfly species ever recorded in Singapore, categorising them by their family, primary wing colours and conservation status.  - Organic 3D data visualisation: Butterflies fly around a central circle, dynamically rearranging their positions based on their level of extinction threat. This creates fluid, organic movements in a 3D space. The visualisation was built using Threlte and custom shaders. - Following the common rose’s life cycle: We designed a 3D garden using Threlte to showcase the life cycle of the common rose. Users can explore each stage of its journey and discover the challenges it faces along the way, creating an immersive experience.  - Butterfly observation map: Forests are home to many threatened butterflies.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,,,Drowning in plastic: The oceans’ growing constellations of trash,2024-11-22,"Illustration, Infographics, Map, Environment","Animation, 3D modeling, D3.js, Mapbox GL, Threlte, WebGL","Amid vast, swirling currents, 170 trillion microplastic particles drift unseen through our oceans, forming hidden patches of pollution that threaten marine life and seep into our food chain. This interactive project allows users to trace the journey of a plastic particle, such as a textile fibre, across ocean currents. Using data visualizations and 3D motion graphics, the piece illustrates the scale, movement, and long-term consequences of ocean plastic pollution. The project was published alongside the INC-5 UN Plastics Treaty talks, providing vital context on the urgency of tackling microplastic pollution at a global level.","This project brought renewed attention to the scale of microplastic pollution and its far-reaching consequences, especially in the context of the INC-5 UN Plastics Treaty talks in Busan. By leveraging immersive storytelling and interactive graphics, it provided a visually compelling and scientifically grounded narrative that engaged policymakers, environmentalists, and the general public alike.  The piece reached more than 14,000 readers in the first week and was widely shared on social media. It received positive feedback from marine scientists, who praised its data accuracy and clear visual representation of plastic migration.","This project was published in the lead-up to the INC-5 UN Plastics Treaty talks in Busan. Given the political urgency, the project aimed to provide scientifically backed, visually compelling evidence to inform public debate.  One of the main challenges was understanding the complexities of plastic distribution models. Estimating the movement and accumulation of plastic in the ocean involves sophisticated simulations, and it was crucial to consult directly with scientists to ensure that the data was used correctly. Their insights helped determine which models to rely on and how to translate them into meaningful visual representations without oversimplifying the science.  Another constraint was the limited availability of detailed data on the composition of garbage patches. The only study that provided a breakdown of the different plastic types within these zones came from an academic paper by The Ocean Cleanup, which analyzed how plastic is distributed inside garbage patches. This research became a key reference for the illustrations, allowing them to be grounded in real data rather than assumptions.  By overcoming these challenges, the project successfully translated complex scientific data into an engaging and interactive experience, making the issue of plastic pollution both visually striking and scientifically rigorous.","The foundation of the project relied on robust data sources and modeling. The plastic distribution data was derived from research conducted by six leading scientists, who mapped the dispersion of oceanic plastic using real-world marine expeditions. The team also utilized The Ocean Cleanup’s Plastic Tracker, a simulation tool that predicts the likely trajectory of a plastic fibre discarded near Singapore, illustrating how plastics travel through ocean currents before accumulating in garbage patches.  The team employed Threlte and WebGL to enable smooth 3D globe rendering, allowing users to visually track the movement of plastic debris across the ocean. Mapbox GL was used to map ocean currents and highlight the five major garbage patches. Additionally, D3.js powered the data-driven graphics, particularly for visualizing the concentration of microplastics in different oceanic regions.  To enhance engagement, the project was designed with a sequential storytelling approach, guiding users from the surface of the ocean, where plastic pollution begins, down to the deep sea, where microplastics accumulate over time. Annotations were strategically incorporated throughout the piece, ensuring accessibility for both scientific audiences and the general public. The use of motion graphics and micro-interactions allowed users to intuitively grasp the scale and impact of plastic pollution.","This project underscores the importance of blending data journalism, interactive design, and scientific collaboration to tell compelling environmental stories.  Key takeaways for journalists:  - Simplifying complex data is crucial: We translated ocean plastic simulations and data from garbage patch compositions into an intuitive narrative, making research accessible without oversimplifying the science. - Interactive elements enhance engagement: Allowing readers to track a textile fibre’s journey added a personal, relatable dimension to a global crisis. - Collaborate with scientists: Working with oceanographers and environmental researchers ensured data accuracy and credibility. - Use emerging technologies strategically: This project leveraged Threlte, Mapbox, and D3.js to enhance storytelling without overwhelming users.

In the 1970s, HDB playgrounds began featuring creative designs and themed elements inspired by local culture and heritage. Among them, the dragon playground, made from concrete and mosaic, became one of Singapore’s iconic playgrounds.   This interactive explores how these playgrounds have evolved from basic structures to thematic designs, reflecting efforts to foster community engagement and address diverse needs.","The interactive, published in October, received positive feedback for evoking nostalgic memories. It garnered approximately 18,000 page views on its launch day. Total page views ~30k, unique page views: ~25k, avg time spent: 00:01:33","The project used publicly available geospatial data from the Singapore government and OpenStreetMap. Some amount of data cleaning and wrangling was required.  For example, to calculate the distance that Singaporeans live to their closest playground, we had to find the number of dwelling units for each residential building in Singapore. While this sounds straightforward, there wasn’t a readily available dataset for this. However, we were able to find 2 different datasets that we could join to get this information.  Public residences and public residences are managed by different government agencies in Singapore, and so, the records provided were in different formats.  The private residences dataset had all the data we needed and were in the format that we desired. However, the public housing data was in a csv format with the number of dwelling units for each address. Since that dataset did not have geospatial data, we had to geocode each address in order to do this geospatial analysis.   After wrangling the data, we were finally able to join the two datasets and perform the analysis needed for this project.","As OpenStreetMap data is crowdsourced, we did a number of tests to make sure that the dataset was accurate and robust enough for our analysis. From our tests, we noticed that the OpenStreetMap dataset included playgrounds that are planned for the future in ongoing construction projects. That alerted us to search for current land use data to exclude those playgrounds from our analysis and dataset.   With different datasets, we were able to show the distribution of playgrounds in different areas, such as HDB neighbourhoods, condos, and parks, using colourful illustrations that are easy to understand and visualise.  Since most of the old playgrounds have been demolished or replaced, we recreated some as 3D models, giving users a glimpse of their original appearance and how they have evolved over time. Using a combination of photos, videos, and illustrations, we show the transformation of the play elements in the playgrounds over time, and how children interact with them.  Finally, we included a searchable map that helps readers find the nearest playgrounds in their area using the OpenStreetMap data which includes over 1,400 playgrounds.","Even though the story doesn’t appear to be data-heavy and focused more on the evolution of playground designs, data informed many decisions.

Nikkei’s investigation unveiled that many anime images suspected of copyright infringement are produced by the misuse of image generative AI.  After investigating approximately 90,000 images on three major image-sharing websites, we found about 2,500 images that resemble original images in multiple ways. When analyzing the prompts used in generating the images, the character names like Pikachu, Mario and Luffy had been entered for around 90% of the images, strengthening the suspicion that users had created similar images with intent to copy the characters.","Nikkei published a story both in Japanese and English simultaneously. We collected approximately 200,000 page views combined. A professor who has served on the International Subcommittee of the Copyright Subdivision of the Cultural Council in the Agency for Cultural Affairs in japan said, ”This was a groundbreaking report, as it was the first quantitative investigation to be conducted.” The lawyer we interviewed said, ”After publishing this story, it has become a hot topic in the legal professionals and the AI development industry, and the article is widely read by experts.”  In response, the Japanese lawmakers and the Agency for Cultural Affairs are actively discussing ways to protect the rights of Japanese content in the age of generative AI.","Even if strict AI regulations are imposed in one country, there is a danger that it may be possible to train AI to learn anime by passing it through other countries with no regulations, a lawyer pointed out. It is not easy for one country to create rules for generative AI alone, so global coordination is essential for regulations to be effective.  AI has now developed to the point where it can generate images from text, and in 2024, Google, OpenAI, and others announced video generative AI one after another.

The two-part series on the limited access to healthcare for Rohingya refugees in India was supported by MSF Without Borders Media Fellowship and published in January 2024. The third story, which was separately reported (not part of the series), was published in October.  The first two reports is on the impact of limited healthcare available, and the impact of refugee life on their mental health.   The third story reports how a Rohingya asylum seeker’s battle to terminate her pregnancy resulting from rape became  an ordeal.","While there have not been any significant policy changes, the series informs policy makers and civil society organisations, and health-related organisations on the limited scope of government policy on refugees and how vulnerable communities like Rohingya must be protected and supported considering violence and life-threatening circumstances they face in Myanmar. They continue to be targeted politically and vilified, and face arbitrary detention and deportation impacting their health and livelihood.","Rohingya in India, due to their predominantly Islamic identity and their status as stateless, are vulnerable to detention and deportation and dehumanisation. As recently as December 2024, in Delhi, which has a significant number of Rohingya refugees and asylum seekers, the state government decided that Rohingya children will not be given admission in government schools due to their presence as ‘illegal’ immigrants. India does not have a legislation on refugee and asylum seekers, nor is it a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol which makes detention and deportation of those seen as ‘illegal’ routine, harrowing, and legally complicated. Accessing information on the community has been difficult as NGOs do not want to speak on record fearing government reprisal, and data are also limited. The government has no policy on Rohingya refugees, specifically for their support. Open data that are updated are only available with UNHCR India which may not be fully representative.  The human rights challenges and lack of enforcement of basic rights are depicted in the sidelining of their healthcare and corroborated in the story through Right To Information responses of the various government agencies and ground reporting.","There is limited or no data on Rohingya in India. Due to this I filed right to information requests with government agencies for information/data on healthcare, for the two part series. There was no specific response to the issues related to Rohingya refugees in India. This shows that challenges faced in reporting important human rights and refugee issues particularly on stateless Rohingya refugees/asylum seekers in India.   The data that are mentioned in the first part of the series is retrieved from the UNHCR website. But the data is of those registered with the agency and not neccessarily a representation of all Rohingya in India which is contested by the government. The government said that in 2017 (latest) there were around 40,000 Rohingya. The reporting had to be strongly supported by ground reporting and information from NGOs/activists/experts working with the community. Giving the fear mongering around ’illegal immigration’ in India, particularly Rohingya and Bangladeshi immigrants, accessing information on record was a challenge.","Rohingya refugees in India are in fear of detention and deportation in India. There is limited reporting on their circumstances in India which is also a reflection of journalism and media coverage on immigration and refugee issues. The stories represent the violation of human rights and entitlements of one of the most persecuted groups on the planet. There are nearly double the number of Rohingya living outside Myanmar than the those in the country, which shows the precarious and unsafe conditions that prevail in a politically unstable Myanmar.   In India, while they enter as foreigner without valid documentation, the state has obligations as a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet they are unwelcome, and fear violence and detention. This has also been recognised by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination which urged India to end the arbitrary detention of Rohingya who fled Myanmar to India and refrain from forcible deportation and returns to Myanmar.

India,IndiaSpend,Small,,,Why India’s Bail Scheme For Poor Prisoners Isn’t Working,2024-11-15,"Open data, Crime, Human rights",Google Sheets,"At the end of 2023, India had about 25,000 prisoners who were granted bail by trial courts, but remained in custody because they could not afford bail money. But a Union government scheme to address just that has been ineffective, the story shows using data. In August, I filed right-to-information requests with nine states to find out how the scheme, announced in 2023-24 Union budget, is being implemented. Of the six states that replied, only Maharashtra had released prisoners. While Odisha and Delhi did identify some prisoners to assist under the scheme, they had not actually been released.","This is one of the first reports on the status of implementation of a scheme that is crucial for thousands of prisoners who cannot afford to access quality legal service and afford to pay for bail.   There are nearly half a million incarcerated people in India’s prisons. Compared to the other populous countries like the US, China and Brazil, the proportion of the undertrials is the highest in India. The report shows the challenges faced by poor incarcerated populations in India despite a scheme specifically designed to support their release.   It also show the problems in accessing timely and relevant data from state authorities. The report identifies and informs others including journalist about less reporting aspects of society particularly imprisoned people who are limited by their socio-economic circumstances.","There are nearly half a million incarcerated people in India’s prisons. Compared to the other populous countries like the US, China and Brazil, the proportion of the undertrials is the highest in India.  The majority of the imprisoned population, most of whom are undertrials, belong to oppressed, marginalised and some of the poorest communities like Scheduled Castes and Tribes and Other Backward Classes, and from minority religious communities. This means that many remain in cramped conditions unable to pay for bail or find proper legal aid/services leading to prolonged incarceration in overcrowded prisons. Despite decades of advocacy and court orders to show leniency and mindfulness in determining bail the lack of adequate criminal justice reforms has had a cascading impact on the mental, physical and financial health of prisoners and their families.    When the government announced a cash bail scheme in 2023 to release eligible prisoners who were unable to pay for their bail, it became imperative to see how effective the scheme’s implementation was. As is evident, the scheme is unable to meet its objectives.","Data for the story were accessed through right to information requests to the state and union governments. The information were received at different times, which created challenges in analysing information particularly because not all states shared full information/data. In fact, Madhya Pradesh responded with additional demand for fees to process the application in January 2025 that is two months after the publication of the story, and more than 6 months after the application.   The data were collated and analysed using Google sheets.  Sheets were created for each state and based on jails that responded from the respective districts. While, not all district jails responded, atleast 73 jails/districts did. Due to non-uniformity in response and lack of clarity on the cash bail scheme at the state/district level, the data were not accurate in many cases.","The analysis highlights the challenges in the less reported aspect that is prison population and unfairly long incarceration. Across the world prison populations have severe problems in  accessing their liberty and freedoms. Often people come from socio-economically under privileged backgrounds that has cascading effects on their life due to prolonged rates of incarceration and mental health.   The project also highlights how implementation of the scheme is lackadaisical, and the concerns in being able to access timely government data on relevant matters.

Built on these 3D models, it creates VR and AR content that allows multiple users to connect in a metaverse space, participating in ”group tours” of war-affected regions. ”Crisis XR” has been showcased at peace and media-sponsored events, gaining widespread media coverage. The project has deepened public engagement with humanitarian issues and pioneered new storytelling methods in data journalism through immersive technology.","The immersive journalism project centered on ”Crisis XR” gained significant attention on social media, leading to new collaborations, including an outreach initiative by UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East). The immersive experience was exhibited at events in partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and widely covered by major media outlets such as NHK, Yomiuri Shimbun, TBS, HuffPost, Yahoo News, and Mainichi Shimbun. These exhibitions, hosted at peace-related events in Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, as well as media-sponsored events by NHK and Nippon Television, provided audiences with an unprecedented perspective on war-affected regions. The project’s ability to foster deeper engagement with humanitarian issues has been recognized in the academic and media sectors, contributing to ongoing discussions about the role of immersive technology in journalism. Additionally, a symposium scheduled for March 2025 will further explore the integration of XR in conflict reporting, bringing together Al Jazeera, the American University of Beirut, NHK, Yomiuri Shimbun, The Nikkei, and Nippon Television.","The ”Crisis XR Gaza” project was developed against the backdrop of the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where over 2.3 million people face devastating conditions due to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Since October 2023, large-scale military attacks have destroyed entire neighborhoods and critical infrastructure. Given the severe restrictions on media access in Gaza, Al Jazeera and UNRWA has played a crucial role in capturing first-hand footage, much of which remains unused in mainstream media. This project repurposes that valuable data into immersive experiences, allowing audiences worldwide to engage with the reality on the ground.  The project also builds on the success of “Crisis VR Ukraine”, which documented war damages in Ukraine using immersive technologies. The innovative approach of ”Crisis XR” allows for a broader audience reach, particularly among younger generations who engage more effectively with interactive media. Given the resource constraints in war zones, the team strategically partnered with media organizations and NGOs to ensure ethical data use and accessibility. The project also raises awareness of the challenges of conflict journalism, including legal risks for reporters and access to accurate, real-time data. By leveraging immersive technology, ”Crisis XR” sets a precedent for the future of data-driven, conflict-reporting journalism.","The ”Crisis XR” employs a range of advanced technologies to create immersive virtual environments. Moving-camera footage is converted into 3D models using KIRI Engine, while stationary footage is processed into 360-degree VR. Luma AI is utilized for structured scanning footage, and drone or handheld recordings are optimized with KIRI Engine. The models undergo post-processing with Postshot before being integrated into the interactive experience. At events, this project is showcased using VR headsets, participants’ smartphones (AR), or large-scale immersive displays with Liquid Galaxy. Additionally, footage from Al Jazeera and UNRWA is transformed into 3D-Gaussian Splatting models, refined with Supersplat, and deployed as an interactive HTML-based experience. Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI, the team strategically integrates third-party software to ensure agile development. The initiative will also extend to educational efforts, with collaborations with Al Jazeera and the American University of Beirut to provide training for journalists, researchers, and students on XR-based storytelling.","The immersive journalism project centered on ”Crisis XR” highlights how repurposing archival media through XR technology can sustain awareness of critical global issues. Immersive storytelling enhances audience engagement, particularly among younger demographics, by making abstract conflicts more tangible. The project underscores the potential for combining emerging technology with peace education, using interactive experiences to foster a deeper understanding of humanitarian crises. It also demonstrates that presenting dark themes in an engaging format encourages broader public participation in peace-related discourse. By integrating Luma AI, KIRI Engine, and 3D-Gaussian Splatting models with traditional journalism, the project exemplifies how immersive media can extend beyond conventional reporting. This interdisciplinary approach enables journalists to expand their storytelling methods, offering new avenues for documenting conflicts through interactive, data-rich experiences. Furthermore, collaborations between researchers, journalists, and humanitarian organizations such as the ICRC and UNRWA are crucial in ensuring impactful content creation.

Japan,Hidenori Watanave Lab (University of Tokyo),Small,,,Gaza: Damage of Japan-backed facilities,2024-01-26,"Investigation, Cross-border, Satellite images, Human rights","QGIS, Satellite images, GIS platform(arcgis)","Since 1993, the Japanese Government and NGOs have supported facilities in Gaza, reaching approximately 2.3 billion dollars as of June 2023. Since the start of military collisions on 7th, October 2023, there have been concerns of these Japan-backed facilities receiving damages due to massive air strikes and ground invasion. Watanave Laboratory of the University of Tokyo collaborated with a Japanese NGO working with the area in analyzing the damages of Japan-backed facilities by using satellite images of Gaza since the start of the invasion. The results revealed the extensive damage of infrastructure in at least 12 cases.","The website’s launching X post saw approximately 530 likes, 300 shares and 190,000 views. The project reached a mass audience as it was featured in numerous major Japanese media outlets such as NHK, Asahi Television, TBS, Yomiuri Newspaper, Kyodo News, Jiji press, Sankei News, Tokyo Newspaper etc.  The project aimed to create a bottom-up movement for peace within the public through 1)evoking the feeling of relevance in the general Japanese public, and 2)reaching audiences who prefer data-based information instead of empathetic stories.  As a result, many commenters on social media expressed their ’devastation by the clear visualization that shows Japanese taxpayer money and work being turned into rubble’ and their interest in how ’satellite imagery can showcase the situation in Gaza even if outside journalists are shut out’.  The team also had the opportunity to present the content to members of parliament at the non-partisan parliamentary association for humanitarian diplomacy. Members including the now-president Mr. Ishiba saw the contents and agreed to continue its advocacy for the restart of UNRWA funding. A journalist also cited the webpage in her question to the minister of foreign affairs during a press conference.","There was the following context behind the project: 1)Japan is far away and generally perceived to not be directly tied to the conflict, and interest of the general public is low. However, the country holds many political and economical connections with the offending※ state. In order to raise awareness to these issues, the team attempted to personalize the issue through visualizing damage to facilities supported by Japanese taxpayer money, donations and NGO efforts. 2)The team observed how media outlets and NGOs have already reached the population of people who are receptive to the traditional narrative of empathy, with efforts of collecting in-person stories. Therefore, the project was aimed to touch the ’minds’ of those who need visualized evidence and data to prompt action. 3)The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Japan answered in a questionnaire that it was unable to provide the public with clear data of damage in Gaza as ground investigation was not accessible. The team believes that prompt responses are necessary during on-going conflicts, and cannot simply wait for the end of violence. Satellite imagery is a reliable tool in remotely providing information.","The team compiled a list of Japanese government-funded projects as well as NGO-backed facilities. Then, the team acquired SkySat high-resolution (50cm per pixel) optical satellite imagery after the Israeli invasion (October 2024 ~ May 2024) and compared it with pre-war base maps provided by Esri using arcgis maps. The team conducted visual comparison and annotated collapsed buildings, craters, presumed Israeli military vehicles, tank tracks etc. Visual annotation was not necessarily apparent to the inexperienced eye, so the work was overseen by the professor who had past experience in identifying conflict-induced damage in satellite imagery in Ukraine. The team focused on 12 cases with either extensive damage or drastic changes to its surroundings. They include 4 medical facilities, a wastewater plant and 3 schools. The team measured crater diameters, estimating that a 2000-pound bomb was used in a highly populated residential area with a school within the blast radius. EO-browser was also used to visualize land cover classification change in northern Gaza, with calculation indicating debris area increased by 43%. Finally, the results of the analysis were compiled into a webpage using Storytelling Map.","1)Satellite imagery is a powerful tool for digital investigation, capable of monitoring ongoing wartime activities and recording destruction that progresses gradually over time. Compared to on-ground journalism, it provides comprehensive and quantitative data, capturing evidence even in occupied areas or long-term conflicts where damage might otherwise be lost. Additionally, satellite imagery is difficult to forge due to the availability of multiple satellite data sources, and the difficulty of maintaining continuous deception, making it a reliable source of evidence in conflict analysis. 2)It is important to actively adopt new technology in journalism. New technology is rapidly becoming integrated into people’s daily lives. Though traditional media expression methods may become obsolete, journalists can learn to harness these innovations to ensure relevance. The lab has actually inspired, taught and overseen news companies like Yomiuri News to create similar content. 3)Collaboration between NGO and researchers has great potential. This project was made possible due to the NGO’s input on impactful storytelling perspective as well as connections to humanitarian policy-makers, and the researcher’s ability in accessing/annotating data and producing digital storytelling content. Evolution of the information environment enables formation of communities that transcend borders and specializations.","Japanese, English",https://gaza.mapping.jp/index_en.html,https://x.com/hwtnv/status/1750639691811180725,https://gaza.mapping.jp/,https://labo.wtnv.jp/,"1)Hidenori Watanave, 2)Mai Namiki, 3)Yuka Sashihara","1) Professor at The University of Tokyo Interfaculty Initiative in Information Studies.

Peru,Mongabay Latam,Big,,,"Toxic inheritance: 3,452 waste products from oil exploitation continue to contaminate Peru",2024-05-15,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Chart, Video, Map, Environment, Health, Human rights","Drone, Scraping, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Over six months, Mongabay Latam built up a database with information requested from the Peruvian authorities and revealed, for the first time, that there are 3,452 uncontrolled sources of pollution or toxic waste from the oil industry throughout the country. The picture worsens when, in a geographical analysis, we discover that 43 of these waste sites are located within 20 indigenous communities and a protected area. The cases detected are dramatic, ranging from abandoned wells and pools of oil to rusty pipes and communities built on top of buried oil. To date, the authorities have not established who is responsible.","After publication, representatives of the district of Negritos, a town on the Peruvian coast with the highest number of detected environmental liabilities, told Mongabay Latam that they use the publication to explain the magnitude of the problem to neighboring communities that are also exposed to the same contamination. They also presented the results of the investigation at the Pan-Amazonian Social Forum (FOSPA 2024): “This report, which has been forceful and well explained, is the reality that is happening in our district. We were able to take it to FOSPA 2024 in Bolivia to summarize our story and we shared it with groups that are affected by oil liabilities in Ecuador, Brazil, Venezuela and Bolivia. Thanks to the report, three journalists from the United States called us to follow our case.” On the other hand, Profonanpe, the institution in charge of administering the budget for the rehabilitation of contaminated sites, confirmed that they are working to regularize the figures of affected sites based on our investigation.","Throughout the investigations we have carried out to monitor the oil industry in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador, one of the central objectives has always been to contribute to transparency. There is critical information that is not public, such as that on environmental liabilities, which is required both by the affected communities to demand remediation from the State and by the authorities themselves, who do not always have full access to the figures. That was the reason why we built a search and free access tool for all the environmental liabilities that Peru accumulates. This tool shows the location and description of the liability, the level of risk it presents, whether or not it is present within a community, the name of the affected community and the exact  file number. Finally, the most critical cases were covered in four investigations that form part of the series and which, with field trips, closely narrate how indigenous and coastal communities deal with pollution on a daily basis.","We built a database, based on requests for information from three Peruvian institutions, to gather all the environmental liabilities that they have been able to inventory from 2013 to 2023. It was not easy to build this database, as the information differed between institutions and we had to make several inquiries in order to end up with the largest number of verified cases. On the other hand, in the requests for information we asked for the coordinates of each of the environmental liabilities, but we also gathered the location coordinates of all the country’s indigenous communities and protected areas with the help of specialized NGOs that have that information. With all these layers of data, we worked with a geographic analyst to superimpose all the toxic waste, indigenous communities and protected areas on a map, thus revealing how many of these territories are being affected.","Sometimes, continuous coverage of a subject leads us to think that there is nothing more to reveal. However, four years of investigating the oil industry in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru has allowed us to reveal various problems, such as the fines and sanctions accumulated by the oil companies that continue to operate, the environmental liabilities that are not remedied or the magnitude of the overlap of oil blocks with indigenous territories. Knowing the territory is key when it comes to understanding environmental problems. For this reason, the use of maps and satellite images necessary to understand what is happening in those places that the figures reveal and to show a complete picture of the impact. Without this, for example, we would not have been able to detect that more than 40 indigenous communities have been living with oil on their land for years. Detecting emblematic cases in the databases and narrating them in the territory allows us to put a face, a name and, in some cases, a person responsible to the figures gathered. Only in this way were we able to tell stories like Negritos, where the images of a school turned into an oil field are tragic.",Spanish,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/05/herencia-toxica-desechos-explotacion-petrolera-contaminan-peru/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/05/el-martirio-de-negritos-ciudad-atrapada-bomba-de-gas-petroleo-peru/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/05/petroleo-amazonia-peru-remediacion-ambiental-que-nunca-llega-jose-olaya/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/05/cementerios-de-petroleo-comunidades-indigenas-luchan-contra-contaminacion-peru/,"Alexa Vélez, Antonio Paz, María Isabel Torres, Vanessa Romo Espinoza, Gabriela Quevedo,  Juan Julca, Gloria Alvitres, Enrique Vera, Elizabeth Salazar, Lupe Muñoz, Lourdes Fernández, Eduardo Mota, Richard Romero, Sebastián Castañeda, Hugo Alejos, Patrick Murayari and Dalia Medina.","The team that produced this special is made up of ten investigative journalists, four photographers, a geographer, a programmer and two audiovisual and social media specialists. This group has been part of the investigations into oil that Mongabay Latam has published in 2022 and 2023, where the fines of the oil companies were denounced and where the damage that these companies left in four Latin American countries began to be revealed.

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,,,Fortunes of War,2024-07-01,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Chart, Business, Economy","3D modeling, Scraping, D3.js, Three.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Node.js","“Fortunes of War” combined data journalism and boots-on-the-ground reporting to expose allegations of deceptive behaviour by Australian pension funds.  Our investigation painstakingly compiled public disclosure data from sustainable or ethical-labelled superannuation options, to find out if the promises these funds made matched the reality of where member’s money ends up.  We revealed ethical-labelled funds held almost $30 million dollars in companies involved in making some of the most controversial weapons including nuclear weapons and white phosphorus munitions. When we cast the net wider to include companies involved in weapons-related products, we found a further $1.1 billion in investments.","The story was extremely well received by our audience. We believe this because the piece was able to show our audience where the retirement savings were being invested in a clear manner. With wars in the middle east and Ukraine, there is heightened interest in where people’s money is being invested. Through the course of our reporting we’ve heard from pension fund members who were shocked to find where their money was ending.  We also received tip-offs from the public about the investments of some funds, that led to a follow up story.  In the wake of our reporting in “Fortunes of War”, one of Australia’s largest funds announced plans to overhaul the wording of its investment policies to exclude some of the weapons types examined in our story.","The wrangling of data and developing a robust way of classifying a controversial weapon manufacturer were two big challenges.  There is no requirement for funds to publish disclosures in a consistent format. The spreadsheet structure changes between funds and assets are named inconsistently. That meant we had to manually clean and copy over the data from each portfolio into our master spreadsheet.   We then needed to develop a way to compare the funds’ shareholdings with a list of public companies globally that report revenue from controversial industries. We used ISIN codes - a globally consistent, unique code for publicly listed companies. We sourced ISINs from public databases and matched them to our data.   To ensure the accuracy of the data we were analysing, the team programmed 18 scrapers for each fund. Then the program compared the data it had collected to ours to check for any discrepancies in the spreadsheet we had manually compiled.  The pension funds are required to publish their portfolio holdings every 6 months, so the tools we built during this investigation will allow us to more easily analyse their investments in the future.","We used node.js to write the scrapers for the fund and the program to analyse check for any issues in our main database.   For the data wrangling, cleaning, joining and analysis we used a combination of Google Sheets and R.  To visualise the data, the team used a combination of D3, Svelte and various in-house tools. We also used the open source 3D software blender to produce the depleted uranium animations.","Two takeaways for other journalists for the piece are:  1. This project was built off the back of previous reporting we had done looking into the investments of these funds in the fossil fuel industry. By returning to the subject, we were able to streamline our data gathering and come up with more sophisticated methods for fact checking. When we return to check the data again when a new round of disclosure is released, I’m certain we’ll be even faster at turning around these impactful data stories. By investing time in understanding the data coming up with a methodical approach to data collection when we first began reporting this story, we are now able to iterate on that process and make it easier and faster each time.  2. We did this using entirely open-source software and code libraries. So everything we did could be entirely recreated without any budget constraints, other than the time it took us to pull it all together.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-01/ethical-super-savings-found-in-controversial-weapons-makers-/104015686,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzRuMjrHgqc,,,"Pat McGrath, Mark Doman, Jack Fisher, Thomas Brettell, Katia Shatoba, Alex Lim","The story was a collaboration between the ABC’s data team and its investigations unit.

Chile,"Centro de Investigación Periodística (Ciper), Mongabay Latam",Small,,,La fórmula de minera Quiborax para saltarse las reglas en el Salar de Surire,2024-03-06,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Fact-checking, Crowdsourcing, Environment, Corruption","AI/Machine learning, Drone, Scraping","Autoridades chilenas investigan a la empresa minera Quiborax, luego de que la denunciaran por eludir la evaluación ambiental. El Salar de Surire es considerado Monumento Natural por ser una de los principales sitios en América del Sur para la reproducción de tres especies de flamenco. Un equipo periodístico de Mongabay Latam y Ciper analizó una filtración de más de un millón de correos electrónicos enviados entre altos ejecutivos de Quiborax. Las comunicaciones, que fueron cotejadas con documentos oficiales, dan cuenta de la elaboración de un plan para flexibilizar las restricciones establecidas y poder así extraer mineral desde zonas restringidas.","El valor de esta investigación radica en su contundencia. Aunque en numerosas oportunidades la minera Quiborax ha sido denunciada por daño ambiental, la empresa siempre ha logrado salir ganadora.  Tras la publicación, el diputado por Arica y Parinacota, Vlado Mirosevic, del partido Liberales Chile expresó su preocupación por el daño ambiental generado en el Salar de Surire, así como por los vínculos entre la empresa Quiborax y los funcionarios públicos que se unieron para eludir la evaluación ambiental.  Luego de la publicación del reportaje, el Consejo de Defensa del Estado, se trasladó al Salar de Surire y se reunió con personal de la Corporación Nacional Forestal —la autoridad ambiental en Chile— para tener información sobre las operaciones de Quiborax. El 3 de julio, el CDE demandó a Quiborax por daño ambiental continuo, acumulativo, permanente e irreparable en el salar de Surire. El Primer Tribunal Ambiental acogió la demanda del Consejo de Defensa del Estado y ordenó la paralización de las faenas de Quiborax en el salar de Surire hasta el 31 de diciembre 2024.  La Superintendencia de Medio Ambiente se encuentra indagando también sobre posibles daños al salar.","Quiborax es una empresa que ha esquivado la evaluación ambiental durante varias décadas. La razón principal es que Quiborax posee dos decretos supremos que le permiten explotar en el salar de Surire y que le fueron otorgados durante la dictadura de Augusto Pinochet, en tiempos en que la actual legislación ambiental no existía.  Para la elaboración del reportaje debimos analizar la información contenida en más de 1.000.000 de correos electrónicos filtrados de ejecutivos de la empresa, y cotejar esos datos con documentos oficiales que estaban en poder de distintas instituciones chilenas.  Para obtener esos documentos recurrimos a la Ley de Transparencia y a bases de datos públicas. El equipo también visitó el Salar de Surire y realizó decenas de entrevistas a lugareños, trabajadores de la minera, y expertos ambientales.  Luego de publicado el reportaje, Quiborax presentó una demanda en tribunales por la divulgación de información considerada por ellos sensible. Los dos periodistas que elaboraron el reportaje fueron citados a declarar por la fiscalía que investiga esa denuncia. Hasta ahora, esa indagatoria judicial no ha avanzado.","Utilizamos Thunderbird para cargar los correos electrónicos filtrados de los ejecutivos de la minera Quiborax, y desde ahí buscar por palabra clave. Ordenamos los correos según tema de interés, y elaboramos planillas en Excel que utilizamos como índice temático de los correos.  La información que hallamos en los correos electrónicos la chequeamos con documentos oficiales que estaban en poder de distintas instituciones chilenas (Conaf, Ministerio del Medio Ambiente, Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente, Sernageomin, Ministerio de Agricultura). Para acceder a esos documentos utilizamos la Ley de Transparencia; los solicitamos a través de gestiones de prensa; y otros los encontramos buscando en las bases de datos oficiales, como por ejemplo la que pone a disposición la Superintendencia del ramo donde detalla los procesos de fiscalización y las posturas de distintos organismos a la hora de evaluar proyectos.  Nuestro equipo periodístico también visitó el Salar de Surire, ubicado en el altiplano, donde realizó entrevistas a trabajadores y también a comunidades indígenas que rodean la minera. Asimismo utilizamos un dron para poder realizar mediciones propias respecto de la localización de las zonas de explotación, y la distancia con los sitios de reproducción de los flamencos, o bien de los lugares donde estos anidan.","Creemos que fue relevante el proceso de chequeo de los datos contenidos en los correos electrónicos filtrados. Y, para eso, la utilización de las distintas herramientas disponibles en Chile: Ley de Transparencia y bases de datos públicas, principalmente.  Otro asunto importante fue la constatación de que una de nuestras hipótesis iniciales (las comunidades indígenas se ven afectadas por las activiadades de explotación minera de Quiborax) fue refutada luego de reportear en terreno. En realidad los indígenas están divididos, porque mientras algunos critican a la minera, otros la defienden por ser esta una de sus principales fuentes de financiamiento al otorgar trabajo y llevar recursos materiales al altiplano. Ahí apareció un tema colateral: el abandono del Estado de las comunidades que viven alejadas de los principales centros urbanos.   Fuimos cuidadosos a la hora de redactar el reportaje. Por ejemplo, no imputamos delitos o irregularidades que no estuvieran respaldados por sentencias de los tribunales, o bien por conclusiones de los organismos fiscalizadores. Buscamos resguardarnos de posibles acciones judiciales de una empresa minera que nunca había sido escrutada por la prensa en Chile.

The analysis provided the first comprehensive look at potential jurors in the state’s history, and it shed light into lingering disparities among jurors in some of the state’s judicial districts.","The story raised awareness of the racial disparities that remain in Connecticut’s jury system, three years after state court system recommended a long list of reforms to the jury selection process. Following the story, Connecticut lawmakers sponsored bills to increase juror pay in Connecticut in order to ensure lower-income individuals didn’t preemptively opt out of jury service.","The Connecticut Mirror requested the data from the Judicial Branch through a Freedom of Information Act request, and negotiated what portions of the new juror data would be provided under the law.","To analyze the story, Renata compared 2022 Census data with jury selection records to assess racial representation.

The report reveals that the government vehicle tracking system has failed to keep tabs on vehicles being used for purposes other than those intended.  Although the Ministry of Transport denied what was mentioned in the investigation, an audit report was published later revealed information that confirmed the findings of the ARIJ investigation.","This data-driven investigation was published in AlGhad Newspaper; the most widely circulated newspaper in Jordan with mention on the first page.  Following the publication of the investigation, the “Ministry of Transport”’s budget, which oversees the vehicle tracking project, was discussed in a session of the Financial Committee in Parliament. Several questions were raised regarding the projects and entities managed by the ministry, in the presence of the minister.  Later, the Audit Bureau in Jordan, a regulatory authority, published a report which revealed information similar to what the ARIJ investigation uncovered؛ the audit report states that the government vehicles are being parked overnight in areas and lots not designated for them, and that there is a malfunction of tracking devices on many vehicles, also the distance/time meters in several vehicles are faulty, preventing the verification and accuracy of their fuel consumption, according to the audit report.  The report also revealed that the entities most in violation of the vehicle tracking system were the vehicles of the “Ministry of Local Administration and Municipalities”. The ARIJ investigation highlighted these vehicles’ violations of the system. Also, the audit report uncovers that the disbursement of fuel quantities exceeded the allocated amounts in monitored governmental entities.","The investigation relied primarily on extensive fieldwork conducted evening and late night and after official working hours, as well as on holidays as access to government data was controlled. Despite these constraints, the journalist put a lot of effort into gathering firsthand evidence, including direct observations, anonymous testimonies. The report included an analysis of the state’s public budget data over a period of eight years؛ Data on fuel expenditures were collected from the budgets of over one hundred entities within the state, which involved gathering data from thousands of pages. This coincides with government statements claiming that it reduced the energy bill for its vehicles, which the investigation revealed to be contrary. Legal threats were a constant concern, as cybercrime laws in Jordan have been used to target journalists. It criminalizes the criticism of the government and poses significant risks to journalists and their sources, hindering the ability of the media to report news and provide information freely.","Data was collected through extensive fieldwork by identifying government vehicles on the streets after working hours.Google Spreadsheets  were used for data storage and cleaning, while Microsoft Excel was utilized for analysis. Flourish was employed for data visualization as an initial version of the charts before being designed by coding. Google Maps and Google Earth Pro were used to pinpoint vehicle locations, and the data was cross-referenced with open government records to verify the functionality of the tracking devices.","Fieldwork could be crucial for data collection, especially in the absence of cooperation from the authorities. Despite limited resources, a journalist can carry out investigations that uncover the actual effectiveness of government projects and validate the claims made by the authorities.

Canada,Investigative Journalism Foundation,Small,,,Open by Default: Canada’s Comprehensive Access to Information Database,2024-03-05,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Politics","Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Node.js, Next.js, React","Our Open by Default (OBD) database stores over 6.9 million pages of internal government documents recovered via Access to Information (ATI) requests. It is the only database of its kind in Canada, making available, for the first time, completed Access to Information requests on thousands of topics of public interest, from pandemic policy to sanctions on Russians following the invasion of Ukraine.   The database was designed to meet the evolving needs of news consumers and to enhance transparency by providing journalists and the public with free, direct access to data about the internal government processes that shape Canadian politics.","The public launch of our OBD database in March 2024 had an immediate impact. Traffic to our website increased by 53% as Canadians flocked to look at the documents for themselves. IJF reporters have also exhibited what the database can do when it’s put to work, by uncovering incidents of fraud in Canada’s COVID benefit regime, and finding evidence of the Canadian Armed Forces’ difficulties during its anti-terrorism mission to Jordan.  Perhaps most importantly, journalists at other outlets have been keen to leverage Open by Default documents in their own reporting. CBC News, Canada’s national public broadcaster, used the database to report on internal goings on at Canada’s IRS, the Canada Revenue Agency. Canadaland reporter Cherise Seucharan called Open by Default a “treasure trove” for Canadian journalists. Dean Beeby, Canada’s preeminent ATI reporter, described OBD as “a huge benefit to the country and to journalism.” It’s clear that OBD is the kind of innovative news product that will transform the industry by making it easier to conduct high-quality investigative journalism with less time and smaller budgets.","Under Canada’s Access to Information (ATI) laws, Canadians have the right to access government records about any topic. In practice, however, ATI requests have little impact on transparency, because documents are released only to the individual who made the request. Say, for example, that Jane Doe submits a request to the government for all documents pertaining to COVID-19 vaccine trials. Other users would be able to see that Jane Doe filed that request, but only Jane Doe would receive the actual vaccine trial documents. Or put another way, under the old status quo, ATIP releases had an audience of precisely one.   The IJF’s critical innovation in our Open by Default project is to file piggy-back ATI requests. Now, when any ATI request is filed, the IJF automatically files a duplicate request, meaning that, along with the original requester, we also receive a copy of the liberated files. We then publish those files in full to our database, so that any member of the public or journalist can search through and read them. In this way, our Open by Default achieves the stated purpose of Canada’s ATI regime, by making internal government documents easily and freely accessible to all Canadians.","We have a Node.js crawler bot that monitors Canada’s open data portal and files a piggy-back request to the relevant government department when a new ATI record is released. IJF employees monitor for email and physical copies of documents, uploading them to Google Drive. We then use Google Apps Script to process uploaded documents and link them to their related request ID. Batches of processed requests are uploaded to DocumentCloud via a Node.js script, and DocumentCloud OCR’s and hosts our files. Our front-end, built in Next.js and React, lets users search the full text of these documents and browse or download copies. Our front-end is deployed using Vercel with CloudFlare as a caching layer. Registered users can save individual documents for future reference, a feature which relies on Supabase.","We hope that journalists draw two lessons from our OBD project. The first is that government portals are not the only source for government data. Being stymied by a government portal, like the ATI portal, that does not actually publish liberated ATI files, should not spell the end of reporting on important public interest topics. We hope that journalists looking to report on these topics will not be put off by government sources, but rather will come to the IJF for complete, centralized, and searchable data.  Second, and relatedly, we hope that journalists see the value in using the OBD in their reporting on virtually every beat. OBD contains millions of pages of documents packed with rich detail about all areas of government activity; everything from how a government decides whether to intervene in a foreign war, to how to address a human rights complaint, to how to respond to an environmental crisis. There are thousands of new stories in these documents, but also detail to enrich existing stories, and we hope that journalists will use OBD to do deeper reporting that keeps Canadians informed about what is going on behind closed doors in the halls of government.",English,https://theijf.org/open-by-default,https://theijf.org/the-ijf-launches-open-by-default,https://theijf.org/open-by-default-roundup,https://theijf.org/how-white-collar-criminals-profited-from-the-chaos-of-covid-19,"Matt Malone, Adam Soames, Daniel Nass, Sam Park, Martin Allen, Kate Schneider, Carly Penrose, and Zak Vescera.","This project combined the skills of the IJF’s technical and editorial teams with those of a research team from Thompson Rivers University (TRU).

The script used Pandas for data manipulation and GeoPandas for geospatial operations, such as joins between city locations, state boundaries and eclipse path geometries. The script required time zone conversions and adjustments for Daylight Saving Time and managed precise time calculations. The processed data was then used to create an interactive Mapbox application, allowing users to zoom to specific cities and see when the eclipse would be most visible and how much obscuration they could expect.","We had several more ambitious ideas that we dreamed up during the brainstorming process, but ultimately decided on a simple, searchable map for people to easily use to answer the question of when and how they could see the eclipse.

Portugal,DIVERGENTE,Small,,,The non-voter time bomb,2024-02-21,"Investigation, Cross-border, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Elections, Arts","D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, R, Python","“The Non-Voter Time Bomb” is a  multimedia investigation into voter abstention in the EU, designed to engage audiences through compelling data and storytelling.   The homepage offers two sections.  On the left, users can explore a data-driven analysis of voter abstention across the 27 EU countries over the past 50 years. Interactive maps reveal insights about abstention in 697 electoral events, allowing users to visualize participation while correlating it with 16 socioeconomic indicators, such as inequality and education levels.   On the right, a narrative report presents the ten Portuguese parishes with the lowest voter turnout, enriched with photographs and community stories.","The ”Non-Voter…” had a significant impact on both the media landscape and public discourse surrounding voter abstention in the EU. The dataset and analysis contributed to 14 articles published across nine media outlets in seven EU countries. By November 2024, the project had garnered 22,940 pageviews and attracted 4,699 unique users from 62 countries, primarily Portugal, Italy, and Slovenia, highlighting its broad reach.  The team was interviewed by six media outlets, including podcasts and public broadcasting, and two chronicles were published in the national newspaper Público. The team organized five public events to present the feature (350 attendees).  On social media, posts reached over 20 million followers in the EU, while newsletters sent by DIVERGENTE to 4,229 subscribers boasted an impressive 50% average open rate.   The report has sparked important discussions about democratic participation and the reasons behind citizens’ feelings of detachment from it starting from concrete data gathered.  The datasets will serve as a valuable resource for future journalistic, research and policy making endeavours.   Finally, in the scope of this investigation we are developing a toolkit to be designed and shared with other journalists and students on cross-border collaborations in data investigations (Link 4).","This feature emerged from the collaborations involving 17 media outlets across 13 countries, coordinated by DIVERGENTE in the scope of the European Data Journalism Network.  A challenge that we faced was accessing data from primary sources, as we intended. All electoral results presented were sourced from the National Electoral Commissions from each country, or the official bodies with similar functions, such as national Ministries of the Interior, among others. To analyze voter abstention in relation to socioeconomic indicators across all countries, we began by compiling data from the National Statistics Institutes. However, we quickly discovered inconsistencies in the data and variations in data collection methodologies. To effectively identify correlations between countries and regions within the EU, we decided to base our analysis on data collected in accordance with EU standards.  Finally, our most significant barrier was securing adequate funding; despite the crucial nature of our work, we faced multiple rejections from both public and private institutions: we were told the investigation was too long, undefined, and asked questions that weren’t guaranteed an answer—as if doubt and uncertainty weren’t the best places to start an in-depth journalism project.","“The non-voter time bomb” combined a variety of tools and technologies and took a multidisciplinary approach.  We have used advanced data analysis software, including statistical tools and programming languages like Python and R, to analyze the extensive dataset. This allowed us to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies in voting patterns against socioeconomic indicators. For data visualization, we leveraged interactive graphic design tools such as Tableau and D3.js. These enabled us to create engaging visual representations, making complex data comprehensible for readers and allowing them to filter and interact with the information dynamically.  The design was also an important element: the iconography was centered around the act of ”counting”, symbolizing time, distances, and votes in a rhythmic way, much like a clock ticking down. Our designer wrote a newsletter about the relation of the visual identity and the data (Link 2).  We collaborated with plastic artist Nogueira Lopes to create an illustration (”The open veins of democracy” 230 x 64 cm, Link 3) that encapsulates the project’s urgent essence  Photograph and narrative portraits of communities with low voter turnout brought real-life stories to the forefront, combining the data with personal storytelling.","We believe that other journalists can take lessons from the multidisciplinary approach in journalistic work of ”The non-voter time bomb”.  The illustration of this investigation was selected for a collective exhibition by the Portuguese Foundation Júlio Pomar, highlighting the impact of combining data analysis with visual arts. Additionally, we produced a series of serigraphs that we distributed and sold within our community, establishing a new revenue source essential for an independent, non-profit media outlet like ours.  This project emphasizes the importance of human stories. While data is crucial, personal narratives connect readers to the broader issues at hand. By including real-life portraits and stories, we foster empathy and urgency. We were recently approached by a Portuguese city hall from one of the parishes portrayed in our work, expressing interest in creating a street exhibition this summer. This exhibition will showcase the stories and photographs from these parishes in public space, inviting local residents to reflect on democratic participation and voter abstention.  Ultimately, by combining data, visual storytelling, and innovation, journalists can produce impactful and creative work that not only informs but also engages and inspires meaningful dialogue around critical societal issues.","English, Portuguese",https://bombarelogio.divergente.pt/en/home-english/,https://shorturl.at/RHMNq,https://abstencao.divergente.pt/en/home?page=maps&tic=true,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DVxnmMlLjLXF2ynkjWjmQOa7-lJbGYCY,"INVESTIGATION: Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Luciana Maruta, Sofia da Palma Rodrigues  METHODOLOGY: Sebastião Ferreira de Almeida  DATA COLLECTION: Adrian Burtin, Adrian Mihălțianu, Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Chrysoula Marinou, Daniel Kerekes, Gianna Grün, Giovanni Vale, Hana Radilovič, Indrė Kiršaitė, Ioana Epure, Jelena Prtoric, Joanna Elmy, Kata Moravecz, Kelly Kiki, Kira Schacht, Krisztián Szabó, Luciana Maruta, Mădălina Mihălțianu, Marta Ley, Michel Penke, Michela Finizio, Nina Hlebec, Riin Aljas, Raphaël da Silva, Ruben Brugnera, Sofia da Palma Rodrigues, Taja Topolovec  INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE: Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Diogo Cardoso, Gonçalo Fialho, Luciana Maruta, Sofia da Palma Rodrigues  DATA ANALYSIS: Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Luciana Maruta, Sebastião Ferreira de Almeida, Sofia da Palma Rodrigues  DESIGN: Gonçalo Fialho, Diogo Cardoso  WEB DEVELOPMENT David Reis  TEXT Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Luciana Maruta, Sofia da Palma Rodrigues  PHOTOGRAPHY AND IMAGE EDITING Diogo Cardoso, Ricardo Venâncio Lopes  EDITING Sofia da Palma Rodrigues  TEXT ”THE OPEN VEINS OF DEMOCRACY” Miguel Carvalho (text),   ILLUSTRATION ”THE OPEN VEINS OF DEMOCRACY” Nogueira Lopes  DATA REVIEW (COUNTRIES): Ana Pereira, Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Cledivânia Pereira, Luciana Maruta, Sofia da Palma Rodrigues  DATA REVIEW (PARISHES): Alice Corona, Amanda Fincatti, Andrea Mauro, Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Benedetta Tonnini, Cinzia Bongino, Dataninja, David Uku, Elisa Bertoli, Luciana Maruta, Natalia Motorina, Ruggero Marino Lazzaroni, Sofia Cherici, Sofia da Palma Rodrigues  METHODOLOGICAL REVIEW: Margarida Perestrelo  PORTUGUESE PROOFREADING: Alda Rocha  ENGLISH TRANSLATION: Sandra Young  ENGLISH PROOFREADING: Felicity Pearce  COMMUNICATION: Beatriz Walviesse Dias, Cledivânia Pereira  PRODUCTION:  Ana Pereira  OTHER SUPPORT: Carla Luís, Francesca Berardi, Frederico Rocha, Isacco Chiaf, Patrícia Alves, Pedro Costa, Ricardo Venâncio Lopes, Rui Oliveira Marques  MAPS (COUNTRIES AND PARISHES): OpenStreetMap  COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS: Luciana Maruta  INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS  Are We Europe (Belgium), Átlátszó (Hungary), Delfi Meedia (Estonia and Lithuania), Dataninja (Italy), Denník N (Slovakia), Deutsche Welle (Germany), DIN MIA’CET-Iscte (Portugal), El Confidencial (Spain), EUrologus (Hungary), II Sole 24 Ore (Italy), iMEdD (Grece), NARA (Lithuania), Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso Transeuropa (Italy), Pod črto (Slovenia), PressOne (Romania), Rue89 Strasbourg (France), Voxeurop (Belgium).","DIVERGENTE is an independent, bilingual, digital magazine based in Lisbon, dedicated to investigative and narrative journalism.

Fifty were convicted in December for raping or sexually abusing Gisèle.    The one thing that united these rapists? The now-defunct Coco.fr “dating site,” which hosted unmoderated chatrooms selling date rape drugs, spaces to post revenge porn, and child sex abuse materials. These men first connected with Dominique on Coco before moving their conversations to other platforms. CNN learned of other websites that had popped up in Coco’s place.","One of Gisèle Pelicot’s lawyers, Antoine Camus, told us that he referenced CNN’s work in his closing arguments of the trial. Camus said that CNN was ”the first (and indeed the only!) to draw my attention to the existence of a website of the same type as the one involved in the Pélicot affair.”     And, less than a month after CNN’s report was published (to coincide with the conclusion of the Pelicot trial) Coco founder Isaac Steidl was placed under formal investigation.    Our work – which was viewed by over 1.2 million people – told a complex and editorially heavy story clearly and engagingly, in part through the use of custom graphics reproducing some of the real-life exchanges contained in the police report.

This collaboration uncovered the true costs of flaring-related emissions by the oil and gas sector for as much as a decade worth of gas flaring, attributing thousands of geo-localized flaring signals to hundreds of companies.  Our series revealed massive discrepancies between what oil and gas majors self-declare in terms of flaring emissions, and what they actually do emit through this industrial practice, while also providing the first estimates of demographic exposure to these poisonous flames and gases.","Our project was selected as one of the top collaborations of 2024 by the Montclair University, best stories of 2024 by the francophone section of the Global Investigative Journalism Network, as well as featured and quoted by various international and national European, African and Arabic media. Training sessions based on this collaboration have been provided to Arena for Climate, Data Harvest Conference, SEJ (Society of Environmental Journalists) 2025 Conference (Upcoming) etc.","Flaring has been investigated using remote sensing signals in the past, but never to this extend and with such a systemic approach.   Oil & Gas majors only publish global flaring emissions figures, but without any detail by country. Our collaboration managed to calculate and rightfully attributes linked to 665 single assets (oil & gas fields, pipelines, refineries, LNG plants) over a ten year period, and attribute these emissions to the operators of each of these assets.  This allowed us, for the first time, to expose the individual responsibilities of big oil companies regarding their flaring emissions.     Through this work, we’ve exposed that Western fossil fuel giants were emitting the largest shares of flaring-related CO2e emissions, while European operators themselves were the top emitters across these 18 countries, including 9 jurisdictions where flaring is either prohibited or strongly regulated.   Refined counts attributed by single companies also led us to discover that Big Oil companies were severely under-declaring their CO2 emissions through joint ventures established to divest their responsibility in some of the world’s most polluting oil and gas licences. Overall, we discovered that several majors were untransparent about their emissions reporting methodology and largely under-reporting CO2e emissions, such as ENI, BP and TotalEnergies.","#BurningSkies used OSINT to fetch oil and gas licenses shapefiles for a set of 18 individual countries featuring owners, operators, geo-coordinates from publicly available sources, whenever available.   We cross-referenced these shapes with signals locations and emissions values made available by the US NGO ’Skytruth’, in order to attribute signals to a specific license.  We then went on each of the 665 licenses (asset lines), and confirmed visually that they were not located on an unrelated asset (for instance, a refinery operated by company B, but located on Licence A), for current year at the time of the project (2024).  For each of these assets, we verified past ownership and operatorship history in order to be sure to rightfully attribute flaring emissions signals to the correct company.","This methodology means that, in theory, we could expand this methodology on a global scale to monitor the true costs of flaring worldwide. Using the same open source approach and easy methodology, the project can indeed be replicated everywhere, and anytime.  Any journalist can replicate this methodology, anywhere - every single year.  This could become a long format reporting initiative allowing to hold any companies accountable for their flaring activities and its impact on climate, but also very locally on biodiversity and public health, as impacts of gas flaring on human health are believed to start from a 90 miles radius only.","French, English, Arabic, Portuguese, German, Spanish, Dutch, Italian, Croatian",https://eiforum.org/burning-skies-the-hidden-of-big-oils-toxic-flames/,https://eic.network/projects/burning-skies.html,https://eiforum.org/wp-content/uploads/Burning-Skies-Investigation-Methodology.pdf,,"Reporting  Yann Philippin (Mediapart), Alexandre Brutelle and Leopold Salzenstein (EIForum), Micael Pereira (Expresso), Stefano Vergine (Domani), Begona Ramirez (infoLibre), Blaz Zgaga and Saša Leković (Nacional), Natalia M.

Brazil,Agência Pública de Jornalismo Investigativo,Big,,,Projeto Escravizadores: investigações sobre escravidão no Brasil,2024-11-19,"Investigation, Long-form, OSINT, Politics, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, OCR","The **Projeto Escravizadores** investigated the genealogy of all Brazilian presidents since redemocratization after the end of the dictatorship, as well as current senators and governors, to identify ancestors linked to slavery. Of the 116 authorities analyzed, at least 33 had ancestors involved in enslaving people. Many politicians were unaware of these connections.    All of this information was presented in an interactive visualization of the 33 politicians and their ancestors. 15 reports were also published that delve deeper into the cases investigated and the legacy of slavery in Brazil.  The investigation was conducted with support from the Pulitzer Center.","The report was an unprecedented investigation of its kind in the history of Brazilian journalism, as it presented the connections of ancestors of important figures of power with slavery. The series of articles made available and transcribed historical documents, some of which were previously unavailable to the general public, about the Brazilian slavery period. The project was cited by The New York Times; highlighted by LatAm Journalism Review in Portuguese, English and Spanish; was recognized as one of the Pulitzer Center’s stories of the year; translated into French by Autres Brésils; and repercussed in Brazilian media outlets and programs such as DW Brasil, Jornal do Brasil, MSN, ISTO É Dinheiro, UOL, Terra, Band, Alma Preta, Brasil de Fato, Sul21, O Termo, Jornal Alerta, the Brasis newsletter, from Ajor, and Rádio Escafandro. The project was also mentioned by Frei David, founder of EducaAfro, on 11/21 during official event organized by the Advocacia Geral da União in partnership with the Ministry of Racial Equality, in Brasília. We also published a column in Folha de S. Paulo about the importance of the investigation.","The **Projeto Escravizadores** was conducted in an environment where discussions about slavery and its legacy are both controversial and sensitive. Slavery shaped Brazil’s social and economic structures, and its effects persist today in racial inequality, land and power concentration, and systemic barriers faced by Black Brazilians. Addressing this history often provokes resistance, making our investigation particularly delicate. While no politician formally contested our findings, some ignored our requests for comment, while others reacted defensively when confronted with historical records about their ancestors. Given the polarized political climate, we took precautions when addressing potential repercussions, especially on social media, where the subject matter could provoke strong reactions.    We faced resource constraints, restricted access to historical archives, and the challenge of analyzing vast, diverse, and inconsistent records. Legal precautions were necessary to ensure accuracy and prevent disputes. To overcome obstacles, we used OCR for document analysis, R programming to organize genealogies, and illustrations and interactive visualizations to make complex histories accessible and engaging.","Between July and October 2023, we mapped sources and finalized a document database for the research. This database includes nominative lists of inhabitants, such as a 19th-century population census, as well as post-mortem inventories, which detailed the assets left by deceased individuals, including enslaved people, on the properties of the elite of the time—similar to modern wills. We also gathered baptism, birth, and marriage records from registry offices, parish records, digital archives, and the FamilySearch website, which became our primary research tool. Additionally, we consulted registry offices and public archives from different states.  Our database also incorporates digital tools such as DivulgaCand (a database from the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) that compiles information on Brazilian candidacies) and Google Scholar. We used the collaborative database SlaveVoyages, which documents vessels and routes used in the transatlantic slave trade. Furthermore, we analyzed historical newspapers in newspaper libraries and public archives, along with academic works from several Brazilian universities.","Other journalists can learn several key lessons from **Projeto Escravizadores**:   * Investigating ancestry and historical records requires patience, cross-referencing multiple sources, and an understanding of paleographic writing. Journalists working with historical data must develop strategies to verify and interpret old documents accurately.   * The project leveraged OCR for document analysis, R programming for data organization, and interactive visualizations to present findings in an engaging way. These tools can help journalists handle large datasets and make complex historical information accessible to the public.   * Given the sensitivity of the topic, the team sought legal guidance to prevent disputes. Investigative journalists dealing with controversial subjects should consider legal risks and ensure their findings are well-documented and defensible.   * The investigation touched on a divisive historical issue, requiring careful communication and a strategy for managing potential backlash, particularly on social media. Journalists can learn how to navigate sensitive topics while maintaining ethical reporting standards.   * The project faced restricted access to archives, inconsistent records, and resistance from some individuals. Overcoming these challenges required adaptability, collaboration, and creative research methods, such as adopting genealogical research techniques and consulting universities that specialize in handling this type of data in their academic work.","Português, inglês",https://apublica.org/especial/projeto-escravizadores-investigacoes-sobre-escravidao-no-brasil/,https://apublica.org/2024/11/projeto-escravizadores-33-brazilian-authorities-have-ancestors-linked-to-slavery/,https://apublica.org/2024/11/como-a-publica-descobriu-os-antepassados-que-teriam-escravizados/,https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/enslavers-project,"Amanda Audi, Ana Alice de Lima, Babak Fakhamzadeh, Bianca Muniz, Bruno Fonseca, Bruno Penteado, Catarina Bessel, Danilo Queiroz, Darlene Dalto, Ester Nascimento, Ethieny Karen, Fernanda Diniz, Leandro Aguiar, Leticia Gouveia, Lorena Morgana, Mariama Correia, Marina Dias, Matheus Pigozzi, Matheus Santino, Patrícia Junqueira, Pedro Ezequiel, Rafael Custódio, Rafael Oliveira, Raphaela Ribeiro, Raquel Okamura, Renata Cons, Romeu Loreto","Founded in 2011 by female journalists, Agência Pública is Brazil’s first non-profit investigative journalism agency.

Our goal was to understand coping strategies and identify effective methods for building digital resilience. The project emphasized the urgent need to address the gendered nature of online abuse. It called for accountability from tech companies, governments, and social communities through improved digital literacy, enhanced reporting mechanisms, and regulatory measures to create safer digital spaces.","The unique design and interactive’s innovative approach to visual storytelling, not only made the quantitative information more accessible, but also resonated deeply with our audience – generating significant engagement across CNN national and international digital platforms, and sparking important discussions about online safety for girls and young women. The study was live streamed on CNN broadcast channels, picked up by other media outlets, and garnered further discussion with international organizations such as Amnesty and Helvetas about the importance in addressing online safety.     Our aim was also to support digital awareness, literacy and resilience among girls and young women. The survey and focus groups involved and engaged directly hundreds of girls aged 13-24 in nine countries across South America, Africa and Asia, creating a safe space for them to learn and inform themselves, and providing a platform for the girls to share their fears, doubts, and aspirations. They also shared their solutions to make their online experience safer.","What context about the project would you like the jury to know about (200 words max)   Digital abuse is a pervasive issue affecting millions of women online globally. Yet, we rarely hear directly from young girls about the specific harms they face and what they believe is needed to ensure a safer digital future.    The data is also patchy and often unavailable. Thanks to Plan’s extensive network, we surveyed more than 600 girls across nine countries worldwide, and we found that 75% have faced harmful content online at some point, with more than one in 10 experiencing it daily or almost daily. These experiences include hate speech, discrimination, and unwanted sexual content, leading to significant emotional distress such as anxiety and depression for over a third of respondents.    Legal advisers and local facilitators helped us arranging focus groups with 73 girls in Brazil, Malawi and the Philippines, to ensure their safety and to avoid triggering questions.    The month-long research culminated in the production of an innovative digital interactive published on CNN international in July 2024. The immersive experience integrated personal testimonies from the young women, exclusive survey data, and expert insights from a dozen interviews.","We used Excel to read, parse, and analyze the data.    We developed an original visual approach to navigate the complex landscape of hundreds of data points, and to transform the raw data into a compelling visual narrative. Our visual Editor developed tools to visuals the survey numbers that represent geographies and characters to make the information more compelling.   Each survey participant was represented by a single dot, which dynamically moves across the different sections based on their survey responses. At the same time, the same dots collectively form digital illustrations of three girls, allowing for the sharing of their personal stories while protecting individual identities.","When our team first approached the topic, it became clear that obtaining quantitative and qualitative insights would be a challenge. We also wanted to partner with an organization that already had built a relation of trust with young girls.      We collaborated with NGO Plan International in month-long research to develop an experimental framework to survey hundreds of girls in very different geographical, social and economic contexts. We also facilitated focus discussion groups with 73 girls in Brazil, Malawi and the Philippines, presenting them with a range of case studies of digital harms and letting them discuss potential responses. These safe spaces provided a platform for the girls to share their fears, doubts, and aspirations. They also shared their solutions to make their online experience safer.      By blending quantitative insights with qualitative testimonies, the project provided an innovative and engaging storytelling approach about the challenges faced by girls in the digital space.",English,https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2024/07/business/online-sexual-harassment-girls-survey-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html,,,,CNN As Equals Team,Staff entry

The rising tendency among coastal women, particularly girls, hysterectomy in the name of tumour removal among middle-aged women and lack of appropriate treatment, and including salt water into their life for prawn and crab farming is taking tablets during menstruation. But all of this has been emphasised in this report—how much has this pattern altered, why salt water is used instead of pure water during the rainy season?","The consequence is that, despite the fact that this trend has been prevalent among the populations of this region for an extended period, it was not as well-known among health professionals or government officials. Subsequent to this report, numerous additional media outlets have been motivated by it. The accountability of the district administration, civil surgeon, Bangladesh Water Development Board, Public Health Engineering Department, and numerous local hospitals has been established. In addition, the prevalence of certain diseases and the underlying causes have been verified through interviews with women in specific unions, surveys, and data analysis.","First, this issue began when a seafood export zone including crab and prawns was established along this shore. Researchers and victimized women’s remarks have helped us to pinpoint this. However, the government and those engaged in the moneylender company are not eager to classify this industrial sector based on this idea. All the information on the kind of land changing  land fit for farming or other uses comes from the Soil and Salt Research Institute. They are giving them, but local level is not affected by it. Instead, everyone who was leaning towards using certain international corporations to produce this white gold for economic development has now become like bring on a tragedy by their own negligence. The extent to which green villages have been rendered pallid is illustrated by Google satellite images, which demonstrate the influence of saline water. The absence of a depleting crimson motherhood has resulted in the cultivation of white gold. As a result, the number of divorces has increased, and individuals in that region are migrating and losing their livelihoods. In essence, the environmental sustainability assessment that was required prior to the establishment of this economic zone was not conducted.","We conducted a study of four unions, developed a sample form, and distributed it to our female colleagues in the workplace to ascertain its appropriateness for the women. Subsequently, we visited the site again to do the survey and record footage for a television documentary. We engaged around 25 local NGOs and visited the girls’ residences with their assistance. Subsequently, we endeavored to comprehend by the examination of diverse study texts and essays whether cervical tumors are attributable to salinity, sought any scientific rationale, and aimed to go further by consulting health specialists’ perspectives. We encountered significant difficulties in cleansing the data and aligning it with a precise description. If it does not align with the hypothesis, all our efforts will be in vain. We organized the data into a precise structure, posed enquiries regarding the field data, and sought corresponding replies; in certain instances, this resembled solution journalism.","Following the completion of this research, several journalists have expressed a keen interest in gaining a deeper grasp of the subject, as such an extensive report replete with information and data has not previously been produced in Bangladesh. Despite its intermittent coverage in the media as brief news segments, it has not been comprehensively explored.

United Kingdom,"Climate Home News, Dialogue Earth",Big,,,Shell greenwashing gas with fake carbon offsets,2024-02-02,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, OSINT, Chart, Satellite images, Agriculture","Scraping, Canvas, Google Sheets, Google Earth, SentinelHub","This series of articles revealed how Shell used fake carbon offsets to “greenwash” the production of liquified natural gas (LNG). Climate Home News and Dialogue Earth discovered Shell-linked projects claiming to slash methane emissions in rice fields across China did not have real activities on the ground. Despite being aware of issues with the projects, the energy giant used millions of carbon credits issued by the scheme to sell LNG cargoes as “net zero”. More widely, the investigation raises questions over the credibility of the voluntary carbon market as a mechanism for companies to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.","Climate Home ran a long-running investigation into what was a little-known corner of the voluntary carbon market. When it first raised concerns about rice farming offsetting schemes in 2023, carbon standard Verra suspended the projects while carrying out an internal review.   After analysing Verra’s database in January 2024, Climate Home discovered that Shell had used millions of carbon credits produced by the schemes for offsetting purposes despite the well–established integrity allegations and Verra’s pending investigation.   Eventually, in August 2024 Verra took the unprecedented step of revoking the projects due to serious integrity failures and imposed sanctions on some of the companies involved.  Meanwhile, Climate Home and Dialogue Earth worked together on a follow-up to the story after a whistleblower provided credible evidence that the projects were never actually implemented on the ground.  The final investigation heaped more pressure on Verra to strengthen its verification processes to ensure the credits’ integrity and obtain compensation from Shell and other involved companies for the fake credits. We understand Verra is still in the process of seeking repayments.   Policymakers and campaigners used the findings of the investigation to call for more stringent regulations in the carbon market.","Over the last few years, carbon credits have been increasingly promoted by polluting industries - and many governments - as an effective way to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and channel financing for climate projects towards developing countries.   Our investigations showed the voluntary carbon market is riddled with deficiencies and integrity failures which allow companies like Shell - the world’s largest user of carbon credits - to greenwash fossil fuel production without any repercussions.   Carbon offsetting projects offer little upfront transparency and key technical details are buried in reports that could be hundreds of pages long. The investigation relied on painstaking data gathering and analysis from a large number of sources - including Verra’s database, reports issued by project developers and verifiers and filings submitted by Shell.   Both Climate Home and Dialogue Earth are small independent media outlets with limited resources to run investigations of this caliber and magnitude.   The verification of claims made by project developers on the ground in China provided further challenges given the country’s political landscape which restricts press freedom and investigative reporting, in particular.","As a starting point for the investigation, reporters scraped all rice cultivation projects located in China from Verra’s carbon credits database. Further research unearthed Shell’s direct involvement in ten of those projects - something not openly declared on the database.   Collating data from various sources, we compiled our own dataset, including additional information on how many credits from the “phantom” projects had been used, by whom and for what purposes. This provided us with an overview of the projects’ significance and claimed impact on emission reductions.   We analysed the projects using satellite images which cast initial doubt on some of the key technical claims made by project developers. For example, by uploading KML files from all of the projects we could see that project developers artificially divided up large rice farming areas to qualify the projects as “small-scale” and obtain exemptions from stricter checks.   We also received input from a risk intelligence firm that used an AI-model to identify issues with carbon credit projects. Their evidence further corroborated our findings.","To our knowledge, this is the first investigation shedding light on a clear-cut example of fake carbon credits used by a fossil fuel company to sell products as “net zero” GHG emissions.   Our investigation shows how journalists can use data from carbon standards like Verra to probe the green claims made by polluting companies like Shell and prompt regulators to take action when wrongdoing is identified.  The final story investigation in the series also shows how journalists can use open access carbon reports to trace the steps that led to the approval of a carbon offsetting project, and find inconsistencies in the process. This is what we set out to do in an effort to find if the rice projects had ever existed.   The main challenge of the story was that the projects were located in China, which made ground reporting and scanning through government documents very difficult. We found a way around it by partnering with Chinese journalists from Dialogue Earth, who played a crucial role in probing the offsetting project’s reports. The project also illustrates how journalists can find ways to work in very difficult locations, where there are severe limitations to press freedom.","English, Chinese",https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/12/19/shell-greenwashed-gas-junk-chinese-carbon-credits-offsets-phantom/,https://dialogue.earth/zh/3/60066152/,https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/02/02/shameful-shell-uses-carbon-credits-under-investigation-to-meet-climate-targets/,https://www.instagram.com/climatehomenews/reel/DFdjLp9S93g/,"Matteo Civillini (reporter), Shi Yi (reporter), Lin Zi (editor), Sebastian Rodriguez (editor), Fanis Kollias (visuals), Mariel Lozada (social media).",Matteo Civillini is a senior reporter at Climate Home News.

Journalists from Arte’s program Sources have discovered accounts using stolen images of children, on which users express their ”sexual fantasies” in comments. Even more worrying, their investigation uncovered profiles dedicated to the sale of pedocriminal images. These profiles link to Telegram groups where folders containing hundreds of CSAM are sold. Under a false digital identity, journalists were then able to observe that Instagram’s algorithm suggested that they follow suspicious accounts and directed them to videos and photos of children.",This investigation was shared by several child protection organizations on social media. It was also added to the list of educational resources of the French association Contre les Violences sur Mineurs. The journalists were invited to take part in a ”stream react” on Arte’s Twitch channel to share behind-the-scenes insights about the investigation.,"Within the editorial team of Sources, we were struck by the announcement of a lawsuit against Meta, the company that owns Instagram, filed in the United States in March 2023. Several pension and investment funds holding shares in Meta accuse the company’s leadership and board of directors of having ”turned a blind eye” to human trafficking and child exploitation on its social networks. However, Meta asserts that its platforms strictly prohibit human exploitation and child sexual abuse. For this investigation, we decided to analyze hundreds of accounts and examine the role of the algorithm.  This required in-depth research on Instagram using a dedicated investigative account.  All content was reported to the French authorities (Pharos) and Instagram.","We began our investigation by creating an anonymous profile without publishing any content. To ensure credibility and minimize bias, we followed mainstream accounts, such as actors and influencers. We then examined which keywords were permitted or banned on the platform. By searching seemingly harmless terms like ”sport boys” or ”gymnastics,” we uncovered dozens of suspicious accounts. We documented these accounts, recording in an Excel document their creation dates and, when applicable, their deletion to assess Instagram’s moderation effectiveness. Among the patterns we identified, we focused on fake accounts impersonating French-speaking minors. These profiles advertised Self-Generated sexual content but redirected users to Telegram channels selling image and video packs of child sexual abuse. By analyzing seller posts, we identified several buyers through transaction screenshots. We further investigated accounts selling ”Mega links” of child sexual abuse material, listing 1,000 of them and documenting the Telegram channels linked in their bios or stories. Many accounts led to the same URLs, exposing moderation failures.To map these networks, we scraped followers of these accounts and analyzed the data using open-source tools such as Gephi and Cytoscape. Finally, we examined Instagram’s algorithm by scrolling through Reels, Discover, and suggested accounts, tracking the frequency of suspicious content.","This programme shows that sometimes investigative stories can emerge from platforms that seem entirely familiar - and that it’s not always necessary to delve into the dark web or hard-to-access platforms to find out how child sex offenders are exchanging photos of children or selling illegal images of abuse. As digital investigative journalists, this investigation also highlights the importance of tracking down seemingly innocuous content on social media - such as videos of children dancing - and following those leads. In doing so, the investigation draws attention to the role of platforms in fostering harmful networks and calls on them to take responsibility for their lack of moderation.","français, anglais, allemand",https://www.arte.tv/en/videos/117240-002-A/data-sources/,https://www.arte.tv/fr/articles/pedocriminalite-les-failles-dinstagram-la-methode,,,Directed by:  Valentin Petit  Maëva Poulet  Editor-in-Chief:  Sylvain Pak Producer:  Alexandra Jousset,"Maëva Poulet and Valentin Petit are investigative journalists specializing in digital investigations using OSINT techniques.

What stands out about these attacks is that they targeted the few civilians left in the area, mostly elderly or people with disabilities. The scale and intensity of the attacks were unparalleled in other cities in Ukraine at the time.  DW’s investigative unit collected, documented and analyzed reports of Ukrainian authorities on drone attacks resulting in civilian harm. The team counted over a hundred strikes that left nearly 130 civilians injured and 16 dead.","DW’s investigation documents, for the first time, a new pattern of a potential war crime in the context of Russia’s war in Ukraine: the use of commercial first-person-view or FPV drones to target civilians.  DW’s investigation was the first one to systematically document Russian FPV drone attacks in Ukraine and explore the reasons behind these. Following the investigation, other local and international media outlets reported on the story. Experts in international humanitarian law and war crimes investigators have reached out to and referred to DW’s findings resulting from this data-driven and open source investigation to independently investigate specific cases of interest.  The attacks that first started in Beryslav have now expanded to the neighboring city of Kherson, sparking the interest of dozens of other media outlets to look into civilian harm caused by Russian FPV drones along the frontline in what journalists have started to call a ”human safari”.","Drone attacks are particularly difficult to investigate, even for law enforcement. They leave little evidence behind and, since they happen so close to the frontline, it’s challenging for journalists, prosecutors and officials to mobilize to the scene and document them in person, especially because of the risk of becoming a target of a double-tap attack (a tactic often used by the Russian military).  For this reason, social media platforms and open-source techniques proved to be a crucial aspect to the investigation. On Telegram specifically, the team found a trove of videos showing specific Russian units and soldiers conducting drone attacks and targeting civilians in Beryslav - a digital footprint that might be used as the only critical evidence in future accountability processes.   The investigation successfully combines open sources with traditional journalism to reduce research gaps. Even though the story started as an open-source investigation, the investigative unit in Berlin worked closely with DW’s bureau in Kyiv to get as close as possible to the frontline, traveling to the Beryslav district to speak with survivors, rescue groups, volunteers, and local law enforcement.","The team built its own database on Google sheets, extracting the information Ukrainian authorities shared via Telegram on drone attacks resulting in civilian harm (e.g. timestamp, number of casualties, type of casualty, age of casualty, type of target, type of drone, reporting authority, source link, and, when media was available and it was possible to geolocate incident, coordinates).  After mapping the geolocated drone attacks on Google Earth, DW projected the potential flight trajectory the drones could have followed – taking into account their average flight ranges – to narrow down the area where these attacks might have originated and establish potential attribution.  The team crossed this data with relevant information that Russian stakeholders (such as military bloggers and politicians) posted on their Telegram channels, including videos of drone attacks, delivery of drones and supplies to the area of interest, and deployment of Russian military units and volunteer battalions.  As a result, DW was able to identify the units operating drones in the area, Russian drone manufactures and patterns of FPV drone attacks.","As a result of this project, other journalists can learn how to develop a methodology to monitor drone attacks, in terms of: -Where to find open source data (such as Telegram, VKontakte, etc) -Identifying relevant data to create their own monitoring and database (date, time, type of target, casualties, etc) -Mapping and geolocating attacks and potential drone trajectories  -Identifying and analyzing patterns of drone attacks  -Identifying drone manufacturers and types, as well as military units using them  At the same time, the project shows the limitations of open-source data and highlights the importance of crossing this information with human voices.","Russian, Ukrainian, German.

This project involved sending Freedom of Information Requests to every country in the region, as well as collecting data from open databases and media outlets to try to compile the best posible dataset for the region. We combined the data with our extensive fieldwork to better understand the underlying causes of homicides in the region.  We published this special in both, Enlish and Spanish, as a web app, and as a static PDF.","InSight Crime’s 2023 Homicide Round-Up was the most read special in 2024. It got 98,999 views and generated 6,848 downloads, a clear indicator that users found the content engaging.  Media outlets from Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, the United States, Colombia, Panama, India, Brasil, Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, Australia and Honduras cited our special.   Outside of journalism, academics  government officials, such as the Honduran Minister of Security, and world leaders have extensively shared our maps and graphics in both private and public settings.","As a nonprofit media outlet, InSight Crime published this special in two languages, with resource limitations. Everyone involved had to take on multiple roles, and every part of the process had to be done twice. This was further complicated by the fact that many governments gave us preliminary data, only to then publish significantly different figures, which meant we had to update graphics, maps and our analysis in both languages.    In order to get the data we had to write and file 31 public information requests following different formats in 5 different languages. Many of these requests were ignored, denied or responded to with incomplete, poorly formated or unreliable data. In these cases, we then had to search public databases, reach out to our sources on the ground, and monitor media outlets to get realiable data through other means.   Many countries in the region had different methdologies to measure homicides, which not only complicated country to country comparisons, but also required us to take the utmost care with our analysis to avoid misinterpretations of the data.","InSight Crime used an AI-assisted monitoring system to hourly scrape news articles from nearly 400 regional and international media outlets, and refine them to the most relevant results. Human researchers further refined the articles, verified the information and built a database to feed our analysis.  The team utilized AI tools to create freedom of information request templates, and translate and copy-edit the Homicide Round-Up related content, before humans revised the final versions.   We used JavaScript and Mapbox to build the scrolling map within the web app, as well as D3 to make some of the graphs included in the article. The statics maps were made using Adobe Illustrator and the promotional videos were made with Adobe Premiere.","1. How to organize and analyze large amounts of data and deliver a story in an efficient, user-friendly format. We were able to cut down the word count, despite having more countries than ever before, and integrated navigation tools throughout the app to help readers easily find specific countries. 2. How to access official data through freedom of information requests (FOI) and how to proceed when the data is not provided. For example, when we couldn’t access official data via FOIs, we relied on public databases, NGOs and other sources to get reliable estimates for nearly every country. 3. The importance of telling the stories behind the data. For example, according to our Homicide Round-Up, El Salvador had the lowest homicide rate in the region, but their methodology artificially deflates the figure, which is vital to mention in the analysis.  4. How to use simple visuals to compliment text. For every country, we included a table with the main data points and homicide rate trends that made a large dataset more digestible.","English, Spanish",https://insightcrime.org/news/insight-crime-2023-homicide-round-up/,https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/InSight-Crimes-2023-Homicide-Round-Up-Feb-2024-2.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCFchDTAFfY,https://insightcrime.org/es/noticias/balance-insight-crime-homicidios-2023/,"Juliana Manjarrés, Christopher Newton","Juliana Manjarrés is Colombian journalist specialized in conflict resolution.

South Africa,African Arguments,Small,,,“It’s the wild west”: Zombie mines multiply in South Africa’s opaque coal sector,2024-09-18,"Investigation, Open data, Map, Politics, Environment, Corruption","Drone, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap","Opacity in South Africa’s mining sector is allowing hundreds (if not thousands) of mines to be abandoned without undergoing environmental rehabilitation. The consequences are severe for surrounding communities, yet accountability is near impossible due to the lack of public data. This project investigated 10 coal mines listed as ”active” by the government in Ermelo, Mpumalanga province. By triangulating the limited available data with field reporting, I identified 3 abandoned mines among the 10. I was able to create an interactive map of the mines, their owners and some of the reported damage to the surrounding environment and communities.","The project was shared widely by the publication African Arguments and the Earth Journalism Network which supported it with a grant. It thus reached a wide audience across South Africa and the wider African continent. It was the subject of discussions within the mining sector (as shared by mining consultant Paul Miller) and in advocacy circles. It also inspired further reporting on the topic by journalists, including reporter Tommy Trenchard who is currently reporting on the issue for NPR (US).","Access to data was a major challenge in reporting this piece. South Africa doesn’t publish a mining registry, unlike other mining countries such as DRC and Namibia. This made it difficult to find the GPS coordinates of the mines. I had to use satellite imagery along with a map created by a mining consultant on the basis of data published by the South African Heritage Resources Agency, as detailed in the story. This led me to re-angle the story with a strong focus on the lack of data itself. Through my field reporting, I sought to ”create my own data” to tackle - even in a small way - this opacity.","I used satellite imagery from Google Earth, triangulating it with data sourced from AmaranthCX and South Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources and Energy. I also used the good old field reporting: I travelled to each of the ten coal mines, observing if they seemed active and interviewing local communities. I  collected drone and camera footage and GPS data to complete the data. I then entered all the data in Datawrapper to create an interactive map.","The biggest lesson I learnt from this project, which I would share with other journalists, is that, sometimes, the lack of information is the story itself. The deeper I looked into this story, the more I found that the lack of public data, registry, ownership lists etc allowed an absolute lack of accountability in the mining sector.",English,https://africanarguments.org/2024/09/absolutely-ridiculous-zombie-mines-multiply-in-south-africa-opaque-coal-sector/,,,,Reporter: Julie Bourdin Editor: James Wan,"Julie Bourdin is a multimedia journalist based in South Africa.

United States of America,"The Markup, Outlier Media",Small,,,Premium Penalty,2024-07-18,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Economy","Scraping, QGIS, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Docker, Tabula, SciKit, Airtable","Premium Penalty is a nine-month investigation by The Markup and Outlier Media into the high cost of auto insurance in Detroit. Our reporting and unique data analysis found insurers heavily relying on people’s location to set their rates, and that as a result, Black Michiganders are saddled with the most expensive policies. This is despite a 2019 state law that, in an attempt to fix this disparity, banned companies from using ZIP codes to set rates.","Following publication, U.S. House Representative Rashida Tlaib, representing western Detroit and its adjoining suburbs, responded to our reporting: “Ban credit scores and they use ‘insurance scores’ from the same companies. Ban zip codes and they come up with even more precise location discrimination. This report confirms what our residents have been telling us. Insurers are still finding ways to get around reforms intended to prevent discrimination.” Our report was then mentioned in Tlaib’s constituent newsletter.   Detroiters said the project empowered them. Tonya, a panelists who shared her personal data with an insurance agent for this story, said that our findings “really opened my eyes to how we get exploited.” Multiple sources said they planned to shop around for better rates after learning about the disparities.  Local media amplified our findings. NPR affiliate WDET invited reporter Koby Levin and Melissa Love, a featured Detroiter, to discuss the [investigation on air](https://wdet.org/2024/07/23/how-michigans-insurance-reform-laws-failed-to-protect-detroit-drivers/). CBS Detroit also hosted a [live interview](https://www.wxyz.com/news/insurance-reforms-were-supposed-to-bring-relief-detroit-drivers-are-still-paying-more) with Levin and Love, while WXYZ [republished our investigation](https://www.wxyz.com/news/insurance-reforms-were-supposed-to-bring-relief-detroit-drivers-are-still-paying-more).   The investigation resonated nationally. 190+ newsrooms across the country, most of them local journalism outlets, republished our story, and over 160 republished our guide on [how to get a discount on car insurance](https://themarkup.org/premium-penalty/2024/07/18/how-to-get-a-discount-on-your-car-insurance).","**We got real world pricing comparisons:** US car insurance company websites block users from checking what their insurance premium would be based on different address locations. We got around this by convincing an independent insurance agent to use their backend systems to check three Black women’s real car insurance premiums in Detroit, and how much those premiums would change, if they lived at another home address. For the first time ever, we saw how big of a difference home addresses made, in real-world pricing. To our knowledge, no other newsroom has gotten these internal pricing calculations.   **We did our own, unique data analysis:** Journalists and researchers have conducted similar car insurance data analyses by buying data from companies like Quadrant Information Services. This is an easier path to take, but the insurance industry has always criticized this method, asserting that it violated core actuarial practices. To sidestep this argument, we instead collected all of the data from insurance company rate filings ourselves and constructed our own bespoke measure of how location affected prices totally isolated from all other factors.","To conduct our [disparate impact analysis](https://themarkup.org/premium-penalty/2024/07/18/how-we-investigated-car-insurance-loopholes-in-michigan/) of auto insurance premiums in Michigan, we analyzed 52,000 pages of regulatory documents from the state’s top insurers to extract territory-based premium data. We then created a “location effect” measure, comparing each territory’s base rate to the insurer’s median rate. This quantified the impact that a person’s location has on their premiums.  To connect location effects with demographics, we matched insurer territories to corresponding census geographies using geospatial techniques, including boundary matching for pre-existing maps and internal variation analysis for insurers’ custom maps. We used quintile sorting to group territories by location effect, race, income, and population density, enabling comparative analysis.  To test for disparate impact, we calculated the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, choosing rank correlation because the extreme location effects in Detroit and majority-Black areas risked skewing results with other methods. Additionally, we conducted a nearest-neighbor analysis to pinpoint areas where crossing territory boundaries led to significant changes in premium rates.  Finally, actual quotes from an insurance agent and on-the-ground reporting allowed us to go beyond data analysis, and show that very concretely, when isolated, changing someone’s location directly changes their insurance premium.","Premium Penalty demonstrates how meticulous data analysis, combined with on-the-ground reporting, can expose systemic inequities hidden within complex pricing algorithms. The team manually reviewed 52,000 pages of regulatory filings from Michigan’s top auto insurers, creating a bespoke “location effect” measure to isolate how addresses impacted premiums. This approach ensured findings were based solely on geography, avoiding common industry criticisms.  The investigation also highlights the importance of overcoming data access barriers. Since insurers and vendors don’t allow consumers to compare premiums by location, the team partnered with an independent insurance agent to run real-world pricing tests. This innovative method provided concrete evidence, not just theoretical models, of how location-based discrimination inflates premiums for Black residents.  Collaborating with affected communities further strengthened the investigation. By involving Black Detroiters to test quotes and combining their experiences with statistical findings, the project moved beyond abstract analysis to real-world impact. We also addressed potential industry pushback by refining our methodology through expert peer review, ensuring our claims were defensible and transparent.",English,https://themarkup.org/premium-penalty/2024/07/18/michigans-fair-and-reasonable-reforms-allowed-car-insurers-to-charge-more-in-black-neighborhoods,https://themarkup.org/premium-penalty/2024/07/18/how-we-investigated-car-insurance-loopholes-in-michigan,https://themarkup.org/premium-penalty/2024/07/18/why-stopping-algorithmic-inequality-requires-taking-race-into-account,https://outliermedia.org/detroit-car-insurance-rates-crime-theft/,"Mohamed Al Elew, data reporter Aaron Sankin, reporter Koby Levin, reporter Sarah Alvarez, reporter Natasha Uzcátegui-Liggett, statistical journalist  Soo Oh, editor","Mohamed Al Elew is a journalism engineer at The Markup, where they use data and software to produce investigative reporting.

Canada,Investigative Journalism Foundation,Small,,,How Canada Spends: a Comprehensive Procurement Database,2025-08-14,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Politics","Scraping, D3.js, Json, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python, Next.js, React","We built and made public a massive database that shows how the Canadian government awards contracts and spends tax dollars on goods and services. This database work laid the foundation for our investigative journalism that exposes who wins government contracts and which companies benefit the most from Canada’s procurement policies.  The database provides, for the first time, a unified way of searching through 187,000 government tenders and 987,000 contract awards. We spent weeks correcting errors in public records and standardizing company names to allow for comprehensive searches that would not be possible in the government’s own databases.","The project has already allowed us to investigate several stories that have impacted the political discourse in Canada. For example, a scandal that gripped Canada for years was the federal government’s perceived favouritism in allowing SNC-Lavalin, a giant engineering services corporation, off the hook for offering bribes internationally. The database work helped our journalists show that the company had garnered $80 million in new contracts since it pleaded guilty to offering payments to a dictator’s son overseas. A similar story involved IBM and its error-riddled Phoenix pay system, which has plagued federal civil servants for years. Despite admitting serious problems, and costing thousands of employees money and grief, we showed the company continued to receive millions of dollars in government contracts.  Most importantly, our database is a permanent resource for all journalists in Canada that is already empowering reporters at other outlets to do more reporting on government contracting, increasing transparency and accountability in this key democratic domain. We have heard from other journalists that the extensive entity standardization we did has been invaluable in revealing other procurement-related stories, as the government’s own raw data often contains too many errors and duplicates to be reliable for data analysis.","While the Canadian government publishes open data in a variety of ways, it is often not presented in a fashion that is useful or accessible for journalists. Procurement data is an example: diffuse sources, non-machine readable formats, and errors limit the value to journalists of the government’s original procurement data. We collected all available data and then used optical character recognition (OCR) to allow for keyword searching, which is crucial to be able to follow links between providers, suppliers, government officials and departments. We also organized a large team to perform extensive entity standardization to ensure searches would be comprehensive and accurate.   The product is a database that is far superior to the government’s own data in that it provides: - Unified formats, to compare in-kind contracts reported disparately across Canada. - Cleaner data, which allows anyone to follow patterns obscured by lax reporting standards.   - Indexed documents, which allows searching inside the technical materials not searchable at the source.","Our procurement database leverages Python-based web scraping technology to scrape and parse publicly available procurement records which are then schematized into a full-text searchable PostgreSQL database. Records are manually standardized using an in-house tool to handle discrepancies in supplier names, which often contain slight spelling variations. We built a front end using Next.js and React to allow users to search procurement records by buyer, supplier or individual award. Users can view all relevant data about a specific award (such as supplier, value, date awarded), along with related documents, which we host on S3. Our front-end is deployed using Vercel with a CloudFlare caching layer. D3.js charts give visitors a high-level overview of the data.","We hope that journalists draw two lessons from our procurement database project. The first is that government portals are not the only source for important government data. Being stymied by a broken government portal or error-riddled government dataset should not spell the end of reporting on important topics like who the government awards contracts to. In addition to our procurement database, the IJF hosts 10 other databases on topics like political donations and lobbying. We hope that journalists looking to report on these topics will not be put off by government sources, but rather will come to the IJF for cleaner, centralized, and searchable data.  Second, and relatedly, we hope that journalists will see the value in covering government contracting more closely. The poor quality of government data has meant that contracting – the process by which hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money is allocated to private corporations each year – has not received the scrutiny it deserves. We hope that journalists will use our database to report on where this money is going, and that, as a result, Canadians will be much better informed about how this crucial part of government is working (or not working) in their interests.",English,https://theijf.org/procurement,https://theijf.org/10-companies-winning-federal-contracts,https://theijf.org/snc-lavalin-contracts-ijf-procurement-database,https://theijf.org/ibm-phoenix-pay-system,"Daniel Nass, Martin Allen, Sam Park, Bethany Lindsay, Apurva Bhat, Kate Schneider, Zak Vescera, Anusha Siddiqui and Liv Chug.","This project combined the skills of the IJF’s technical and editorial teams.

Our investigation reconstructed the timeline of events and uncovered new evidence using data from a civil inquiry that had not yet been reported by the press. Based on academic and technical studies, we developed infographics to illustrate the industry’s impact more clearly.","Our work exposed a socio-environmental injustice neglected by authorities for nearly a decade, shedding light on an issue previously overlooked by mainstream media. The report documents errors and omissions in the environmental licensing process, revealing government complicity. By connecting technical data and turning it into infographics, we demonstrated how Coca-Cola FEMSA’s factory directly impacts 800 rural families who have struggled with water shortages for years. On O Joio e O Trigo’s website, the report became the most-read piece of the year within days, surpassing 144,000 views, with 27.6% of total browsing time dedicated to its reading. It was republished by several independent media outlets, reinforcing its relevance and the mainstream media’s neglect of the topic. Additionally, the story was featured in a special by Connectas, a Latin American journalism network, about water use by ultra-processed food industries. The report’s impact underscored the urgent need for greater transparency and oversight of water resource exploitation by major corporations, highlighting the necessity of holding both these companies and public authorities accountable.","The investigation faced challenges in accessing information and resistance from both authorities and industry representatives in granting interviews. We overcame these obstacles by cross-referencing public data, analyzing documents from the lawsuit filed by Campinho and Suzana residents against Coca-Cola, and gathering information from multiple sources to reconstruct the timeline of Coca-Cola FEMSA’s establishment in Itabirito. Interviewing affected communities, authorities, environmentalists, researchers, and attempting to secure a statement from a Coca-Cola spokesperson took nearly three months. This extensive effort allowed us to cross-check information and finalize the report. Creating the infographic required additional research due to the region’s geological complexities: the same aquifer supplying the community was also being used by Coca-Cola. Instead of being confined in a valley, it is a vertical aquifer. Understanding and simplifying these technical aspects was a major challenge.","In addition to interviews, we relied on civil inquiry documents, including hydrogeological reports, service contracts, and spring flow monitoring data. Geologists were consulted to produce infographics aimed at making the information clearer and more accessible.","The main lessons we spotted are: - Despite the lack of transparency, the report demonstrated that persistence and cross-referencing data can expose irregularities. Reviewing the civil inquiry and understanding the procedural steps were essential in providing a solid foundation for the investigation. - Narratives that combine technical data with human stories make complex issues more understandable and accessible to the public. - With technical rigor and documentary evidence, journalism can challenge corporate influence and bring critical public interest issues to light. - Translating technical information into visual formats, such as charts and infographics, broadens a report’s reach. These visual elements must complement the text while also serving as standalone informational units. - Our investigation connected scattered pieces of information published over the years, introduced new findings, and provided a comprehensive understanding of the case and the interests at stake. Journalism also plays a crucial role in structuring and linking publicly available information.

Swift is known for her highly detailed, narrative-driven songwriting, often using complex structures, internal references, and poetic storytelling. This makes her lyrics rich in meaning but also harder to memorize compared to simpler, repetitive pop songs. At the same time, her storytelling is one of the key reasons for her massive success—fans deeply connect with her words, and her songs become anthems of personal experiences.  By using data to examine this phenomenon, the project provides insight into how lyrical complexity and emotional storytelling contribute to the global impact of her music, even when individual lyrics may be harder to retain.","Data collection and analysis: Conducted using Python, leveraging data science techniques to process streaming numbers and lyric trends. Data sources: Integrated Spotify’s API to retrieve official streaming data and used web scraping techniques on Genius to extract lyrics for further analysis. Design: Infographics were created in Figma, ensuring a visually appealing presentation.","This project demonstrates that data journalism can be applied to entertainment and pop culture, offering a unique and engaging perspective that is not often explored in generalist media. Journalists can learn:  How to uncover and analyze data behind cultural phenomena, finding new angles for storytelling. The originality of using data in music journalism, proving that many topics, even in entertainment, can be approached with a data-driven methodology. The importance of looking beyond conventional news topics, as many cultural and lifestyle stories have hidden data sources that can lead to compelling insights. The success of this project shows that audiences respond to data-driven storytelling even in non-traditional areas, paving the way for new ways to cover entertainment, music, and cultural trends.",Spanish,https://www.elconfidencial.com/cultura/2024-05-25/cancion-taylor-swift-artista-mas-escuchada-mundo_3889580/,,,,"Ana Ruiz, Héctor García Barnés, Emma Esser, Marina G.

United Kingdom,Inside Housing,Small,,,How many toddlers and babies are living in temporary accommodation?,2024-05-17,Investigation,"Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Datawrapper","In the UK, homeless families are housed in “temporary accommodation”, often spending months or years in unsafe conditions, which can have a particularly severe impact on the health and development of very young children. But the government’s public data doesn’t differentiate between teenagers and toddlers, meaning we have no idea how many of these children are in the age bracket most at risk. Inside Housing’s data dashboard uses quarterly FOIs to every local authority in the UK to track how many families with children aged under five are living in temporary accommodation, the type of accommodation, and for how long.","Inside Housing is the only outlet to have collected and published this data. . Since the data dashboard launched, more than 40 councils have now begun to provide the data, including a number of major councils who say it was in direct response to Katharine’s work.  Following Inside Housing’s publication of this dashboard, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has said it intends to begin publishing age breakdowns of children in temporary accommodation. The chair of the Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee told Inside Housing she would push the government on this commitment.  Katharine was invited to write an article for the Guardian on her investigation. The dashboard has had strong, consistent usage, including between quarterly updates, particularly from government departments, academics and campaigning groups.    The dashboard was welcomed by Shelter chief executive Polly Neate and Sylvia Stoianova, deputy programme director at the National Child Mortality Database, who said: “Collecting and publicising data about the numbers of young children in temporary accommodation, as Inside Housing’s data dashboard is doing, is essential… Gathering more and better data on this issue will be key to improving and saving children’s lives.”","In the UK, the housing crisis has seen record numbers of families housed in temporary accommodation. This accommodation is often unsafe and in poor conditions, examples include whole families housed in a single hotel room, sharing bathrooms with single men, and washing their clothes in the sink. Dr Laura Neilson, an A&E doctor and chief executive of the Shared Health Foundation, says she has seen children with dangerous fractures, burns, and respiratory conditions caused by their temporary accommodation.  Data from the National Child Mortality Database found that between 2019 and 2024 the standard of temporary accommodation was a contributing factor in the deaths of 74 homeless children.. Of these, 54 were children aged under one. Charities and campaigners on the safety of children in temporary accommodation say that more data on the number of toddlers and babies in these living conditions is vital to reducing the mortality rate. Sylvia Stoianova, deputy programme director at the NCMD, said that public, age-segregated temporary accommodation data “would allow for more integrated and multi-agency support for families, helping integrated care boards for example to see the scale of the problem in their area so they can plan services.”","The FOI asked local authorities to report how many households with children aged under five are in temporary accommodation, whether it was B&B temporary accommodation which is usually the worst conditions, and how many had been there more than six weeks or six months. These FOI requests are repeated every quarter for the most recent data, and have also obtained historical data, so it currently spans each quarter from December 2022 to September 2024.  This data is held in a large spreadsheet, which is used to create the local authority-level analysis of numbers and change over time. It is also combined with household population census data in order to provide a ‘per 1,000 households’ adjustment. Pivot tables are used to conduct regional analysis. The tables, charts and map are all created in Datawrapper, and edited with html.  On the day of the government’s quarterly publication of temporary accommodation data (which provides the numbers of households with children in TA, but is not age-segregated), XLOOKUP is used to combine the FOI data with the government’s public data. This means that estimates can be made for the missing local authority data, to calculate a national top line figure.","This project not only shed light on the numbers of families with young children trapped in these living conditions, it also shed light on the huge numbers of local authorities which refused or were unable to provide the data. Many said they would have had to manually search thousands of records in order to provide the numbers. This included a number of councils with among the highest homelessness levels in the country. Katharine pushed back on as many of these refusals as possible, and this project has prompted a number to change their analysis and reporting processes in order to be able to access the data. So this project shows how vital it is to highlight information gaps in public bodies and demand they look for solutions.",English,https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/how-many-toddlers-and-babies-are-living-in-temporary-accommodation-in-the-uk-86337,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/may/24/thousands-of-children-under-five-living-bed-and-breakfast-government-allowing-this,https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/news/government-to-start-publishing-age-breakdown-of-children-in-temporary-accommodation-after-inside-housing-investigation-88538,https://www.insidehousing.co.uk/insight/the-doctor-turned-campaigner-for-homeless-children-89503,Katharine Swindells,Katharine Swindells is deputy features editor at Inside Housing.

To do this, we gathered various data through a year and two months of intensive FOIA requests to the Korea Forest Service, 32 national forest management centers, forest aviation centers, 10 forest aviation management centers, the Korea Fire and Rescue Service, 17 provincial fire departments, 17 metropolitan local governments, and 100 basic local governments. We also interviewed at least 130 people in person or by phone.","After the story broke, politicians and the Forest Service realized the severity of the problem and began to act. For example, in August, after our report, lawmakers released a report on “Wildland Firefighting Helicopter Golden Time Compliance” from the Forest Service and the Congressional Budget Office. The report showed that 7 out of 10 forest helicopters arrived at the scene within the golden time, which is the same as our analysis. Also, after the report, an official from the Forest Fire Prevention Division of the Korea Forest Service called Danbee News to say that they agreed with the issue of the shortage of specialized forest firefighters and said that they would increase the number of firefighters. In September, the Forest Service announced the “Five-Year Strategy for Promoting Forests for All,” which stated that it would bring together dispersed facilities and personnel for disasters such as forest fires.","Over the course of a year and two months, the Who Puts Out Wildfires project was the culmination of tenacious reporting. We had to obtain and refine a vast amount of information scattered across the country. The Forest Service alone, the primary agency responsible for fighting wildfires, has 32 national forest ranger stations under its umbrella. Helicopter operations and management are handled by the Forest Aviation Headquarters, which has 11 forest aviation management centers under its umbrella. In addition, various organizations such as the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, 17 provincial fire departments, 17 metropolitan governments, and more than 100 basic local governments are involved in fighting wildfires. Information on forest fires was scattered among agencies and organizations, not in one place, and Dhanbinews made FOIA requests to each of these agencies and organizations to obtain information on forest fires. However, even after making the request, there were many cases where information or files were missing or had errors. In the case of the departure and arrival of special firefighters, we had to call 32 national forest management centers to correct the data errors. We also released it to readers to increase the transparency and objectivity of the article.","I mainly used R and Excel: first, I worked to clean up the massive data into a single file; then I analyzed the data to make sure it made journalistic sense; then I visualized it so that readers could read the story effectively; and finally, I...

Malta,The Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation,Small,,,Malta’s Golden Visas What Problem Are They Solving and Who Benefits?,2024-11-05,"Investigation, Long-form, Fact-checking, Corruption, Economy","Google Sheets, Python, Regression analysis","Malta runs an investor residency scheme, which is meant to attract capital to the country. But by closely examining the sceme’s impact, we found numerous negative externalities: it contributes to real estate market overheating, security concerns at the EU level, and disproportionate impacts on some localities. Their extent was only known anecdotally -- until now.  A team of journalists and researchers  used innovative and collaborative data gathering and analysis methods to address data gaps. They found that while law firms, service providers and landlords benefited, ordinary residents were increasingly priced out of the rental market, and trickle-down effects were minimal.","Instead of publishing a single story, we decided to create an online resource with available data, photography, and narrative for media and researchers to use. The findings were reported by major media in Malta, and we received emails of interest from academics in several countries. The team leader presented the findings at the University of Malta, and there are talks to discuss them on a podcast. Despite the government saying the main stakeholders were consulted, we found they were not informed about the local impact of golden visa investments. When we contacted the government for their right of reply, we were told that the government is working on a study of its own. This has not materialised. Malta continues selling golden visas, but we expect to see more impact of the project when the deadline comes to implement new EU anti-money-laundering legislation, which places emphasis on golden visa facilitators.","Malta is a rather secretive jurisdiction, with no lobbying transparency and high tolerance for revolving doors and politically exposed persons’ conflict of interest. Legislators are part-time, and they often engage in business on the side. Although the present golden visa scheme is the brainchild of the ruling Labour Party, the golden visa is one of the few policies that escapes the opposition’s scrutiny and criticism. The government promotes investor residency abroad and publishes next to no data about the buyers.   To circumvent data gaps, we developed a range of creative approaches. We tested statements made by local activists by hiring a statistician to compute the statistical significance of the golden visa’s impact. To see whether golden visa buyers compete with local residents in an overheated rental market, we compared golden visa property investment thresholds with official housing data. Since most buyers are Chinese nationals, we used census data to prove that after buying the visa they do not reside in Malta and don’t even use the electronic residence system for the census. For the first time, data quantitatively proves the floating anecdotal observation that investors buy the Maltese golden visa to use it in other EU common travel area countries.","The methodology encompasses analysis of a dataset provided by an anonymous source, publicly available information, FOIs, statistical data and expert insights. We compared the distribution of nationalities in the dataset analysed with  official information published via golden visa intermediaries to make a case that the dataset is representative. We encircled the missing data points by using census and Housing Authority data and thus, for the first time, prove that (1) golden visa buyers do not appear to be using their visa in Malta, (2) obliged to keep a property in Malta, golden visa buyers compete with local residents in an overheated housing market, which place a strain on locals. For our social media communication, we commissioned creative data visualisation (see project link 2)","One of the lessons is that sometimes data is hiding in plain sight, but it needs to be used creatively to encircle the missing information. In this case, when we subtract the number of Chinese golden visa buyers from the total number of Chinese nationals who participated in the census (compulsory in Malta), we get a negative value.  Another lesson is to ask for help when needed, especially with the quantitative research aspect. In this case, we were lucky to have funding to commission regression analysis and creative dataviz, but there are numerous academics interested in joint research, with advanced technical tools that can be used to prove pertinent points with data.  Most importantly, we think that keeping the story local and focusing on local impact helps the audience relate to a topic that may feel so far away from their daily life as residence by investment is.",English,https://www.daphne.foundation/documents/reports/malta-golden-visas-who-benefits.pdf,https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=991634283010567&id=100064920120262&_rdr,,,"Daiva Repečkaitė and Matthew Caruana Galizia, with contributions from: Michaela Pia Camilleri and Corinne Vella, and photography by Joanna Demarco","Daiva is an investigative journalist focusing on politics and the environment.

Ukraine,Nikcenter,Small,,,Billions from Ukraine: how officials moved assets abroad after the start of the great war.,2024-12-23,"Investigation, Database, Open data, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Corruption, Money-laundering, Economy","D3.js, Json, Python","Nikcenter’s team used its own custom-built software to investigate where and how much money officials, law enforcement officers, and MPs have withdrawn from Ukraine since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion. The journalists analyzed three million declarations and identified 1,500 declarations with foreign accounts that were opened or replenished during the war. Ukrainian officials and politicians are holding at least 7 billion hryvnias abroad, mostly in banks in Austria, Poland, and Switzerland. Additionally, more than four thousand declarations of public officials were analyzed, 812 of which revealed foreign property worth over two billion hryvnias acquired since 2022.","The “Billions from Ukraine” data project was featured in the article “Foreign aid freeze decimates investigative news outlets internationally” by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The project was highlighted as an example of the vital work undertaken by investigative journalists in Ukraine, who cover socially critical issues, including exposing corruption schemes. Their work is under threat due to the termination of U.S. foreign aid funding. The “Billions from Ukraine” data project was also named one of the top five most compelling investigations of December 2024. It was disseminated by local and national media outlets in Ukraine, garnering hundreds of thousands of views and sparking active discussions on social media. Later, President Zelenskyy imposed sanctions on several influential Ukrainian businessmen mentioned in the study for moving their assets abroad. The revelation that politicians, who wield influence over the country’s political life, and officials, who have increased their wealth during the war, have moved their assets abroad is a matter of significant public interest. This raises critical questions: Do these politicians see their futures tied to Ukraine? Can they genuinely act in the best interests of their constituents and the country from which they have moved their families and wealth?","Due to the full-scale invasion, Ukrainian authorities suspended public access to officials’ declarations in the early days of the war for security reasons. It took more than a year and a half, along with significant pressure from civil society, to reinstate the mandatory declaration of assets and income and restore public access to these records. As a result, there was considerable public interest in analyzing not only newly acquired wealth but also assets that were moved out of Ukraine during its most challenging period. To identify new accounts held by MPs, officials, and law enforcement officers, journalists conducted an automated comparison of declarations from 2022–2024 with those submitted before the full-scale invasion. The team focused only on foreign bank accounts where savings exceeded 25,000 units of the relevant currency. The analysis also included only the real estate listed in officials’ declarations. However, most declarants concealed the value of their acquired foreign real estate, while some failed to disclose it entirely. Consequently, the actual amount of money moved out of the country—including illegally—is likely much higher.","In Ukraine, the register of officials’ declarations was closed for two years during the war. After its reopening, Nikcenter journalists utilized Python to download all the declarations from the registry—totaling more than 8 million records—and created their own database on their server using Docker and MongoDB. This database is fully indexed and supports complex queries, unlike the official registry, which is limited to searching only a few fields. The journalists analyzed the declarations using the Pandas library in Python and visualized the data with D3.js and Mapbox. AI technologies were also employed in the development of these applications.","The data project includes the names of declarants, their positions and workplaces, the names of banks, and the amount of assets in hryvnia equivalent. This information enables investigative journalists to track money withdrawn and property purchased, aiding in their investigations of individuals—including verifying the legality of their wealth accumulation while holding public office. The data can also be used to further explore the issue of money laundering from Ukraine, a problem that significantly impacts the country’s economy and overall development. Additionally, we have developed a Telegram bot that allows other Ukrainian journalists to access data through complex queries related to declarations, streamlining the process of gathering critical information for their investigations.",Ukrainian,https://nikcenter.org/milyardy-z-ukrayiny-za-kordon/,,,,"Oleg Oganov, Olesia Boreiko, Oksana Orsach, Oleksandr Sidieliev.","Oleg Oganov - investigative journalist, founder of the Nikcenter investigative journalism center.

Pakistan,The News,Small,,,The Rising Tide of Gender-Based Violence,2024-04-28,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","”The Rising Tide of Gender-Based Violence” is an investigative report that exposes the harrowing case of Maria’s murder in Pakistan and highlights the persistent issue of honour killings and gender-based violence (GBV). Using verified police reports, expert legal opinions, and statistical data, the story connects Maria’s tragedy to a broader pattern of violence against women in Pakistan. By incorporating official crime statistics, DNA analysis procedures, and expert commentary, the report underscores systemic failures in law enforcement and judicial proceedings. The project aims to raise awareness, drive policy discourse, and emphasize the urgent need for stronger legal protections for women.","This investigation sparked critical discussions about gender-based violence in Pakistan. Following its publication in The News on Sunday, the report was widely shared on social media, generating public outrage and calls for justice. Activists and legal experts cited the case in advocacy campaigns, emphasizing the need for legal reforms and stricter enforcement of existing GBV laws. The report also influenced mainstream media coverage, leading to further scrutiny of the case and increased pressure on law enforcement. As a result, local authorities in Toba Tek Singh intensified their investigation, ensuring that all suspects were brought to justice. Moreover, discussions on platforms like radio and television programs referenced the story to highlight systemic failures in addressing honor crimes. By documenting past cases and presenting verified statistics on honour killings, the report reinforced the scale of the issue, compelling policymakers and civil society organizations to take stronger stances. Importantly, it amplified the voices of human rights activists who continue to push for gender-sensitive legal reforms. This project stands as a testament to the power of investigative journalism in bringing attention to marginalized voices and pressing social justice issues.","Investigating gender-based violence in Pakistan comes with significant challenges, including political interference, limited access to data, and threats to press freedom. Many cases of honour killings and domestic violence are covered up by families or dismissed by local authorities due to deep-rooted patriarchal norms. Moreover, law enforcement often lacks gender-sensitive training, leading to botched investigations and poor conviction rates. Legal threats are another major concern. Journalists reporting on GBV risk defamation lawsuits, intimidation, and, in extreme cases, violence. The Pakistani legal system, while having laws against honour killings, is often manipulated by perpetrators who exploit loopholes such as forgiveness clauses under Islamic law. Access to official crime statistics is also difficult. While some reports are available through police and government sources, data inconsistencies and bureaucratic hurdles often obstruct transparency. The investigative process required cross-referencing multiple sources, including court records, police reports, forensic analysis, and expert opinions. Despite these constraints, the project successfully highlighted systemic failures, using evidence-based reporting to challenge institutional silence. It demonstrated how investigative journalism can bridge the gap between policy and enforcement, ensuring that issues like honor killings receive sustained public and media attention.","The investigative process for this project involved a combination of field reporting, forensic analysis, data journalism, and digital verification techniques. •Data Journalism: Official crime statistics on honour killings from Punjab Police and the National Police Bureau were analyzed to establish broader trends in gender-based violence across Pakistan. •Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT): Social media monitoring tools were used to track public discourse on Maria’s case, while forensic video analysis confirmed the authenticity of the viral murder footage. •Legal and Policy Research: Pakistan’s Penal Code, DNA Act 2017, and forensic examination procedures were examined to assess legal loopholes and institutional failures. •Interviews and Expert Analysis: Law enforcement officials, forensic experts, human rights activists, and legal professionals provided critical insights into the investigation process and systemic barriers to justice. By combining traditional investigative techniques with digital tools, this project not only reported on a single case but also contextualized it within the broader epidemic of gender violence in Pakistan.","This project offers several key takeaways for journalists covering gender-based violence and human rights issues. •Data-Driven Storytelling: Incorporating crime statistics and forensic details strengthened the credibility of the report. Journalists should leverage official records, police reports, and expert analysis to provide a well-rounded narrative. •Ethical Reporting on GBV: Sensitive storytelling is crucial when covering cases of violence. Respecting victims’ dignity, verifying facts, and avoiding sensationalism are essential to responsible journalism. •Navigating Legal Hurdles: Understanding national laws, such as the Pakistan Penal Code and DNA Act, helped in assessing whether justice was being served. Journalists should familiarize themselves with relevant legal frameworks to hold authorities accountable. •Leveraging Technology for Investigation: Using OSINT techniques, digital verification tools, and forensic video analysis can help journalists corroborate evidence in sensitive cases. •Building Pressure for Change: A well-researched investigative report can mobilize public opinion and push policymakers to act. Journalists should collaborate with human rights organizations, legal experts, and activists to amplify their findings.

The story documents the ongoing struggle of survivors as they attempt to rebuild their homes and reclaim a sense of belonging. Based on firsthand accounts, legal documents, and official records obtained under the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act 2013, the report highlights the failures of governance, the lack of accountability, and the social and economic impact of the attacks. This project provides a detailed, data-driven account of a marginalized community’s plight in the face of systemic injustice.","The report had a significant impact by shedding light on the unfulfilled promises of justice and rehabilitation for the Christian community in Jaranwala. It exposed the discrepancies in official narratives regarding compensation and legal action, prompting renewed discussions in media and human rights circles. The report was widely shared among journalists, activists, and advocacy groups, leading to increased pressure on authorities to address the concerns of the survivors. Amnesty International referenced key findings from the investigation in their public statement criticizing the Pakistani government’s failure to provide justice and security to religious minorities. Additionally, local NGOs working for minority rights used the findings to demand transparency in compensation distribution and legal proceedings. The report also provided a platform for affected individuals to voice their struggles, breaking the silence that had settled over the tragedy. It drew attention to the inefficacy of Pakistan’s judicial system in prosecuting mob violence, raising broader concerns about religious intolerance. The coverage further sparked interest from international organizations, leading to collaborative efforts for documentation and advocacy. By bringing the survivors’ voices to the forefront, this report contributed to the ongoing fight for justice and minority rights in Pakistan.","This investigative report was produced under challenging circumstances. The political landscape in Pakistan remains volatile, with religiously motivated violence often met with impunity. Blasphemy accusations, which triggered the Jaranwala riots, are weaponized against minorities, making it difficult for journalists to report on such issues without facing threats. Access to data was another significant hurdle. Despite filing a request under the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act 2013, the district administration refused to provide crucial details regarding compensation and rehabilitation efforts. An appeal to the Punjab Information Commission was dismissed without explanation, reflecting institutional opacity. Despite these challenges, I managed to obtain police records and legal documents through alternative means, ensuring factual accuracy in the report. Resource constraints were also a major factor. Independent journalists in Pakistan often lack financial backing for in-depth investigations. I relied on self-funding and personal networks to conduct field reporting, interview survivors, and cross-verify claims. The political and social risks associated with covering religious violence were immense, as local extremist groups had already influenced legal proceedings and public narratives. This report was a result of persistent effort, uncovering truths that official sources sought to obscure.","For this investigation, I employed a combination of data journalism, field reporting, and digital tools to verify and present information effectively. •Data Collection & Verification: I filed a Right to Information (RTI) request to obtain official records regarding arrests, legal proceedings, and compensation. While the district administration refused to provide the data, I accessed police records through secondary sources. •Interviews & Field Reporting: I conducted in-depth interviews with survivors, activists, and local leaders, ensuring diverse perspectives. Direct visits to affected neighborhoods and churches allowed me to document firsthand accounts. •Geospatial Analysis: I used file photos to compare pre- and post-riot damage in Jaranwala, highlighting the scale of destruction. •Digital Archiving & Fact-Checking: Open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques were used to cross-verify statements from government officials, including reviewing social media posts and press releases from political figures. •Multimedia Storytelling: I incorporated visual elements like images and maps to strengthen the narrative. •Secure Communication: Given the sensitive nature of the topic, I used encrypted communication channels (Signal, ProtonMail) to ensure the safety of sources and whistleblowers. These tools and methodologies allowed me to produce an evidence-based, impactful report that challenged official narratives and brought survivors’ stories to the forefront.","This project offers valuable lessons for journalists covering human rights abuses, religious violence, and governance failures. 1.Persistence in Data Retrieval: Bureaucratic resistance to transparency is a common obstacle. Journalists must explore multiple avenues to access official records, including leveraging RTI laws, alternative sources, and digital forensics. 2.Field Reporting & Survivor-Centered Storytelling: Conducting on-ground interviews and visiting affected sites is crucial. Relying solely on official statements often results in an incomplete picture. Direct engagement with survivors provides authenticity and emotional depth to the narrative. 3.Safety Measures & Digital Security: Reporting on sensitive issues requires strategic planning. Using encrypted communication tools and avoiding digital footprints that could expose sources is essential for safety. 4.Multimedia Integration: Data visualization, satellite imagery, and archival comparisons can enhance the credibility of an investigation. Combining textual reporting with visual evidence makes a stronger impact. 5.Advocacy & Collaboration: Investigative journalism is most effective when findings are amplified through networks of human rights organizations and advocacy groups. Engaging with them can lead to policy changes and increased pressure on authorities. By employing these techniques, journalists can navigate hostile reporting environments and produce compelling, high-impact investigations that hold power to account.",English,https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/1220871-raw-wounds,,,,Naeem Ahmad,"Naeem Ahmed is an award-winning freelance journalist with over a decade of experience in print and digital media.

It provides firsthand accounts from victims’ families, labour activists, and officials, revealing systemic negligence, lack of oversight, and legal loopholes that enable unsafe working conditions. The report uncovers how factory owners bypass safety protocols, employ untrained workers, and delay emergency responses, leading to preventable fatalities. Using data from Rescue 1122, police, and labour organizations, the investigation sheds light on policy gaps and calls for stronger enforcement of safety regulations in Pakistan’s industrial sector.","The publication of ”Worker Safety Still Elusive” sparked discussions among labour rights groups, policymakers, and industrial stakeholders about the urgent need for enhanced worker protections. The report gained traction on social media, prompting local labour organizations to demand stricter inspections of industrial boilers and accountability for negligent employers. The Labour Department issued fresh directives to re-evaluate factory safety compliance, and legal proceedings against responsible factory owners were expedited following media pressure. The report also brought attention to the 2019 legislative amendment that restricted factory inspections, highlighting its role in diminishing workplace safety oversight. Advocacy groups leveraged this report to push for its reconsideration. Additionally, the victims’ families received increased support from labour unions and non-profits, ensuring they had access to compensation and legal representation. Beyond immediate responses, the report contributed to broader discussions on the ethical responsibilities of global brands that source textiles from Pakistan. International labour rights organizations referenced the findings to call for better compliance with workplace safety standards in supplier factories. By exposing industry-wide negligence, the report laid the groundwork for sustained reforms in industrial safety regulations and reinforced the importance of investigative journalism in safeguarding workers’ rights.","Investigating worker safety in Pakistan’s textile industry presents numerous challenges, particularly due to the influence of industrial lobbies and the political connections of factory owners. Many textile mill owners hold significant economic and political power, making it difficult to obtain firsthand testimonies from affected workers and their families, who fear retaliation. Journalists covering labour rights often face legal threats, pressure from authorities, and restricted access to factory premises. Additionally, a 2019 amendment in labour laws restricted factory inspections, reducing transparency and making it harder to obtain official safety violation records. Access to data was another major hurdle—while Rescue 1122 provided statistics on industrial accidents, there is no centralized government database documenting workplace fatalities and injuries. Information had to be pieced together from police reports, labor activists, and firsthand accounts. Resource constraints also played a role. Unlike larger media organizations, independent journalists in Pakistan lack financial support for in-depth investigative projects. Despite these limitations, the investigation was conducted through extensive field reporting, interviews with affected families, cross-referencing legal documents, and verifying claims with multiple sources. The report highlights the resilience required to pursue investigative journalism in a challenging environment, where systemic failures often go unchallenged.","This investigative report utilized a combination of traditional journalism techniques and digital tools to gather, verify, and present information. 1.Field Reporting & Interviews oConducted on-the-ground reporting in Faisalabad’s industrial zones. oInterviewed victims’ families, labor rights activists, factory workers, and government officials. 2.Data Collection & Verification oObtained and analyzed accident reports from Rescue 1122, police records, and labour department archives. oCross-referenced official statements with eyewitness accounts to identify inconsistencies. 3.Legal & Policy Research oExamined Pakistan’s labour laws, including the 2019 amendment restricting factory inspections. oReviewed court filings and FIRs against factory owners to assess legal accountability. 4.Digital Tools & Visualization oUsed Google Sheets for structuring accident data and identifying patterns. oFact-checked official claims against independent reports using OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) methods. 5.Social Media Monitoring oTracked discussions on worker safety in Pakistan’s textile industry using Twitter trends and labor rights forums. oIdentified advocacy campaigns that referenced the report, amplifying its impact. By combining investigative journalism with data analysis and digital tools, the project successfully exposed critical lapses in worker safety and legal enforcement.","This project offers key takeaways for journalists covering labor rights and industrial safety: 1.Persistence in Overcoming Barriers oIndustrial lobbies often attempt to suppress investigative work. Journalists must build trust with workers and activists who can provide insider perspectives. 2.Triangulation of Sources oRelying solely on official statements can lead to an incomplete picture. Combining firsthand testimonies, government records, and independent research strengthens credibility. 3.Leveraging Data for Impact oEven in resource-limited environments, analyzing available data—such as Rescue 1122 reports—helps identify patterns that would otherwise remain unnoticed. 4.Using Legal Frameworks for Accountability oUnderstanding labor laws and regulatory loopholes allows journalists to highlight systemic failures and push for policy changes. 5.Digital Tools for Broader Reach oSocial media can amplify investigative work, making it harder for authorities to ignore critical issues. Tracking digital discourse also helps gauge public response and advocacy efforts. By applying these strategies, journalists can enhance their reporting on worker safety, ensuring that neglected stories receive the attention and reforms they deserve.",English,https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/1185369-worker-safety-still-elusive,,,,Naeem Ahmad,"Naeem Ahmed is an award-winning freelance journalist with over a decade of experience in print and digital media.

France,"ARTE, Youtube",Small,,,Baby gorillas for sale: investigation into international trafficking,2024-08-28,"Investigation, Explainer, Breaking news, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Video, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Corruption, Business, Crime, Economy","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap, Epios Osint industries Facial recognition like Pimeyes Image reverse tools like Google Lens, Yandex Scraping tools","On social media, we discovered videos of baby gorillas. They are for sale. Poached illegally, they have often been mistreated before reaching the hands of those who sell them. To kidnap a baby, poachers also have to kill adults, even though the species is highly protected and in danger of extinction. Every year, more than four hundred gorillas disappear from the forests of Central Africa. How is this poaching organised, and for whose benefit? This investigation reveals the inner workings of a trade that is both highly lucrative and devastating for the endangered species.","The gorilla is a fascinating animal, close to us, with which people identify. The fact that baby gorillas are for sale on the Internet, even though they are supposed to be extremely protected, came as a great shock.  The investigation has been seen by over 200,000 people on Arte and Youtube. Above all, it shocked many and was widely relayed by animal rights associations such as the Jane Goodall Institute, L214, the Gorilla association or the animal rights foundation. Researchers and primatologists such as Sabrina Krief or Shelly Masi, the leading gorilla specialist, relayed the investigation to their networks following the revelations.  Sanctuaries that take in apes after poaching have also shared the story, such as the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA), a non-profit association of 23 primate sanctuaries based in 13 African countries. We also know that police investigations are underway following our revelations.","Great apes in Africa face the severe threats of habitat destruction and poaching for bushmeat. Now, they’re also increasingly targeted to supply international demand for pets and zoo attractions. These animals are very popular on social networks. So far this problem has largely escaped the notice of most groups tasked with protecting Africa’s great apes: chimpanzees, bonobos, and two species of gorillas. All four species are endangered—most critically—and are protected by national and international laws. But few groups or governments track ape seizures, making it difficult to know how serious a threat poaching for the live animal trade poses.  In 2023, a report by the NGO Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime warned of this situation. This triggered our investigation. Most of the African apes go to China, Pakistan, Libya, or the Gulf States—especially the United Arab Emirates—where they become pets or, increasingly, attractions at private zoos. The number of zoos in China has doubled in the last decade. ”Without concerted global action, the problem will only worsen”, the autor’s report, Daniel Style, warns. “If the international community does not begin to take great ape trafficking seriously, it will continue to grow, threatening the very survival of our closest relatives”.","Animal traffickers make no secret of the fact and post ads on social networks, mainly Facebook and TikTok, to market their animals and find new customers around the world. It is thanks to this open-source research, by examining their profiles, their friends, their comments and their images, that we have been able to understand their place in the supply chain and how this trafficking works. We used reverse image search tools, facial recognition tools to find the traffickers and also scraping tools to identify the traffickers’ accomplices and customers, and to understand the links between them. In this milieu, the line between trafficker and swindler is often very porous. To check that those who present themselves as traffickers on the networks really are and are not scammers, for example, we had to resort to undercover work. We posed as a potential buyer of gorillas to several traffickers. The OSINT Industries and EPIEOS e-mail and telephone search platforms also enabled us to verify a certain amount of information about the traffickers.","My investigation was broadcast as part of the digital investigation magazine “Sources” in which we use open open source information as a new territory for investigation. In our videos, we explain to the viewers our research process. By being transparent about our methodology, we want to show how OSINV techniques can help fight against disinformation and question official versions.

Japan,Nikkei Inc.,Big,,,Tokyo runway collision: How JAL airplaner crashes into Coast Guard plane,2024-01-09,"Investigation, Breaking news, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Business",3D modeling,"On January 2, 2024, a Japan Airlines (JAL) plane collided with a Japan Coast Guard plane at Haneda Airport and burst into flames. Less than a week later, NIKKEI analyzed how the crash happened and why it was unavoidable.  Using video from X, communication records, and 3D models, we verified fragmentary information. The nighttime accident and restricted runway access made the investigation challenging. By leveraging 3D models and public data, we reconstructed the scene. Our approach was based on Open-Source Intelligence techniques.","Nikkei published the Japanese version of the article one week after the accident, followed by the English version. The article received about 500,000 views and widespread acclaim for its meticulous reporting, innovative visualizations, and swift production. Readers praised it as “exceptional investigative journalism,” highlighting its precise second-by-second verification and seamless integration of data and design.  By the end of 2024, nearly a year after the crash, the Japan Transportation Safety Board released its findings, which closely matched Nikkei’s report from just one week of investigation. A former Japan Airlines pilot also commended the accuracy and impact of the work.  The Global Investigative Journalism Network cited the article among the Top 10 data journalism projects of 2024. Slow News, a Japanese investigative outlet, featured it in a special report. Its editor praised the use of scroll-telling and announced on X that he would introduce the article in a university class.","The accident occurred after sunset, in darkness, with information in disarray. Official statements from the government and police were fragmented. Amid this uncertainty, our investigative team used advanced digital technology to reconstruct the scene. Despite the restricted access to the airport runway, we digitally simulated how the Japan Airlines and Japan Coast Guard aircraft collided.  By integrating 3D models, photos, videos, and audio data, we conducted a comprehensive spatial analysis, revealing critical details of the accident.  The article was published just one week after the crash—when public interest was at its peak. A year later, the official government report confirmed nearly the same findings as our investigation.","The 3D video production was achieved using tools such as Blender, Google Earth Studio, and Adobe After Effects. The scrollytelling was implemented with React. Using Figma, we collaborated with reporters and editors to finalize the structure, then proceeded with designing while coding.  During the investigation, designers created 3D models and conducted collision simulations. To reproduce the collision, a 3D model tailored to the dimensions of the aircraft involved in the accident was created, and repeated simulations were conducted in a digital space using Blender. To verify whether the series of experiments was appropriate from a professional perspective, we consulted Associate Professor Hidehiro Hata of Kumamoto University, an expert in explosion and impact mechanisms. Audio data was also obtained, and interviews with aviation experts were conducted. The trajectory of the JAL aircraft was based on data from ”Flightradar 24,” a website that tracks aircraft worldwide. The circumstances of the accident were analyzed using images and videos posted on social media, live camera footage, and aerial photographs taken the following day.","By harnessing the power of digital technology, we have demonstrated how the possibilities of visual journalism can be expanded.   The plane collision accident at the world’s largest airport occurred on a dark runway, and the live airport cameras alone were unable to provide clear insights into what had happened. Moreover, the police and government were unable to immediately release detailed information. In response, our investigative team took a novel approach: we created 3D models of both the aircraft and the airport, using them to digitally reconstruct the scene of the accident. By combining this digital reconstruction with social media videos captured by passengers, we were able to present a more accurate depiction of the events.   This approach highlights the potential of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and digital technologies, proving that thorough investigations can be conducted even in challenging or otherwise inaccessible locations.","English, Japanese",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/haneda-runway-collision/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/haneda-runway-collision/,,,"Hirofumi Yamamoto, Gaku Ito, Hiroshi Kunou, Masaharu Tateno, Kazuhiro Kida, Hiroki Sakuragi, Shota Fujii, Kento Awashima, Yuichiro Kanematsu, Kimihiko Yamamoto, Akira Hayakawa, Toru Yamada, Shohei Yasuda, Ryohei Senzaki and Masayuki Shimizu","Making news clearer and deeper—  We are a team of specialists in ”visualization,” aiming to assist readers’ understanding and judgment through content that utilizes visual expressions and digital technologies.

Los Bukele se convirtieron en terratenientes y adquirieron 361 hectáreas de tierra que antes no poseían al cierre del primer mandato, el legítimo, de Nayib Bukele. La Corte Suprema de Justicia, cooptada por Bukele, ha mantenido bajo reserva las declaraciones patrimoniales. Desde 2019, su círculo íntimo multiplicó 12.2 veces la extensión de sus propiedades. La investigación también reveló conflictos de intereses en un contexto donde el gobierno de Bukele aprobó 18 reformas legales que benefician sus inversiones.","Las investigaciones revelaron por primera vez cómo Nayib Bukele y sus familiares se han aprovechado de su posición de poder para adquirir cientos de hectáreas de terrenos y usar leyes diseñadas por su Gobierno para beneficiarse. Estas revelaciones dominaron la conversación digital. Fueron citadas durante protestas contra el Gobierno, por políticos, académicos, líderes sociales y comerciantes del centro afectados por los desalojos forzosos.  Las investigaciones fueron retomadas por más de un centenar de medios internacionales. Y el sitio web de la Redacción Regional recibió ataques cibernéticos de fuerza bruta para intentar vulnerar su plataforma. Los diputados oficialistas amagaron con aprobar una ley que pretendía limitar el acceso público al Registro de la Propiedad, una herramienta fundamental en la realización de estos trabajos. Sin embargo, al momento de la votación en el congreso, decidieron no incluir esa limitación. Ninguna de las entidades contraloras del país han abierto una investigación para aclarar de dónde vinieron los fondos con los que la familia Bukele adquirió 361 hectáreas. El periodista que realizó la investigación fue atacado por Bukele, sus hermanos y miles de usuarios en redes sociales por revelar la acumulación de propiedades de la familia presidencial.","Diversos indicadores internacionles que miden entre otras cosas la libertad de expresión, han demostrado que en El Salvador ese es uno de los derechos fundamentales más deteriorados. Todos los periodistas independientes somos estigmatizados por la administración de Nayib Bukele, lo que dificulta nuestra labor. Y desde 2021, el propio Bukele tiene el poder todas las instituciones públicas, lo cual nos expone a la criminalización de nuestro trabajo.   Semanas posteriores a la publicación, el presidente Bukele, sus hermanos, funcionarios oficialistas, medios de propaganda oficial y cuentas afines al oficialismo atacaron a este periodista y a los medios que publicaron la historia. Desde el 18 de septiembre de 2024, fecha en que se solicitaron los descargos a la familia presidencial, el sitio web de la Redacción Regional, que lideró esta alianza, recibió ataques cibernéticos de fuerza bruta para intentar vulnerar su plataforma.   Un mes después de la publicación de la segunda parte de la investigación, los diputados oficialistas amagaron con aprobar una ley que pretendía limitar el acceso público al registro de propiedad, una herramienta fundamental en la realización de esta investigación. Sin embargo, al momento de la votación en el Congreso, decidieron no incluir esa limitación.","Revisamos 64 escrituras de propiedad, 10 escrituras de hipotecas y 40 perfiles de sociedades de la familia presidencial registrados hasta marzo de 2024.  Analizamos cientos de folios oficiales del Centro Nacional de Registros y del Registro de la Propiedad, Raíz e Hipoteca para construir una base de datos que nos permitiera identificar qué empresas tuvieron las mayores fluctuaciones y cruzarlas con las que adquirieron más propiedades.  Navegamos en cientos de archivos del registro nacional de la raíz e hipotecas y cientos de archivos de sociedades en el registro mercantil. Recabada la información, se elaboró tres bases de datos para cotejar los años de las compras, los montos, las descripciones de las propiedades y las direcciones catastrales de los inmuebles. En paralelo, se creó otra base de datos en la que se revisó la evolución de los activos de 40 cantidades de sociedades vinculadas a la familia Bukele.   Luego de tabular la información, se  conversó con una decena de fuentes para confirmar la valía de la información, para determinar el rol que los hermanos de Nayib Bukele juegan en el Gobierno y la ubicación geográfica de las propiedades a través de imágenes satelitales.","En El Salvador Nayib Bukele ha logrado consumar su proyecto personalista e inauguró una dictadura en la que gobierna junto con sus hermanos, logrando que la independencia de poderes y los pesos y contraspesos dejen de funcionar. Han logrado que toda la información oficiosa y las solicitudes de información pública sean bloqueada. Aún así hay maneras de investigar el aumento patrimonial de los funcionarios.   El éxito en lecturas y difusión de estas investigaciones fue una lección de cómo procesar escrituras de bienes y raíces, perfiles financieros de empresas, leyes y bases de datos para que las audiencias entiendan y dimensionen la importancia de conocer cómo los gobernantes se aprovechan de sus cargos para beneficiarse. Además de contarlo con una narrativa que recuerda la historia de oligárquica que dominó con políticas muy similares a las actuales.   Fue indispensable hacer uso de herramientas satelitales que permitan identificar la ubicación precisa de las propiedades.  La construcción de bases de datos fue crucial para cruzar diferentes datos que ayudaron a concluir que no se trataba de compras de propiedades ordinarias, sino que era un mecanismo a través del cual el clan Bukele está amasando riquezas y beneficiándose de las políticas que ellos mismos confeccionan.",Español,https://redaccionregional.com/transparencia/bukele-cia-la-nueva-familia-terrateniente-de-el-salvador/,https://redaccionregional.com/transparencia/hermanos-de-bukele-compraron-edificio-por-1-3-millones-en-el-centro-historico-tras-una-ley-que-otorga-exenciones-fiscales/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRnf6dC3OGU&t=2s,https://x.com/RRPresenta/status/1844150425865400475/photo/1,"Jaime Quintanilla, Daniel Valencia, José Luis Pardo, César Cortez, Carlos Sánchez","La Redacción Regional (RR) es un equipo periodístico que apuesta por investigaciones en profundidad para ofrecer una cobertura permanente de las violencias, desigualdades, corrupción y violación a los derechos humanos en Mesoamérica."
Netherlands,"Lighthouse Reports, Svenska Dagbladet",Big,,,"In Sweden, a secretive algorithm flags the innocent as welfare cheats",2024-11-27,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration","AI/Machine learning, Microsoft Excel, Python","Sweden is hailed as a model welfare state and one of Europe’s most transparent countries. Yet the country’s welfare agency secretly deploys opaque algorithms that make life-changing decisions about millions of people. Over the course of three years, Lighthouse Reports and Svenska Dagbladet sent dozens of freedom-of-information requests to get under the hood of the system — and were stonewalled at every turn. We managed to obtain a unique, confidential dataset containing thousands of algorithmic predictions. We tested it against six statistical tests and found that the algorithm discriminates against innocent women, migrants, low-income earners and people without a university education.","The same day we published our story, a leading member of the Green party called the Swedish social security agency to parliament over our reporting. Amnesty International and its Swedish chapter called for the agency to halt its use of discriminatory profiling.   The reporting jumpstarted lively debates on Swedish radio and television, as well as in the op-ed sections of multiple newspapers. This extended to social media, too.   It was also noticed by the Swedish journalism community. The investigation and methodology was covered in both the Swedish journalism union magazine, as well as Sweden’s premier professional magazine for investigative journalism.","Sweden tops transparency rankings and has the world’s oldest freedom-of-information law. Yet during our investigation into Sweden’s social security agency, Försäkringskassan, we  met a starkly different reality.   Obtaining the dataset underlying our reporting required persistence. We sent dozens of requests, all rejected. The agency refused even basic details, arguing that disclosure would enable welfare fraud. It became clear they were not acting in good faith. In one exchange, an official accidentally cc’d a reporter, remarking, “we must hope that we are done with him.” We even conducted an experiment where we requested information available in a document the agency had itself published online—the response? Confidential.  Sweden’s political climate is intensely polarized, and this extends to discussions on the welfare state. We co-published with Svenska Dagbladet, which has an editorial that describes itself as ”unound moderate/conservative”. After our initial story, the opinion section at the paper published an editorial titled ”Random selection is a lousy way to catch cheaters” that defended the agency’s use of the AI system due to alleged widescale welfare fraud. Follow-up investigations by us showed the algorithm was not only discriminatory but inefficient, another exposed the agency’s deeply flawed welfare fraud estimates that justified the algorithm’s use.","Our investigation made widescale use of freedom-of-information requests. We sent dozens of freedom-of-information requests, including requests for emails, database manuals and obscure logs. This led us to a unique, confidential dataset containing thousands of algorithmic predictions, which the agency refused to disclose.   However, through the other materials we had obtained, we realized it had been sent to a supervisory authority. Piecing together the structure of the dataset via internal emails, we managed to construct a freedom-of-information request that would allow the supervisory authority to disclose the data without running afoul of European privacy laws.   We also made widespread use of advanced algorithmic auditing to test for bias.   Academic debates around algorithmic bias are not straightforward. Since the publication of ProPublica’s Machine Bias investigation, academics have enumerated dozens of metrics for defining bias, some of which are incompatible with one another. The “correct” definition of bias is hotly contested.   To overcome this, we worked with a panel of academics to design six different statistical fairness definitions that we tested against our dataset. We found that women were disadvantaged according to all six definitions, while migrants, low-income earners and people without a university education were disadvantaged according to five definitions.","We ultimately obtained the dataset underlying our reporting from another supervisory agency. The algorithm — its code, its training data, its variables — remained a black box to us. Yet this relatively simple dataset — a spreadsheet containing flagged individuals, a few basic demographic traits, and whether a mistake was in their welfare application — nonetheless enabled us to test academic-standard discrimination tests. Other newsrooms can take away methods for meaningful algorithmic auditing using simple data, especially when faced with untransparent agencies.   Sweden has seen very little algorithmic accountability reporting. This meant that we had to introduce a new reporting genre and technical concepts that were new to a mainstream Swedish audience. In contrast to Lighthouse’s previous publications, we made an active decision to minimise the use of statistics and heavy visualization in favor of a more traditional, narrative approach to storytelling.   In practice, many newsrooms around the world do not have the resources to invest in heavy visualization and also face audiences that are not accustomed to reading about algorithmic audits. We found that strong narrative storytelling and lean use of heavy statistics can overcome these gaps.  We published an extensive methodology detailing our analysis and published the code and data on Github.","Swedish, English",https://drive.google.com/file/d/17TAglfAEmPAg2CQuOMDLGCy9RbYdmkfD/view?usp=sharing,https://www.lighthousereports.com/methodology/sweden-ai-methodology/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GL1Du22d_shJSFxm95taNLhR4R-_0Xh7/view?usp=sharing,https://github.com/Lighthouse-Reports/suspicion_machines_sweden,"Sascha Granberg, Gabriel Geiger, Anna Tiberg, Justin-Casimir Braun, Henrik Malmsten, Thomas Molén, Ahmed Abdigadir, Iben Ljungmark, Frederick Laurin, Eva Constantaras, Daniel Howden","Lighthouse Reports pioneers collaborative journalism and works with the world’s leading media to deliver deeply reported, public interest investigations.

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,,,Singapore’s divisive ethnicity-based housing policy,2024-12-19,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, Map","Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Scraping, Figma, Illustrator, Vue 3, Tailwind, Vanilla JS and CSS","For every public housing block in Singapore, up to 87% of houses are allocated to the Chinese community, and the rest to minority groups—a policy designed to prevent enclaves. As the government does not release granular data on this policy, it is near impossible to assess its effectiveness; those who try risk legal repercussions. Through web scraping and geocoding, we built a compelling picture of where and what quotas are hit, our investigation revealing the underlying systemic injustice faced by minority homeowners. 35 years on, is this policy still defensible?","In particular, the map visualisation—which shows that blocks with more minority homeowners tend to be in the city’s fringes—has been praised for clearly showing the inequities linked to the policy. We’ve received requests from academics for the map data to be used in their research. We hope the article can drive real changes to our public housing experience in the future.  Our story also helped to get the government to go on record about when quota limits were last updated. We used information that was reported in Parliament and other media outlets, and Singapore’s Ministry of National Development wrote to us to clarify in the story that they had not been updated since 2010. This was actually positive, since it allowed this information to enter into the public record as fact.   The story has been read widely and we received good feedback from the public, academics, policymakers, urban planners and property agents in Singapore. The longform story reached over 5,000 views (as of 24 Feb). The social media version, with 2,700 likes and 1,300 shares, generated more than half its reach outside of our followers. Many expressed appreciation for the sheer work put into gathering the data.","Race is a sensitive issue in Singapore and there are laws against threats to racial harmony. Our analysis of this policy could be deemed as threatening to racial harmony. The government has recently passed a new Maintenance of Racial Harmony Bill, which further tightens discourse on race-related issues.  The irony is that Singaporeans are so used to race-based policies that they become a given. Yet many also don’t fully understand how it works. And while there are anecdotes of minorities selling their houses for far less than Chinese sellers, the government avoids framing this as a systemic flaw.    The government has an open data portal (data.gov.sg), but potentially sensitive data is usually not released. For our story, we had to create a workaround using Python and web scraping to get the required data. However, this meant we were potentially making observations based on incomplete data.   Even with sound insights, the government could disagree, penalising us under Singapore’s ‘fake news’ law. They had issued a similar one as recently as Aug 2024. With this year being an election year, the government might also be more sensitive to policy critiques.","Melissa Zhu wrote a Python/Selenium script that downloaded a public housing dataset, with over 12,800 unique addresses, from Singapore’s open data portal. This returned every unique address with quotas in response to the sellers of each ethnic group (Chinese, Malay and Indians/Others) – before scraping the resulting paragraph, which described the race of buyers that the homeowner from a particular address and particular race could sell their flat to. Python was used to clean the output data.   Python was used for other analyses: deducing which blocks had hit what ethnic quotas by matching them to a predefined set of result statements, and checking for correlations between quotas hit and sale prices by matching the results with publicly available housing resale data.   The data collected was from June 2024, but also in February, March, and May to ensure that there was no significant difference in the trends observed. For transparency, readers could see the results.   The results were further geocoded using Google’s Geocoding API to build the interactive map. These data points were visualised using a custom designed map in Mapbox GL JS, with Mapbox Search Box API, allowing users to search the data via addresses.","Even with limited data, we could conduct a solid data investigation using well-established techniques. With a government website and some public data, we were able to form a more complete picture about the policy’s implications, which was the first step of our exploration.   We also showed how to cover a potentially sensitive issue. We did this by creating a visually consistent story emphasising comprehension and accessibility, allowing readers to discover their own insights. For example, they could fill up a virtual block to learn how a quota works. To help readers understand the presence of modern-day ethnic enclaves, we included options for toggling data layers on the main map, allowing them to explore the patterns themselves.  Because correlation is not causation, we were unable to make outright assertions; yet we were still able to ask questions and point to injustices borne by Singapore’s minorities. At the same, we included the government’s perspectives and solutions, showing that it isn’t a straightforward issue.  Lastly, the piece is an example of data activism – part of Kontinentalist’s larger vision of advocating for a more equitable world. Our analysis helped validate the lived experiences of minorities, and called for more open data and discussion.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/hdb-ethnic-integration-policy,,,,"Writing / Melissa Zhu and Nabilah Said Data collection and analysis / Melissa Zhu Research and data support / Loh Pei Ying Code / Siti Aishah Design and illustrations / Amanda Teo Editing / Gwyneth Cheng, Zafirah Zein","Melissa is an editor at the investigative journalism group Bellingcat.

Peru,OjoPúblico,Small,,,Proyecto Dipteryx,2024-06-09,"Database, Open data, Environment","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Microsoft Power BI","El proyecto Dipteryx trata sobre el desarrollo de un algoritmo que alerta sobre las banderas rojas en la cadena de suministro de la madera peruana. Como principal hallazgo se obtuvo que más de la mitad de la madera comercializada en Perú tiene alto riesgo de ser ilegal. A este análisis interdisciplinario, en el que se usaron más de 2 millones de datos de distintas autoridades forestales peruanas, también contó con un trabajo de campo donde se registró de forma fotográfica el proceso de transformación de la madera peruana que se suele exportar a países asiáticos y europeos.","Este proyecto evidenció, a partir de una metodología y modelamiento con científicos de datos, una realidad que suele recogerse de experiencias particulares: la madera que se extrae de la Amazonía peruana tiene un origen ilegal. Esto fue posible a partir del desarrollo del algoritmo y entrevistas con fuentes. Luego de la publicación generó que fuentes fiscales y policiales se interesen en los hallazgos y les sirve para perfilar sus casos en curso. También generó que la autoridad supervisora (Osinfor) publique su índice de ilegalidad para el comercio maderero que, según sus cálculos, era menor que el obtenido para el algoritmo Dioteryx. Asimismo, el proyecto ha sido expuesto a estudiantes y otros colegas de regiones andinas y amazónicas del Perú. Esto ha permitido que la metodología, con fuerte uso de pedidos de acceso a la información, sirve de motivación a otros proyectos periodísticos que tienen como base el uso de datos.","En primer lugar, poder señalar que el proyecto fue posible gracias a una beca del Pulitzer Center ya pude tener el tiempo y recursos para desarrollar el msimo. También me gustaría que sepan todo el proceso detrás de los datos, fue un trabajo de más de 10 meses donde se realizaron decenas de pedidos de información para reconstruir la cadena de suministros y alimentar al algoritmo. Esto, si bien tiene un proceso bastante técnico, es el corazón del proyecto porque los hallazgos se obtuvieron a partir del cruce de información y un trabajo en el que también participaron analistas así como científicos de datos junto a expertos forestales para valir los datos empleados en el desarrollo del algoritmo. Este punto puede ser visto de manera detallada en la siguiente infografía trabajada como parte del proyecto.

Luego se trabajó junto a científicos de datos y expertos forestales para validar el uso de los datos a los que se accedió. Se generó así un modelamiento y pruebas para determinar cuál era la mejor forma de desarrollar el algoritmo.  El algoritmo se basa en un modelo Random Forest Classifier y establece una predicción de riesgo de 0 a 1 —donde 0 representa la inexistencia de riesgo y 1 el máximo riesgo— para tres actores principales del comercio maderero: el titular (que administra la concesión), el comprador (que adquiere el producto y en su mayoría lo transforma) y el destinatario (casi siempre el empresario exportador o vendedor local).  Respecto al tipo de algoritmo —de técnica Machine Learning para un aprendizaje con datos y mejora con la experiencia—, la sugerencia inicial de los especialistas fue usar el denominado Random Forest Classifier (RFC) porque permite con variables que se responden con un ‘Sí’ o ‘No’. Y también porque el RFC es de regresión, usado para conectar características y una variable objetivo continua.","Considero que otros periodistas pueden aprender que en tiempos de inteligencia artificial el trabajo de investigación puede verse potenciado. Esto, a partir de la experiencia obtenida en el desarrollo del proyecto Dipteryx donde la tecnología puede ayudar a tener hallazgos más robustos sobre un tema específico. Además, creo que trabajar de manera metódica y con técnicas de reporteo tradicional así como del periodismo de datos generan que se puedan tener proyectos de este tipo. Estamos en una época donde los periodistas trabajan junto a otras especialidades para tener un sustento en su proceso de trabajo.

Brazil,Aos Fatos,Small,,,The Check-Up,2024-11-26,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Health","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Python","Check-Up is a pioneering 6-month investigation that exposed how health misinformation has infiltrated trusted news sources through native advertising. Using advanced scraping tools and AI analysis, our team examined 242,000 ads across nine major Brazilian news websites, uncovering an alarming reality—90% of health-related native ads contained false or misleading claims. Beyond identification, we documented five systematic deception strategies employed by advertisers and mapped how these ads exploit news credibility to bypass editorial scrutiny. Check-Up has helped shift the misinformation conversation in Brazil by revealing how respected news platforms unwittingly become vectors for dangerous health falsehoods.","Check-Up shed light on a previously overlooked issue in Brazil: the role of native advertising in spreading health misinformation on trusted news websites. The findings have sparked meaningful discussions within the media industry and resonated with the public.  **Media Industry Response:** * Folha de S.Paulo, Brazil’s largest newspaper, acknowledged the issue when its ombudsman cited our findings in a December 7, 2024 column urging the company to review its advertising policies. * O Joio e o Trigo, an independent Brazilian outlet, highlighted Check-Up findings in its December 13, 2024 newsletter, extending our reach to their audience of media professionals. * The report was presented to fact-checking organizations at the 2024 Latam Chequea conference in São Paulo, raising awareness among industry peers.  **Public Engagement:** * Our video summarizing the findings garnered over 100,000 views across Aos Fatos’ social media channels, demonstrating significant public interest in this previously unexamined issue.  **Research Foundation:** * Several research groups have informed Aos Fatos that they are using the Check-Up data for academic studies. * By publicly sharing our code on GitHub, complete with the dataset and methodology, we’ve created a foundation for similar investigations globally.","**Pervasive Nature of Native Ads:** Our investigation revealed how native ads strategically mimic editorial content, appearing seamlessly at the end of legitimate news articles with misleading health headlines. Unlike social media content that readers may approach skeptically, these ads exploit the credibility of their hosting platforms. This positioning makes them particularly dangerous for vulnerable audiences, as they blur the line between journalism and advertising in ways that typical readers struggle to distinguish.  **Technical Challenges:** The investigation required substantial investments in data scraping and analysis—resources not readily accessible to many independent journalism organizations. Since its foundation, Aos Fatos has been a tech-driven outlet, and this challenge was an opportunity to demonstrate how technology can enable complex investigative projects.  **Industry Dynamics:** We approached this project with nuance, recognizing that news outlets are not directly responsible for the content of these ads while still highlighting the ethical questions raised by hosting potentially harmful content. Our goal was to spark a conversation about balancing revenue generation with an unwavering commitment to reliable information. Despite these challenges, we maintained complete independence throughout the investigation, producing a rigorous analysis that addresses a significant gap in misinformation research while respecting the complex realities of modern digital journalism.","Our investigation employed a multi-phase technical approach to capture and analyze a massive dataset of native advertisements.  **Data Collection Pipeline:** * Used Similarweb to identify the top 100 Brazilian websites in the ”News and Media” category (January-March 2024). * Deployed a server that repeatedly accessed each domain, extracting homepage URLs over six weeks (June 17-July 30, 2024). * Implemented the Playwright automation library to download native ad texts and images from 15,164 unique URLs, yielding 242,812 individual advertisements.  **Classification System:** * Employed OpenAI’s GPT-4 model to classify each advertisement into one of 16 predefined topics, revealing Health and Beauty as the predominant category (37% or 90,934 ads). * Applied Aos Fatos’ fact-checking methodology to systematically evaluate health-related ads through a three-step process: 1. Selection of objectively verifiable claims 2. Research comparing claims against primary sources and expert knowledge 3. Evaluation with standardized labels: ”false,” ”misleading,” ”true,” or ”not fact-checkable”  **Analysis Framework:** * Performed qualitative analysis to identify recurring strategies, affected products, and potential impacts of the misinformation. * Traditional data analysis and data visualization tools were used to process and display the patterns discovered in the dataset.   This technical architecture transformed what would have been an impossible manual task into a systematic, data-driven investigation with actionable findings.","Check-Up demonstrates how investigative journalism can harness technology to uncover previously invisible problems at scale.  **Methodological Innovation:** * Our approach shows how combining automated data collection with human verification creates a powerful investigative framework that maintains journalistic rigor while analyzing vast content volumes. * The project establishes practical techniques for examining native advertising content that typically evades scrutiny due to its volume and ephemeral nature.  **Expanding the Misinformation Focus:** * Check-Up challenges the prevailing focus on social media platforms by documenting how traditional media can unwittingly amplify false information through their advertising systems. * The investigation provides concrete categories and examples of commercial health misinformation that can help journalists identify similar patterns in other markets.  **Transparency and Replicability:** * By open-sourcing our methodology and code, we’ve created accessible tools for newsrooms worldwide to conduct similar investigations in their local contexts. * Our approach can be adapted to investigate misinformation in sectors other than health, from political propaganda to financial scams.  Most importantly, Check-Up demonstrates how data-driven journalism can identify systemic problems rather than just individual instances of misinformation, creating accountability for the structures that enable false information to reach vulnerable audiences.","Portuguese, English",https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/how-clickbait-ads-weaponize-brazilian-news-websites-to-spread-health-misinformation,https://github.com/aosfatos/check-up,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRdQ-0K1LWSTcOG2UJur5GjVUq280wHSzsVjU_oglXkghN8pgCkI5UJ-PJ6E9y9TmJlByhWaS7gghwT/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgS_Qlg7jaA,"Alexandre Aragão, Bianca Bortolon, Bruno Fávero, Fernanda da Escóssia, Milena Mangabeira, Rhenan Bartels, Yvna Sousa","The Check-up project team is a multidisciplinary group of reporters, editors, and programmers.

Mexico,Climate Tracker Latinoamérica,Small,,,The carbon pirates in Mexico,2024-08-08,"Investigation, Long-form, Environment, Business","AI/Machine learning, Microsoft Excel, CSV","The investigation reviewed carbon projects from forests in Mexico, which has become a major sites for these type of initiatives. The outcomes were large costs for forest communities, insufficient information for consultation processes, illegal deals, governmental omissions, inflated carbon calculations, and confidential agreements which barrages against transparency and accountability. For the project, I reviewed the files, checked the local assemblies statements, the registering of the projects, the calculations of carbon metrics, and the databases of sellers, buyers and quantities.","The project fostered transparency and accountability in Mexico’s carbon credit market, revealed practices by private developers and their tactis; exposed the government’s inhability to intervene in its regulation, including a regulation initiative that left  communities and  private developers unhappy; and the liability of international standard makers, such as Climate Action Reserve (CAR). CAR reviewd its calculation methodology, with the effect of lower carbon metrics. The project led communities to be more conscious about their dealings with private developers and to ask for better contract conditions in the development of the forest projects. The developers association built a code of ethics to try to avoid bad practices. I presented the investigation results at a community meeting in Guadalajara last September.","Since there are no national neither international regulations, the carbon market depends on standards developed by private companies. And there is no official registry in Mexico. Therefore, there is dependence on the companies databases and international organizations that track forest projects and carbon credits. In addition, it’s viirtually impossible to review all the projects, since the files are huge, and it implies reading every entry in them. That difficults access to reliable data. In addition, project evaluations by private companies are expensive, which make it more difficult for freelancers. Thanks to the review of some projects, I was able to build my own database. One of the most challenging things was to get contracts between communities and developers, as there are NDAs in them. Finally, I could get a couple, which showed the asimmetries in the deals. Besides, it’s very difficult to assess carbon metrics, as it implies the use of satelite images, new techonologies and other resources of difficult access. And FOIA requests have only been useful to show the governmental void in the matter.","First, I learned about the projects in Mexico searching the databases and companies websites. Based on information from my sources, I checked their files to assess the projects, areas, carbon calculations, consultation processes, legal commitments, and so on. In parallel, I reviewed the carbon credits issues by the communities, intermediaries and buyers, based on Excel and CSV. I used AI to identify key words in the documents and to track carbon credits. I used satellite images, but it was difficult to check the state of the proposed areas, and they’re no good to monitor carbon in forests. I presented FOIA requests to show the government’s absence in the regulation of the market.","Colleagues can learn how to track carbon credit projects in databases, identify communites, private developers, intermediaries and buyers involved; know where to look for specific information of the projects; how to identify economic, legal abuses. It’s fundamental to cultivate sources that can give guidance about problematic projects and to deliver documents to help the tracking of the carbon credit projects.",Spanish,https://climatetrackerlatam.org/historias/bonos-de-carbono-siembran-abusos-en-mexico/,,,,Emilio Godoy,"Emilio Godoy has been a journalist since 1996.

You can read the article here : https://www.telerama.fr/plateformes/sur-arte-tv-sources-revele-comment-les-passeurs-de-migrants-font-affaire-sur-tiktok_cri-7032318.php  I was also invited by French radio station Sud Radio on the day of the release of her investigation : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odI0D81MvXI  I was also invited on Arte’s Twitch programme to answer questions from Internet users about her investigation, her investigative methods and the genesis of the subject. The programme was very popular on Twitch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqitRkDRSdg   My investigation was nominated as one of the finalists in the ‘Short’ category at the DIG Awards 2024 in Italy. https://dig-awards.org/eng/finalisti/film/tiktok-and-people-smugglers/","In 2024, the migratory phenomenon resumed its intensity in the Channel. More than 36,000 people, mainly Afghans, Iranians and Syrians, crossed the Channel, 25% more than in 2023.  And, as a result of increasingly small crowded boats, there have never been so many deaths : 75 exiles died in the Channel, according to the Préfecture Maritime in 2024.  Migrants are taking more risks to brave an ultra-secure border guarded by French and British police.  Following Brexit, the UK’s immigration policy has become considerably tougher. The British government has pledged to pay France €500 million over four years to secure the border. On the French side, the rise of the far right is also encouraging anti-migrant policies. Faced with this increased security, smugglers are adapting and hiding behind pseudonyms on social networks to recruit candidates to go in England. They always appear in the shadows when the fate of migrants is discussed. But who are the smugglers and how do they operate? We investigated on TikTok using digital investigation tools to reveal their identities and methods.","For this investigation, I worked with open sources, mainly on social networks, particularly TikTok, where smugglers publish numerous offers to cross the Channel from France to the UK. I identified dozens of accounts offering illegal crossings to England. All means of transport are offered: lorries, planes and, above all, rubber dinghies. To do this, all you have to do is type in a number of keywords like ”game” in kurdish, persian, arabic, pashto for example.   The smugglers advertise on TikTok but their identities are well hidden behind pseudonyms and idyllic London landscapes. In a report published in July 2023, Europol highlights the complexity of identifying 2.0 smugglers: ”the digital tools used to organise and conduct migrant smuggling activities add an extra layer of protection for the leaders of criminal networks, who reside both inside and outside the EU”. To find out who is behind these smuggler accounts, I used OSINV techniques like reverse image search tools, social networks and traditional investigative methods, including infiltration, in contacting NGOs and experts in the field to support my investigation.","My investigation was broadcast as part of the digital investigation magazine “Sources” in which we use open open source information as a new territory for investigation. In our videos, we explain to the viewers our research process. By being transparent about our methodology, we want to show how OSINV techniques can help fight against disinformation and question official versions. To accompany my investigation video, I  published my investigation methodology, in which I explain how I found and checked my information, the additional sources I used and the reports I relied on. https://www.arte.tv/fr/articles/tiktok-et-le-business-des-passeurs-de-migrants-la-methode  In this methodology I also explain how and why I used certain digital tools. The aim is both to restore public confidence in the veracity of information and to enable young journalists to appropriate these OSINV techniques and use them in their investigations. I am regularly invited by journalism schools to explain this new way of doing online journalism using OSINV tools, in a more transparent and technological way.","French, German, English, Italian, Spanish, Polish",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HB63b3jq-Ek&t=2s,https://www.telerama.fr/plateformes/sur-arte-tv-sources-revele-comment-les-passeurs-de-migrants-font-affaire-sur-tiktok_cri-7032318.php,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqitRkDRSdg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odI0D81MvXI,Director : Manon Bachelot Editor : Sylvain Pak Producer : Alexandra Jousset,"Manon Bachelot is a French investigative reporter and documentary filmmaker.

In our immersive story, readers travel along Switzerland’s longest river, the Aare, and explore a future environment altered by global warming. Using photorealistic renderings, maps, and data visualizations, we show a world in which glaciers have melted, droughts fuel forest fires, and crops adapted to warmer temperatures grow in the fields.   The story illustrates the consequences of climate change at a local level. Going beyond simply highlighting potential threats, it offers insights into how early adaptation and decisive action today could still create a livable future.","Stories about climate change often struggle to capture our readers’ attention. But this story attracted two-and-a-half times more readers than our average climate-related article. More than half of them read the article to the end, an indicator that it engaged them.  The story’s Instagram and Tik Tok reels were among the most viewed reels on our account last year. On these platforms, the story attracted a younger, predominantly female audience to our outlet’s content.    In addition, the article was widely shared in the scientific community in Switzerland and praised for its innovative approach to making climate change data tangible and experiential.","In this article, we wanted to show our readers a realistic, local future scenario grounded in scientific facts. Therefore, all visual elements – from classic data visualizations to 3D renderings – are based on climate models. This approach required us to develop several novel storytelling, presentation, and research techniques. In particular, we developed methods for using satellite imagery to model a future landscape based on climate projections and created data-based 3D landscapes in the Unreal gaming engine (see the Tools and Techniques section for more details).   We also worked closely with a team of eleven scientific advisors from universities and institutions across Switzerland. They provided us with climate data on a wide range of topics such as models for future glacier loss and new lakes, changes in forests, adaption of agricultural crops and water levels and water temperatures. We also frequently asked them for feedback and additional research to refine the visualizations.","The climate data was translated into a visualization of a future landscape in two components:  The first is a 3D map with a satellite image layer that we modified to represent the year 2075. Climate models and satellite imagery from other regions that are already significantly warmer underlie the modifications. To create the custom satellite image we processed current imagery from Maptiler in QGIS, used Photoshop to ”paint” the data onto the image, and then produced map tiles from it with Maptiler Engine. The altered image forms the backbone of the article, as the reader progresses through the story by flying over the map.   The second component is two close-up scenes in which the reader walks through the landscape instead of flying over it. For these, we recreated two specific locations – one in the Swiss Alps, one in a forest – in Unreal Engine. This visualization uses topographic and climatic data to simulate a future landscape. Once the scenery was built, we used Unreal’s animation capabilities to create a camera path that leads the reader through the landscape. Finally, the scenes were rendered as videos. Like the map, they are linked to the reader’s scrolling movement in the final article.","While working on this story, we were inspired to think more deeply about how to approach issues that are global in scale but local in impact. Visual, data-driven journalism often addresses climate change through charts and data visualizations or interactive news games. Despite the personalization these games allow, it remains difficult for audiences to imagine the real impact of the climate crisis on their surroundings. Our article attempts to bridge this gap by simulating a future landscape. We present the year 2075 – a time that is neither too near nor too far away – and use a photorealistic visualization style to bring this near future to life. Through this approach, our story allows readers to experience what Switzerland might look like in the future and to understand how they will have to navigate a warmer world.",English,https://www.nzz.ch/english/switzerland-in-2075-a-climate-change-visualization-ld.1855325,https://medium.com/nzz-open/switzerland-2075-how-we-built-an-immersive-experience-of-a-landscape-transformed-by-climate-change-baab17eac8c1,,,"Adina Renner, visual editor: Storytelling, data, story lead; Jon Cohrs, creative technologist: Concept and 3D visualization; Tom Vaillant, visual journalist: Concept and visualization; Sven Titz, climate change editor: Storytelling, research and text; Cian Jochem, visual journalist: Data visualization; Michel Grautstück, developer: Web implementation","Adina Renner is a Visual Editor at Neue Zürcher Zeitung.

The article combines investigative research, data-driven analysis, and visual storytelling to shed light on the immense challenge that countries face after natural disasters.","The article was well received by our readership, as evidenced by long engagement times well above the usual average. Internally, the story raised our standards in covering complex issues with a solutions-oriented approach. In addition, visual research methods, specifically qualitative and quantitative satellite data analysis, are now an integral part of many of our articles.","This article combines a range of modern research methods to reveal the true extent of the debris problem following the 2023 earthquake in Turkey.  Visual and quantitative analysis of satellite imagery from the hard-hit city of Anatakya helps to gauge the immense destruction at a concrete location. The analysis is presented as a scrollytelling element, with step-by-step explanations to the reader.   Complementing the maps, visualizations show a generalized process for cleaning, sorting, and recycling the debris. These illustrated infographics are based on in-depth interviews with UN experts and construction specialists. The goal was not only to highlight the dangers of improper debris management, but also to provide practical solutions. The article discusses innovative approaches to debris recycling and shows how sustainable practices can protect people and the environment from long-term damage.","Because the journalistic methods for this article were diverse, both the techniques used for research and for the visualization of the findings varied widely. The following techniques and tools were used:  -Data analysis: Satellite imagery analysis based on Sentinel-1 data. Results were processed in QGIS, visualized using high-resolution satellite imagery, and presented as a scrolling map. -Qualitative analysis: Visual exploration of debris dumps around Antakya using Google Earth Pro. Satellite images from different time periods were animated to illustrate the growth of debris sites over time. -Explanations: Illustrated infographics based on expert interviews, created using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. -Perspective: Drone images and photos taken by a local journalist.","Although this article is investigative in nature, it does not focus on the investigative process itself and position the authors as central figures. Instead, we chose an explainer format to present our findings, allowing readers to understand the issue without engaging with the behind-the-scenes research. This more approach resonated with our technically minded audience and contributed to the article’s success in terms of engagement.

Poland,"Fronstory.pl, VSquare.org",Small,,,Tracking the ‘Green Eagle’: Unpacking CEE’s biggest oil company’s promises to ‘go green’,2024-10-17,"Investigation, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Environment, Business, Economy","Animation, Microsoft Excel, Fluorish","This story unpacks the green promises of Orlen, the largest energy and oil company in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). It is an unprecedented work in the region, covering the multifaceted transformation of a company that claims to be going green while simultaneously betting on the region’s slow transition and aiming to become the last refinery in Europe. The story also highlights the paradox of the financial ecosystem surrounding it: pension funds profiting from a company that harms the climate and a state that enables its significant influence on lawmaking.","The story was republished by various high-profile individuals, including the founder of the Climate & Strategy Foundation and the civil society advisor to the Polish Prime Minister.  In November, activists from the Dzikie Karpaty group refused to accept a prize co-sponsored by Orlen, and this story was mentioned in media coverage of the event (though I cannot confirm it was the reason).  I was interviewed by Lithuanian public radio (as Orlen is the country’s largest company) and was approached by the media officer of a major intergovernmental financial institution regarding an assessment of credits Orlen was set to receive. I was informed that the story had been read there. I was invited to lead a workshop for journalists on climate investigations, based on that story.  It was the fourth most-read and shared story on Fronstory.pl in 2024 and had the second-best reach.  Early 2025, Orlen published a new, re-done strategy that had corrected some of the issues mentioned in those stories - butm unfrotunately, it didn’t address many more.","There was little editorial will to handle this story in a way that did not succumb to the prevailing political atmosphere in Poland. The state treasury-owned Orlen is seen as political spoils, and its former director, Daniel Obajtek, was one of the most prominent figures in the Law and Justice Party. Highlighting Orlen’s internal inertia and independent business goals—regardless of the ruling party—meant going against the ”clickbait” instincts of editors, not just in my newsroom but in nearly every newsroom in Poland. It also required fighting for every paragraph to keep the story informative and balanced rather than sensationalist.  By steering clear of the inter-party battles of 2024, this story reveals the full scope of failure—not just of the state, but also of the private sector, independent media (including outlets clearly opposed to Law and Justice), and even one of Poland’s most popular science educators. It shows how all these actors have struggled to hold Orlen accountable—or, at times, have succumbed to self-censorship while benefiting from its financial influence.","I based this story on Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, press inquiries, interviews with experts and activists, and publicly available data from sources such as the Polish Statistics Office, Eurostat, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and others. Additionally, I used paid data services to track the tanker fleet delivering gas to Poland, with assistance from OCCRP.  My research also included reports from public, non-governmental, scientific, and private institutions, such as studies on the impact of fracking on earthquakes in Canada, a report on fracking for the U.S. Congress, assessments of the state of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, and analyses of gas leakage in transportation and production. I examined publicly available financial data, including stock ownership and dividend distributions, as well as various other datasets and reports, such as the Alberta Administration oil wells register and geological maps of the Permian Basin and planned investments there.  Additionally, I conducted a media analysis on the impartiality of reporting and examined gas contracts that Orlen had previously published but later refused to disclose under FOI requests, citing ”trade secrecy.”","This project is a mosaic of data, and its value lies in demonstrating the success a journalist can achieve by effectively utilizing all this information to tell a comprehensive story. You could argue that this story does not stem from a single news event or a specific wrongdoing. Instead, it is built from fragments of information that, on their own, might often be dismissed as mere ”context.” Yet, when pieced together, they reveal a broader picture of a vast corporation—and its true goals.  Moreover, no energy company in this region of Europe has received more media attention than Orlen. And yet, after reading this story, most analysts said: No one has ever done something like this before. The lesson here is that even with a company everyone knows about, a journalist can still uncover thousands of words of information that have never been published—or that, when connected, offer a completely new perspective.","Polish, English",https://vsquare.org/orlen-oil-green-transformation-poland-gas-usa/,,,,Author: Tadeusz Michrowski Visual storytelling: Anastasiia Morozova and Tadeusz Michrowski,"Tadeusz Michrowski is an award-winning journalist and writer.

As an alternative to traditional fireworks, they are much safer and eco-friendly. Furthermore, they are constantly growing in scale and spectacle. Just last October, 10,197 drones illuminated the night sky in celebration of China’s National Day. Drone shows seem like such a technological marvel; how does one even go about coordinating such a large number of drones? This piece seeks to demystify and explain the science and technology behind what makes drone shows work.",-,"In particular, the drone show over in Hong Kong on China’s National Day was actually cancelled due to weather conditions. This might lead one to wonder about the safety and feasibility of such performances. This piece thus also goes on to explain about the logistics and preparation required for such a huge event to happen, as well as weather conditions that may affect different pieces of hardware and prevent the entire show from happening.   Overall, the aim was to increase the public’s understanding and appreciation of the science and artistry of drone shows, and have them think about whether they should embrace this new form of celebrating events.  The piece wraps up with a slightly experimental data visualization. To visualize the intensity of solar flares over time, a radial spiral is emanated from the centre of the Sun, in an attempt to make it resemble its solar flares. A radial form is chosen also to reinforce that the patterns are cyclical and repeating, and will continue on ad infinitum. This is also an attempt to use animation to prime the reader’s perception of what the chart represents.","From the initial research, it turns out that software plays a huge role in the initial design stage of a drone show. Namely, the show is first simulated within a 3D software. Hence, work was put into actually learning and understanding the software - putting the author in the shoes of a drone show designer.  In fact, designing a drone show is really just designing a 3D graphic, and this is something that with some work, can also be done on the web. Hence, you view the visuals of this piece as the team trying to simulate our own drone show right inside a web article.   To create the drone formations, publicly downloadable models were utilized and tweaked for our needs. Rendering large numbers of particles (even up to 10,000) is something that WebGL can do very efficiently, making the 3D graphics pipeline perfect for this piece.   The piece makes gratuitous use of scroll-driven animations to create the narrative. Scenes and sections transition smoothly one to another, preserving the reader’s mental model of the different concepts being presented. In order to make these animations run smoothly on the web, careful engineering and programming of the rendering process was required.",-,English,https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/world/article/3292066/drone-shows/,,,,"YiZhe Ang, Infographic Designer Andrew London, Graphics Editor","i Zhe joined SCMP’s infographics team in 2024 after a stint as a visual journalist for The Straits Times in Singapore.

First and foremost, it raises awareness about the significant challenges faced by asylum seekers in the city. Many individuals remain unaware of the hardships these people endure while fleeing persecution or danger in their home countries. By sharing real stories, we aim to foster empathy and understanding, highlighting the human aspect of this issue. We documented personal experiences to illustrate the profound impact of the asylum process on individuals and families. Living in one of the world’s most expensive cities, asylum seekers often find themselves unable to work legally, forcing them into precarious living conditions. Although the government provides some assistance, it is frequently inadequate to cover basic living expenses, compelling many to turn to non-governmental organizations for support. Understanding the asylum process in Hong Kong is also crucial, as it is marked by complexity, lengthy wait times, and alarmingly low acceptance rates—only about 1.3% of claims are granted. By presenting objective data alongside these visual narratives, we hope to contribute to a more informed and compassionate society.","We started with research on asylum seekers in Hong Kong by consulting various NGOs and speaking directly with affected individuals who shared their personal stories with us anonymously.

From the data collected in the indicator, it was identified that the majority of municipalities, 68%, still have limited or non-existent actions to deal with disasters.","The report played an important role in shedding light on a neglected issue, significantly increasing its visibility. Beyond that, it became a valuable database for public consultation, providing accessible and reliable information for those seeking to understand the topic in depth.","The investigation encountered significant obstacles, including limited transparency in municipal data, restricted access to official sources, and political neglect of disaster prevention. Additionally, resource constraints and the lack of standardized public data made it difficult to assess local preparedness, while some municipalities were unresponsive to information requests.","Indicator of Municipal Capacity in Civil Protection and Defense (ICM), collected on the website of Ministry of Integration and Regional Development. This indicator classifies Brazilian municipalities into four categories – Initial (D), Early Intermediate (C), Advanced Intermediate (B) and High (A) –, reflecting its ability to respond to extreme events. The information was available in tables within files in PDF format. To enable analysis, the data was extracted, converted and subsequently processed in Power Query. Furthermore, we apply descriptive statistics techniques to synthesize and interpret the data, allowing the identification of patterns and disparities in risk management by municipalities. To deepen the analysis, the municipalities were clustered by population groups, following the demographic classification adopted by the Ministry of Integration and Regional Development, and by the condition of being state capitals. Municipal groupings and their position as capital influence their ability to respond to disasters.  The results were presented using interactive graphics and georeferenced maps in Datawrapper, allowing a detailed spatial visualization of disaster preparedness levels in Brazilian municipalities. Cartographic modeling played a key role in identifying regional disparities.","Journalists can learn how to navigate the lack of official transparency by cross-referencing data sources and seeking alternative sources. The project also highlights the importance of contextualizing technical data to make it accessible to the public and reinforces the need for persistence in obtaining information on issues neglected by authorities. Additionally, it demonstrates how data-driven investigations can expose structural failures and drive discussions on preventive policies.",Português,https://lupa.uol.com.br/jornalismo/2024/12/23/duas-em-cada-tres-cidades-do-brasil-falham-na-protecao-contra-desastres-belem-sede-da-cop30-e-uma-delas,https://lupa.uol.com.br/jornalismo/2025/02/25/muito-calor-e-enchentes-veja-se-a-sua-cidade-esta-preparada-para-eventos-extremos,,,"Francisco Amorim, Luciana Correa, Evelin Mendes","Francisco Amorim is a journalist specializing in science and the environment, with experience at major outlets such as *Folha de S.Paulo*, *National Geographic*, and *Deutsche Welle*.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,,,"2024, l’année des « filles de la pop ». Oui, mais…",2024-12-30,"Explainer, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Audio, Arts, Culture, Women","Animation, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV","Our article on the « pop girlies » of 2024 was published in French on Radio-Canada website on December 30, 2024, as a review of a year like no other. 2024 was dominated by women in pop music, but especially the rise of new artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan, and a powerful comeback from Charli XCX. Yet, their undeniable success wasn’t enough to propel them to the top of the charts. But why? According to experts and studies, the way music consumption is measured in the charts, but mostly misogyny in the music industry, are key factors.","In a year that is said to be marked by female pop, why doesn’t the Billboard Hot 100 reflect this more? Let’s look at radio airplay, which is a third of the points to get a place on the chart. Women are generally underrepresented, according to a study on the frequency of song airplay in Canada. Between 2013 and 2023, female performers were heard, on average, only five times per hour on pop radios. Way less the male singers. And charts reflect that. We spoke to experts who question the relevance of the Billboard Hot 100, what it measures and what it actually means, even if this chart is still the reference in the industry. The article, with its candy/pop presentation, its illustrations, its data visualisations and the possibility to listen to the songs while reading, starts from what could be a light subject to explore something way more important, with depth and rigor : the misogyny in the music industry. But it also takes a look at other ways to measure success : critics, Grammy Awards, social media and fans.","We analyzed data from the Billboard Hot 100, the most important American chart. One third of the ranking was occupied by pop music, the quarter by female pop. But women only reached #1, the top of the chart, ten weeks of the year. And even in the top 10, female artists were underrepresented. Our analysis is dissected step by step in a data visualization where each of the songs is represented by a yellow dot. A second visualization even allows readers to see, by artist and song, its progress on the charts in 2024.","The mandate for this project aimed to provide users with an efficient and enjoyable experience for visualizing the Billboard Chart data. We created an intuitive way to launch an audio player directly from the content, while also allowing users to read the article simultaneously. The art direction is vibrant and impactful, intended to engage the user right from the start. Regarding the visualizations, the objective was to enable users to easily track an artist’s positions on the Billboard, compare their songs, and explore different artists and albums in an interactive and intuitive manner. Each animation was carefully designed and optimized to enhance the storytelling experience. We used the appropriate technologies based on the context: GSAP, Lottie, or CSS, depending on the needs. Three designers with diverse skills collaborated on this project: an illustrator designer, a data visualization illustrator, and a UI designer.","Our project has also shown how to deal with a seemingly playful subject in a rigorous way. It made it possible to tackle a historical trend in the music industry. Over the years, there have been other articles written about pop music and charts, but rarely on our scale or in such thoroughness. This could have been a light subject, but highlighting it with a playful format made it possible to put into words and graphics a phenomenon that we do not necessarily think about every day. The whole project is also supported by the testimony of experts in the musical field which sheds new light on this trend. Although the subject may seem light on the surface, the fact remains that the resulting conclusions say a lot about this industry. Exposing these biases could help change the future of music.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2024/billboard-pop-sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-charli-xcx/,,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier data journalist, Sara Barrière-Brunet desk-editor, Louis-Philippe Bouvier and Francis Lamontagne designers, Josselin Pfeuffer illustrator, André Guimaraes and Mathieu St-Laurent developers","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,,,On a enquêté sur la réduflation pendant un an. Voici le résultat,2024-03-25,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Chart, Business, Economy","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV","Our project on shrinkflation was published in French on Radio-Canada website on March 25, 2024, as a result of a year-long investigation on this commercial practice. With shrinkflation, consumers get less food for their money. It has been going on for years, and it was even worse during (and after) the pandemic, at a moment where inflation was also weighing on everybody’s wallet. Still, the extent of the phenomenon was impossible to measure : shrinkflation is not monitored, nor is there any oversight from any authority in Canada.","We used our findings to try, for the first time ever and as best as possible, to quantify the phenomenon : which kind of products were more impacted, when did it happen, how big were the downsizings and which brands were doing it the most. We also gave the companies an opportunity to speak up and explain their decisions. Many articles have looked at shrinkflation over the years, but without addressing the heart of the problem: the real scale of the phenomenon. Experts say there’s a need for a review, to hold manufacturers, which show no transparency in this matter, accountable, but above all to protect consumers. Our work was applauded by experts and consumers across the country, and forced the industry to be more transparent on this practice. As a result, for example, Tropicana, when it reduced again its bottle of orange juice last year, published a detailed explanation on their website, something that is not seen enough.","Prior to our project, there was no database on shrinkflation in Canada. The extent of the phenomenon was therefore impossible to measure. There are no reliable surveys and the examples found here and there on the Internet or social networks are anecdotal and cannot, except in a few rare cases, be considered as reliable evidence. Over the course of a year we have identified hundreds of products that got smaller. We made that possible thanks to a crowdsourcing part of our project, asking readers to send us products which met the definition of shrinkflation. We received more than 350 emails from readers. More than 600 examples of products were also submitted via an online form. By leading us on the trail of specific products, and adding some key information (new and old sizes, for example), we just had to carry out the necessary checks before adding them to our database. We also went through old flyers and web archives, and cross-checked everything using archives or data harvesting. This allowed us to verify and confirm the shrinkflation of more than 300 products sold in Canada in the past 20 years.","The idea of measuring the extent of the practice, and the absence of data to do so, pushed us to begin our own data collection. But we quickly face the scale of the task, with the tens of thousands of food products sitting on store shelves. We then added a crowdsourcing part to our project, asking readers to send us products which, according to them, met the definition of shrinkflation. They could do it through a Google form, simple to fill out, but they also had the option to write to us, or send us photos, by email. Our article « On a enquêté sur la réduflation pendant un an. Voici le résultat » is the result of that rigorous investigation. We used scrollytelling to present a selection of examples associated with shrinkflation. Later in the article, a selection of charts and special sections show our data. It also addresses what is to be expected with shrinkflation in the future and explores solutions implemented abroad as inspiration for Canada.","Shrinkflation resonates strongly with the public: everyone shops for groceries and notices price increases. Many articles have looked at this commercial practice over the years, but without addressing the heart of the problem: the real scale of the phenomenon and the lack of monitoring. This is not surprising given that reliable data on the subject was not available and that companies that engage in it often lack transparency. However, sometimes, the absence of data is a subject in itself. Alternatively, it may be sufficient to see how it would be possible to access or obtain data, with crowdsourcing, for example, in order to create one’s own database to quantify, if not at least document, a phenomenon that is increasing in Canada.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2023/reduflation/conclusion-enquete-produits-reduits-epicerie/,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2099214/bouteille-jus-orange-tropicana-reduflation,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier data journalist, Melanie Julien and Sara Barrière-Brunet desk-editors, Louis-Philippe Bouvier and Francis Lamontagne designers, Josselin Pfeuffer illustrator, André Guimaraes and Mathieu St-Laurent developers","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Uruguay,Self-published,Small,,,Paths in Education,2025-08-12,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Python, Shorthand, Flourish, Datawrapper","A country designs its education system to equip people with essential skills, but what happens when only half of its young population completes mandatory education? In Uruguay, this challenge has persisted for over 30 years. While key statistics are widely discussed, the human stories behind them remain untold. This project combines quantitative and qualitative data visualisation to reveal personal educational journeys. By visualising the experiences of eight young adults who encountered barriers, it blends rational insight with emotional storytelling, urging the need for tailored policies to address the diverse paths students face.","Paths in Education has resonated strongly with both the public and professionals. Numerous tweets have highlighted its emotional impact, with many users expressing empathy and a renewed understanding of the personal struggles behind educational statistics. The project’s combination of quantitative scrollytelling and qualitative storytelling has proven effective in humanising complex data, shifting the narrative from abstract figures to real-life experiences.  The impact extended beyond social media; I was invited to present the work at an education and public policy group. This opportunity affirmed the project’s relevance in shaping policy debates and inspiring innovative approaches to addressing educational challenges. Moreover, participants featured in the visualisations expressed pride in the sensitive and honest portrayal of their educational journeys.  Overall, Paths in Education has not only sparked meaningful dialogue around educational inequality but also demonstrated the power of data visualisation to engage, inform, and inspire both audiences and decision-makers.","Paths in Education was developed as a master’s dissertation over three months, covering every stage from concept and participant recruitment to data collection, analysis, design, web development, and an 8,000‐word academic report detailing the underlying theories. The project was executed on a zero-budget basis, aside from a prize draw incentive and minimal website upkeep costs.  Conducting field work from 11,000 km away posed significant challenges. Uruguay was chosen for its pressing educational issues, despite the difficulties inherent in remote participant recruitment. Without access to in-person outreach or organisational support, recruitment relied on social media and personal networks, with incentives offered to secure suitable participants. Strict criteria—selecting only individuals who had repeated a grade or not completed high school—added to the challenge. Interviews were conducted without a predetermined vision for the final visualisations, necessitating a careful balance between building rapport, ethical considerations, and comprehensive data gathering.  The project was later translated into Spanish, broadening its reach in Uruguay and engaging educators, academics, journalists, and the general public.","The project comprised several stages and tools that integrated quantitative and qualitative data into a cohesive narrative. For data collection, virtual interviews were conducted on Microsoft Teams, and interview transcripts were analysed using Microsoft Copilot’s paid version, to ensure participant anonymity. Copilot was used to clean the transcripts and help find key information. In addition to published datasets, raw survey data was processed using Python to extract critical metrics.  Charts were primarily developed in Flourish, with some visualisations created in Datawrapper. A custom anthropographic representation of educational trajectories was designed using Adobe Illustrator. This bespoke visual grammar encoded key attributes—such as grade progression, course selections, early dropouts, and school changes—and was integrated as background imagery on the website.  The interactive scrollytelling website was built using Shorthand, allowing the narrative to unfold dynamically as users scrolled. An agile workflow and iterative design process ensured that insights from qualitative interviews informed the quantitative elements, resulting in a balanced presentation of complex data and personal narratives.","Paths in Education demonstrates that blending numerical data with personal stories can create narratives that are both insightful and deeply empathetic. Journalists can learn how the integration of quantitative analysis with personal accounts not only clarifies complex issues but also evokes a powerful emotional response from audiences.  This project shows that personal stories can be conveyed through data visualisation without compromising the privacy or dignity of those involved. By using innovative, bespoke visual techniques to map educational trajectories, it captures the essence of each participant’s experience —without the risks associated with exposing sensitive details. In contexts where direct exposure may be unsafe or unethical, such methods provide a respectful alternative that still conveys authenticity.  The overwhelmingly positive feedback from the project’s own protagonists underscores its impact. Many felt that their stories were portrayed accurately and with honour, affirming that ethical storytelling should always prioritise the people at its heart. Ultimately, this work shows that when journalists combine robust data with thoughtful narrative techniques, they not only inform but also inspire a more nuanced and compassionate public discourse.","English, Spanish",https://bit.ly/PathsInEducation,https://youtu.be/gDrhvBrIpn8,https://bit.ly/CaminosEnLaEducacion,,Paula Lago,"Paula Lago is a data journalist and visualisation specialist from Uruguay with extensive experience in digital communications, including five years leading UNICEF Uruguay’s digital strategy.

Spain,Civio,Small,,,"One small step for a few, one giant leap for the rest: how to become a European citizen",2024-05-28,"Investigation, Cross-border, Quiz/game, Infographics, Immigration","3D modeling, Personalisation, D3.js, Google Sheets, R, RStudio, PyxelEdit","The investigation examines the avenues for obtaining European citizenship, with a particular focus on inclusivity and accessibility for non-EU residents. It provides an in-depth analysis of the legal frameworks, the challenges of the current processes, and potential reforms to streamline integration while ensuring fairness. By showcasing success stories and outlining the challenges, the project aims to foster understanding of European identity and the role of citizenship in promoting equality and shared values. By presenting data, expert insights, and real-life experiences, the article aims to empower individuals and inform policy discussions for a more unified Europe.","This work had a significant social impact because it highlighted bureaucratic barriers that affect thousands of people and demonstrated how different legal frameworks condition the lives of stateless individuals and migrants in Europe. It highlights the stark contrast between the swift and exclusive paths to citizenship for a select few, such as athletes or celebrities, and the lengthy, bureaucratically challenging processes faced by many others. By comparing individual cases with the special treatment of public figures, the investigation exposes systemic inequalities in citizenship laws. It sheds light on the profound impact citizenship has on immigrants’ lives, enhancing their opportunities for social and economic advancement while also emphasizing the unequal access to European citizenship based on arbitrary factors like nationality and social status. The piece brings attention to the need for reform, prompting public debate on citizenship policies within the EU.  Thanks to cross-border collaboration with the European Journalism Network and media outlets like Deutsche Welle, OBC Transeuropa, Dennik K, the research transcended borders, revealing a shared reality in different countries. Its republication in The Journal, El Confidencial, and the European Data Journalism Network expanded its reach, promoting public debate and the need for reforms.","This journalistic investigation is an innovative integration of cross-border journalism, data analysis and digital storytelling. This content is delivered through a variety of mediums, including traditional reporting, visual data and an eye-catching retro video game as the main data visualization. The game’s visualization draws heavily from nostalgic design, utilizing pixel art and a classic gaming interface to evoke familiarity and engage a broad audience. It incorporates elements of decision-making, resource management, and role-playing to simulate real-world citizenship challenges, offering players an immersive, hands-on learning experience. This method transforms abstract concepts into relatable scenarios, making complex legal frameworks accessible through engaging and visually appealing gameplay mechanics. Combined with the investigative journalism underpinning the project, the game serves as a powerful tool to inform and inspire action, bridging entertainment and education in a uniquely innovative way.","We developed the visualisations using Svelte and D3.js. We prototyped all user flows and designed the visualisation interface in Figma.  At the level of pixel-art design and implementation of the game-like visualization:  1) We designed the interactive map of the European Union ad-hoc following a grid approach using R and the ggplot and sf packages. Then we modeled it in 3D with CAD software Rhinoceros to extract an axonometric perspective view that we exported to encoded SVG to be able to manipulate it interactively with JavaScript. 2) We designed the animated avatar frame by frame to bring to life the different actions that accompany the narrative. Using sprites (series of frames) designed with the video game creation software PyxelEdit, we animated the figure’s motion using CSS. We prototyped both elements in Observable.","Journalists can learn several key lessons from this project. First, the value of cross-border collaboration is evident. Working with international outlets like Deutsche Welle and OBC Transeuropa allowed the investigation to transcend national boundaries, showcasing how partnerships can amplify a story’s reach.  The project also highlights the importance of uncovering hidden stories, particularly those that affect marginalized groups. By focusing on bureaucratic barriers faced by migrants and stateless individuals, the investigation underscores the significance of reporting on issues that may be overlooked but have a profound societal impact. A standout element of the project is the powerful use of data visualization. The inclusion of interactive data and visual analysis made complex legal and bureaucratic issues accessible and engaging. This approach helps readers better understand intricate patterns and trends, especially with dense topics like citizenship laws. Journalists can learn to incorporate data visualizations, making complex information easier for audiences to grasp and increasing engagement.

Norway,"NRK Graveredaksjonen sørøst, NRK Brennpunkt",Big,,,Instukids,2024-04-24,"Investigation, Long-form, Documentary, Database, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Health","Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python, Selenium, MongoDB, Streamlit","«Instukids» is an investigative journalism project by NRK Graveredaksjonen sørøst and Brennpunkt that explores the harsh realities faced by children and young adults in Norwegian child welfare institutions. The project reveals that many become heavily addicted to drugs and experience sexual abuse while under supposed protection. Utilizing customized data journalistic tools to explore TikTok, NRK connected with 100 current and former residents aged 13 to 23. This groundbreaking work exposes critical systemic failures and has prompted swift responses from governmental bodies to address these urgent issues. The articles is in Norwegian, so please use Google Translate.","The projects narratives, extensive fieldwork and data-driven approach had a profound impact. Following its publication, Jan Christian Vestre, Minister of Health and Care Services from the Labour Party, pledged to shift the responsibility for addiction treatment of institutionalized children from the child welfare system to the healthcare system. Additionally, the government announced a forthcoming reform of institutional child welfare, set to be introduced in the spring of 2025, with a focus on enhanced support for children facing drug challenges. The project also led to immediate actions, such as Kjersti Toppe, Minister of Children and Families from the Centre Party, calling a meeting with institution owners and user organizations nationwide to implement short-term solutions to reduce drug issues within these institutions.  Furthermore, The Norwegian Directorate for Children, Youth and Family Affairs (Bufdir) responded by promising to enhance training on substance abuse in light of the findings and initiated a comprehensive review of their procedures due to revelations of staff-perpetrated abuse. Moreover, NRK’s investigation have sparked broader public and political discourse, emphasizing the need for systemic change and greater protection for vulnerable children in state care. The total page views for the web articles has surpassed 1,3 million.","The word «Instukids» is a term used by young people with experiences from child welfare institutions to describe themselves, and it is a shorthand for the words «institution» and «kids». Around 1000 children are at any given time taken care of in institutions. Often when the media covers issues about child welfare, it is adults who speak about the children, not with them. «Instukids» has taken the children seriously, and the entire project is based on the children’s own voices. Never before have so many been given the chance to tell and show the public how they are doing and what challenges they face.","To find «Instukids» on Tiktok, we searched for hashtags such as «#instu» and «#barnevernet» to find potential accounts. With custom scrapers for TikTok built with Python and Selenium for browser automation, we were able to download information from these accounts – including who they were following, who followed them and who had commented on their videos. By manually inspecting the accounts for signs for openly sharing posts about child welfare services and drug abuse, we could gradually add accounts to our growing database. The technique was based on the fact that children in the child welfare system are moved around a lot and therefore make new friends who are in the same situation in other institutions. By inspecting their friends on TikTok, we were able to identify many more. To get in touch with 100 current or former residents we used Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok to create trust and conduct anonymous interviews. We also requested our own data from the social media apps we used, to gain access to structured data from our conversations. To keep track of the interviews we used a MongoDB database and Streamlit to create a dashboard highlighting our findings for all in the team to see.","Firstly, it underscores the importance of giving a voice to marginalized and vulnerable people. By connecting directly with children and young adults in the child welfare service through social media, the project demonstrates how journalists can bypass traditional gatekeepers to access authentic, firsthand accounts.  Secondly, the project highlights the potential of leveraging custom digital tools and platforms to gather and analyze data. The extensive use of TikTok and Snapchat enabled the team to reach a wide network of sources. Another critical takeaway is the importance of building trust with sources, especially when dealing with sensitive topics. It was crucial for us to be transparent of what we were investigating and to ensure safety and consent of the people we talked to, which in return were essential in securing honest and detailed testimonies.",Norwegian,https://www.nrk.no/stor-oslo/barn-og-unge-i-barnevernet-deler-videoer-om-rus-pa-tiktok-1.16835047,https://www.nrk.no/stor-oslo/sara-_13_-kom-for-a-fa-hjelp-av-barnevernet-_-ble-avhengig-av-rus-1.16838666,https://www.nrk.no/stor-oslo/ronja-_13_-opplevde-overgrep-mens-barnevernet-hadde-ansvar-for-henne-1.16838669,https://www.nrk.no/stor-oslo/mathilde-hellum-_21_-ble-sviktet-av-barnevernet-_-ble-funnet-pa-en-benk-1.16838673,"Christian Nicolai Bjørke (investigative/data reporter), Tuva Skei Tønset (investigative reporter), Kaja Staude Mikalsen (investigative reporter), Henrik Bøe (data reporter), Stephan Reis (photo/editing), Gry Kårstad (photo/editing), John-André Samuelsen (photo/editing), Susanne Stubberud Rom (graphics), André Håker (graphics), Johannes Odland (developer), Rina Therese Blekkerud (project editor), Lars Karelius Noer (project editor), Anne Vinding (editor), Frode Frøyland (editor)",NRK Graveredaksjonen sørøst is a regional investigative group in the public service broadcaster in Norway.

United Kingdom,BBC Eye Investigations.,Big,,,Settlements Above the Law,2024-09-03,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Documentary, Database, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Video, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Gun violence, Human rights","Scraping, Google Sheets","Since Hamas militants killed around 1,200 people in Israel on 7 October 2023, extremist Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank are increasingly using violence to force Palestinians from their homes.  “Settlements Above the Law” investigates a new type of illegal settlement known as a ’herding outpost’. These and other outposts don’t have government approval and are illegal under Israeli law.   But we independently verified the location of 196 outposts established in the occupied West Bank, showing that almost half of them have been built in the past five years.","The film and associated content has performed well across a number of channels. The full 52 minute film has been watched by over 600,000 people on the BBC World Service’s main YouTube channel. Alongside this, social media content, a text article and versions in other languages helped to expand the reach of the journalism.   The use of satellite imagery, SOCMINT and Israeli government geodata to verify the existence of 196 illegal outposts currently standing in the West Bank helped to push the investigation to a wider audience. These data were widely quoted in the media and by NGOs working in this space. It has also helped to inspire other journalists working in this space to see the power of data and verification projects to deliver stronger accountability.   We also investigated how individual organisations inside Israel aid, abet and fund illegal outposts throughout the West Bank. By uncovering open-source Israeli court records, we were able to prove one key settler organisation - Amana - was loaning money to settlers who were setting up illegal outposts. In the months after our investigaiton was released, Amana and it’s commercial construction arm, Binyanei Bar Amana Ltd. were sanctioned by both the UK and US governments.","Although made apparent in the film itself, a key issue we faced making this film was the insufficient data showing the numbers of outposts in the West Bank. Due to their illegality both under Israeli and international law - this was to be expected. But it meant that we had to try to uncover and verify the data ourselves.   It is also worth noting the difficulties of operating in the West Bank given the current political climate. Our team worked carefully and considerately whilst filming on the ground to ensure it was possible to both make the film and keep contributors safe at all times.","There were three main investigative strands to our piece which aimed to investigate the ’micro’ ’on-the-ground’ realities alongside the ’macro-view’ -  showing the issue at scale. At the ’micro-level’, we forensically investigated a single incident of settler violence where a Palestinian man was shot and killed. We verified, geolocated and analysed more than 130 photos and videos captured at the scene. This made it possible to recreate events, placing key moments on a timeline and showing audiences how a notorious settler was armed at the scene and had used his assault rifle to threaten residents in full view of Israeli soldiers.   At an organisational level, we also analysed open-source contracts from key settler organisations,  using these to create map overlays which we cross-referenced with satellite imagery. This allowed us to confirm that land and money provided by powerful settler groups were being used to build illegal outposts.   At a ’macro-level’, one of our key aims was to show the scale and proliferation of illegal outposts - especially given the lack of official data. Therefore we used satellite imagery, SOCMINT and Israeli government geodata showing demolition orders, to map and verify the existence of 196 illegal outposts and the year they were built.","We hope that this project reflects the possibilities in presenting complex and wide-ranging issues in accessible, engaging ways by combining on-the-ground reporting, open-source forensics and data journalism. Hopefully this project reveals that intricate investigations and data analysis can effectively weave into more traditional narrative documentary storytelling to deliver journalism that is both impactful and engaging.","English, Arabic, Hebrew",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxLDYkX7l9A,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c207j6wy332o,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2715,https://time.com/7017069/west-bank-palestinian-gaza-israel-war/,"Director - Matthew Cassel Producer - Emir Nader, Ziad Al-Qattan, Jake Tacchi Filmed by - Matthew Cassel, Ayman Abu Ramouz Location Producer - Ayman Abu Ramouz, Shakked Auerbach, Assaf Peretz Research - Uri Blau Additional Camera - Yossi Ollech, Yotam Ronen Impact Producer - Fahima Abdelrahman, Tom Donkin, Emaan Warraich, Paul Organe, Gabriele Shaw Colourist - Andy Elliot Online Editor - Mike Green Audio Post Production - Edwin Matthews Junior Production Manager - Louise Cavanagh Production coordinator - Charlotte Delamere Unit Manager -  Maria Caramelo Film Editor - Bettina Waked Motion Design - Jasmine Rone Narration - Raghad Chaar Head of Longform - Liz Gibbons Executive Editor, BBC News Arabic - Tim Awford Executive Producer - Simon Cox BBC Eye Editor - Mustafa Khalili","BBC Eye Investigations is the BBC World Service’s award-winning investigative unit which brings investigative journalism and hard-hitting documentaries to an international audience.

Zimbabwe,Equity Axis  Samala USA,Small,,,Turning Insights into Action: Securing Funding for Nyabhira Primary,2024-03-01,"Investigation, Documentary, Video","AI/Machine learning, Microsoft Excel, Adobe Primier Pro","This project explores the tricky situation of primary school students in Nyabhira, whose families can not afford the $40/ term school fees due to their average incomes of less than $45/ month. The Government has also failed to address this problem.We have been able to source funds for 15 students per term and we haev also installed a water tank and we are helping with building a new school block also.  The main purpose of this investigation is to find ways of utilizing data journalism to help in assisting marginalised communities.","This project has had a profound impact in Nyabhira.  Our research concluded that 90% of primary school students live with families who cant afford fees of $40/ term.  We addressed these issues and sought to involve a broader community on many apps like Linkedin to be able to gain insights from  companies and capable stakeholders interested in making a difference.  To date we have managed to install a water tank, organised fees payment for 15kids and assisted in building an additional classroom block. This has helped the students improve their circumstances due to the difficulty of accesing some of these ”basic” amenities.  Additionally, the project has encouraged journalists to implore data driven journalism to reflect on societal issues. Zimbabwe’s most viewed TV station, ZTN has also taken a keen interest in understanding our mandate to and helped propel it further.  This project has engaged the community to discuss issues around educational equity, and this has highlighted the importance of  data journalism in improving communities that are marginalised.","The political climate in Zimbabwe has made it difficult to undertake this project. Firstly, the Government refuses to aknowledge the failure of its BEAM  program. The Basic Education Assistance Module (BEAM) is a  program in which the government assists families to be empowered through payment of primary school tuition for those families that cant afford edcuation access. Fiscal challenges have resulted in the failure of BEAM to undertake its fees empowerment objective.  Another challenge is around accesing accurate data. Available data is usually biased and it tends to be influenced by a narrative that minimizes the extent of the issue. Our project has had to rely on primary research which is costly.   Our project has amplified the need for a solution regarding education empowerment in the farm town of  Nyabhira. Our project has demonstrated the importance of data journalism in effecting change in the community. To effectively communicate our findings, we utilized creative reporting techniques, such as video production and dynamic editing, to highlight therealities faced by these families. This approach helped in engaging a wider audience as well as  attracting partnerships, such as with Samala USA, a social enterprise I co-founded, which has been instrumental in our efforts.","To ascertain the education problem at Nyabhira Primary school, our methods almagamated many different methods. We utilised primary data by means of conducting one-on-one interviews with the parents, teachers and community leaders. This information made it clear as to the plurality of families making less than the average $45/ month.  We also incorporated video editing and capturing methods that are centred around the use of narratives that are compeling. These video production methods showed effectively how poverty impacts access to education. Emotional, heartfelt interviews also captured how different stakeholders felt and for dissermination purposes we utilised Linkedin to help reach C-suite executiives . The idea around this was to find many partnerships with companies undertaking CSR initiatives that fit into our mandate.","This projects shows how data journalism can be utilised to address comunity issues in a disruptive manner way. Journalists can learn the importance of anchoring their stories and investigations on the needs of the community. Journalists should also use primary data to come up with first hand data driven narratives.   Engaging different stakeholders like educators and community leadersis important for journalists  to come up with well researched  insights that only data can help in constructing.   Journalists should also learn to collaborate with other experts in other fields. For examples,collboration with  data analysts, helps gurantee accurate data gatheringb and analysis. Their knowledge helps in trend analuysis,   pattern spotting and   also in assertions substantiation, giving their  stories more authority.  Journalists can also learn from using professional social media sites like LinkedIn to help in spreading reports to  corporations and C-suite executives. We utilised this method to get financial support for students fees showing how effective it is.  Also, to help in visualizing data and simplifying data analytics, it is important for journalists to use generative AI softwares in deriving prompts that make the whole process easier.In conclusion, journalists benefit from using data drive jorunalism to helo communitites in need.",English,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geraldmacheka_nyabira-primary-school-primary-blocks-project-activity-7208120943750062081-FkbI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACRS1SIBSe84GuEQolB_bSQJeWnBoCgELok,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geraldmacheka_i-extend-my-heartfelt-gratitude-to-the-esteemed-activity-7208119601077903361-JqeI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACRS1SIBSe84GuEQolB_bSQJeWnBoCgELok,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/geraldmacheka_i-extend-my-heartfelt-gratitude-to-the-esteemed-activity-7208119601077903361-JqeI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACRS1SIBSe84GuEQolB_bSQJeWnBoCgELok,https://youtu.be/kD243tqT3mA?si=f2t7TmaYsQRI26H7,Gerald Macheka Arthur Makotore,"Gerald is a social economist who also serves as editor in chief for Equity Axis Research, a media company based in Zimbabwe.

Greece,Solomon,Small,,,Who owns the media?,2024-09-16,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Chart, Business","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","The investigation ”Who owns the media?” has documented, for the first time, on an interactive platform, the business activities of the oligarchs behind Greece’s major media groups.   We identified 800 companies in various sectors (shipping, energy, sports etc), and searched business registries in 30 countries. We collected data on shareholders and beneficiaries of not only their media groups but also every company we could document as being owned by them. The data were published in an interactive network diagram and a website.  Our goal was greater transparency. It’s crucial for the citizens to know where they get their information from.","Our experience from the launch event we organized in order to communicate our findings to the audience:  Even though there was no actual promotion, as the oligarchs we put under examination control the country’s largest media organizations, the event -on a weekday- was attended by around 1.000 people.  It was the first time in the recent “history” of our country not just of independent media, but of journalism in Greece, that an outlet managed to host such a huge event.  Greece ranks the lowest in media trust in the EU, and the audience was eager to listen/read our findings. Our reach was more mouth to mouth and in our social media platforms rather than with publications in other ”mainstream” media.","As briefly mentioned, Greece lacks deeply in media transparency and public trust towards the media. So, our project had an impact regarding that. On one hand we reinforced the importance of having the data to prove something (ownership) and on the oher hand we covered how oligarchs control the narrative in the public space and how independent investigations and outlets are able to crack this obscure establishment. By proving in practice the absence of pluralism and how this interdependence of media-corporation works there is an opportunity to regain the trust of the public.  We did have a legal threat from a shipping/oil magnet (D. Mellisanides) but dealt with it with the help of the laywers of Homo Digitalis (human rights Non-Profit).  Access to data was a big hurdle since we are talking about registries all over the world so, we published less companies (800) than the ones we found (>1000) in order to ensure proof of ownership.   Resource constraints involved our lack of hands (3 people team) for two years and limited budget for the designers/developers of the website.","For our research we used spreadheets to document the companies and their UBO’s. We used diagrams for our findings and pandas to analyze the data. We used some basic OSINT techniques like Wayback Machine, WHOIS Lookup. ChatGPT as a first step quick search. We used a lot of platforms like Aleph, open corporates, Dun & Bradstreet etc, and we searched a lot of business registries (Greece, Cyprus, Marshall Islands, Liberia, UK, Russia).   We used coding to build the interactive network diagram.","Both in Greece and abroad our project could be used as a pilot on how to investigate and depict media and all other business activities of the biggest businessmen in a city or country.

By analyzing over 50,000 Facebook community discussions and conducting interviews with 11 supporters from various parties, we present insights into Taiwanese voters’ post-election thoughts and emotional shifts.","This election marks a significant shift in Taiwan’s political landscape, as the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has lost the absolute dominance it held for the past decade, leading to an unprecedented balance of power among three parties in the Legislative Yuan. At the same time, public perception of the DPP has become increasingly polarized. Some voters feel that its long-standing “anti-China, pro-Taiwan” narrative has lost its appeal and even become a source of frustration. In contrast, Kuomintang (KMT) supporters remain firmly committed to their party, while the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) has attracted voters disillusioned with the traditional blue-green divide and seeking new political possibilities. These shifts not only influence Taiwan’s domestic political development but may also draw international attention, with far-reaching implications for the island’s political dynamics and democratic progress.","To accurately capture the perspectives of supporters from different political parties, we gathered and analyzed post-election discussions on social media to identify key emotional and ideological trends.

Readers can simply click on the map and explore different variables provided on the site to quickly compare election results across the same region for different elections and years.","From a web development perspective, we utilized a modular design concept, treating different webpage components like building blocks that can be assembled and connected seamlessly. The webpage is divided into distinct modules, including a primary interactive map, candidate information, a historical timeline, election variables, and an overview of election results. When users interact with any of these modules, the content updates dynamically across all components. For instance, if a reader clicks on the map to view results for Zhongshan District in Taipei City, the other modules will automatically load the corresponding data for that district, offering a comprehensive view of the information. For the newsroom, each module can be embedded in various contexts as needed. For example, when reporting on Taipei City election results, there is no need to rely on designers to create additional visuals. By simply adjusting module parameters, the components from the election results website can be embedded as visualized charts directly into articles.","We used R to analyze and organize historical data, standardizing them into a consistent format. In web development, we used D3 and React to display and interact with map components, Redux to manage election data for Taiwan’s various administrative levels, and Next.js with GCS services to provide a serverless static website.","Modularizing tasks that need to be repeated every year not only makes it easier for readers by providing historical data for comparison, but also offers significant benefits to the newsroom, streamlining the editorial process.",Mandarin,https://www.readr.tw/project/3/taiwan-elections/index.html,,,,"Chien Hsin-chan, Lee Yu Ju, I-Ching Wang, Lee Wen Han, Fu Dian-Yang, Liu Hong-Ming, Zhang Rong-Xuan, Tseng Lee-Yu, Wu Man-Ru, Syu Siang-Yun","READr is not just a data newsroom, it is also a digital innovation team. The development of information news in Taiwan media is still not perfect at present. Although the READr is only a small information newsroom, we still try hard to have an indicative impact on the development of data journalism in Taiwan.

Germany,Proekt,Small,,,2024: A study into repression under Putin,2024-02-22,"Long-form, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Video, Politics, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Python","Russians are often criticised for not opposing the regime. In reality, however, the number of people convicted on political charges during Vladimir Putin’s most recent presidential term alone exceeded the figures recorded in the USSR under Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev. About 116,000 people have been subjected to direct repression in Russia over the past six years. That’s just the tip of the iceberg: if we take into account those who have been punished for disobeying law enforcers and “violating COVID restrictions”, the real scale of repression could actually be many times greater.","While Russia remains isolated it is extremely hard to grasp what happens not only with the political system inside, but also what happens with the society. Our goal is to research the actual numbers of repressions against Russian citizens and put it in a historical context, helping to dismain the image of the successful country and happy people, brought by state propaganda. The report was picked up by the leading world media outlets and widely quoted by watchdogs on Russia.","For our analysis, we used software to compile information from the websites of Russian courts of general jurisdiction, Moscow City Court – all of Moscow’s courts have a separate unified website - and military courts on cases brought for consideration between 2018 and 2023 (during Vladimir Putin’s most recent presidential term) concerning criminal and administrative offences under the following articles. However, our calculations are not exhaustive, and here’s why: 1. The servers of the Russian courts, which are scattered all over the country, are unstable, and it is not always possible to collect data in full.  2. Some of the criminal and administrative offences we analysed – for example, those under CC Art. 319 “Insult of a Law Enforcement Officer”, CAO Art. 6.21.2 on “LGBT propaganda” among minors, as well as some of the CC and CAO articles relating to “foreign agents” – are considered in magistrate courts, which were not included in our analysis. 3. Information on some of the criminal cases is not made public at all, especially when it comes to treason and articles related to terrorism and extremism.","We programmed an elaborate scraper to be able to gather information from different servers of the Russian digital court system (every court has it’s own server, often not standartized). The second big part of the research was to develop a neuronet to sift through the gathered data to receive readable results.","It is possible to build a strong data research even from contaminated data-sources, when data mining is combined with strong journalistic expertise and methods.","Russian, English",https://www.proekt.media/guide/repressii-v-rossii/,https://youtu.be/3mW7KrZsM_Q?si=H01eKSPUsoBtyEJP,https://www.proekt.media/en/guide-en/repressions-in-russia-study/,,"Authors - Kateryna Reznikova, Alexey Korostelev Editors – Mikhail Rubin, Roman Badanin Factchecker – Vitaly Soldatskikh","Proekt is a Russian investigative journalism project known for its in-depth reporting on corruption and political issues.

India,BBC,Big,,,Throw it like Arshad: Pakistan’s trailblazer javelin thrower,2024-08-06,"Explainer, Long-form, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Sports","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","A visual and data piece on Arshad Nadeem, Pakistan’s  javelin thrower which showcases his journey from grassroots to international acclaim.It highlights his record-breaking performances, placing them within the context of global javelin history.The piece includes data-driven visuals that compare his throws to those of leading javelin athletes particularly India’s Neeraj Chopra.It also tracks his  achievements in major competitions like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games.Through this piece we also try to answer what makes Arshad excel—his training, and the factors that contribute to his powerful 90m throws.It also explores the history of javelin, its records, and the science behind javelin throw.","The project had a notable impact by shifting attention towards javelin throw in South Asia, traditionally dominated by cricket. By focusing on Arshad Nadeem’s groundbreaking achievements, it sparked regional pride and curiosity about the sport. The project answered public queries based on google trends about javelin throw through data-driven visuals, enhancing understanding of its science and techniques. This approach made complex concepts accessible to a broader audience, fostering greater interest in athletics. Additionally, by addressing the challenges Nadeem faced, such as equipment affordability, it highlighted social issues, promoting discourse and potentially inspiring other journalists to pursue similar in-depth, innovative storytelling in underrepresented sports. The story has more than 50k pageviews and the engagement was more than a minute.  One remarkable aspect of the project was its timely publication before the main event at the 2024 Olympics. When Arshad Nadeem won the gold medal, it amplified the story’s relevance and reach, allowing it to travel further and engage a broader audience. This serendipitous timing enhanced the story’s impact, aligning perfectly with Nadeem’s triumph and sparking widespread interest in his journey and the sport of javelin throw.","Since javelin is not a widely followed sport among the South Asian diaspora, our goal was to present it in an engaging and accessible manner. We aimed to strike a balance, simplifying concepts without compromising technical accuracy so that both casual readers and sports enthusiasts could appreciate the story.  The data was readily available from _worldathletics.org_, but understanding the science behind javelin throw required extensive research. We analyzed multiple scientific papers, which was time-consuming, to break down complex biomechanics into simplified, visual explanations for a general audience.  Another challenge was sourcing the prices of javelins from different brands. Unlike mainstream sports equipment, this information isn’t easily accessible, so we had to manually review various catalogs to compile accurate pricing data.","We utilized multiple tools and techniques to bring this project to life. Some of the key ones include:  **Google Sheets**: Used to scrape data from WorldAthletics.org, followed by cleaning and analysis to identify key insights. **Flourish**: Leveraged to create interactive visualizations, including javelin records, Arshad Nadeem’s performance trends, and a timeline of his achievements. **Adobe Illustrator & Photosho**p: Designed custom illustrations to explain Arshad’s movement, the science behind javelin throwing, and javelin specifications for better audience understanding. **Shorthand**: Used for visual storytelling, seamlessly integrating data, visuals, and narrative into an engaging, immersive format.","The project ranked on the first page of Google search, proving the importance of headline choices, structured metadata, and keyword optimization. We analyzed the data on Google Trends for the last 6 months and use keywords that will help it to reach more audience. Journalists should consider how audiences search for information and optimize content accordingly.  The average engagement time was over one minute, which is higher than many news stories. This shows that compelling visuals, innovative storytelling techniques, and structured information keep audiences engaged longer.  If the project involved data visualization, comparisons, or historical analysis, this demonstrates how numbers can deepen storytelling and make a piece more shareable.

United States of America,KFF Health News,Big,,,Payback: Tracking the Opioid Settlement Cash,2024-04-02,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Open data, News application, Infographics, Chart, Health","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, R, Svelte, Flourish, Datawrapper","“[Payback: Tracking the Opioid Settlement Cash](https://www.kffhealthnews.org/opioid-settlements)” is a series that provides the most comprehensive account of how state and local governments are spending billions of dollars from companies that fueled the opioid crisis. Our coverage utilized innovative data collection, analysis, and visualization methods, alongside traditional investigative reporting, to uncover how jurisdictions are using — and misusing — the cash. In 2024, we built a first-of-its-kind database cataloguing more than 7,000 expenditures, the only such centralized repository to date. It answered pleas from families devastated by the addiction epidemic for insight into how this windfall, often termed “blood money,” is spent.","The “Payback” series filled crucial gaps in data, prompted policy changes, and improved transparency. It was [cited by](https://kaptur.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/kaptur.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/one-pager_opioid-settlement-accountability-act.pdf) lawmakers who introduced the [Opioid Settlement Accountability Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6956?q=%7B%22search%22:%22opioid+settlement+accountability%22%7D&s=1&r=1) in Congress. It spurred Montana’s settlement council to add regular public comment to meetings and led South Carolina’s council to share [descriptions of funded projects](https://scorf.sc.gov/sites/scorf/files/Documents/DSF%20Awards%202024.pdf). After the team uncovered settlement money buying lasso-like arrest tools for police, California [disallowed such expenditures](https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Documents/CSD/Law-Enforcement-Expenses-with-OSF-Fact-Sheet.pdf).   KFF Health News also cultivated an ecosystem of journalism around the settlements. Dozens of news outlets — from [The Atlanta Journal-Constitution](https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-getting-638-million-as-part-of-opioid-settlement/CN7V6AHN7NCONPHL4YWLUH4JSM/) to [Iron Range Today](https://ironrangetoday.com/2024/07/18/iron-range-rural-st-louis-county-see-opioid-settlement-funds-invested-into-repairing-communities/) in Minnesota — used databases we built as springboards for their reporting. Consultations with our team moved [Mississippi Today](https://mississippitoday.org/2024/08/14/opioid-settlement-dollars-coming-to-mississippi/) and [Bridge Michigan](https://www.bridgemi.com/tags/opioids-michigan) to tackle this topic for the first time. Our reporting inspired [an episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io0yuH1CiA0) of the news comedy show “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,” bringing the information to an even broader audience.  One Ohio woman whose son died because of addiction wrote to us, “You have done more than any state representative or senator or the governor of Ohio to care and to acknowledge and remember not only my son but all the other sons and daughters that parents have lost to this horrible disease.”","The project’s largest obstacle was also its mission: to fill the void of publicly available information about opioid settlements. The money is split among thousands of state and local governments. The federal government is not a party to most settlements and has taken a hands-off approach. No academic entity or nonprofit is collecting data or overseeing this money. As a result, seemingly simple questions, such as how much settlement money has been distributed or who makes spending decisions, became a quagmire.  KFF Health News undertook the reporting needed to answer these questions and created a series of easy-to-use databases for the public. [One such tool](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-payouts-state-county-city-tracker/) showed how much money jurisdictions had received to date and expected through 2038. Another examined opioid settlement councils’ public engagement policies, [illustrating which councils](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-fund-council-meetings-public-comment-closed/) allow public attendance, comment, and access to meeting recordings. The [biggest database](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-funds-detailed-database-state-county-city-spending/) catalogued more than 7,000 decisions jurisdictions made regarding settlement funds. Each entry linked to a source document, providing readers access to hundreds of records, some for the first time.  These datasets have been downloaded more than 400 times, including by individuals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Arizona Legislature, and newsrooms nationwide.","We created three data visualizations to summarize the information in our database cataloging 7,000 opioid settlement expenditures. [Our overview visualization](https://khn-graphics.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2024-opioid-settlement-expenditures/index.html) was a cartogram of treemaps built with Svelte and D3, and containing a Datawrapper table for readers to look up specific numbers. The other two — [an alluvial diagram](https://public.flourish.studio/story/2606124/) and [a treemap filterable by state](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/19820722/) — were built in Flourish.

Our [lookup tool](https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-payouts-state-county-city-tracker/) for finding how much money jurisdictions had received to date and expected through 2038 was built with vanilla JavaScript and fed by data in a Google Sheet using the Google Sheets API. That data was formatted for the tool using R. The underlying data was also made [available to the public for download](https://kffhealthnews.org/download-the-data-opioid-settlement-payouts/) as an Excel spreadsheet.","If it doesn’t exist, build it. When KFF Health News realized no one was comprehensively tracking how communities nationwide were spending billions of dollars in opioid settlements, we decided to take on the task. This required collecting and reviewing thousands of pages of records, building a database from scratch, developing a methodology to classify expenditures, and visualizing it in a manner reasonable for the average person. The investment was worthwhile as we’ve now seen hundreds of people and organizations, ranging from parents whose children died of overdoses to county public health departments and national nonprofits, use our project to gain insight into this windfall meant to stem one of our nation’s greatest public health crises.",English,https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-funds-detailed-database-state-county-city-spending/,https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-payouts-state-county-city-tracker/,https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/state-opioid-settlement-funds-transparency-update/,https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/opioid-settlement-money-controversy-replacement-funds-budget-supplantation-addiction-services/,"Aneri Pattani, Lydia Zuraw, Henry Larweh","Aneri Pattani, senior correspondent for KFF Health News, reports on mental health, substance use, and suicide prevention.

United Kingdom,Climate Home News,Small,,,World Bank climate funding greens African hotels while fishermen sink,2024-04-16,"Investigation, Satellite images, Environment","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, CSV,","Climate Home News carried out a review of the World Bank Group’s climate lending, which revealed one of its agencies supported the purchase and redevelopment of luxury hotels across Africa under the guise of climate action. Run by the Qatar sovereign wealth fund and hospitality giant Accor, the Mauritius-based Kasada Hospitality Fund LP was granted over $250 million in financial support by the World Bank’s little-known Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). MIGA has counted this support as part of its climate efforts for the last three years, according to a review of its annual sustainability reports.","Our findings showed that, despite lofty promises, limited global funding for climate projects – largely fuelled by taxpayers’ money from rich countries – often fails to help those shouldering the burden of warming impacts.  We conducted the first analysis of its type of the World Bank’s private sector climate insurance, which is key (and scarce) for developing countries in Africa to withstand the impacts of climate change.    Our investigation was widely shared and praised, being shortlisted for the European Journalism Centre’s 2024 Climate Awards. The story was also picked up by activists and policymakers. World Bank officials approached our reporters with praise. The story was also referenced in a Green Economy Coalition article, shared by the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers and featured in a webinar hosted by ActionAid International during the World Bank’s Spring Meetings. Since the date of its publication, it has been one of the most viewed articles on our website.    This story would not have come to light without Climate Home’s independent and rigorous reporting, which combined data analysis, use of satellite imagery, a large review of official documents and field reporting in Senegal. It provides a methodological basis for future investigations on the World Bank’s MIGA.","We uncovered this case – and several others - while completing the first ever detailed analysis of the climate finance portfolio of the World Bank’s private sector institutions at a time when they are being asked to play an increasingly prominent role in tackling the climate crisis.      We asked ourselves: what kind of projects are they actually supporting?    We wanted to gain a comprehensive understanding of MIGA’s climate finance portfolio but gathering information was challenging as we found due to a lack of transparency. When we requested the data through an access request, the World Bank group failed to provide the required information, shining a light on the inability to scrutinise how public funds are being spent.   We resorted to using an innovative mixed-methodology and built an entirely new database of projects by manually scraping information from the World Bank’s online portfolio and its sustainability reports.     This allowed us to get visibility in granular detail over MIGA’s climate record. After analysing the portfolio and assessing the impact of individual projects, we decide to spotlight the refurbishment of luxury hotels in Africa as a symbolic example of wide gulf between MIGA’s claims and the reality of its funding.","Our methodology combined data analysis, through building our own database from dozens of World Bank public reports, with other methods like field reporting in Senegal and the use of satellite imagery. Our project sought to bring accountability to a little-scrutinised arm of international climate finance.   MIGA provides little transparency on its work, hiding behind the shroud of commercial confidentiality. We painstakingly pieced together its climate portfolio by analysing annual reports and reading through hundreds of entries on the agency’s database. This gave us an overview of the projects defined as “climate finance”.    After identifying the case in Senegal, our reporter travelled to the country’s south coast, 90km from its capital Dakar, where money earmarked for climate action helped refurbish a 5-star resort. He found a stark contrast with the conditions of the neighbouring fishing community of Mbour, the country’s second-largest fishing port, struggling against rising seas and receiving limited support.    We used satellite imagery to contrast the state of the two beaches. While the resort had received $74m of World Bank investment to protect its beach from the encroaching sea, in the fishing area, the coast is being eaten away by the rising sea level and putting livelihoods at risk.","International climate finance is an intricate space because there are many development organisations involved and working in very different areas. As this story shows, some of these organisations tend to avoid being transparent with their projects, with many of their results hidden in long, technical reports.   Climate finance looks set to become a major point of contention – as shown at last year’s COP29 – as countries will have to agree on a global climate finance roadmap at COP30. More reporters are needed to bring accountability to these international agencies Which play a key role in the implementation of climate projects using vast amount of public money.    This investigation will hopefully serve as a basis on how to approach rejections in FOI requests and how to work around creating your own climate finance database with little resources. As a small newsroom, this project shows that if larger news organisations took on the same effort, we could have a coalition with even larger impact.",English,https://www.climatechangenews.com/2024/04/16/world-bank-climate-funding-greens-african-hotels-while-fishermen-sink/,https://ejc.net/news/announcing-the-fourteen-finalists-of-the-2024-climate-journalism-award,https://icsf.net/newss/world-bank-climate-funding-greens-african-hotels-while-fishermen-sink/,,Reporters:  Matteo Civillini Jack Thompson  Additional reporting: Sebastian Rodriguez  Editors:  Megan Rowling Sebastian Rodriguez Joe Lo  Graphics: Fanis Kollias,"Matteo Civillini is a senior reporter at Climate Home News since 2023 specialising in accountability journalism.

The analysis revealed a striking trend: about 180 counties got their first  wind-power projects in the past decade, but double as many blocked wind projects in the same period. Also, 2023 was the first year to see almost as many counties block new solar projects as the ones adding them. Overall, 15% of counties have enacted bans or restrictions on large-scale wind and solar projects, including in areas with abundant wind and solar potential.","The response to USA TODAY’s reporting on clean energy roadblocks was swift and overwhelmingly positive. Readers praised the clarity and depth of the work, with one calling it “a monumental assignment with overwhelming complexity, clearly and simply explained.” Others highlighted its importance in an era of declining local journalism.  The dataset compiled by Suhail Bhat and Elizabeth Weise quickly gained traction among academics studying obstacles to the nation’s transition away from fossil fuels. Researchers from Princeton, Yale, UC Santa Barbara, the University of Michigan, and UT Austin requested access, leading USA TODAY to make the data publicly available on GitHub.  Industry professionals also recognized the value of the reporting. John Szoka, CEO of the Conservative Energy Network, noted that no existing dataset matched its sophistication. Lauren Bauer of the Brookings Institution requested permission to use the data to map renewable energy bans by county.  Many readers expressed renewed trust in USA TODAY’s journalism, appreciating the balanced presentation of complex issues. One wrote, “I am impressed by the scope and breadth of the article,” while another, who had distanced themselves from national media, called the reporting “profound” and elevated USA TODAY on their list of trusted sources.","Elizabeth Weise researched clean energy restrictions – bans, moratoriums, temporary restrictions, building codes, height limits, sound limits, setback requirements – in every single county in the United States. It was no small feat. Some of the work had begun with efforts by the National Renewable Energy Lab’s work on siting constraints and Columbia University’s Sabine Center for Climate Change Law. Weise spent more than 10 months poring over local government websites, reviewing local news reports and calling county clerks and permit staffers to build a dataset for each state. Through sheer journalistic will, she built the only current, definitive, hand-researched list of county-level green-energy restrictions nationwide, expanding significantly over National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s database that ended in 2021.",* Python to analyze data.  * Web devlopment and 3D modeling to visualize the metholody and findings * Google Sheets * Mapping tools for geospatial analysis * Web Scraping * Quantitative as well as qualitative research methods were used,"This project addresses the information gap caused by fragmented policymaking at the local level. It provides a state-by-state legislative landscape of roadblocks to solar and wind energy. Currently, no database tracks bans or moratoriums on wind and solar installations. Understanding which restrictions effectively constitute a ban can be challenging. Additionally, centralizing data from media reports, local county announcements, town meetings, and academic papers is a labor-intensive process. Furthermore, renewables-related data is scattered across various federal agencies, and identifying relevant datasets while verifying their accuracy can take months.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/02/04/us-counties-ban-renewable-energy-plants/71841063007/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/02/04/solar-power-in-kansas/71920670007/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/02/04/us-renewable-energy-grid-maps-graphics/72042529007/,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/02/04/green-energy-nationwide-bans/71841275007/,"* Elizabeth Weise, national correspondent, USA TODAY, Lead reporter * Suhail Bhat, assistant data editor, USA TODAY, Lead data reporter * Josh Morgan, USA TODAY, photojournalist * Stephen Beard, Ramon Padilla, Carlie Procell, Karina Zaiets and Shawn Sullivan, graphics journalists * Andrea Brunty, Designer and visual journalist * Yoonserk Pyun, data journalist, Worked on a standalone graphics tool * Josh Susong, Senior editor, who led the project","Elizabeth Weise, a USA TODAY national correspondent, covers climate change and energy transition.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,,,"Elon Musk’s transformation, in his own words",2024-11-21,"Investigation, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Politics","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Large language models (in particular ChatGPT 4)","Using a large language model to parse 38,358 of Elon Musk’s posts from December 2013 to November 2024, The Economist’s data team mapped out how his once climate- and clean-energy-focused online presence pivoted toward politics, immigration, and “the woke mind virus.” By harnessing AI to examine such a large dataset, the project offered an unprecedented, data-driven look into Mr Musk’s evolving priorities and showcased the power of LLMs in revealing shifts in influential figures’ rhetoric.","The project provided a new way to look at the political priorities of a notable public figure through their online presence. It clearly introduced its methods and data, and explained how these priorities had shifted in rather dramatic ways.   The piece was published as part of a November 2024 cover package stating that Elon Musk is Donald Trump’s disrupter-in-chief, and warning that the entrepreneur will be let loose on America’s government.  The work shows how data-driven reporting, carefully paired with cutting-edge AI tools, can reveal critical shifts in thinking among those with influence and sharpen society’s understanding of those who wield immense power.  Upon publication, the article was widely read by our standards. The most notable reader was perhaps Mr Musk himself, who reposted its charts several times (though without providing a link), on X, where it was seen by tens of millions. Most popular was a chart showing his posts by date and time. Shortly thereafter, X limited the way the timings of posts were displayed. We won’t say correlation equals causation, but one can wonder.","Social media posts often only make sense in the context of what they reply to or share, and can be highly cryptic–sometimes consisting of just a single word, like “absolutely.” To conduct our analysis, we therefore had to collect not just social media activity of Elon Musk on Twitter/X, but also the posts he had replied to or quoted. We then had to feed them into an AI system in a way that enabled it to gauge their meaning in this context.  Large language models are also extremely inconsistent–for instance, it found hundreds of ways to say immigration (“immigration”, “arrival of foreigners to America”, “immigration policies”, etc.). Grouping topics was therefore a largely manual endeavour.   To ensure our method was accurate, we coded 400 randomly selected posts by hand. For over 90% of posts, the human coder agreed with the LLM system. Where they did not, we found that a third human was about as likely to agree with the human coder as the LLM.","We used R, Python, and the OpenAI API to acquire and process these posts. We used R and Illustrator to visualise them. We wrote in Google Docs and an in-house CMS.","In processing large quantities of text, large language models can be extremely helpful. However, they rely on being provided relevant context, and struggle with consistency if asked to provide an output. We showed a way to overcome these difficulties.",English,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/11/21/elon-musks-transformation-in-his-own-words,,,,"Ainslie Johnstone, Sondre Ulvund Solstad","Ainslie Johnstone joined the newspaper in 2021.

Mexico,Quinto Elemento Lab. EL UNIVERSAL,Small,,,Jueces sin castigo: las fallas de un sistema negligente,2024-09-04,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Politics, Corruption, Money-laundering, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio","Esta investigación revela el fracaso del Poder Judicial de la Federación en México para llevar a la cárcel a los jueces y magistrados que cometieron delitos, como enriquecimiento ilícito y lavado de dinero; y para castigar las faltas disciplinarias, como acoso laboral. Es una radiografía inédita que expone que en 24 años las instancias disciplinarias emitieron 664 sanciones, pero el 90% fueron simples regaños o suspensiones temporales.  Esto permitió que nueve de cada diez juzgadores volvieran a sus cargos sin mayores consecuencias a pesar de que muchos de ellos protegieron con sus fallos a empresarios poderosos o liberaron narcotraficantes.","Se publicó en un contexto político importante en México, donde se debatía la renovación total del poder judicial para que los jueces y magistrados fueran elegidos mediante voto popular. Aunque el trabajo de investigación inició mucho antes de que el entonces presidente López Obrador propusiera una reforma al Poder Judicial, se consideró que era oportuno darse a conocer en esa coyuntura porque los hallazgos del análisis hecho podían resultar pertinentes a la luz de las discusiones que transcurrían en el Congreso de la Unión. Uno de los pilares de la iniciativa que se debatía en ese momento consistía en disolver al CJF, el órgano de vigilancia que fiscaliza esta investigación periodística, y sustituirlo por uno nuevo llamado Tribunal de Disciplina Judicial. El reportaje sirvió como un insumo para que las personas pudieran informarse mejor y tomaran la decisión que consideraran más pertinente, ya que una de las herramientas del trabajo periodístico fue un buscador, donde se podía consultar el nombre del juzgador, la sanción, la falta administrativa y el delito cometido. Los datos contenidos en esta base de datos fue reveladora porque durante más de dos décadas el Poder Judicial guardó en secreto todo lo relacionado a sus procedimientos disciplinarios.","Para esa investigación se realizaron 450 solicitudes de información y se presentaron una veintena de recursos de revisión ante el Instituto de Transparencia (INAI) para lograr la apertura de archivos que habían sido sellados como confidenciales.  También se construyó una base de datos que fue alimentada con las estadísticas de las denuncias y las sanciones aplicadas a los jueces y magistrados.  A la par, se recopilaron los expedientes de investigación administrativa, lo cual no fue una tarea sencilla por el sigilo que envuelve a estos procedimientos. Estos archivos fueron esenciales para conocer la negligencia con la que investiga el CJF, ya que estos contienen las actas de las visitas a los juzgados y las entrevistas con los empleados, los audios o fotos que revelaban alguna ilegalidad, y las declaraciones de los denunciantes. Para documentar la negligencia en materia penal, se hizo un trabajo minucioso de recopilación de expedientes en una veintena de juzgados y tribunales con el objetivo de obtener las sentencias en contra de los juzgadores, los amparos, las declaraciones, los dictámenes periciales, así como las órdenes de detención.","Utilizando R (a través de RStudio) se elaboraron programas para unir distintas bases de datos sobre los procesos sancionatorios a jueces y magistrados federales. Para ello, se estandarizaron los nombres y se concatenaron con fechas y datos de la región (circuito) sobre la que tenían jurisdicción.  Una vez conformada una única base de datos, se realizó un análisis de estadística descriptiva básica para identificar, entre otros datos, a los jueces y magistrados más sancionados, los tipos de sanciones, los hechos sancionados y las fechas.  Asimismo, se elaboró un programa para descargar masivamente las resoluciones de decenas de procesos sancionatorios que originalmente estaban en línea en formato PDF. Las sanciones fueron revisadas manualmente para identificar elementos de interés periodístico y para cerciorarnos de no dar a conocer datos personales o privados.  Finalmente se publicó la base de datos en formato interactivo para que la audiencia puedan consultar si una persona juzgadora a cargo de un proceso judicial que la involucra ha recibido alguna sanción y, en algunos casos, los motivos de esta.","El Poder Judicial Federal es el menos escrutados de los tres poderes de la unión (ejecutivo, legislativo y judicial) por la complejidad y secrecía en la que están envueltos sus fallos. Nadie se había dado a la tarea de darle seguimiento a las quejas y denuncias contra jueces y magistrados (desde que se recibe la queja, se da inicio a la investigación, se recaban pruebas y se emite resolución).  Este reportaje muestra una metodología que pueden replicar otros periodistas para acceder a los procedimientos sancionatorios contra jueces y magistrados en cada uno de los estados del país.  Antes de publicar hubo un debate ético sobre publicitar o no el nombre de los juzgadores. En el tema de las sanciones administrativas dimos a conocer los casos donde había sanción definitiva. En el tema penal, dimos a conocer los nombres de los juzgadores inmersos en un proceso judicial y para ello nos basamos en varios criterios de la Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación que establece que en el caso de servidores públicos de alto mando, pesa más el interés público sobre los actos y decisiones que toman en el ejercicio de su cargo que su derecho a la privacidad.",español,https://quintoelab.org/project/jueces-sin-castigo-las-fallas-de-un-sistema-negligente,https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/periodismo-de-investigacion/jueces-sin-castigo-las-fallas-de-un-sistema-negligente/,https://aristeguinoticias.com/0409/investigaciones-especiales/jueces-sin-castigo-las-fallas-de-un-sistema-negligente-quinto-elemento-lab/,,1.-Zorayda Gallegos. 2.-Efraín Tzuc. 3.-Alejandra Xanic. 4.-Omar Bbbadilla,"1.-Periodista de investigación especializada en temas de justicia, transparencia y corrupción.

De actualización diaria, este mapa permite a los usuarios comparar las temperaturas máximas y mínimas registradas cada jornada con los valores normales, para entender lo que significa la temperatura más allá del dato concreto. Esta herramienta combina datos meteorológicos con una presentación accesible y personalizable, facilitando la comprensión y ayudando a comprender la información.","La publicación del mapa del calor en España de RTVE ha tenido un impacto significativo en la manera en que la audiencia accede y comprende la información meteorológica. La personalización del contenido, con datos a nivel municipal, ofrece información relevante para cada usuario, lo que mejora la comprensión y utilidad de las previsiones meteorológicas.  Otro de los grandes hitos de este proyecto es la colaboración entre los equipos de Datos, Infografía, Desarrollo y Meteorología de RTVE. El desarrollo de esta herramienta ha sido posible gracias a la estrecha colaboración entre todos ellos, una sinergia qe ha permitido trasladar datos científicos científicos rigurosos con una presentación visual atractiva y comprensible para el público general.  La información del mapa se ha utilizao de manera recurrente en los telediarios de TVE, incorporándose como recurso informativo tanto a nivel nacional como en las desconexiones territoriales. Esto ha enriquecido la cobertura informativa de fenómenos relacionados con el calor, proporcionando a los espectadores una visión ampliada y contextualizada de las condiciones climáticas en sus áreas de interés.  Asimismo, la precisión y utilidad de esta herramienta han sido destacadas por profesionales de la meteorología en otros medios de comunicación.","En un contexto de trabajo independiente como es RTVE, donde los equipos habitualmente trabajan por su cuenta, conseguir sumar esfuerzos para sacar adelante un proyecto conjunto es todo un reto. Al margen de las resistencias internas, el mapa del calor ha supuesto una inversión considerable de tiempo, para entender los datos, analizarlos, tomar decisiones sobre su uso y buscar la mejor forma de comunicarlos. En ese proceso, la propuesta inicial tuvo que ir reconfigurándose para ajustarse a los recursos disponibles, manteniendo pese a todo el afán innovador de un proyecto con voluntad de servicio público.","Para recolectar y analizar datos se utilizó el lenguaje de programación R, en particular, el paquete tidyverse. Se usaron los valores climatológicos de AEMET para 947 estaciones meteorológicas de la España peninsular, Baleares y Canarias, así como la observación de los últimos días. Estos datos están disponibles a través del portal AEMET OpenData y la mayor parte de las consultas se han realizado con la librería de R Climaemet.   La curva de la temperatura normal se ha suavizado con una regresión local polinómica ponderada (LOESS) y, para rellenar los huecos de días en los que alguna de las estaciones de referencia no tiene datos, los meteorólogos de El Tiempo de RTVE han designado hasta tres estaciones vecinas que comparten características climatológicas y de altitud similares a las de la original. Hay más detalles sobre las decisiones metodológicas en la misma página.   El mapa utiliza una base de OpenStreetMap sobre la qe se ha incorporado la información. Se han utilizado diferentes librerías de JavaScript, incluida D3 para la creación de algunos gráficos dentro de la pieza.   Para algunos gráficos auxiliares se han utilizado herramientas como Flourish o Datawrapper, aunque la mayor parte de la información se visualiza con desarrollo propio.","Este proyecto es un ejemplo de cómo el periodismo de datos puede ser innovador, útil y relevante cuando se combina con especialización, visualización y diseño centrado en el usuario.   El mapa del calor en España destaca la importancia de la personalización de los datos: en lugar de ofrecer solo datos generales, RTVE permite a los ciudadanos acceder a la información más cercana, aumentando la utilidad y el valor del periodismo de datos.

Czech Republic,Radio Tavisupleba - Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) newsroom in Georgia,Big,,,Georgian Elections Simulator,2024-09-26,"Quiz/game, News application, Chart, Elections, Politics","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","The Election Simulator was created for Georgia’s October 2024 elections to help audiences navigate the new proportional voting system with a 5% threshold. The interactive and gamified experience allowed users to input their election predictions and voter turnout. They could then see how votes translated into seats in the 150-member parliament.   The simulator also allowed users to form potential coalitions before and after the elections based on their predictions and the final results. By making complex electoral mechanics more accessible, the project empowered voters with a deeper understanding of the process, encouraging informed participation in the elections.","With Georgia’s population at approximately 3.8 million and its primary language spoken mainly within the country, the project had both quantitative and qualitative impacts. It attracted 40,000 unique visitors with 75,000 page views; the average time spent was over 1 minute and 30 seconds.   Beyond the numbers, the simulator encouraged public engagement, as users actively shared their predictions and election scenarios on social media, sparking discussions.  The project gained recognition from multiple media outlets, was featured in election-related broadcasts and podcasts, and became a topic of discussion among journalists and political analysts. Additionally, Georgia’s electoral committee was directly involved in verifying the calculations. They praised the project for its accuracy and for being a valuable tool to help citizens understand the new electoral system.","Since 2012, Georgia has been effectively ruled by the country’s sole billionaire, Bidzina Ivanishvili, through the Georgian Dream party, which he founded. Political scientists describe this governance as a case of state capture, where all key institutions of power are concentrated in the hands of one man and one party, without proper checks and balances.  The October 2024 parliamentary elections were expected to be a turning point, with over 200,000 new young voters in a country of 3.8 million. In response to mass protests, the electoral system shifted from a mixed system to a proportional one. However, this reform was bundled with other amendments and never properly explained to the public.   Social listening revealed widespread confusion, as voters struggled to understand how their participation would influence the outcome under the new system. To address this, we developed the ”Election Simulator”—an interactive tool that provided voters with a clear, accessible way to see how their votes would shape election results, potential coalitions, and overall participation impact. By bridging the gap between complex electoral rules and public understanding, it empowers citizens with data-informed insights.","The simulator is a responsive web application built with Svelte 4 and D3, designed to help users perform two tasks: 1. Simulate the party distribution in the Georgian Parliament using a seat calculation algorithm. 2. Simulate coalition formations to achieve simple or super majorities using a coalition checker.  **Algorithm** The seat allocation algorithm follows the election commission’s framework.   If the total allocated vote percentage (including sub-5% parties) is less than 100%, seats are allocated based on the percentage—e.g., 10% of the vote = 15 seats in the 150-seats Parliament.  Once the total vote percentage reaches 100%, the algorithm proceeds as follows: 1. Remove parties under 5% and those in the ”Other” category. 2. Calculate the initial seats as the floored share of the vote percentage. 3. If the total number of seats obtained by political parties was less than 150, the undistributed seats were awarded to the parties with better results, based on their vote percentages in descending order. In the case of a tie, the seat was given to the party with the earlier registration date.  **Sharing** User-built parliaments and coalitions can be easily shared. The simulator allows users to save and share their configurations via URL parameters.","The Election Simulator demonstrates how gamification can be a powerful tool for journalism, making complex topics more accessible and engaging, especially for younger audiences. Traditional news formats often struggle to capture their attention, but interactive tools can turn civic education into a participatory experience.    A key takeaway for journalists is the importance of audience research and data. Social listening revealed widespread confusion about the new electoral system, which shaped the development of the simulator. Journalists can apply similar techniques to identify knowledge gaps in their communities and create tailored content and products that directly address those needs.  The project’s success came from starting with the needs of the audience. Instead of creating something shiny for its own sake, we focused on helping voters navigate the new system. This user-first approach ensured the tool was both practical and impactful, driving engagement and discussion.   The project’s outcome was a combination of journalistic storytelling with technology and data visualization, something that news organizations can apply beyond elections. By blending interactivity with credible reporting, journalists can not only inform but also empower audiences to engage more deeply with issues that affect their lives.",Georgian,https://www.radiotavisupleba.ge/a/archevnebi2024/33134642.html,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MPp8uRFfEdxnRolrMbDBSeih9RX8cAwJ/view?usp=sharing,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAi_Hf-qP78/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DBRZgLpP_HD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link,"Natia Zambakhidze, Radio Tavisupleba Director   Carla Pedret, Director, RFE/RL News Products   Nino Japiashvili, Radio Tavisupleba Managing Editor   Saba Chikhladze, RFE/RL Product Manager for Engagement and Loyalty Strategies   Davit Chumburidze, Radio Tavisupleba Social Media Editor   Gela Bochikashvili, Radio Tavisupleba Features Writer   Lars Verspohl, Data Visualisation Engineer",Roles indicated in the previous question.

Malaysia,Malaysiakini,Small,,,How much pension can MPs receive?,2024-06-19,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Politics, Economy","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Using open data and further verifications, this project estimates the amount of pension sitting members of parliament can get when they retire.   The data is then presented in a multimedia and interactive format, allowing users to search for their own MPs and see how much of their tax funds will be used to pay these elected representatives, who only need to serve for a term to qualify for lifelong pension.   The project was conceptualised following the government’s proposal to change the civil service pension scheme to a superannuation scheme, to alleviate the fiscal bill.","The project received extensive engagement from the audience. It received 517,387 page views within a month, making it the most read project by the Kini News Lab team.  The survey ran following publication received some 13,000 votes and 8000-plus responses - more than double of similar surveys ran by Malaysiakini.  Estimating the amounts was a challenge due to lack of transparency in how the legislation is interpreted and the formula used. We had to speak to multiple former and current MPs and ministers, the Public Services Department, Parliament officers etc, to truly figure out how it is counted.   The leg work was worth it. For the first time, taxpayers were able to see how much of their money is used to pay politicians, and how this compares to civil servants, prompting robust public discourse involving key opinion leaders.  In response to the reporting, various MPs took a public stand that they would be willing to give up their multiple pensions, or opt for a superannuation fund like proposed for civil servants.  The team was also invited to speak on the project on two prime time radio shows. We were also invited to speak on the subject on a television show.","Pension amounts received vary per MP depending on whether they have also served at state level, the different states they have served, if they had also served in the executive, and whether they have done so at federal or state level. To complicate matters, each state has its own legislation which governs how much pension an elected representative and executive member can enjoy and the condition for its disbursement. Federal legislation also differs.   Not all the state legislations are available publicly online. We were only able to access these legislations through a subscription only legal database - a costly affair.   The next challenge was verifying if our interpretation of the legalese and in turn the formula for calculating the pension amounts.  To do so, we sought help from Public Services Department, which manages federal pensions, but the department was not forthcoming.   We also tried the Parliament administration, and the Opposition Leader’s Office but this was not helpful either.   Finally, we reached out to multiple former MPs, ministers and assemblypersons, to see if whether our estimate of their pensions were correct.   This was also challenging because not many were willing to share this information, which they deemed private.","We used open source investigation techniques, but using publicly-available resources as much as possible. This was coupled with standard shoe leather journalism, employed for verification.   The data was presented in simple searchable tables, while we used infographics to communicate the complex calculations.   The infographics were also used to make direct comparisons to a civil servant’s pension, to break down the complex issue into something more relatable to the audience.","1.  Something that is already out there and public may not be accessible at all. Often it can be obsufucated by complicated language or jargon, making it difficult to understand on its own, let alone in the larger context.   By breaking the complex into something easily accessible to the wider public, data journalistm plays a role towards bringing greater transparency and in this sense, contribute towards greater accountability in democracy.   2. There are multiple ways to verify information. Official sources aren’t always helpful, it doesn’t mean someone else won’t be able to verify the data for you.   3. It is useful to make friends with sources who may have access to expensive databases. (In this case, we accessed the expensive legal database it was through academic sources)  4.

Egypt,"Pulitzer Centre, Muwatin Media Network",Small,,,The Cost of Freshwater in the Arabian Gulf,2024-12-25,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border, Environment","Scraping, QGIS, Canvas, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","This four-part data-driven investigation examines the growing reliance on desalination in the GCC to address water scarcity. While desalination has ensured water security, the project analyzes its environmental consequences through satellite imagery, government records, and scientific data—particularly the impact of brine discharge on marine ecosystems and fishing communities in the Arabian Gulf. Using historical datasets, the investigation traces the evolution of desalination, identifies key beneficiaries, quantifies its financial and ecological costs, and evaluates data-backed solutions to mitigate the crisis. Through data visualizations and expert analysis, the project offers a comprehensive look at the future of water sustainability in the region.","This investigation played a role in sparking public and political debates about the environmental costs of desalination in the Arabian Gulf. By presenting hard data on brine discharge, rising salinity levels, and marine biodiversity loss, the project contributed to discussions on sustainable water management in the region.  The findings gained attention at the Ministry of Climate Change in Qatar, where researchers used the investigation to engage with the government on addressing the brine crisis. The series was widely shared among environmental organizations, academics, and policymakers, leading to increased social media engagement and coverage by other media outlets. It also inspired journalists across the Middle East and North Africa to pursue similar data-driven investigations on water scarcity and climate change.  Beyond policy discussions, the project had a tangible impact on local communities, particularly fishing communities affected by desalination, amplifying their voices in environmental discourse. Environmental activists and researchers cited the findings in conservation discussions, and the investigation was referenced in regional policy forums.  More than just raising awareness, the project reinforced the value of data journalism in the Middle East, underscoring the urgent need for open data and evidence-based policymaking to tackle the region’s escalating water crisis.","Investigating environmental issues in the Gulf region presents significant challenges due to its restrictive political landscape. As an Arab and Egyptian journalist, reporting on desalination and its environmental consequences in a region known for its tight media control and reputation management was particularly risky.  Access to reliable data was one of the biggest obstacles. Gulf governments do not transparently share environmental statistics, and much of the available information is either outdated, inaccessible, or designed to portray an idealized narrative. Official sources often downplay the ecological damage caused by desalination, making independent verification crucial but difficult.  Fieldwork also posed serious risks. While conducting on-the-ground reporting, our team faced intense scrutiny, pressure from authorities, and even the confiscation of equipment. These challenges underscored the difficulty of investigating environmental crimes in a region where economic and political interests take precedence over transparency.  Despite these barriers, the project leveraged innovative data collection methods, including satellite imagery analysis, scientific modeling, and testimonies from impacted communities, to uncover the hidden costs of desalination. The investigation not only highlights the environmental crisis but also serves as a testament to the resilience and necessity of independent, data-driven journalism in restrictive environments.","1) Open-Source Data & Global Water Intelligence: We analyzed reports from Global Water Intelligence and other open datasets to assess desalination capacity, water consumption trends, and environmental impact. 2) Excel & Spreadsheets: Data was structured, cleaned, and analyzed using Excel and spreadsheets, allowing us to quantify salinity increases, brine discharge levels, and their effects on marine ecosystems. 3) QGIS & GIS Mapping: QGIS, an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS), was used to visualize desalination plant locations, track environmental changes, and overlay spatial data on water stress, marine biodiversity loss, and industrial pollution. 4) Satellite Imagery & Remote Sensing: We leveraged satellite data to monitor brine discharge patterns and detect shifts in water quality, helping to illustrate the environmental toll of desalination. 5) Flourish & Datawrapper: To communicate findings effectively, we used Flourish and Datawrapper for interactive charts, maps, and visualizations, making complex environmental data more accessible. 6) On-the-Ground Reporting & Interviews: Despite restrictions, we conducted fieldwork to document the lived experiences of fishing communities affected by desalination, incorporating their testimonies into the investigation.","Every Story Can Be Told with Data: Even in data-scarce environments, there are always ways to find or generate data. Open-source datasets, scientific research, satellite imagery, and geospatial tools can help uncover hidden truths.  Data is Essential for Environmental and Climate Reporting: Climate and environmental issues are best understood through data-driven storytelling. Using quantifiable evidence makes the story more impactful, credible, and difficult to ignore.  Teamwork is Key: A successful investigation requires collaboration, where each team member understands their role—whether it’s data analysis, visualization, reporting, or storytelling. A well-structured team ensures efficiency and depth in the investigation.  Ask Questions, Stay Curious: Never hesitate to question official narratives or seek out alternative sources, but always do your homework. Thorough research, persistence, and a commitment to accuracy will strengthen your reporting.",Arabic and English,https://muwatin.net/53293/GCC/en/,https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/cost-freshwater-arabian-gulf,,,Investigation: Eman Mounir Illustrations: Sahar Eissa,"Eman Mounir is an Egyptian independent data and investigative journalist, mentor, and trainer specializing in climate and environmental issues in the MENA region.

Nigeria,HumAngle,Small,,,The Internet Fundraising Marathons Behind IPOB’s Armed Struggle in Nigeria,2024-10-25,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Crime, Human rights, Terrorism","Scraping, Google Sheets, Python","The project collected and analysed data about fundraising activities fuelling acts of terrorism in Nigeria by a group called the Biafra Republic Government in Exile. Relying on publicly available data from social media platforms and those gathered by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) project, the report established -- for the first time -- that rising violence in Nigeria’s South East could be directly linked to a crowdfunding campaign by diasporans, who are arming militia forces on the ground. The report also highlighted the impact of this campaign on the lives of ordinary people and security agents in the country.","Simon Ekpa is the leader of the Biafra Republic Government in Exile (BRGIE), a faction of the separatist movement inciting violence in Nigeria. He is a citizen of Finland and has lived there for many years, engaging in local politics and running a business. Despite his violent and hateful rhetoric on social media since at least August 2021, he remained a free man in Finland. When he was briefly arrested in February 2023, it was for a ‘suspected money collection’ [offence](https://poliisi.fi/-/krp-tutkii-epailtya-rahankeraysrikosta-operaatio-lahdessa-liittyi-esitutkintaan?languageId=en_US) because a rival faction had accused him of fraudulently extracting money from their members. The issues of hateful and inciteful speech were not priorities. However, roughly a month after my report was published, Ekpa was [arrested again](https://yle.fi/a/74-20126210), and this time around, he was detained ‘on probable cause for incitement to commit crimes with terrorist intent’ and terrorism financing alongside other members of his group. He has remained in detention at the Kylmäkoski prison since then, his assets have been [frozen](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/ssouth-east/761388-more-troubles-for-simon-ekpa-as-finnish-govt-freezes-his-assets.html), and he is set to face trial in May 2025. This development has significantly [weakened](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/766886-simon-ekpas-arrest-reducing-tension-in-south-east-cds.html) the BRGIE and its ability to continue to incite violence in Nigeria.","The topic of insurgency in southeastern Nigeria is a sensitive and grossly underreported one. Journalists, especially those from the affected region, are afraid of reporting the crisis. Residents are also afraid of speaking out, lest they are labelled as ‘saboteurs’ by the violent separatists and attacked. I faced these challenges when I travelled down to Owerri, one of the hotspots. The police refused to grant my request to interview their officers, and it took a lot of convincing to get people to talk to me.  Initially, it was very difficult to get information about the group’s internal operations. However, the faction led by Simon Ekpa since 2021 became very unabashed and did not mind sharing certain kinds of information publicly. They must have thought live-streaming the fundraising meetings would attract more donors and sympathisers. But it meant the data was just there for grabs for researchers like me willing to do the grunt work.   After the report was published, I made a tweet to share it, which was viewed 1.6 million times. Simon Ekpa responded to the tweet, calling me a ‘Yoruba Afonja man’ (an ethnic slur) and saying I’m part of a group of cannibals and ritualists.","I used social media search engines to narrow down the information I was looking for, downloaded dozens of live-streamed videos of the Zoom meetings held by the group, extracted the data I needed, and then analysed this using Google Spreadsheet.  I listened in on six of those meetings held in June 2024 (which was nearly 20 hours of material) and tabulated the announcements of money raised by members of the separatist group across the world -- documenting other important information as well. I also scraped tons of data from the Twitter/X account of the armed group’s leader, Simon Ekpa, using Python -- as well as other kinds of data from platforms like Telegram. Using statistics filtered from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), I was able to show a correlation between the fundraising activities and acts of violence in that region of the country. I then visualised my findings using interactive infographic templates available on Flourish.","Sometimes, the data for a groundbreaking report is not hidden away in some secret place.

United States of America,"The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK), Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet)",Big,,,Passport detection tool (machine learning),2024-10-25,Multiple-newsroom collaboration,"CSV, Python","ICIJ collaborated with a team of machine learning scientists at Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet) and the public broadcaster Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK) in Norway to develop and refine a machine-learning tool that detects passports out of hundreds of thousands of images and retrieves information to deliver leads for ICIJ reporters and media partners. The tool classifies and detects passport images found inside documents shared with ICIJ. Key information (name, country) found inside the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) is automatically extracted. Then, ICIJ’s data team fact-checks the model results and marks (tags) the documents in [Datashare](https://datashare.icij.org/) where users (reporters) can retrieve them.","Passports are among the key documents journalists use for identifying end clients of offshore services providers during investigative projects involving massive data leaks like the Pandora Papers. They’re critical for fact-checking company ownership. Providing a list of countries and/or client names at the start of projects for journalists to find leads not only saves time, it supports collaborations and feeds data-driven investigations and visualizations.  Previously, detecting passports wasn’t easy. Journalists searched in [Datashare](https://datashare.icij.org/), our open-source search engine for investigation documents, using terms commonly found inside passports. This method was both cumbersome and unreliable as passport scans variable quality is highly challenging for Datashare’s OCR text extraction, lowering the number of search matches.  To streamline the process, ICIJ has released, deployed and open-sourced a [passport detection service](https://github.com/ICIJ/passport-service/) which can process up to 500 pages per minute. We estimate that the tool can recover 100% of passport pages found inside documents with a precision of 86%. So far ICIJ has run the tool to classify hundreds of thousands of images extracted from Datashare documents. After fact-checking by the data team, prediction results are shared with ICIJ reporters by tagging documents containing passports in Datashare, allowing an immediate retrieval.","Using Machine Learning in a small newsroom can be daunting. The ICIJ newsroom remains small.  ICIJ’s collaboration with OsloMet and NRK has been successful because we understood our common goal from the outset. To keep the project manageable, ICIJ and the data scientists identified a type of document that was of clear use to the reporters: passports.  The passport service is an innovative resource that reporters can now use to access all passports identified by the tool in a specific corpus.   Identifying passports poses a challenging task as these documents can take different shapes and layouts since they can come from all over the world and date back more than 70 years. Some passports are simple pieces of paper with handwritten details, making them nearly indistinguishable from other identification documents like identity cards and badges. This diversity complicates both automated recognition and manual review, making the process time-consuming and labor-intensive.   ICIJ has become known for its massive collaboration projects gathering hundreds of journalists across the world to review millions of documents, such as the Panama Papers and the Pandora Papers. ICIJ wants to continue developing partnerships with researchers at universities to leverage their expertise for collaborative investigative journalism.","A team made of machine learning researchers at Oslo Metropolitan University and NRK created a dataset containing passport images based on data we provided . They then trained the [YOLO](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/yolo-object-detection) open-source object detection model on this dataset to specifically detect passport pages inside documents. MRZ information was then read using a custom and optimized version of [PassportEye](https://github.com/konstantint/PassportEye).   ICIJ stored the data on its own servers to maintain security and confidentiality and shared a training corpus for the researchers to access and train the model. The OsloMet/NRK team and ICIJ had regular calls to go over the classification and detection results, and many iterations were necessary to reach the desired detection performances. After the research code was shipped, it was refactored by ICIJ’s tech team and turned into a production-grade service integrated in ICIJ’s IT ecosystem. The service code was then [open-sourced](https://github.com/ICIJ/passport-service) and made available (model excepted). When the tool is run on new sets of documents, the data team reviews each prediction using [Prophecies](https://icij.gitbook.io/prophecies), ICIJ’s open-source fact-checking tool to assess if each image is indeed a passport, and if the country (if assigned) has been correctly detected and if not, adds the missing country (if available/discernable).","Using AI in a newsroom can be costly. ICIJ was able to leverage existing tools and collaborate with university researchers to develop/create a machine learning tool that helps to support reporters’ research. This is a tangible result of a collaboration between the media and a university. ICIJ plans to maintain this successful collaboration over time and explores new potential academic collaborations. There was a clear division of tasks where OsloMet and NRK researchers trained models, reviewed the results of the passport classification and country detection processes, and ICIJ provided the data and feedback as well as specified the tool features for an optimal integration into its existing tools and workflows. Throughout the project, ICIJ evaluated the results and vetted the data for journalistic integrity based on its previous experience of dealing with terabytes of leaked data.    When working with ML algorithms, providing datasets which can accurately represent the diversity of documents we see on a daily basis is a real challenge. Creating such datasets proved to be key in the success in our collaboration with researchers.",English,https://github.com/ICIJ/passport-service,https://icij.gitbook.io/prophecies,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Du0hxD5KChfo8rVueLD-3rvBTavcHOvU/view?usp=sharing,,"Marina Fridman, Nuno Loureiro, Gabriela Fioreze, Roy Thowsen Krøvel, Pierre Romera, Clément Doumouro, Javier Ladrón de Guevara, Miguel Fiandor Gutiérrez, Jelena Cosic, Agustin Armendariz, Jesús Escudero, Denise Ajiri, Karrie Kehoe, Delphine Reuter, Emilia Díaz-Struck.","Marina Fridman is a Datajournalist at NRK.

The series reveals how Western oil companies ignored bribery risks and massive cost overruns to secure their stake in the CPC only to be sidelined by the Kremlin. It demonstrates how Western companies and misguided foreign policy combined to foster kleptocracy, environmental harm and geopolitical risks. And it lays out how Vladimir Putin used CPC as a weapon in a long-standing and troubling rivalry with the West.","Caspian Cabals is a clear-eyed case study of the lengths to which some U.S. oil companies and their allies were willing to go to thwart greater transparency and to avoid closer scrutiny of their relationships with autocrats and kleptocrats. Big Oil and its lobbyists fought tooth and nail to dilute U.S. regulations on payment transparency. It also illustrates unintended consequences of governments’ attempts to bring democracy to post Soviet states–policies that led to Western oil companies paying Russian contractors that helped finance Putin’s Palace, the Black Sea mansion highlighted by the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.  Caspian Cabals spans decades’ worth of corruption and wrongdoing, from a single allegation of corruption to an entire village — made sick because of oil fumes and poisoned water — literally moved away from its home. Villagers — some of them children experiencing fainting spells and memory loss — were forced to resume their lives in new places. As one villager told our reporter, “We had everything,” recalling the richness of a life of peace. “Then we became no one.”","Caspian Cabals began when a lawyer informed us that he represented a whistleblower who claimed that Western oil companies were helping to fund Russia’s war in Ukraine through taxes on oil revenue, and through bribes. The alleged bribes would contravene the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — and, we were told, the U.S. government had failed to act on his complaint. We set out to investigate and soon discovered that what had initially appeared to be a simple story of corruption was infinitely more complex.  ICIJ worked for almost two years with a team of investigative reporters in the U.S., Europe, Kazakhstan and Russia to find evidence of how much profit the governments were making from the 939-mile CPC pipeline and the oil fields. The details were scattered across tens of thousands of pages of confidential emails, company presentations and other oil industry records, Kazakh audits, obscure Russian court documents, inspection reports and regulatory filings. Finding reliable and consistent data across years was just one of a series of endless challenges.  Ultimately, Caspian Cabals is the story of Western oil executives’ pursuit of everything, which brought its own dire consequences.","For this project we relied heavily on [machine learning translation tools](https://github.com/ICIJ/es-translator) to advance the reporting. Many documents were in Russian, Kazakh, Dutch and even Italian. The documents that needed to be shared with the journalists who joined the collaboration were indexed and OCRed in Datashare, ICIJ’s open source document research platform. Similarly ICIJ’s collaborative model and accumulated corpus of leaked documents from previous projects were essential in helping to verify whistleblower statements. Journalists posted their findings on iHub, ICIJ’s secure forum and messaging platform.   We collected audits of companies from the [Kazakhstan Ministry of Finance](https://opi.dfo.kz/p/en/dfo-search/opi-search) using Google Translate to craft search terms and a browser extension for translation. [Russian](https://kad.arbitr.ru/) and [Kazakh](https://office.sud.kz/) court cases, usually arbitration agreements, were very useful in finding companies that benefited from pipeline-related work.  ICIJ’s data team gathered corporate filings, land records in Spain, Germany, Czechia and the UK, and searched online databases to map how hundreds of companies in secrecy jurisdictions fit into kleptocratic business structures. The research and fact-checking was done in Google Sheets.  In a world where the powerful can hide behind business structures shielded from public scrutiny, working together and sharing information is essential in any attempt to hold power to account.","We believe that Caspian Cabals is a remarkable show of what journalists can do as a team in multiple time zones, multiple countries, with colleagues speaking multiple languages. The need for constant communication wasn’t just essential, but the communications themselves—in meetings, in emails, conversations on the phone—had to be so clear so that everyone was on the same page. And everyone had to understand their role in a project that was constantly evolving.  We were writing about people who didn’t want to be written about, people who wouldn’t speak to us. We were writing about people who had fears for their safety. In addition to those challenges, there were language barriers–translating Russian and Kazakh documents for example, or touring through villages in Kazakhstan. We faced instances of intimidation during our on-the-ground reporting.  Ultimately, we were writing about the strings being pulled by Vladimir Putin, and given the international threat he and his government pose, that’s one of the biggest challenges any collection of journalists in the world can face.  We were telling multiple stories while piecing together one huge and important story about corruption and geopolitical threats. And teamwork was what allowed us to achieve that.",English,https://www.icij.org/investigations/caspian-cabals/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/caspian-cabals/kulibayev-nazarbayev-european-properties/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/caspian-cabals/timur-kulibayev-nazarbayev-kazakhstan-oil-riches/,,"ICIJ staff, with the BBC, OCCRP-CIReN, De Tijd, Der Spiegel, Der Standard, DW Turkey, El País, Follow The Money, ICIJ, Indian Express, IStories, Knack, L’Espresso, La Sexta, Mother Jones, NRC, OCCRP, Oštro, Paper Trail Media, Proekt, Profil, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Reporter.lu, Reporters United, Shomrim, Tamedia, Vlast.kz","The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists tells stories that punch through the noise, showing how the world really works, triggering positive change.

They play a role across many transformational dynamics and touch fundamental aspects of our investigative work, such as the construction of truth and trust. Yet, the inner workings of these systems are opaque and often kept secret.   AI is regarded as a transformational technology and even sits at the core of tech oligarchies’ ongoing state captures. But whether this technology works — when, how, and for whom — is something we can only believe. Decades of reporting have shown that algorithmic systems often don’t work as advertised.  Journalists have had a hard time reporting on AI since its explosion in popularity a few years back. One problem is that the stated claims made by AI companies are difficult to verify with non-deterministic systems. As journalists, we have to find ways to dig deeper into these systems that affect the lives of millions already and be able to weigh these claims on our own terms.","A dataset of 5.8 billion images is incredibly large. The metadata alone takes up almost 1 TB of disk space. To run the analyses, we had to develop custom software to process these large amounts of data. Our custom software can be divided into two groups: tools to analyze the dataset and tools to examine the dataset.   For the former, we kept the model simple and relied on batch processing. A separate software process yielded a dataset with the answers for every question we formulated. Some of those processes ran for weeks because we lacked the infrastructure to speed them up.  For the latter, we built a tool called see:set, a search-driven UI that allowed us to examine the dataset’s images and captions. Since we lacked the resources to load the full 5.8 billion image and text pairs into the UI, we examined only samples of the entire dataset based on each question we formulated during the investigation.","Dataset investigations can serve as fundamental methods to hold AI models and the broader AI field accountable. We commonly think of AI as a black box. But, when we look at the datasets used to train these incredibly complex machines, we can uncover the models underneath them and learn about the emerging effects of AI, essentially enabling us to unravel the black box. While models are non-deterministic and unexplainable, the datasets used to train them are not – their datasets shape them.  Dataset investigations allow us to name biases in models and structural biases in the ecosystem. They highlight the processes of constructing datasets and show the social entanglements of the field behind those processes. This will require new tools and methods.",German,https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/laion-5b-so-entsteht-das-weltbild-einer-kuenstlichen-intelligenz-a-dea0157b-d364-4622-8d77-3a1cb6c4afd1,https://knowingmachines.org/models-all-the-way,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qw7sfjAUS5MspuEiXAvb5POw9ytnrziL/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=101966639374568988838&rtpof=true&sd=true,https://github.com/NYUEngelberg/models-all-the-way,"Patrick Beuth, Christo Buschek, Max Heber, Marcel Rosenbach and Hakan Tanriverdi","Patrick Beuth, since January 2018, reporter at SPIEGEL in the business/network world department, and team leader since November 2023.

The bulking population has not been accompanied by  the development of housing and other important accompanying infrastructure","The story will have significant implications for the city (and country’s housing policy going forward.  The data-driven insights could push policymakers to revisit urban planning strategies, possibly considering densification and affordable housing projects. The article will also serve as a catalyst for conversations among urban planners, government officials, and residents. And it reinforces the need for sustainable housing solutions beyond short-term political fixes.","The biggest issue with data journalism in Zimbabwe is that data is not often readily available or sometimes at all, due to limited data collection systems. In other cases, institutions may fail to provide requested data to protect their interests. This then necessitates dependency on external data sources, which may not be adequately granular.

Thailand,"Mekong Eye,Initium Media,The Straits Times,DVB Myanmar,Tia Sang,Prachatai",Small,,,"Cattle hustle, Mekong Eye",2024-12-02,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Environment, Corruption, Health","Canvas, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Data Wrapper, Flourish","This collaborative investigation leverages data analysis and visualization to uncover the hidden networks of live cattle smuggling within the bustling border trade of the Mekong region. By tracing the illicit flow of livestock from origin to consumer, the project exposes public health risks and threats to the integrity of the meat supply chain.   Our story was co-published in multiple languages—English, Burmese, Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese—across platforms such as Mekong Eye, Initium Media, The Straits Times, DVB Myanmar, Tia Sang, and Prachatai. This data-driven storytelling approach brings critical regional issues to light and strengthens cross-border collaboration among local journalists.","This investigation addressed a critical knowledge gap on live animal smuggling, earning praise from regional and local public health experts for its clear explanation of the health risks, especially food safety concerns for consumers. Despite being produced with limited financial resources, the story was recognized by local data journalism communities for effectively bridging the gap between academic research, data analysis, and human-centric storytelling, making complex issues accessible and relatable.  Beyond its public impact, the project also fostered collaboration among journalists in the Mekong region. The editorial team provided mentorship and support to local journalists involved in the project, encouraging them to embrace data journalism and collaborative investigative approaches. They shared positive feedback in experiencing firsthand the power of these methods in uncovering complex and transboundary issues. Inspired by this project, they are now motivated to pursue similar investigations in the future.  The story on Mekong Eye alone reached over 73,000 users on social media and attracted around 5,000 website visits, an impressive figure for a niche media outlet. Combined with analytics from our publishing partners, the full story package reached at least 117,000 users on social media and an additional 12,000 users via websites, amplifying awareness of this pressing issue.","Cattle smuggling is a century-old practice that threatens public health and the whole meat supply chain. However, it remains underreported in the Mekong region due to a lack of comprehensive data on animal movement, as much of this trade operates in the black market and is tied to corruption. Smuggling routes often pass through remote areas controlled by influential groups, making access difficult. Limited press freedom in authoritarian-leaning countries also poses risks to journalists investigating this issue.  To uncover the hidden dynamics of the illegal cattle trade, our team spent over six months investigating the issue with a One Health approach, using data analysis to identify trade routes and quantify smuggling and its health risks. Data journalism allowed us to pursue this story despite political challenges, particularly in Myanmar, where smuggling routes cross active war zones.  With limited newsroom resources, we adopted a collaborative journalism approach, recruiting local journalists from multiple newsrooms. The team included reporters covering Myanmar’s conflict zones, journalists in Vietnam and Laos facing government repression, and reporters in Thailand investigating politically sensitive ties to smuggling. This cross-border investigation aims to shed light on cattle’s zoonotic diseases, which are often overlooked as attention tends to focus on influenza.","With a limited budget, we relied on cost-effective tools like Google Sheets for data analysis and Datawrapper and Flourish for visualization. Our investigation focused on four key aspects:  1.Trade routes & corruption We identified smuggling routes by analyzing reports from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), regional livestock departments, and field interviews. This exposed the trade route and corruption within border agencies and local authorities enabling illegal trade.  2.Scale of smuggling By cross-referencing studies from the Torino World Affairs Institute, the University of Queensland, and local news reports, we estimated the scale of illicit trade. Interviews with traders and transport workers revealed how bribes and unofficial fees facilitated smuggling.  3.Economic and political incentives We used data from the UN Comtrade and local trade reports on the volume of cattle trade to analyze its value and disruption during the pandemic and the war. Beef consumption data from OECD and FAO highlighted supply-demand imbalances exploited by corrupt networks.  4.Public health risks We analyzed cattle disease data from the World Animal Health Information System, examining trends in disease spread and its correlation to illegal smuggling activities. We examined government budget records, which revealed underfunding in surveillance and vaccination.","This project offers two key lessons for journalists, especially those working with limited financial and human resources.   1. Despite constraints, data journalism can be effectively applied in collaborative investigations to create comprehensive stories that explain complex issues—even in regions with restricted press freedom. While high-quality, interactive visualizations require more resources, journalists can still uncover important stories using affordable or free tools rather than avoiding them due to perceived limitations.  2. Beyond the investigation itself, this project was part of our editorial mission to empower local journalists, fostering cooperation in an increasingly fragmented media landscape. It equipped reporters with skills in cross-border reporting and data journalism, proving that impactful investigative stories are achievable through collaboration. We took this approach as we were aware that many local journalists lacked confidence in their ability to produce large-scale, data-driven investigations. However, this project demonstrated that a structured, collaborative approach can be both effective and inspiring. This model can serve as a starting point for local newsrooms looking to undertake impactful cross-border investigations, even with limited resources.","English, Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese",https://www.mekongeye.com/2024/12/06/cattle-hustle,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MNTEj2_l9i2feic64wFIgBlp6fylosUN?usp=sharing,,,"Kannikar Petchkaew,Gebu,Konlaphat Siri,Aung Myo Htut,Vũ Thanh, Nattakit Meesakul,Chris Trinh,Paritta Wangkiat,Trang Bui,Alan Parkhouse,Tan Hui Yee, Jayalakshmi Shreedhar,Michael Salzwedel, Rosmy Sophia","Mekong Eye is an environmental and climate news platform led by a team of local journalists and editors, dedicated to amplifying local reporting and strengthening the journalist network in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.

Meanwhile, thousands of migrants are excluded from jobs in their field of education - a concept known as brainwaste. Often these migrants hold degrees in fields where there are labor shortages in the countries they live in. Our investigation, based on extensive original analysis of the European Labor Force Survey, a cross-sectional survey carried out across the EU with more than 1 million annual respondents, quantifies the extent, root causes, failed solutions and economic toll of brain waste in countries across Europe and tells the stories through the eyes of its victims","Reporting on structural issues means change won’t happen overnight. However, we are already seeing the impact. We were the first journalistic organization to receive recognition by Eurostat as a research institution based in large part on the detailed methodologies and open repos we publish for each data-driven investigation in the interest of transparency and reproducibility.   Our findings have sparked commentary from economists, politicians, EU level experts on skills matching, employment agencies and heads of human resources at companies such as Patagonia, Mahou and San Miguel.   In Portugal our publication resulted in an immediate agreement by the government to change rules for migrant teachers to access jobs to fill the current teacher shortage. Our team met with the Portuguese government migration body, which is in early consultations to propose a change to degree recognition rules which would ease access to employment for Global South migrants.   With our only TV partner, France 3, we were able to reach a wider and more conservative audience. We produced an hour-long programme on brain waste in France which gave a platform to six qualified immigrants with unique trajectories. A renowned economist explained how including immigrants in the job market did not reduce chances for natives.","Our access to Eurostat micro data unlocked millions of data points of what actually happens inside Europe’s labor market. We made aggregated versions available to media across Europe with a story recipe to guide journalists to more than a dozen important stories across seven media. Europe’s spiralling anxiety over migration is roiling its politics, dominating elections and undermining human rights. The media focus on spectacle turns statistically minor events, such as the “small boats” in the English channel or horrific shipwrecks in the Central Mediterranean into the main story. But away from the polarised politics the richest bloc of countries in the world is ageing fast and its economies have critical skills shortages that migrants have a key role in filling, potentially preventing imminent economic decline. We felt an ethical journalistic obligation to leverage our unprecedented access to produce an investigation that focused not on scandal and corruption, but on exposing a flawed migration policy that has real economic consequences for people on all parts of the political spectrum, migrants and native borns alike. We also actively recruited and prioritized bylines for journalists who come from a migrant background who could relate to and reflect the experiences of affected communities.","We employed three analytical strategies to answer our research questions: (1) descriptive analysis to understand the scale of brain waste and who was most likely to be affected by it. We computed average rates of e.g., unemployment differences between college-educated natives and immigrants and confirmed the statistical significance of these differences using multivariate regression. We found consistently large gaps in labor market outcomes and disparate impacts by gender, field of education, and region of origin. We used a similar approach to better understand how immigrants’ labor market outcomes differed with language skills, time since migration and place of education. (2) We trained a basic linear wage model to understand how much money individuals and European economies were losing tof brain waste. This involved regressing native wages on education, residence, gender and other common predictors of income. We then predicted immigrants wages using the same model and calculated the difference to immigrants’ realized wages. (3) Finally, we used a difference-in-difference estimator to estimate the impact of improved access to diploma recognition on immigrants labor market outcomes. Such policy changes are touted as a solution to brain waste. Our analysis suggests that their impact was marginal because of poor implementation.","This was a values-driven investigation based on: an inclusive collaborative journalism approach, measuring and exploring the nuances of systemic inequality based on extensive social scientific analysis of scientific datasets and a product that leads with human stories not data, to appeal to both affected communities on the one end and skeptics on the other. The investigation proved that there is critical mass in newsrooms across Europe to produce data-driven investigative reporting that can make a real policy difference.  One of the biggest challenges was bringing together data teams and migration beat reporters that together shaped the direction of the investigation. This included custom data analysis based on questions that arose during initial ground reporting and choosing and building trust with victims of brain waste who are most typical of the brain waste phenomenon according to data. We did this to ensure a representative story. Shoe leather reporting by committed reporters filled in the gaps left by the data to explain why brain waste persists despite so many efforts to reduce it. Unsurprisingly, this led to an enduring coalition of traditional and data journalists committed to producing stories most likely to stay on the story and prompt reform.","English, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese",https://www.lighthousereports.com/investigation/brain-waste/,https://www.lighthousereports.com/methodology/brain_waste/,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/brainwaste-imigrantes-portugal/en/diploma-without-value-gianna-teacher-brazil-portugal/,https://elpais.com/economia/2024-04-18/espana-desperdicia-el-talento-extranjero-uno-de-cada-dos-inmigrantes-trabaja-por-debajo-de-su-cualificacion.html,"Justin Casimir Braun, Beatriz Ramalho da Silva, Eva Constantaras, Maud Jullien, Tessa Pang, Halima Salat Barre, Ella Hollowood, Alan Smith, John Burn-Murdoch, Daniele Grasso, Borja Andrino, Emilio Sanches Hidalgo, Maria Martin Delgado, Christina Lee, Justin Yarga, Gabriela Ramirez, Pablo Linde, Sophie Béchirm, Marion David, Giada Santana, Rui Barros, José Volta e Pinto and Ana Maria Henriques.","Beatriz Ramalho da Silva is an investigative journalist at Lighthouse Reports reporting on migration, borders, food systems and technology.

United States of America,Endeavor Global,Small,,,Activating International Networks: Research to Strengthen the Turkish Entrepreneurship Ecosystem,2024-06-10,"Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Business, Immigration, Economy, Employment","Animation, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Python, Flourish, Elementor","International networks of founders are an asset for building effective tech ecosystems, but they remain an under-researched area of entrepreneurship. This is the first investigation of its kind to study the connections between Turkish founders at home and the international community of Turkish-origin entrepreneurs.  As companies in Türkiye look to expand their operations globally, there are opportunities to activate the international network of founders who have already built businesses abroad. Endeavor Insight identified 400 Turkish-origin founders and assessed their potential to support the Turkish tech ecosystem. The data comes from more than 60 interviews with those founders and other stakeholders.","This project changed the way that Turkish entrepreneurs living abroad are viewed by the local Turkish community. With the backdrop of negative narratives around emigration and ”brain drain,” this project debunked the myth that founders are leaving Türkiye and never looking back. Instead, we uncovered that founders can make significant investments in the local ecosystem after emigrating and there is untapped capacity for international networks to give even more.  As a result, this project inspired multiple diaspora networking events, and support programs to better match mentors and investors with local ventures. The article garnered 8k+ website views and 500+ report downloads for the English version.   This project has cultivated interest from leaders in four other markets who with to replicate a study on their own diaspora founders.","Endeavor Global’s research and data journalism division specializes in understanding how founders grow and ecosystems thrive. We investigate the importance of founder-to-founder connectivity in long-term economic growth. Our focus is on evidence-backed data and inspiring action, especially among decision makers who can improve conditions for founders.  This project redefines applied research in entrepreneurship. Instead of a traditional long-form, academic style PDF -- typical in this industry -- Endeavor Insight is bringing information to life through compelling narratives, eye-catching visualizations, and multimedia experiences.  Given the local context and negative”brain drain” narratives, we did not publish the article using the word ”diaspora,” so instead used terminology like ”international networks” and ”Turkish-origin.”","Our work utilizes extensive primary data collection, which ensures the projects are backed by evidence that can reflect the voice of founders. This is distinctive in entrepreneurship reporting, which often relies on incomplete secondary sources from capital providers.   This project involved identifying prominent Turkish founders of tech companies outside of Türkiye through months of desk research, outreach to networks, and snowball sampling. We identified 400 companies and interviewed more than 60 founders and other key stakeholders.  To present the findings, we use custom data visualizations and a scrollytelling website. The visualizations include an adapted Nightingale Rose chart to depict the Endeavor Multiplier Effect TM. This was a new way of demonstrating Endeavor’s signature data journalism on the [Multiplier Effects in entrepreneurship](https://https://multipliereffect.endeavor.org/).   We used Google Sheets, SQL, and Python for data cleaning and analysis. We used Illustrator, InDesign, Figma, Elementor, and Flourish for visualization, design, and publication.","When the measure of entrepreneurial success among journalists focuses on profitability and valuations in select tech hubs like Silicon Valley, it omits the value and innovation coming from other parts of the world. Our aim is to demonstrate how effective data journalism can tell the stories of founders in emerging markets, and demonstrate novel ways to evaluate their growth and contribution.  With this in mind, we hope that other journalists will: 1. Join us in establishing a new standard for measuring and evaluating entrepreneurial success. 2. Take note of entrepreneurship research as a ripe topic for further investigation, especially in places beyond traditional tech hubs.","English, Turkish",https://endeavor.org/turkishnetworks,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVjJTsj37XY,https://turkiye.endeavor.org/endeavor-insight-rapor/,,"Leah D.

United Kingdom,The Times (as UK partner of wider OCCRP investigation),Big,,,Dubai Unlocked: Times work,2024-05-14,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration","Animation, R, RStudio","Dubai has long had a reputation for being an anything goes jurisdiction, with its penchant for secrecy and lack of scruples about welcoming money from all quarters.  However, until now, it has been hard to estimate just how extensively it had been used as a store of wealth by those in Britain with something to hide.   Emma Yeomans and George Greenwood, in partnership with OCCRP, have for the first time been able to shed light on the sheer scale of British criminals investing money in the Dubai property market, utilising a leaked copy of the emirate’s property ownership database.","The Times’ work on the project was able to identify dozens of convicted fraudsters, money launderers and drug dealers who owned vast amounts of luxury property, including a Labour Party linked money launderer who had been able to buy his property in Dubai from his prison cell.  Shoe leather reporting by the team then verified the leads, revealing a total of Fifty-seven criminals, and 105 bankrupts, disqualified directors, tax cheats and people under investigation closely linked to the UK having been able to buy property.  Further matches of the list against public sanctions databases also allowed the team to reveal that Hamas, Hezbollah and Houthi financiers had bought up significant swathes of real estate.    The story led to police investigations into those named by the paper to see if police forces could recover further proceeds of crime.","On its own, the millions of rows of data for people of almost every nationality would have been challenging to use for any serious reporting, with many of the database’s constituents being innocent investors and Emirati citizens.  For a UK publication, we also had to make the work relevant to our audience, as for these kinds of stories to have impact, it would need to demonstrate how the lack of due diligence in Dubai directly affected readers in the UK.  The team was able to use a computer programme that matched the names and dates of birth of those listed in the database with the identities of people on a corporate due diligence database identified as having been convicted of UK crimes.  This allowed us to narrowly target our reporting on those most relevant to our audience, and maximise the impact of the project in the UK, while other partners were able to use a similar approach in their own countries.","I wrote a computer programme in the language R, that matched a copy of the leaked Dubai property data with a copy of the Factiva due diligence database, which we have access to as part of the News Corp group by name, date of birth, and nationality.  As the data was not clean, I had to write multiple iterations of the code, and use some fuzzy matching, to deal with issues where there were spelling differences between the names in the property database and that in the due diligence database, as well as cases where people registered for property using a different version of the name. We then repeated the approach with the open sanctions database.   We then also faced the challenge of how to show the breadth of the international findings, whilst not overwhelming our audience. We achieved this with an interactive globe element, which allowed readers who wanted to deep dive into the story to find some of the international findings, without overwhelming all readers with a wall of text.","The best lesson for this project is the importance of being laser focussed on what you need to achieve for your specific audience, as there were many rabbit holes one could have gone down on this project. Trusting international colleagues to focus on their areas, while sharing information with them, but focussing on how you can make the project relevant for one’s own audience, was a key reason for the success with this project.   I also think that the role of screening datasets through due diligence and sanctions databases is a key investigative technique that could be more widely utilised. This can save a lot of work, and let you focus one’s limited time for shoe leather reporting on only the very best of cases.",English,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/crime/article/british-criminals-buying-property-dubai-investigation-kqxhsjqfp,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/crime/article/shes-married-to-fugitive-crime-boss-and-selling-dubai-property-96x3pn70c,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/crime/article/dubai-property-leaks-businessmen-terrorist-groups-hamas-hezbollah-8wf7mwzkq,https://www.thetimes.com/uk/crime/article/thousands-of-britons-may-be-avoiding-tax-on-properties-in-dubai-wp6p0vhc0,"George Greenwood, Emma Yeomans","Emma Yeomans is a news reporter at The Times.

The cultural and economic factors are some of the setbacks that exclude them from most senior decision-making positions of executive government and political parties.  This limited political participation occurs despite women’s proven ability as leaders, their rights under the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, and international human and women’s rights principles to participate equally in democratic governance, as leaders and agents of change.  Agencies such as UN Women Tanzania and NGOs had continued to support the promotion of gender equality.","This article had an impact with continuous reactions from women’s rights organizations rising up and demanding gender gaps to be addressed in Tanzania’s election laws to give room for more women participation. In this particular scenario, women from opposition political parties even face more difficulties with all sorts of discrimination and bullying. Women from the opposition seeking for political leadership face threats of abduction or being jailed unlike their counterparts in the ruling party-CCM. Speaker of the National Assembly Dr Tulia Ackson emphasized that the 2024 Political Parties’ Act doesn’t entail any sections that obligate political particles to observe 50/50 in nomination of their electoral candidates. She insisted on the competence of candidates regardless of their gender.

Women face a long journey to realizing political equality.","I had to work on this story: ‘Data uncover chances for women in Tanzania’s political landscape’ so that it works as a wake-up call for activists and development partners to work on the issue of gender parity in Tanzania’s politics. Women in Tanzania face a long journey to realizing equality in politics. Women-led organizations have been in the frontline of sensitizing women to explore political opportunities. This particular article focused on other aspects holding back women participation in politics far from cultural factors and socio-economic obstacles.  For over the past 60 years, women in Tanzania had struggled to attain political powers not only for local governments but also at top national positions. Emerging challenges put women on a test to overcome them going forwards.  It has not been ease for women politicians in Tanzania since its independence in 1961. It is unfortunate that local government and general election laws together with the political parties law, passed by the parliament and ascended by the president in 2024 doesn’t honor gender equality in Tanzania’s politics. The difficulty with this story was getting the National Assembly Speaker interviewed. I had to wait for a months. I designed an infographics as part of innovation.","There are many options to creating an infographic but for me I opted to use Piktochart. As you are all aware that Piktochart is an online infographic application which allows users including those without intensive experience as graphic designers to easily create professional-grade infographics using themed templates. The program provides tools to add interactive maps, charts, videos and hyperlinks although I didn’t apply all of it. Piktochart needs one to go through four different steps in getting his infographic done. As a first step: I needed to create a Piktochart account. This part is easy, free and takes maybe 30 seconds to sign up and become a user. I clicked the Piktochart Visual to create visuals for the story in minutes. This section also helps one to save their projects, access resources, and select whichever template fits the layout I selected to use.  At this point, I clicked on my preferred visual format in the dashboard to allow for options namely infographics, presentations, posters, reports, flyers, social media posts or your preferred sizing. Going by the process the next step was to choose the right template for my visual. I went through the process to designing and visualizing the data.","For over the past 60 years, women in Tanzania had struggled to attain political powers not only for local governments but also at top national positions. This struggle is finally reaping off fruits but emerging challenges put women on a test to overcome them going forwards. It has not been ease for women politicians in Tanzania since its independence in 1961. For instance, the sitting President Samia Suluhu Hassan goes down in history not only as the first woman head of state in Tanzania but also in the East African region as a whole.  However, President Samia stands as the first woman Vice President in the country serving between 2015 and 2021. Dr. Tulia Ackson, Speaker of the National Assembly emerged as the first woman President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) from Africa and the third one globally. She is the 31st President since the inception of the IPU in 1889. In the National Assembly, Nenelwa Mwihambi, served as the first woman Clerk since the establishment of the law making body in 1926 when it was known as the Legislative Council of Tanzania Mainland, then known as Tanganyika. She served that position from May 15, 2021 to September 16, 2024.",English,https://www.ippmedia.com/the-guardian/features/read/data-uncover-chances-for-women-in-tanzanias-political-landscape,https://www.ippmedia.com/the-guardian/business/read/stakeholders-complement-govts-efforts-in-equipping-women-to-land-ownership-2024-07-11-165014,https://www.ippmedia.com/the-guardian/business/read/tgnp-sensitise-women-of-leadership-skills-ahead-of-2025-general-elections-2024-12-08-160439,https://ippmedia.com/the-guardian/features/read/activists-advocate-for-increased-number-of-women-in-leadership-candidates-list-2024-05-29-100746,Editor: Mnaku Mbani  Infographic Editor: Faraja Masinde  Developing Story: Getrude Mbago,"Winner of the Excellence in Journalism Awards Tanzania (EJAT) Data Journalism category for 2021 and 2022 conferred by the esteemed Media Council of Tanzania (MCT), Francis Dhamira Kajubi (39) has been working with The Guardian-Tanzania for ten years now as Business and Data Senior Journalist.

We conduct weekly workshops on digital literacy, leadership, and access to online education, equipping youth with essential skills to navigate the digital world. Through hands-on training, we empower them to pursue online learning, employment, and advocacy opportunities. Our program has already helped hundreds gain access to free educational resources, international workshops, and job opportunities. By fostering tech-enabled growth, we are shaping a future where Rohingya youth can thrive despite displacement.","Our project, Empowering Rohingya Youth with Technology, has had a profound impact on the displaced Rohingya community by providing digital literacy, leadership training, and access to online education. Since its inception, we have conducted over 12 workshops, equipping youth with essential technology skills, educational resources, and career opportunities. More than 300 participants have directly benefited, with many now enrolled in online courses, securing remote jobs, and participating in international workshops.  Our initiative has inspired youth to become leaders, educators, and changemakers in their community, breaking barriers to education and employment. We have connected Rohingya students to global learning platforms and advocacy opportunities, ensuring their voices are heard. By harnessing technology, we are empowering a new generation to shape their own future, despite the challenges of displacement. Our work has also drawn attention from journalists and humanitarian organizations, highlighting the importance of digital inclusion for refugees.","The Empowering Rohingya Youth with Technology project operates in an extremely challenging environment. The Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, are the world’s largest, where restricted internet access, legal barriers, and resource shortages make it difficult for refugees to access education and employment. Due to their stateless status, Rohingya youth have limited rights, no formal education system, and very few opportunities to develop career skills.  Despite these obstacles, our project leverages available technology to bridge the gap. We conduct weekly workshops on digital literacy, leadership, and online education, equipping youth with tools to access free global learning platforms, secure remote jobs, and build self-reliance. Given restrictions on SIM cards and internet access, we innovate by using offline resources, community spaces, and mentorship programs to keep youth engaged.  Additionally, political instability and legal uncertainties create risks, as refugees often face movement restrictions and crackdowns on digital activities. Yet, through strategic partnerships and safe learning spaces, we ensure our participants can learn and grow in a protected environment. This project is not just about technology—it is about resilience, empowerment, and creating a future for Rohingya youth who have been denied basic rights for decades.","To empower Rohingya youth with technology, we utilized a combination of digital tools, community-based learning techniques, and innovative approaches to navigate the challenges of restricted internet access and limited resources in refugee camps.      Offline & Low-Bandwidth Resources: Since internet access is restricted, we use pre-downloaded educational materials, offline apps like Khan Academy Lite and Google Read Along, and share resources through USB drives and SD cards.     Mobile-Friendly Platforms: We train youth on Google Workspace, Canva, Coursera, and Khan Academy, ensuring they can access online education and develop digital skills using mobile devices.     Community-Based Training: Weekly workshops focus on digital literacy, leadership, and online education, where mentors demonstrate tools, guide learners, and facilitate hands-on activities.     Alternative Communication Channels: Due to legal barriers on SIM card access, we use secure messaging apps, community Wi-Fi hubs, and mentor-led peer learning groups to sustain engagement.     Global Networking & Opportunities: We connect Rohingya youth with international virtual workshops, training sessions, and advocacy programs that amplify their voices beyond the camps.  These approaches ensure continuous learning, skill-building, and global exposure despite the harsh conditions Rohingya youth face.","Journalists covering marginalized communities, digital access, and refugee education can learn several key lessons from this project:      Innovation in Adversity: Despite severe internet restrictions and legal barriers, we developed offline learning models and leveraged mobile-friendly platforms to bring digital education to Rohingya youth. Journalists can explore how digital innovation overcomes systemic obstacles in crisis zones.     Community-Driven Change: The project’s success is rooted in peer-to-peer learning and local mentorship. Journalists can document how grassroots leadership plays a critical role in sustaining long-term impact in refugee settings.     Amplifying Marginalized Voices: By connecting youth to international training and remote job opportunities, we are helping them gain economic independence and a global presence. Journalists can highlight how digital access can redefine refugee narratives from victims to changemakers.     Policy & Advocacy Insights: Our work exposes the legal and political barriers that limit digital access for refugees. Journalists can use this case study to push for policies that enable better connectivity and educational rights for displaced communities.

The investigation attempted to convey the suffering of Arab families in these countries from the shortage of electricity and its impact on all sectors of the economy in these countries and consequently the impact on the GDP of these countries.,"Some of the countries mentioned in the investigation moved immediately due to the popular momentum created by the investigation - as it was published in two languages: Arabic and English - and they signed agreements and memoranda of understanding to increase the production of renewable energy in the energy mix in consideration of the environment.. For example, Egypt signed an agreement with the United Arab Emirates to increase its energy capacity by about 4 gigawatts of renewable energy, especially solar energy.. It also signed an agreement with the Norwegian company Scatec to produce wind energy from the Egyptian Zafarana region.. As for Iraq, it signed an agreement with Siemens to restructure the energy network and increase the percentage of renewable energy in it..","There is a large civilization gap between the East and the West that is clearly evident in the economic sector and casts its shadow on the general policy of developing countries..  This civilization gap is usually paid for by the Arab peoples themselves.. They do not find the basic, required and important resources to live a simple and normal life even!!! Even electricity is not available all day in the capitals of 7 important Arab countries in the Middle East region.. Consequently, this affects the economies of families themselves and then kills any creativity or new ideas that might change society for the better..  This civilization gap between the East and the West also appeared in the presence of a class gap between the Arab peoples in each of these countries.. That is, there are families that can buy large electric generators to generate electricity and there are those who cannot... which causes a problem for families in the lack of equal opportunities whether in education, work or production....  If governments cannot provide the basics of life, there is a real problem for the Arab peoples in adapting to this life..","Infographics, Excel tables, countries’ budget data, energy expenditure and revenue data, and macroeconomic data for these countries were used.

Это исследование затрагивает 4 года и для сбора информации журналисты использовали данные от госорганов, ответа на запросы, изучали новостные заметки в медиа и в соцсетях. Мы считает эту исследование важным для Кыргызстана, потому что оно говорит о систематичких репрессиях власти против граждан, выражающих какую-любо критику. И что самое интересно, мы выяснили, как часто в Кыргызстане сажают людей за их посты, комментарии и репосты в соцсетях.","Наш проект попал в топ расследований месяца на GIJN. Также после публикации наши коллеги-журналисты просили у нас доступ к нашим данным для своей дальнейший работы — мы всегда готовы давать собранные нами данные, так как это была одна из целей проекта. Мы хотели, так и получилось, чтобы журналисты, исследователи и другие могли сослаться на наше исследования, чтобы подтвердить заявление о политических репрессиях в Кыргызстане.   К сожалению, цензура и авторитаризм пришел в Кыргызстан как будто незаметно и негромко, но в итоге десятки, сотни людей сидят в СИЗО за свою критику. Мы хотели, чтобы об этом говорили больше и в целом мы этого добились. Наша база данных — пока остается самой полной базой политзаключенных в Кыргызстане. Также там есть много другой информации об судебных инстанциях, аппеляциях, болезнях и прочее. То есть на основе нашей базы можно делать и другие материлы.","Контекст сейчас в Кыргызстане таков, что за такое исследование вполне могут посадить. Поэтомы мы авторы исследование не подписываем свои работы и нигде не указываем свое авторство. Так же само наше издание ”Клооп” подвергается давлению. Власти уже смогли закрыть одной из наших юридических лиц и продолжают судиться с нами, обвиняя в распространении лжи и фейков. Есть очень большая юридическая угроза. Также есть проблема с тем, что нам порой отказывают в доступе к информации официальные органы.

Grupos del crímen organizado, ligados al narcotráfico y desaparición de personas en todo el país, utilizan este método de robo de gasolinas para financiarse, lo que les ha llevado a disputarse violentamente la zona, asesinando a civiles y agentes de seguridad de Pemex, a reclutar a niños y a comprar a policías del estado. El gobierno sigue tratando de negar que estos grupos delincuenciales hace años que están instalados aquí.","Paloma Negra fue el primer medio de comunicación en hablar del tema en el estado en la última década y hacerlo desde el periodismo de investigación, poniéndolo en la agenda a mediados del 2024. Compartimos el reportaje en medios de otros cuatro estados, además de replicar la investigación en tres medios locales más. Colectivos de madres que buscan a sus familiares desaparecidos en el estado de Querétaro conocieron del reportaje, lo difundieron y formamos alianzas para compartir información del tema de crimen organizado. Para noviembre del 2024, una masacre de 10 personas en un bar en la capital del estado de Querétaro, donde un grupo del crimen organizado disparó sus armas contra jóvenes de un grupo rival, dio cuenta de la presencia de estos grupos delincuenciales, todo México volteo la mirada a Querétaro, específicamente al municipio de San Juan del Río, desde donde Paloma Negra ya había hecho este reportaje de tomas ilegales de combustible.","En México hay una constante evasión del gobierno a mostrar información pública, por ello los periodistas nos hemos valido de herramientas informáticas y leyes para acceder directamente a información, haciendo solicitudes formales por escrito, como este caso donde si bien el número de perforaciones es público, no es difundido por el gobierno y tuve que hacer bases de datos propias contrastando información de varias dependencias del estado, para posteriormente dar un contexto general del caso en los últimos 10 años. Yo, Axel Illescas Tovar, soy un periodista independiente de 23 años que durante toda la investigación no tuvo ningún respaldo de algún medio de comunicación grande, solamente tuve el apoyo de Paloma Negra, el medio independiente que yo mismo fundé en mi estado. Es así que financié este reportaje con mis propios recursos, estando en una vulnerabilidad económica grande. Asimismo, en Querétaro llevo un par de años investigando temas de corrupción en el gobierno, por lo que soy blanco de asedio y acoso del gobierno. A diferencia de medios de comunicación nacionales, yo diariamente vivo en la zona que investigué, hacer periodismo independiente desde la misma zona del conflicto plantea riesgos para mí.","Solicitudes de información pública a Pemex, para la creación de una base de datos propia de los últimos 10 años, y una posterior visualización en gráficas a través del programa Flourish.

Los policías no pudieron ser aprehendidos porque fueron protegidos por el gobierno municipal y se escondieron durante varios meses. Pese a eso fueron beneficiados con recursos públicos al pagárseles el sueldo íntegro aún cuando no ejercían su trabajo como policías.","Se destapó la impunidad conque operaban estos policías con la complacencia de los jefes policíacos y del alcalde de ese entonces, Santos González Yescas. Además, se evidenció la corrupción con la que actuó el gobierno al proteger a estos policías y evitar su detención e investigación por parte de la Fiscalía Estatal. Cabe señalar que en julio de 2024 uno de los policías protegidos, Miguel Amaro Ruiz, fue asesinado en un ataque armado, y el 3 de junio de ese mismo año fue asesinado Gerardo Camacho Ramírez, Jefe Policiaco que participó en evitar que se detuviera a los tres agentes señalados de los delitos ya mencionados.","Desde septiembre de 2018, con la llegada al poder del Partido Morena al gobierno de San Luis Río Colorado en la figura del entonces Alcalde Santos González Yescas, empezó una etapa de intensa violencia criminal en ese municipio.

En este sentido, se tuvo que hacer uso de la Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la información para conseguir los datos que sustentan la información publicada. Sin embargo, conseguir la información a través de los mecanismos de transparencia no fue fácil debido a que varias solicitudes fueron negadas o contestadas con datos que no tenían relación con lo que se pedía, a pesar de que se trataba de información de carácter público.

A team of journalists at ABC News and ABC Owned Television Stations decided to focus on the reason why “countless” needs to appear in the previous sentence.  For years, HUD has been requiring service providers to conduct what is known as the Point-in-Time count in order to determine how many people are homeless around the country. Through data analysis, in-person visits and interviews, ABC investigated concerns that this is a major undercount.","Each year, the Point-in-Time count makes headlines across the United States as officials announce whether homelessness is falling or on the rise, but ABC News decided to take a deeper dive into just how this data is actually created, ultimately finding a system that varies widely from community to community. ABC News traveled from coast to coast and sent requests to hundreds of count operators across the country, ultimately taking these findings to U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge. Fudge told ABC News that HUD is taking a look to see whether the count can be improved. ABC News’ reporting also highlighted unique ways in which some communities are supplementing the count, shining a light on ways to ensure that America’s homelessness data is as accurate as possible. ABC News has presented its findings to conferences to train investigative reporters and data journalists from other media outlets.","Homelessness is a topic that comes to mind right away for ABC’s viewers when they think about crises impacting numerous Americans. With so many people experiencing homelessness on a regular basis, ABC sought to take a unique approach to covering this issue. As ABC producers sent questions to hundreds of Point-in-Time count organizers, it quickly became clear that the answers regarding how America’s data on homelessness is gathered and ultimately used varied significantly. In this case, the data collection methods became the focus of the story. Since ABC is primarily a broadcast platform, ABC’s production team knew that it was vital when visualizing this complex data story to make it easy for the audience to to understand these concepts and relate to them. The team looked across the country for count organizers willing to be followed by a camera crew, eventually finding one in Missouri and using an in-car camera and a chase vehicle to follow their process. The team also worked to hear from people experiencing homelessness and to secure one-on-one interviews with high-ranking government officials like the governor of Washington and the top housing official in the United States.","ABC used automated emails to contact hundreds of service providers around the United States, using their responses to build our own data regarding the Point-in-Time count. The production team used these responses, along with federal data regarding waiting lists for affordable housing, to determine which communities to profile as part of this project. Creative camerawork and audiowork also played a major role in this reporting. ABC found Point-in-Time count operators willing to work with us in Missouri, then put microphones on them and wired their car with interior and exterior cameras. The production crew followed them in a different vehicle to record different perspectives of their data analysis.","This project showed that data released by government agencies can help with stories, but in some cases, the process of how the government collects its data can be a story in and of itself.

Within a short period of time, about a dozen servicemen of that unit submitted a letter of resignation from the army on the grounds that after a divorce they remained the sole guardians of their minor children. The legal counsel suspected that these divorces were fictitious. During the investigation, NGL.media was able to confirm the validity of these suspicions. To do this, we had to analyze almost 30 thousand similar cases considered by Ukrainian courts in 2021-2023.",The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine detained six participants in the evasion scheme through the Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi court.,"The material was created during Russia’s war against Ukraine. When our investigation was ready, we asked law enforcement agencies and human rights organizations for comments. After that, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau asked us to postpone the publication so that they could conduct the necessary investigative actions. So we waited a few months and published it on the day the suspects were detained.","Since most decisions on deprivation of parental rights contain either this wording or the one closely resembling it, we downloaded the texts of all 2021-2023 cases from the State Register of Court Decisions in which the words “independent”, “upbringing” or “child/children” were used.  Following this, we analyzed the text of each decision, excluding cases in which the suit was filed by women, guardianship authorities, or other children’s relatives. We also excluded cases in which the court left the child with the mother. For the most part, we were able to analyze the cases automatically based on specific phrases mentioned in the text.

We have written a script that “crawls” along the relevant pages on the website of the Ministry of Justice and saves these PDFs for further analysis. Most of these were merely scanned images, so to extract the text from them automatically, we had to recognize it using OCR instruments. We used Tesseract engine and kept the data about each complaint and the text of a response thereto in a separate dataset. Our further analysis of texts involved the use of OpenRefine programme and search for similar text patterns in responses to complaints — this is how we managed to determine and “clean” the registrars’ surnames (sometimes their names and surnames were published with misprints) and to define the result of a complaint review.  * The Ministry of Justice allows only for obtaining basic information about the complaints to be considered by the board (besides, this information is not available regarding the complaints considered until October 2023)","They can get the information they need very quickly, although before, analyzing and searching for data took much longer.","English, Ukrainian",https://ngl.media/en/2024/10/26/online-robbery/,https://ngl.media/2024/10/26/pograbuvannya-onlajn/,,,"Nazar Tuzyak, Oleksandra Hubytska, Natalia Onysko",Nazar Tuzyak has been working as a journalist since 2009 and worked at “Lvivska Gazeta” and “Lvivska Poshta” newspapers.

Ukraine,NGL.media,Small,,,Змінений стан свідомості,2024-10-31,"Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Lifestyle","Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","My publication highlights the issue of the rapid increase of drug use in Ukraine by showcasing the rising number of cases involving driving under the influence of narcotics. Drivers serve as a reflection of society, making these tendencies particularly alarming. To explore this topic, I collected and analyzed court rulings from 2015 to October 2024, gathering a total of 1.5 million documents and identifying cases involving alcohol or drug use through linguistic analysis of the court rulings. The primary goal of the publication is to draw attention to the accuring problem of drug use in Ukraine.","This study is the first in Ukraine’s database on drunk drivers, covering the period from 2015 to October 2024. It categorizes the state of intoxication of drivers into alcoholic or narcotic substances.  The article has had a significant impact on society. Notably, other journalists have used our research as a foundation for their works. For instance, ”Economic Truth” utilized our findings to conduct its own study regarding punishments for drivers involved in road accidents while under the influence. Additionally, the article has been widely republished by major Ukrainian media outlets, including ”NV.ua”, ”Teхty.org”, and ”LB.ua”. I also had a broadcast on ”Ukrainian Radio”, which is the largest and most popular radio network in Ukraine.   In late January, the Ukrainian ”Dejure Foundation” conducted its own study concerning how judges in Ukraine have assisted drivers in evading penalties for drunk driving.

Although the court administration provides most court decisions in large annual datasets, the text of each decision had to be downloaded separately in RTF format. These files were double-encoded, so I had to create a Python script to convert them from RTF to DOCX. In addition, the hand-typed court decisions often contained typos, inaccuracies, contradictions, and errors. Each judge presented the decisions in his or her own style, which required defining individual models for each judge. There were also problems with some of the judges’ decisions, such as unnecessary punctuation, extra spaces, or, conversely, a complete lack of spaces. These difficulties required significant time to identify and correct errors for each year separately before looking for patterns to identify drunk drivers and their level of intoxication. In addition, the large volume of data forced me to analyze the decisions year by year. For example, in 2023 alone, I processed approximately 170,000 court decisions, each of which contained a large amount of text.","To Collect statistical data, we used the court registry, since police reports under Article 130 of the Code of Administrative Offenses often reflect only the assumptions of patrol officers. We downloaded all court decisions under Article 130 from 2015 to September 30, 2024 — about 1.5 million decisions.  For analysis, we selected approximately 850 thousand decisions in which the court found the driver guilty.  We used the RStudio environment to download and sort the decisions due to ability to process large data sets. In RStudio, we downloaded all links to the decisions and obtained the texts via the Windows command line. Since the decisions were double-coded in RTF format, I used Python to recode them into the desired format.  Next, using RStudio, I linked the texts of the decisions with their source data, such as court, case number. Year after year, I analyzed the decisions in OpenRefine, transforming them into a convenient format using OpenRefine. Then, I identified patterns for each type of decision. Based on these patterns, I determined the state of intoxication of the driver and whether the court recognized the driver as drunk. To visualize the data in the form of a database, we used D3 library.","With the help of this publication, other journalists can learn how to search, analyze, and systematize data from open sources. They can also understand the volume of data and the opportunities that the Ukrainian court register provides, in particular, to open it up to themselves as a source for potential topics. In particular, in the text we briefly explained how to obtain the data that we analyzed in the text and why we chose the court register for this. In addition, the published database will remain a valuable resource for journalists, activists, and politicians, supporting ongoing advocacy.","The language is Ukrainian, there is also an English translation",https://ngl.media/2024/10/31/zminenyj-stan-svidomosti/,,,,"Data collection and analysis by Maksym Pikho, visualization by Nazar Tuziak, editor by Oleg Onysko, cover by Victoria Demchuk","My name is Maksym Pikho i was born in Ukraine, in the Luhansk region.

We highlighted the plight of millions of civilians caught in the crossfire, enduring dire conditions due to food shortages and inadequate healthcare.    The conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has transformed urban centers like Khartoum, El-Geneina, and Al-Fashir, as well as rural villages, into battlegrounds, deepening the suffering of the Sudanese population.","The project had a significant impact in exposing the devastating realities of Sudan’s conflict through open-source investigative methods. By verifying and analyzing visual evidence, it provided a clear and credible account of human rights abuses, destruction, and civilian suffering in areas affected by the war.  One major impact was raising awareness among international audiences, policymakers, and humanitarian organizations. The report added to the growing body of evidence on war crimes, potentially influencing advocacy efforts and calls for accountability by the International Criminal Court. It also reinforced the role of open-source investigations in documenting conflicts where traditional reporting is limited due to security risks.  On a broader scale, the findings have been referenced by rights groups, media organizations, and researchers investigating Sudan’s war, like Human Rights Watch, WITNESS, and Open Society Foundations, ensuring that the stories of victims are not forgotten.","This project was conducted under highly challenging conditions due to Sudan’s complex political landscape and restricted access to information. The ongoing war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces has led to widespread censorship, internet blackouts, and threats against journalists, making traditional reporting nearly impossible.  Resource constraints were a major hurdle, as access to on-the-ground sources was limited, requiring reliance on satellite imagery, social media analysis, and open-source verification techniques. Legal risks were also significant, with Sudanese authorities and armed groups targeting those documenting war crimes.  Despite these challenges, the project leveraged innovative technologies such as forensic video analysis to verify attacks and human rights abuses. By using digital investigative methods, the report provided a factual, evidence-based account of Sudan’s war, countering misinformation and shedding light on atrocities that would otherwise remain hidden.","For this investigation, we used a combination of open-source intelligence tools, satellite imagery, and digital forensic techniques to verify attacks and human rights abuses in Sudan.  Geolocation and chronolocation were key techniques, allowing us to match videos and images from social media, like Telegram and Facebook, with satellite imagery to confirm locations and timelines of reported incidents.

Additionally, we collaborated with experts from Center For Information Resillience to cross-check findings.","This project demonstrates how journalists can overcome access restrictions and security risks by leveraging open-source intelligence and digital verification techniques to report on conflicts.  Journalists can learn how to systematically verify visual evidence using tools like Google Earth Pro, and Sentinel Hub, ensuring that misinformation and manipulated content do not distort reporting. The project also underscores the value of collaboration with digital investigators, researchers, and human rights organizations to strengthen findings and provide a more comprehensive narrative.  Additionally, it reinforces the need for methodical documentation and transparency in investigative processes, which enhances credibility and impact. By integrating these techniques, journalists can effectively cover conflict zones, human rights abuses, and other hard-to-reach stories, even in environments where traditional reporting is impossible.",English,https://nation.africa/africa/news/look-the-fire-is-inside-your-houses-where-are-you-sudan-s-war-within-4683754,,,,Investigations Lead -Mike Yambo  Illustrator - Geoffrey Onyambu  Additional Research - Jackline Macharia,"Mike Yambo is an investigative journalist currently working with Nation Media Group, a leading media organization in East and Central Africa.

Netherlands,RTL Nieuws,Big,,,145 euros more spent on healthcare in heavy industry nearby,2024-06-27,"Investigation, Environment, Health","Scraping, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Python","People living near 13 areas with heavy industry in the Netherlands spend an average of 145 euros more on healthcare per year. This was revealed last year in a large and innovative journalistic investigation by RTL Nieuws. In the examined areas, costs for general practitioners, hospitals, medications, and medical devices are higher.","The impact of the research is significant. Residents of heavy industry felt heard for the first time. And their concerns were also quantified for the first time in an exploratory study. The study received a lot of political attention. The minister was called to account. Following RTL Nieuws’ findings, the provinces of Groningen and Zeeland announced additional investigations into the health of residents near heavy industry in those provinces. Recognized research institutes showed interest in RTL Nieuws’ developed methodology. One of them, Nivel, is exploring whether this can be applied in future research and intends to conduct follow-up research based on the revelations.","In 2023, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) determined that the business activities of Tata Steel cause health damage to residents. According to the Dutch Safety Board (OVV), not enough attention is paid to residents’ concerns about heavy industry throughout the country. The investigative team at RTL Nieuws then sought ways to identify potential ’other Tata Steels.’  Data journalists developed a new method that revealed many more areas where healthcare costs are significantly higher than expected. The investigative team examined to what extent the costs deviated from what would be expected based on the composition of residents of an area. For instance, a baby incurs more healthcare costs than a ten-year-old child, and healthcare costs vary between men and women.   Although the analysis does not establish a causal relationship, experts praise RTL Nieuws’ exploratory research. Several experts and organizations described RTL Nieuws’ pioneering work as ’highly significant’ and called for large-scale research into residents’ health based on the results.   This complex data analysis was combined with thorough research. Ultimately, thirteen areas were identified where residents are concerned about their health, healthcare costs are higher than expected, and other findings also indicate potential health risks.","For details on the methodology, considerations, and responses from experts and institutions regarding the research, we refer you to our comprehensive explanation (in Dutch, but AI would help). This is attached here and, due to the importance of transparent investigative journalism, has also been published on our website upon the release of the research.","By making smart and pure use of different data sources, linking them together and weighing them, we have managed to realise an exploratory study that is unique by Dutch standards. We knew in advance that such an analysis would not yield a causal link. At the same time, that is also what recognised research institutes are up against. Just prove that someone got cancer from inhaling polluted air, while the same person also smokes: it’s almost impossible. At the same time, we have established that residents of heavy industry are concerned about emissions and their health. With this study, we have been able to establish that healthcare costs in 13 areas with heavy industry are significantly higher than expected. We have thereby laid the foundation for follow-up research. With this, we have managed to inspire other journalists an researchers in the Netherlands.",Dutch,https://www.rtl.nl/nieuws/onderzoek/artikel/5451418/145-euro-meer-kwijt-aan-zorg-bij-zware-industrie-de-buurt,https://redactie.rtl.nl/sites/default/files/content/documents/2024/06/26/Verantwoording-onderzoek-industrie-zorgkosten-rtl-nieuws.pdf,,,"Marcia Nieuwenhuis, Koen de Regt, Jasper Bunskoek","Marcia Nieuwenhuis, investigative journalist: responsible for research, interviews, writing articles, producing TV items, sparring on methodology.

Kenya,Africa Uncensored,Small,,,ANGLO LEASING: The Scandal That Won’t Die,2024-09-23,"Investigation, Documentary, Video, Politics, Corruption, Money-laundering","Animation, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","For the first time since the breaking of a mega scandal in Kenya, we confront the question of who really benefitted from the scandal. Analyzing thousands of leaked financial documents, emails, and company documents, we uncover the involvement of a shadowy figure, Anura Perera, who, despite suspicions and accusations, was never tried for their involvement. At least six of the 15 companies that were awarded inflated and irregular tenders for projects that were either never completed or even initiated, belonged to Anura Perera. We estanlish the network of entities involved and how he moved money through them.","Four of the people accused in Kenya over the Anglo leasing scandal were in 2024 acquitted, seemingly dashing the hopes of justice ever being served. This documentary comes out at a time when the scandal seems to be lulling and fading into obscurity to remind Kenyans and the world at large that such schemes have no expiry date when it comes to the pursuit of justice and accountability. Keeping the faces of the people responsible within the scrutiny of public discourse is one way of keeping authorities accountable.  We are confident that the wide reach of the documentary stirred and will continue to stir the current wave of accountability demanded of leaders by Kenyans. Following the anti-finance bill protests seen in Kenya between June and August 2024, this documentary did more than just expose the beneficiaries of systemic corruption but also played a part in the accountability uprising by showing the effect of corruption on the country’s economy.  The documentary has had over 60 thousand views and over 780 thousand impressions, and counting, since it was first published. It speaks to the duty of journalists to keep shining the spotlight on injustices thus discouraging such blatant acts of corruption.","The whistlbower of the Anglo leasing scandal, John Githongo, was taken to court by one of the implicated politicians accusing him of defamation. John Githongo was fined an obscene amount of money. He is still trying to appeal the ruling. Based on this, and the fear of further litigation, he would not agree to an interview.  The scandal was so far-reaching that a number of people around it, including then Kenya’s attorney general, the then public prosecutor, and the member of parliament who brought the scandal to the attention of the parliament refused to comment on the scandal. Nearly two decades later, whispers about the scandal still cause jitters. This was the environment the team of researchers and the producer worked in.  Moreover, throughout the production of the documentary, all those involved had to operate under heightened security. People who benefit from such corrupt deals, particularly Anura Perera, who has been described as the mastermind, are powerful and can go to great lengths to avoid scrutiny and justice. Perera is very litigious and in 2015 took two journalists and a media outlet to court for defamation. He threatened litigation against Africa Uncensored in the course of the documentary production.","The production of this documentary involved analysis of thousands of leaked documents, including company registration documents, financial statements, emails, and financial correspondences. Collating such a large amount of data warranted the use of data analytics and presentation tools, where we used Excel to record and analyse data. We used proprietary Content Management Systems provided by OCCRP to store and sort the data we had. Moreover, the network builder tool also provided by OCCRP was used to map the trusts, companies, and entities related to Anura Perera.  Aside from technological tools, we used investigative techniques to relate documents building up a flowing connection between the entities and Anura Perera. His involvement in the implicated companies was not known at the time of the unfolding of the scandal. Close scrutiny of company minutes, registration documents, shares documents and shares transfer documents revealed his involvement.","It took more than a year of analyzing thousands of documents to establish a narrative connecting Anura Perera to the entities involved and the companies implicated in the Angl Leasing scandal. For a scandal that was seemingly slowly fading into obscurity with acquittals, this seemed like too much work for not much impact. However, the conversations stirred by the documentary, and its place in etching the impact of corruption on the economy to the minds of young Kenyans who may have not even heard about the scandal, was worth every effort. Moreover, even with the people close to the nuances of the scandal refusing interviews, we were able to produce and publish the story. The continued engagement with the story with increasing views and impressions, speak to its relevance decades after the scandal broke out. Journalists should not tire of putting in their best efforts despite all odds. The impact may appear inconsequential at first, but may eventually be more far-reaching than you ever imagined it would. Besides, the fact that corruption may appear to disappear into the annals of time does not mean that it should. Continue to shine the spotlight on ills in the society.",English,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kFdQ-P0qDU&t=85s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qRlVwjlc_4,,,"Calvin Rock - Producer, Purity Mukami - Data and research","Calvin is a multimedia journalist who worked as a reporter, fact-checker and fact-checking lead for Africa Uncensored, an independent media outlet based in Nairobi, Kenya.

Sweden,Sveriges Radio,Big,,,Revealed: Old-growth Swedish forests being cut down at fast pace,2024-05-21,"Investigation, Open data, Podcast/radio, Environment","QGIS, CSV, R, RStudio","Our investigation uncovered what has happened to Sweden’s old-growth forests, one of few untouched woodlands of this size remaining in Europe. Many say Sweden has an international duty to protect these, and a recent state-ordered investigation suggested that these forests be granted formal protection. But this never materialised - instead, we found this forest has since been cut down at a much higher rate than before.   Over the next weeks, through both news stories and an hour-long programme, we were able to reveal how much had been felled, which companies were behind it, and that valuable untouched nature had been lost.","From day one, our investigation garnered strong reactions, from audiences, politicians, environmental organisations and other journalists. Our story was covered extensively by other Swedish media, both in news articles and op-eds, and even internationally, as Canada’s public service radio picked up the story.   Following our investigation, the Swedish Forest Agency was called to Parliament to answer questions about their actions and some forest owners have retracted their applications to fell in this area. Others have been reported to FSC for breaking FSC standards, by felling in areas with valuable nature, despite having an FSC certification.","During the course of the research for this investigation, we discovered that the Swedish Forest Agency’s data on fellings was flawed, as a bug in their system meant that a small percentage of fellings were being reported twice. This posed a challenge for us, and we had to work together with geodata experts at the agency to figure out how to filter out the incorrect data from our analysis. This also served as a useful reminder not to take official statistics at face value.   Forestry is both a huge industry and a polarising issue in Sweden, and while we were still publishing follow-up stories, several forestry companies lobbied against our investigation, contacting us and our editors, trying to poke holes in our story and claim our findings were incorrect. We were even reported to the Swedish Broadcasting Commission by a forest owners association. The commission investigated their complaint and rejected its claims entirely.","Identifying what had been felled in these forests was a matter of joining two geographical boundaries. We got access to a shapefile showing the boundaries of the forest that the state-ordered investigation suggested be protected, and, using R, we combined this with public data showing every area that had been reported as felled to the Swedish Forest Agency.   This was fairly straightforward once we had the data, but the next step, finding out who had felled what was an interesting challenge. We ended up doing the following: for every unique felled area, we found coordinates that were inside its boundaries, then wrote a script in R that ran these coordinates through an API from Lantmäteriet, Sweden’s mapping authority, which allowed us to get the unique property designation where the felling occurred, and subsequently were able to use this to get the property’s owner at the time of the felling.","This could be used as a case study for a number of different hands-on tutorials, for instance, an introduction to working with geodata in R, or tips for presenting data journalism in a radio format.   It could also be part of broader discussions, such as what to do when the official data isn’t right, or how to handle covering a polarising issue.",Swedish,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/fjallskog-som-skulle-skyddas-huggs-ner-i-rekordfart,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o2t-3nyenah9Cazhu4gi7VQ-jarQ0LjCTWrjPM4iZ1M/edit?usp=sharing,,,"Clara Guibourg, Alexander Gagliano, Maria Ridderstedt","Clara Guibourg is an investigative data journalist, and Alexander Gagliano and Maria Ridderstedt are investigative reporters at Sweden’s public service radio broadcaster Sveriges Radio."

Pakistan,The News (https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/writer/naeem-ahmad),Small,,,A Life of Hazards (Poor safety standards and practices make the vocation of sewer workers unnecessarily perilous),2024-04-21,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Health, Employment, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","This investigative report, A Life of Hazards, published in The News, highlights the extreme occupational risks faced by sewer workers in Faisalabad due to poor safety standards and lack of government support. The story uncovers the grim realities of manual sewer cleaning, revealing how workers operate without essential protective gear, suffer from chronic health conditions, and often lose their lives due to toxic gas inhalation. The investigation uses firsthand accounts, official data, and expert insights to emphasize the urgent need for policy reforms, safer working conditions, and proper recognition of these marginalized workers who ensure urban sanitation.","The report brought significant attention to the hazardous conditions faced by sewer workers in Pakistan. Following its publication, various civil society organizations and human rights groups amplified the discussion on social media, urging authorities to take action. The piece was widely shared among labour rights activists, prompting calls for reforms in workplace safety standards. As a direct result of the article, Faisalabad’s Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) officials were pressured to respond, acknowledging gaps in safety provisions. They reiterated their commitment to providing protective gear and improving working conditions. Additionally, local activists cited the report in appeals to policymakers, advocating for stronger enforcement of labor laws. The story also played a role in raising awareness among the general public about the hidden dangers faced by sanitation workers. It sparked discussions in media outlets and civic forums about the need for mechanized sewer cleaning and better employment conditions. While policy changes are still awaited, the report successfully contributed to a growing movement demanding the dignity, protection, and fair compensation of sewer workers.","This investigative piece was produced in a challenging journalistic landscape. Pakistan’s labour rights and workplace safety issues are often overlooked, and reporting on marginalized communities, such as sanitation workers, lacks mainstream attention. Sewer workers, predominantly from the Christian minority, face systemic discrimination, which makes their plight even more invisible. The investigation encountered significant access challenges. Most workers feared retribution for speaking out, as they are employed under precarious contracts with no legal protections. Additionally, obtaining official data from WASA was difficult due to bureaucratic resistance. The agency was reluctant to share records on worker deaths and safety measures, forcing the investigation to rely on independent labor organizations and firsthand testimonies. Legal threats were also a concern. Reporting on labor conditions in government agencies risks backlash from officials and potential defamation charges. Despite these constraints, the story was carefully reported, cross-verified with multiple sources, and presented with evidence-based arguments. This project is crucial in a country where industrial safety regulations remain weak. By shedding light on these unsafe labor conditions, the investigation aims to push for policy reforms, urging authorities to recognize sewer workers’ rights and adopt modern, safer cleaning technologies.","The investigation utilized a combination of traditional and digital journalism tools to uncover the realities of sewer workers. 1.Field Reporting & Interviews: The story was built on firsthand accounts from sewer workers, labor rights activists, and union leaders. Extensive interviews were conducted in Faisalabad, ensuring diverse perspectives from contract workers, permanent employees, and their families. 2.Data Collection & Verification: Government records on worker safety were difficult to access, so alternative sources like labor rights NGOs and independent surveys were used. The Centre for Law and Justice’s 2021 report on sewer worker conditions was a key data source. 3.Visual & Multimedia Evidence: The report was supplemented with photos and videos of workers in hazardous conditions, collected during field visits. These visuals were crucial in demonstrating the lack of safety measures. 5.Social Media & Public Engagement: After publication, the story was shared across social media platforms to amplify the workers’ voices. Labor rights organizations were engaged to push the findings to policymakers. These techniques ensured that the story was deeply researched, evidence-backed, and had a lasting impact.","This investigation offers key lessons for journalists covering labour rights and marginalized communities: 1.Persistent Field Reporting Matters: Many sewer workers were initially hesitant to speak due to fear of losing their jobs. Building trust through multiple visits and off-the-record discussions helped gain their confidence. 2.Alternative Data Sources Are Key: Government agencies often restrict access to information. In such cases, labour unions, independent surveys, and advocacy groups can provide critical insights and statistical evidence. 3.Multimedia Strengthens the Narrative: The use of photos, videos, and GIS mapping enhanced the storytelling, making the crisis more visible to policymakers and the public. Other journalists can leverage these tools to make their reports more impactful. 4.Navigating Legal & Safety Risks: Investigative reporting in politically sensitive sectors requires caution. This project ensured factual accuracy, used multiple sources for verification, and avoided direct accusations against officials to minimize legal risks. 5.Impact-Oriented Journalism Works: Engaging with labour rights organizations and activists helped amplify the report’s reach, demonstrating that investigative journalism can drive social change when strategically disseminated. Overall, this project underscores the importance of investigating overlooked labour issues, using innovative storytelling techniques, and ensuring that journalism serves as a tool for accountability and advocacy.",English,https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/1180482-a-life-of-hazards,,,,Naeem Ahmad,"Naeem Ahmed is an award-winning freelance journalist with over a decade of experience in print and digital media.

Through radio based learning, awareness campaigns and advocacy, the project aims to provide essential literacy and numeracy education, while combating violent extremism and promoting gender equality. By amplifying the voices of those affected by conflict and creating platforms for positive change, this initiative seeks to foster resilience, hope and empowerment in the face of adversity.","The impact of “Voices of Resilience” has been profound, particularly in the lives of displaced children and women in the North East. Through radio based literacy and numeracy programs, over 30,000 children affected by Boko Haram insurgency received much needed education, giving them hope for a brighter future despite the challenges they face. These educational programs not only improved their academic skills but also provided emotional support, fostering resilience and a sense of community.  The project’s awareness campaigns and advocacy efforts also played a crucial role in combating violent extremism by promoting understanding and tolerance. The media initiatives reached a wide audience, raising awareness about the importance of gender equality, women’s rights and the fight against domestic violence. Through collaboration with various partners, the project helped build stronger, more resilient communities.  Additionally, as a community correspondent, my reporting from conflict affected areas contributed to bringing attention to underreported issues, ensuring that the voices of marginalized groups were heard. Overall, the project empowered individuals, provided essential education and contributed to fostering peace, social justice and resilience within the affected communities.","“Voices of Resilience” was implemented in a challenging context marked by political instability, resource constraints and security concerns in the North East. The region’s ongoing insurgency made access to education and essential resources scarce, while safety risks often limited our ability to reach vulnerable populations. Additionally, local authorities sometimes hesitated to engage, complicating efforts to gain support for the project.  To overcome these obstacles, we relied on innovative solutions, particularly radio broadcasting, to deliver educational content. Radio was an accessible medium for displaced communities, many of whom lacked internet access or electricity. This allowed us to bypass physical barriers and reach remote areas effectively.  Data collection was another challenge, as obtaining accurate and timely information from conflict zones was difficult. We addressed this by incorporating community-based reporting, ensuring that the voices of local populations were heard.  Despite these constraints, the project successfully adapted to the political and security landscape, demonstrating the resilience of both the team and the communities we served. Our ability to leverage limited resources and technologies like radio was crucial in making a tangible impact.","“Voices of Resilience” utilized a combination of innovative tools and techniques to overcome challenges and deliver impactful results. Radio broadcasting was the primary tool used to reach displaced communities, providing accessible literacy and numeracy education to over 30,000 children. Radio was crucial, as many areas lacked internet access or reliable electricity.  We also used storytelling techniques, creating engaging songs and scripts to make lessons more memorable and enjoyable for young learners. This approach fostered both education and emotional support for children in distressing circumstances.  For advocacy and awareness campaigns, we leveraged social media platforms like Facebook to engage a broader audience, raise awareness about gender equality and combat violent extremism. Social media allowed us to reach both local and global communities, amplifying the voices of marginalized groups.  Community based reporting played a significant role in gathering real time data and feedback from the field. This allowed us to adapt our approach, ensuring the content was relevant to the evolving needs of the affected communities.  These tools and techniques enabled us to effectively navigate resource constraints and deliver education and advocacy where it was most needed.","Other journalists can learn the value of creativity and adaptability in challenging environments. Despite resource constraints, we used radio broadcasting to deliver education to displaced communities, proving that innovative technologies can reach vulnerable populations even without traditional infrastructure.  The project also emphasizes the importance of community based reporting. By engaging directly with local populations, journalists can ensure that stories are authentic, relevant and impactful. Listening to the voices of those directly affected fosters a deeper connection and ensures reporting resonates with the audience.  Collaboration is another key takeaway. In politically sensitive areas, working with local and international organizations helps overcome barriers and extends the reach of your work. Additionally, advocacy journalism can drive meaningful social change journalists can inspire action by covering issues like gender equality and extremism, not just informing but actively engaging their audience.  Lastly, the project highlights the power of empathy and human centered storytelling. By focusing on the experiences of vulnerable communities, journalists can create deeper, more impactful narratives that resonate with and motivate their audience.","English, Hausa",https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz6IN9Xak0GXZFg2NHRROVpKeHc/view?userstoinvite=amarnathsankar@gmail.com&ts=5aa1d24f,https://m.facebook.com/TudunTsira/,,,"For the Literacy and Numeracy Program.

The brokers, doctors, and government officials involved in this network buy kidneys from people in Bangladesh for 2 to 3 lakh rupees and sell them for 25 to 30 lakh rupees. To uncover this entire operation, Akodia conducted an investigation not only in India but also in Bangladesh for five days. Posing as a representative of a private hospital, he traveled 1500 kilometers across 8 districts in Bangladesh, reaching 30 kidney donors and recipients. In order to understand the modus operandi of the nexus, he struck deals with the brokers.","Following the expose, the police registered a case to investigate the organ trading racket. The government formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the matter. So far, 15 people have been arrested. The government has revoked the license of Fortis Hospital, a private institution, to conduct transplants. The authorization committee at the Government Medical College in Jaipur, which issues NoCs for organ transplants, has been restructured. Additionally, the federal health ministry has issued guidelines requiring the creation of a unique ID for each organ transplant, enabling the tracking of all transplants across the country. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also investigating money laundering in this case.","Avadhesh Akodia traveled to Bangladesh on a tourist visa. He spent five days in a foreign country without any local support or resources to expose the racket. The reporter posing as the legal consultant of a private hospital, where most of the transplants were performed, he met with both donors and recipients. For the middlemen, he pretended to be the marketing head of a private hospital in Gujarat, and for potential donors, he claimed to be a relative of patients in need of a transplant. He faced the risk of getting into trouble or being handed over to the police for impersonation if anyone discovered that he was actually a journalist on a mission.  In India, obtaining a list of people who had undergone transplants was a difficult task. The list existed only in two places—Hospital and the Health Department. Since both were involved in organ trading, the transplant lists couldn’t be obtained from there. To get the list, we sought help from the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). The second problem was finding the peoples involved in transplants in Bangladesh. To overcome this, a local driver was hired who was fluent in both languages.","- In order to expose the truth behind organ trading, I posed as a hospital representative in Bangladesh and met with kidney donors and recipients.

Also, perfumery history data is primarily written from the point of the view of the colonial powers, so the reporter had to find Sudanese people from old perfumery families in Sudan, to find data and information handed down from their families, to interview in person. This was challengeing, especially with the current war in Sudan and the displacement of people and difficulty of communication, and destruction of records in the current war.","To be able to get Sudan perfrumer data, we had to interview Sudanese people, because there was no data available in the current war situation.

This is how a former manager of the state corporation Rostec consulted with shamans and began to create new drones for war.   To do this, he attracted a Skoltech graduate, Russian nationalists and a Kyiv nuclear physicist working on a project of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).","In a month after the publication the companies mentioned in the article were sanctioned by the US: https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20240823  The post on Telegram gathered nearly 22k views: https://t.me/istories_media/6896  It was cited by major Russian and Ukrainian outlets: Meduza, Ukrainian Pravda, Hromadske, Unian, nv.ua, zn.ua,  dev.ua.","The investigation began after the anonymous founder of the design bureau boasted in an interview about an engineer working for the CERN project. The founder himself was an easy target, but for a long time, I knew nothing about the CTO of the company.  What helped me was a brief video from the UAV exhibition they were presenting at. Makhnev, the CTO of the company, appeared in the background, but there wasn’t a single frame where he was facing the camera, so I couldn’t use a face search tool to identify him.  However, his colleague standing next to him was quickly identified. I managed to find her name and track down a small store where she had previously worked. It turned out that Makhnev had left a review for the store to help boost its rating. In the review, he used an avatar with his actual photo, which helped me identify him.  Later, I scraped all the comments made by the design bureau founder on public Telegram chats. In one of the comments, there was also a reference to Makhnev, which supported my hypothesis.","I used a face search tool to identify people in the photos, and a self-written script to scrape Telegram posts, which was also extremely useful.

Pakistan,The News (https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/writer/naeem-ahmad),Small,,,The Scourge of Child Marriage,2024-03-24,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Women, Health, Economy, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","This investigative report, The Scourge of Child Marriage, published in The News, explores the devastating consequences of early marriages in Pakistan. It highlights the economic, social, and health-related costs, revealing how child marriages contribute to a loss of Rs 636 billion annually, reduce women’s labor force participation by 21%, and incur an indirect wage loss of $26.8 billion. The report incorporates firsthand accounts, expert opinions, and statistical data to expose the systemic issues behind child marriages. It also sheds light on legislative efforts to raise the minimum marriage age and enforce stricter penalties to protect vulnerable children.","The report sparked nationwide debate on child marriage, engaging policymakers, activists, and media professionals. It was widely shared on social media and referenced by advocacy groups working to raise the legal marriage age to 18 across Pakistan. Human rights organizations, including the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), cited the report in their campaigns and discussions with lawmakers. The piece also had a direct impact on affected communities. NGOs working on child protection, such as Rahnuma, used the findings to strengthen awareness sessions in low-income areas, educating families on the economic and social consequences of early marriage. Additionally, the report encouraged discourse within the Council of Islamic Ideology and Parliament, contributing to the renewed push for the Child Marriage Restraint Act. The human-centered storytelling approach of the report made child marriage a relatable and urgent issue for a broader audience. By connecting economic data with personal narratives, the story influenced journalists, activists, and legal experts to advocate for policy changes and stricter enforcement of existing laws.","Pakistan’s political landscape presents a challenging environment for reporting on human rights issues like child marriage. Despite multiple legislative efforts, the resistance from conservative factions has hindered progress in raising the legal marriage age uniformly across provinces. Religious and cultural norms continue to justify early marriages, making it difficult for policymakers to push reforms without backlash. Resource constraints were another major challenge. Many affected families were reluctant to speak due to social stigma and fear of repercussions from their communities. Gaining access to victims required the support of local NGOs and rights activists. Legal threats also posed a challenge, as child marriage remains a politically and religiously sensitive issue. Advocacy groups working on the issue have faced harassment, and some journalists reporting on the subject have been threatened. Access to data was a key hurdle, as government agencies do not maintain updated records on child marriages. Instead, I relied on research reports from international bodies like UN Women, the National Commission on the Rights of the Child, and local organizations. By using a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative data, the report was able to paint a comprehensive picture of the crisis.","This investigative project employed a mixed-method approach, combining data journalism and field reporting to create an impactful narrative. •Data Journalism: I analyzed national and international reports, such as the Pakistan Demographic Health Survey and research by UN Women, to extract key statistics on child marriage rates, economic losses, and health impacts. Excel and Google Sheets were used for data organization and visualization. •Field Reporting: I conducted in-depth interviews with victims, activists, and policymakers. To protect the identities of underage victims, pseudonyms were used, and ethical guidelines were followed while reporting sensitive cases. •Social Media & Advocacy Engagement: After publication, I worked with human rights organizations to disseminate the report through social media campaigns and panel discussions. NGOs such as Rahnuma used the report in their outreach programs. •AI & Digital Tools: ChatGPT and other AI tools were used for data analysis and summarizing lengthy research documents efficiently. This allowed for a more comprehensive and well-researched report within a limited time frame.","This project serves as a model for impact-driven investigative journalism on sensitive social issues. Key takeaways for journalists include: 1.Combining Data and Human Stories: Numbers alone do not move people—real-life stories make the statistics meaningful. By integrating personal testimonies with hard data, journalists can create compelling narratives that resonate with policymakers and the public. 2.Ethical Reporting on Vulnerable Communities: Child marriage is a deeply personal and often traumatic issue. Ensuring anonymity, informed consent, and sensitivity in storytelling is crucial. Reporters should work with local NGOs to build trust within communities. 3.Navigating Political and Cultural Barriers: Reporting on issues like child marriage in conservative societies can attract backlash. Journalists must anticipate legal and social risks, seek institutional support, and use alternative channels such as digital media and international advocacy networks to amplify their work. 4.Building Cross-Sector Collaborations: Partnering with human rights organizations, researchers, and lawmakers can enhance the credibility and reach of investigative reports.

Pakistan,The News (https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/writer/naeem-ahmad),Small,,,Dealing with violence against children,2024-03-10,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Breaking news, Fact-checking, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","This investigative report, Dealing with Violence Against Children, exposes the systemic abuse and exploitation of child domestic workers in Faisalabad, Pakistan. It focuses on the tragic case of 11-year-old Ayesha, who was tortured to death by her employers, shedding light on the widespread violence against children in domestic labour. The report integrates first-hand accounts, police investigations, expert analyses, and statistical data to highlight the urgent need for stronger legal protections, child welfare mechanisms, and societal awareness. By leveraging data-driven journalism, the project not only documents the issue but also urges policymakers to implement child protection reforms.","The report had a significant impact in raising awareness about the brutal treatment of child domestic workers in Pakistan. By bringing Ayesha’s tragic case to public attention, it sparked outrage on social media and prompted discussions on child labour laws, law enforcement failures, and the accountability of employers. The story was widely shared by human rights activists and NGOs, including Sahil and the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau, leading to renewed calls for strict enforcement of child protection laws. Following the report’s publication, Faisalabad police intensified their investigation, and senior officers ensured that the case was properly pursued. Additionally, the National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC) acknowledged the story’s importance in advocating for stronger child protection policies. The report also inspired local journalists to investigate similar cases of child abuse in the region, contributing to a broader movement for child rights in Pakistan. The coverage strengthened public pressure on authorities to address the loopholes in child labour laws and initiate discussions on the need for a National Action Plan against child violence. By exposing systemic flaws in child protection, the project contributed to shaping narratives that demand policy reforms and legal enforcement.","Child labour remains a deeply entrenched issue in Pakistan, exacerbated by economic hardship, weak enforcement of labour laws, and lack of political will. Despite constitutional provisions such as Article 25A, which guarantees free education for children, millions remain out of school and engaged in exploitative labour. The absence of a well-defined national action plan against child abuse further enables such crimes. Access to reliable data on child abuse cases was a major challenge, as law enforcement agencies do not maintain separate records on violence against children. NGOs like Sahil and government bodies such as the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau provided fragmented statistics, requiring extensive cross-referencing and verification. Another challenge was navigating the legal and social barriers surrounding domestic labour. Many cases of child abuse go unreported due to settlements between victims’ families and perpetrators. Police officers admitted that even when cases are filed, victims’ families often withdraw complaints due to social pressure or financial incentives. Additionally, reporting on such cases carries risks. Families of perpetrators sometimes attempt to influence journalists through intimidation or legal threats. Despite these obstacles, the report persisted in exposing Ayesha’s case, pushing for justice and systemic change.","The project combined investigative journalism, data analysis, and digital storytelling to highlight the hidden crisis of child domestic labour in Pakistan. 1.Investigative Techniques: oConducted on-the-ground reporting by interviewing Ayesha’s family, law enforcement officials, child protection officers, and legal experts. oCross-checked police records, forensic reports, and statements to piece together the timeline of abuse. oUsed Right to Information (RTI) requests to obtain data from government agencies on child violence cases. 2.Data and Statistical Analysis: oAnalyzed reports from Sahil and the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau to quantify the scale of violence against children. oIdentified trends in child abuse cases by compiling scattered data from multiple sources. 3.Publication & Distribution: oPublished on The News, one of Pakistan’s leading newspapers, ensuring wide reach. oUsed social media platforms to amplify the report, engaging a broader audience.","This project provides valuable lessons for journalists covering child rights and investigative stories: 1.Humanizing Data-Driven Stories: oCombining hard data with personal stories makes investigative pieces more compelling. By focusing on Ayesha’s case while integrating broader statistics, the report painted a powerful picture of systemic failure. 2.Overcoming Data Access Challenges: oIn regions where official data is scarce or unreliable, journalists must rely on NGO reports, police records, and first-hand interviews to construct accurate narratives. Cross-referencing sources enhances credibility. 3.Navigating Legal and Social Barriers: oChild abuse cases often involve legal settlements or intimidation. Journalists must be persistent in seeking evidence and protecting sources while ensuring ethical reporting on sensitive topics. 4.Advocacy Through Journalism: oThis project demonstrates how investigative journalism can pressure authorities to act and influence policy discussions. It underscores the role of journalism in holding power to account and advocating for vulnerable communities. By integrating these strategies, journalists can uncover hidden injustices and drive meaningful change in child protection policies.",English,https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/1166309-dealing-with-violence-against-children,,,,Naeem Ahmad,"Naeem Ahmed is an award-winning freelance journalist with over a decade of experience in print and digital media.

At its launch, the federal agency promised the portal would house number plates of all vehicles registered in the country and enable the public to verify the authenticity of any number plate at the tip of their finger and help to guarantee public safety, thereby helping to curb the menace of illegal vehicle tags.  About a decade after its creation, the portal remains ineffective and unreliable.","This project was appreciated by FIJ’s audience. This was showcased in its readership statistics of almost 2,000, but its impact was beyond the statistics. Apart from readers’ varying positive comments on social media platforms, a local tech company read the story and found it useful to its work. The company reached out to FIJ to narrate how it had conceived a better and admirable tech solution capable of efficiently managing number plates and vehicle data in Nigeria, but getting official attention at the FRSC had been difficult.  As the author of the report, I gave the company a direct line of the spokesperson of the agency and I am hoping they have started a conversation around the solution.  The feedback was inspiring and indicated the impact the story had on the reading public and problem-solving entities.","In Nigeria, public agencies hardly honour freedom of information requests and in many instances, their silence has killed various story ideas by journalists. Of the 235 agencies ranked in Nigeria’s 2024 FOI Index, only 18 performed above 50%. The FRSC came 39th on the list, scoring 10 points in proactive disclosure, 5 points in level of disclosure and 20 in level of responsiveness.  From story ideation, I realised that relying on the FRSC for number plate data could prove catastrophic to the idea. I then devised a manual data gathering method, visiting various public places in four states for about three months. This enabled the project to have a diverse group of data to work with.  I describe the data gathering method as ”see-and-snap” or ”spot-and-snap” approach, using a phone to capture a vehicle number plate within sight, whether it is park on the street, roadside, in traffic or on speed. However, this method suffered a limitation in that I could collect a large docket of data. Despite this constraint, I succeeded in building my own database from scratch. I populated them into a datasheet according to the vehicle type and state where they were collected.","I made use of Flourish, a web-based data visualization platform, to present the result of the number plate verification in an interactive format. The presentation shows how many number plates had been assigned to a vehicle, unassigned and those that were invalid, according to the available data. This visualisation also indicated the state the data were obtained from.","What stood out for me was the way I was able to create a way to collect data on my own without necessarily relying on the authorities to supply the data and then verify their status on the verification portal. I believe this could serve as a lesson to other journalists.

Using OSINT techniques such as social media monitoring, reverse image searches, and metadata analysis, the project traced digital narratives to real-world settler activities. Through network analysis, we mapped the connections between Israeli extremist groups on Facebook and their organized efforts to promote settlement expansion in Gaza. The findings reveal how digital incitement translates into offline actions, challenging Meta’s claims of neutrality and demanding transparency in content moderation.","The investigation exposed how Meta’s algorithms systematically tolerated hate speech and incitement to violence against Palestinians while actively suppressing pro-Palestinian content. By analyzing 50 Israeli posts advocating settlement expansion, forced displacement, and violence, the report demonstrated how such content remained online, whereas peaceful Palestinian content was swiftly removed. This algorithmic bias directly influenced digital discourse and contributed to real-world incitement.  Findings were cited by digital rights organizations, like 7amleh, to pressure Meta into addressing its biased moderation practices. OSINT & Network Analysis and data analsys in Journalism: The investigation became a model for using OSINT techniques and network mapping to track settler incitement online and its links to real-world events.","This investigation was conducted amid an intensely polarized political landscape where Israeli authorities aggressively lobbied social media platforms to suppress pro-Palestinian content while allowing incitement to violence and settlement expansion to flourish. Meta’s content moderation policies, shaped by geopolitical pressures, created a digital ecosystem where Palestinian narratives were disproportionately censored, distorting public discourse.  Despite these challenges, the project leveraged innovative OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) techniques and network analysis to track digital incitement and its real-world impact. By analyzing Facebook groups, engagement patterns, and sentiment trends, the investigation exposed a direct link between online calls for settlement expansion and organized settler actions on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank.  The team faced legal and digital security threats, as platforms frequently suspended accounts documenting violations, while journalists covering Israeli actions risked harassment. Access to data was also a challenge, with crucial records being deleted or restricted, requiring advanced data retrieval methods.  Despite these obstacles, the project demonstrated how AI-driven moderation selectively shapes narratives, reinforcing systemic bias and digital repression. By pioneering the use of algorithmic auditing in investigative journalism, this work set a precedent for future digital rights investigations into AI governance and bias.","Excel , Python , Pim eyes, Tineye","This investigation provides crucial lessons for journalists covering digital repression, algorithmic bias, and misinformation campaigns. One of the key takeaways is the importance of understanding and analyzing how social media algorithms shape public discourse. By using OSINT techniques and network analysis, journalists can systematically track digital narratives, identify coordinated campaigns, and expose systemic biases in content moderation policies.  Another major lesson is the need for rigorous data collection and verification. By building a structured database of flagged content, this investigation demonstrated how algorithmic moderation selectively suppresses pro-Palestinian voices while allowing hate speech and calls for settlement expansion to thrive. This underscores the necessity of archiving digital evidence, cross-referencing claims, and using statistical analysis to challenge platform policies.  Additionally, journalists can learn how to navigate digital censorship and resource constraints by collaborating with civil society organizations, legal experts, and AI researchers. The project highlights the importance of persistence and adaptability in investigative journalism, as well as the need to engage in advocacy for greater transparency in content moderation policies.

Foram identificados diversos exemplos envolvendo empresas como Allianz, Mapfre, Scor e Tokio Marine, mostrando a concessão de seguro para plantio dentro de fazendas embargadas por desmatamento ilegal ou em terras indígenas onde a produção agrícola de larga escala é proibida. A investigação também revela casos em que companhias garantiram apólices para fazendeiros flagrados por autoridades empregando trabalho escravo.","Após a revelação dos casos, o governo federal anunciou a implementação de um sistema de verificação oficial para evitar a concessão de subsídios governamentais a apólices de seguro em áreas desmatadas ilegalmente, dentro de áreas indígenas ou com histórico de uso de mão de obra escrava (https://reporterbrasil.org.br/2024/02/integra-das-respostas-enviadas-para-o-especial-sobre-seguros-agricolas/). Já a organização Eko lançou uma campanha para pressionar a seguradora suíça Swiss Re, uma das retratadas, a parar de oferecer cobertura de seguros a fazendas com irregularidades ambientais (https://action.eko.org/a/swiss-re-stop-insuring-deforestation-now?rd=1&source=fwd). A investigação também ganhou o VI Prêmio Cláudio Weber Abramo de Jornalismo de Dados, na categoria “Investigação” (https://ok.org.br/noticia/vencedores-6a-edicao-premio-claudio-weber-abramo/).","Esta investigação revelou, pela primeira vez no Brasil, como falhas de controle na concessão de seguros agrícolas fazem com que grandes multinacionais do ramo assinem apólices de seguro rural com fazendeiros que cometeram irregularidades em sua produção- por exemplo, terem sido flagrados utilizando mão de obra análoga à escravidão, produzindo em terras indígenas ou em áreas embargadas por desmatamento ilegal. Segundo as políticas internas destas companhias, essas irregularidades deveriam barrar a assinatura dos contratos. Além disso, todos os seguros firmados por estas empresas foram contratados através de um programa de subvenção do governo federal, que paga parte do valor das apólices com dinheiro público. O governo, no entanto, também não estava fazendo nenhum tipo de verificação prévia para evitar financiar fazendeiros que cometem estas irregularidades. No Brasil, a manutenção de negócios com áreas embargadas por desmatamento, onde foi flagrado o uso de mão de obra escrava ou situadas em terras indígenas já é objeto de restrições financeiras ou comerciais por parte de grandes bancos e industrias. O setor de seguros, no entanto, ainda carecia de políticas semelhantes quando a investigação foi realizada.","A equipe da Repórter Brasil buscou informações de apólices contratadas por meio do Programa de Subvenção ao Prêmio do Seguro Rural (PSR), do Ministério da Agricultura, cujos conjuntos de dados estão disponíveis no portal de dados abertos do governo federal. Todos os contratos de seguro assinados via PSR divulgam o nome da seguradora contratada, do produtor beneficiado e uma coordenada geográfica das propriedades seguradas. Cruzamos estes dados com cadastros fundiários e registros de fiscalizações ambientais, também públicos. Por fim, cruzamos os cadastros fundiários das áreas onde incidia o seguro com mapas georreferenciados de Unidades de Conservação, Terras Indígenas e outras áreas onde a lei proíbe a produção agrícola no contexto apoiado pelas apólices de seguro. Dessa forma, chegamos a uma lista de casos com potenciais problemas, que foram também objeto de apurações complementares à distância e também com equipes enviadas a campo. Foi produzido inclusve conteúdo audiovisual retratando conflitos de terra com indígenas em áreas apoiadas pelas seguradoras, bem como a presença de planios segurados em territórios desmatados ilegalmente.","A utilização de bancos de dados públicos é uma ferramenta eficaz para fomentar discussões sobre irregularidades que precisam ser sanadas,  como as retratadas neste trabalho jornalístico. Os caminhos para utilizar esses dados, entretanto, muitas vezes ainda são pouco explorados, seja pela falta de formação técnica para utilizá-los de forma efetiva, seja pela dificuldade de acesso imposta por diversas instâncias governamentais. Assim, o trabalho realizado contribui para a divulgação desses caminhos e metodologias, que podem ser aplicados também em outras investigações. Além disso, a investigação chamou atenção para uma temática até então pouco explorada, ou seja, as atividades criminosas ou predatórias apoiadas por seguradoras no meio rural. Tratar do tema é fundamental, tendo em vista a importância do seguro rural, uma indústria hoje bilionária, para a expansão da atividade agropecuária não só no Brasil, mas também em diversos outros países.","Português, Inglês",https://reporterbrasil.org.br/dossie-seguro-agricola/,https://reporterbrasil.org.br/2024/02/dinheiro-publico-pagou-seguro-para-lavouras-em-fazendas-desmatadas-ilegalmente/,https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Monitor_Seguros_dez23_EN_V7.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tBaAbVd8hk,"Reportagem e pesquisa: Poliana Dallabrida, Isabel Harari, Gil Alessi, Bruna Bronoski, Carolina Motoki e Ruy Sposati Edição: Naira Hofmeister Coordenação: André Campos","Considerada o principal centro de informações sobre combate ao trabalho escravo no Brasil, a Repórter Brasil ampliou sua área de atuação ao longo dos anos e hoje, com cobertura variada sobre violações de direitos humanos e questões socioambientais, tem influenciado na formulação de políticas públicas e servido como referência para outros veículos de imprensa.

This data story offers a multi-dimensional reasoning of India’s failure at the Olympics. It sheds light on the economical as well as buereucratic factors.   The project garnered about five thousand clicks. But the more important metric it achieved was the average session duration over three minutes, which is way more than what an average story of our website sees. The high engagement garnered on a sports story is also unique for a publisher like us who doesn’t cover sports extensively.","My lack of coding knowledge reflects in the story as the whole story was produced in a scrollytelling presentation with the help of a third-party tool.   Resource constraints in our small newsroom meant that most of the execution was undertaken by one person in a short span of time.

We partnered with environmental health scientist Tatiane Moraes to uncover new data and conducted a series of interviews on the ground. Our findings were alarming: children living in Brazil’s top agricultural regions are significantly more likely to suffer from severe illnesses and even death due to pesticides. The piece was published in English, Portuguese, and Spanish.","The story was one of the most read on Dialogue Earth’s website (in Portuguese) and received the highest engagement on their social media accounts to date. The article received 1st prize at Brazil’s Human Rights Journalism Award in the reporting category, and our findings were cited in a report by the Brazilian Association of Collective Health (ABRASCO). Perhaps most striking, just weeks after our article was published, Brazil’s President Lula da Silva delivered a passionate speech condemning ”excessive pesticide use”—a topic he had previously avoided. While we can’t say for sure if our investigation influenced his speech, we were surprised and heartened when he said these chemicals are ”killing children.”  In the United States, the story also gained some attention. We were recently interviewed by the Association of Health Care Journalists (https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2025/02/two-journalists-discuss-investigation-on-pesticides-and-childrens-health-in-brazil/) and the Open Notebook (https://www.theopennotebook.com/2025/01/14/using-open-data-to-sharpen-science-stories/). What’s more, I’ve been invited to speak at the upcoming Society of Environmental Journalism (SEJ) conference in April about covering pesticides. I hope to influence other reporters to focus on this important topic.","We could only do this work thanks to a reporting grant from the International Women’s Media Fund (IWMF) that allowed us to spend six months uncovering and cross-referencing health and agricultural databases. Once we had the data, we wanted to put a human face to the statistics. We contacted more than 100 sources to find those willing to share stories of pesticide-related illnesses. However, most of them worked in agribusiness and feared retaliation from their employers if they spoke out. The agricultural sector in Brazil is extremely powerful--one of the reasons pesticides lack regulations. After weeks of searching, we found a few families willing to go on the record, including relatives of a young girl named Maria, who never walked or spoke due to severe congenital anomalies attributed to pesticide exposure.","We worked with health scientist Tatiane de Moraes to cross-reference data from Brazilian public databases to investigate the incidence of certain childhood illnesses in areas with high pesticide usage. While we posed research questions and objectives, Moraes used the free software “R Project for Statistical Computing” (https://www.r-project.org) to cross-reference and find patterns in this data. It was truly a partnership, and we would not have been able to find results without her guidance and expertise.","We can (and should) rethink the traditional roles of journalists and scientists.

Although specific information about the direct impact of this particular report is not available, the situation it describes has gained attention from various organizations and media outlets.  For example, in August 2024, the Medellín Mayor’s Office, in collaboration with other institutions, rescued 65 minors at risk of exploitation in the city’s streets. These actions were carried out through 856 territorial patrols aimed at preventing child begging, child labor, and the sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. (medellin.gov.co)  Additionally, journalistic reports have highlighted an increase in the number of minors ending up on Medellín’s streets due to factors such as domestic violence, sexual exploitation, and drug addiction. These issues have been worsened by deficiencies in government programs and other social challenges. (elcolombiano.com)  In summary, while there is no specific data on the direct impact of the mentioned report, the issue of minors on the streets of Medellín has sparked institutional and media responses aimed at addressing and mitigating this crisis.","Political Social Landscape:  The current situation of minors experiencing homelessness in Medellín and how public policies have (or have not) addressed this issue. The impact of armed conflict, drug trafficking, and violence on the vulnerability of these children. Resource Limitations:  Financial and logistical challenges in producing the report. Restrictions on access to shelters, government agencies, or affected communities. Legal and Security Threats:  Potential risks faced by journalists when investigating and documenting cases of child exploitation and organized crime. Legal challenges in protecting the identity of interviewed minors and complying with privacy regulations. Access to Data and Sources:  The difficulty of obtaining official and reliable information on the number of children living on the streets and institutional efforts to address the issue.

The city’s heavy reliance on groundwater for drinking and commercial use, coupled with extraction rates exceeding recharge, has led to this alarming situation. Reports indicate that Lucknow extracts groundwater at 105% of its recharge capacity, placing it in the ”over-exploited” category. This issue is exacerbated by factors like population growth, urbanization, and unregulated water use.   I originally wrote this story in Hindi and am submitting its English translation.","This report aims to highlight the historical background of Lucknow, where water was once abundant but is now severely impacted due to uncontrolled, unchecked, and unsustainable groundwater usage. I used available data to illustrate the dire situation and also calculated the millions of liters of freshwater extracted from the earth, which remains unchecked. To showcase this, I used the example of car washes and calculated the unregistered groundwater usage, pointing out that the situation is much more complicated than what the data reflects. The report received promising feedback, with one significant comment being that it was shared with the concerned department officials.","I immersed myself in various data sets, research papers, and annual groundwater reports to piece together a complete picture of the situation. It’s impossible to fully understand the problem from just one report, as official documents often conceal the more alarming truths. In this story, while highlighting the critical groundwater situation in the city, I addressed two key issues: first, the unchecked extraction of millions of liters of freshwater, which is a major concern, and second, I questioned the credibility of groundwater assessments. I examined how the government’s changing methodology may be obscuring the true state of groundwater, which could impact future assessments of the resource.","For this report, I utilized several tools and techniques to analyze and present the data effectively. I used Google Sheets for performing various calculations, including the estimation of unchecked groundwater extraction, to give a clear picture of the situation.

Although two visualizations are in Hindi, I can provide translations if needed. Additionally, I obtained specific data for this report directly from the Groundwater Department of Uttar Pradesh, which was crucial for understanding the local groundwater situation and assessing the full scale of the problem.","Other journalists can learn a lot from this project. First, it shows how important it is to look at different sets of data and reports to get the full picture of a problem, like groundwater depletion. By using a variety of sources, journalists can reveal a more complete story than what is presented in official reports.  Second, it’s important to question official data. This project looks at how groundwater data is collected and shared, and points out issues with the way it’s presented. This shows how journalists can dig deeper and uncover the full truth.  Lastly, the story demonstrates how data should be connected to real-world examples that readers can easily understand. By using examples like car washes to explain water usage, the story makes complex data more relatable.  Overall, this project teaches how investigative journalism, combined with data and clear storytelling, can help hold authorities accountable and start important conversations.","Original language Hindi, provided translated English pdf file",https://indiaspendhindi.com/cover-story/lucknow-city-is-spending-future-groundwater-right-now-927445,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BxdR0AUhro1R-OJenFQ1FRQM1NjPRorH/view?usp=drive_link,,,Varsha Singh,"I am Varsha Singh, an independent journalist based in Dehradun, covering environmental issues across India since 2017.

It reveals how online accounts falsely claimed the demonstrations were funded by the LGBTQ+ community to ”advance their agenda.” Using the hashtag #GayZ, fabricated graphics, and manipulated news items from credible media houses, the campaign sought to mislead the public. By targeting homophobic sentiments and even faking statements from religious institutions, the orchestrators aimed to discredit the protests and shift public perception. This project uncovers the tactics used to weaponize misinformation against social movements.","The project exposed the deliberate spread of misinformation aimed at discrediting the Gen Z-led protests. By uncovering the coordinated effort behind the #GayZ narrative, it shed light on how online disinformation manipulates public opinion, particularly by exploiting homophobic sentiments.  Encouraged critical evaluation of online content and the role of fact-checking in countering propaganda.  Provided evidence that journalists and digital rights advocates can use.","Legal threats were also a concern, as exposing coordinated disinformation networks can lead to harassment or intimidation, particularly from groups invested in controlling online narratives.","We used Meltwater to analyze the mentions and reach of the disinformation campaign, helping us track how widely the #GayZ narrative spread across different platforms. Additionally, we used Gephi for network analysis, mapping connections between accounts involved in amplifying the false narrative. These tools allowed us to identify key actors, engagement patterns, and the coordinated nature of the campaign. We also used Google Reverse Image search to debunk the images and videos used in this campaign.","Reporting on LGBTQ+ Issues in Politically Tense Situations – Journalists can learn how to cover LGBTQ+ topics sensitively, ensuring their reporting does not amplify harmful narratives, especially during protests or politically charged moments. Using Digital Data for Investigative Stories – The project demonstrates how to analyze data scraped from the internet to uncover and report on coordinated disinformation campaigns. Understanding and Countering Digital Attacks – With online smear campaigns and disinformation becoming more common, journalists can learn how to investigate and expose such tactics effectively.

Using election data, candidate profiles, and voter demographics, it highlights the barriers women face in contesting general seats. The report examines systemic issues, including patriarchal structures, party biases, and electoral laws, while incorporating expert insights and historical comparisons. By presenting data-driven evidence, the project advocates for stronger political inclusion of women. This work aligns with Sigma Awards’ mission by leveraging data journalism to uncover inequalities and promote informed discussions on gender representation in governance.","This project provided a comprehensive data-driven analysis of the gender disparity in Pakistan’s electoral process, particularly in Faisalabad’s 2024 general elections. By compiling election data, voter demographics, and expert insights, it shed light on systemic barriers that hinder women’s participation in mainstream politics. The project sparked significant discourse on the underrepresentation of women in electoral politics, gaining traction among policymakers, political analysts, and civil society organizations advocating for gender-inclusive reforms. It also brought attention to political parties’ failure to meet the mandated five percent quota for women candidates, pressuring them to reconsider their nomination strategies. The findings were widely shared on digital platforms, prompting discussions among journalists and gender rights activists about the need for electoral reforms. Additionally, the report highlighted voter suppression tactics against female candidates, exposing how patriarchal norms continue to restrict women’s political participation. Through this investigation, the project contributed to raising awareness about the importance of fair representation and encouraged debate on solutions, such as constituency-based reserved seats for women. It served as an important resource for researchers and advocacy groups pushing for policy changes to enhance women’s political empowerment in Pakistan.","Conducting this project in Pakistan’s politically charged landscape posed significant challenges, including restricted access to election data, political bias, and the pervasive influence of patriarchal structures in the electoral process. Despite Section 206 of the Election Act, 2017, mandating a minimum of five percent women candidates for general seats, major political parties largely ignored this requirement, making it difficult to hold them accountable. Access to credible election data was another hurdle. While the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) provided some statistics, granular data on female voter suppression and election-day irregularities was scarce. Conducting interviews with female candidates and election officials also required navigating political sensitivities and security concerns, as many were hesitant to speak openly. Additionally, legal and political constraints meant that independent journalists investigating electoral malpractices risked backlash, including online harassment and intimidation. Despite these obstacles, the project leveraged open-source election data, field interviews, and expert insights to build a compelling case for gender-inclusive electoral reforms. Innovative use of data analysis helped visualize the gender gap in voting patterns and political representation. This project highlights the urgent need for systemic changes to ensure women have equal opportunities to participate in Pakistan’s democratic processes.","To investigate women’s underrepresentation in Faisalabad’s general elections, I employed a combination of data analysis, digital tools, and on-the-ground reporting. 1.Data Collection & Analysis: oI extracted election data from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) website, analyzing statistics on female candidacy, voter turnout, and voting trends. oUsed Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets for data cleaning and analysis to identify patterns in women’s participation over multiple election cycles. 2.Interviews & Field Reporting: oConducted interviews with female candidates, party representatives, and election observers using Zoom and in-person meetings. 3.AI-Assisted Research & Writing: oUsed ChatGPT for summarizing reports and refining statistical narratives. oLeveraged Google Bard for fact-checking and verifying legal frameworks related to gender representation in elections. 4.Publishing & Engagement: oPublished on The News, one of Pakistan’s leading newspapers, ensuring wide reach. oUsed social media platforms to amplify the report, engaging a broader audience.","This project highlights several key lessons for journalists investigating gender representation in elections or other data-driven political stories. 1.Data-Driven Storytelling Enhances Impact oCombining quantitative data analysis with qualitative interviews provides a more comprehensive narrative. 2.Overcoming Limited Data Access oIn Pakistan, election data is often scattered and not in user-friendly formats. Journalists must manually compile, clean, and cross-check data from sources like the Election Commission of Pakistan, research reports, and past election results. oAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Bard) can assist in summarizing legal frameworks and analyzing historical trends. 3.Bridging the Gender Gap in Reporting oFemale political candidates often lack visibility in mainstream media. Journalists should actively seek out their perspectives through interviews, addressing their challenges and contributions. oThis approach challenges patriarchal narratives and pushes for more inclusive electoral coverage. 4.Leveraging Digital Platforms for Wider Reach oPublishing findings on digital platforms like Climate Call and social media can spark conversations and advocacy beyond traditional media.

Using police records, Right to Information (RTI) data, and human rights reports, the investigation reveals systemic failures in preventing child marriages and protecting minority girls from forced conversions. It highlights legal loopholes, societal pressures, and the lack of convictions despite arrests. The report amplifies voices of survivors, legal experts, and activists advocating for reforms. This project aims to drive policy change and public awareness through data-driven storytelling, holding authorities accountable for protecting vulnerable children.","This investigative project had a significant impact in raising awareness about the persistent issues of child marriages and forced conversions in Punjab, particularly in Faisalabad. By utilizing police records, Right to Information (RTI) data, and firsthand accounts, the project exposed gaps in the legal system and the challenges faced by victims seeking justice. The findings were widely shared on digital platforms, prompting discussions among policymakers, journalists, and human rights organizations. The report was cited in local advocacy campaigns, urging legislative reforms to increase the minimum marriage age to 18 for both boys and girls. It also contributed to public discourse during the election season, pressing political parties to take a stance on forced conversions and child marriage laws. Following its publication, local activists used the data to petition authorities for stricter enforcement of the Child Marriage Restraint Act. The investigation also highlighted police discrimination against minority victims, leading to renewed calls for police accountability. Most importantly, the project empowered survivors and their families by amplifying their voices. Some families received legal aid, while NGOs leveraged the findings to support affected communities. The project played a vital role in pushing for stronger protections for vulnerable children and religious minorities.","This investigative project was carried out in a complex socio-political environment where child marriage and forced conversions remain deeply entrenched issues. Despite legal provisions, enforcement is weak, and social acceptance often protects perpetrators. Many cases are settled through extrajudicial means, preventing legal action. Access to data was a significant challenge. While the Right to Information (RTI) Act helped obtain police records, bureaucratic delays and reluctance from authorities made the process difficult. Many cases go unreported due to pressure from influential community members and religious groups, making firsthand accounts crucial but difficult to obtain. Legal threats and intimidation were constant risks. Reporting on forced conversions, particularly of Christian and Hindu girls, is highly sensitive. Journalists and activists investigating these cases have faced threats from extremist groups. Victims’ families were often too afraid to speak publicly, fearing reprisals. Despite these constraints, innovative investigative methods were used, including data analysis, field reporting, and cross-referencing multiple sources. Digital tools helped track case trends, and collaboration with human rights organizations ensured credible documentation. This project sheds light on a neglected crisis, challenging societal norms and pushing for legal reforms to protect vulnerable children and religious minorities in Pakistan.","To conduct this investigation on child marriage and forced conversions in Pakistan, I employed a combination of digital tools, data analysis techniques, and traditional investigative journalism methods. 1. Data Collection & Analysis •Right to Information (RTI) Act Requests: Filed RTI requests with Punjab Police to obtain official data on child marriages. •Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT): Cross-checked police records with media reports, court cases, and NGO databases to identify discrepancies. •Google Sheets & Excel: Organized and analyzed trends from police data (e.g., location-based incidents, arrests, convictions). 2. On-Ground Reporting & Verification •Field Interviews: Conducted in-person interviews with victims, families, law enforcement officers, and activists while ensuring anonymity for safety. •Digital Voice Recorders & Note-taking Apps: Used for accurate documentation of testimonies. •Geolocation & Site Verification: Visited affected areas to verify incidents and collect firsthand evidence. 3. Multimedia & Storytelling •Social Media Monitoring: Tracked cases reported by human rights groups and journalists on Twitter, Facebook, and local news platforms. •Photo & Video Documentation: Captured visual evidence where possible, ensuring ethical considerations for victim privacy. These tools and techniques allowed me to uncover hidden patterns, highlight systemic failures, and present a compelling, data-driven narrative for advocacy and policy change.","This project on child marriage and forced conversions in Pakistan highlights key lessons that can help other journalists tackling sensitive social justice issues. 1. Leveraging Data for Impactful Storytelling Using Right to Information (RTI) requests and public records can provide credible, quantitative evidence to support investigative work. Journalists should proactively request data from government agencies and cross-check with independent sources to expose inconsistencies. 2. Ethical and Sensitive Reporting Reporting on child marriage and forced conversions requires extreme care. Protecting victims’ identities, obtaining informed consent, and avoiding sensationalism are crucial. Ensuring anonymity for vulnerable sources and using pseudonyms can help maintain their safety. 3. Combining Traditional and Digital Investigation Journalists should blend on-ground reporting with OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) techniques. Tracking cases via social media, legal documents, and NGO reports can uncover hidden trends. Using Google Earth and geolocation tools helps verify locations and testimonies. 4.

It explores how rising temperatures and increased UV radiation pose severe health risks, including skin cancer and vision impairment, while high taxes on essential protective items like sunscreen make them inaccessible to many families. Through personal stories, expert insights, and policy analysis, the report sheds light on the urgent need for inclusive policies that ensure the well-being and protection of children with albinism in a changing climate.","The ”Vulnerable Under the Sun” project had a profound impact on both public perception and policy discussions in Uganda. It sparked a national debate in Parliament, pushing for a review of tax policies on imported goods like sunscreen, which are essential for children with albinism. The story changed societal attitudes by humanizing the struggles of children with albinism, shifting the narrative from stigma to advocacy.  Impact on Journalism: The project inspired other journalists in the Rwenzori region to cover albinism-related issues with more depth and sensitivity, leading to increased media attention and more investigative reports on marginalized communities.It was shared over 10,000 times on social media, triggering public discourse. Parliament referenced the story during a policy review session. At least five local journalists published follow-up reports, continuing the conversation.","The ”Vulnerable Under the Sun” project was carried out under challenging conditions, reflecting the complex political and socio-economic landscape in Uganda. Political & Policy Context: Uganda has historically overlooked the needs of persons with albinism, with limited policies addressing their challenges. High import taxes on sunscreen and protective gear remain a major barrier, despite international human rights obligations. The story emerged in a period where Uganda’s Parliament was debating tax reforms, making it a timely intervention in shaping policy discussions.Reliable data on children with albinism was scarce, as government records do not comprehensively document their numbers and needs. Misinformation and stigma within communities also posed challenges, requiring careful engagement and trust-building to gather firsthand testimonies.To overcome data limitations, the project utilized multimedia storytelling—integrating video, photography, and data visualization to illustrate the number of children with albinism who go in daily struggles due to taxes policies and  climate change. Social media analytics were employed to track public discourse, amplifying awareness and engagement. The story was published across digital platforms, maximizing its reach and influence. Despite these challenges, the project successfully shifted public perception, influenced policy discussions, and inspired impactful journalism on albinism in Uganda.","Camera (Nikon DSLR & Smartphone Camera)  Used for capturing high-quality images to document the daily struggles of children with albinism.

Originalmente pensada para vehículos utilitarios, esta ley ha sido mal utilizada. Los congresistas venden las exoneraciones a concesionarios y particulares, quienes las aprovechan para importar autos de lujo y deportivos. Entre 2020 y 2024, se importaron 499 vehículos exonerados, de los cuales más de 170 fueron de lujo, como Porsches, Ferraris y Lamborghinis. Diario Libre ha seguido de cerca este tema, publicando datos detallados que revelan la magnitud del abuso y generando gran interés público.","Las publicaciones de Diario Libre sobre las exoneraciones de vehículos a los legisladores dominicanos estuvieron entre las notas más leídas en el tiempo en que fueron publicadas. Además, impulsaron la presentación de proyectos de ley para modificar la normativa vigente. Algunos legisladores defendieron la ley, argumentando que, si se eliminan las exoneraciones, también deben retirarse las exenciones a empresarios y otros sectores productivos. El presidente Luis Abinader pidió a los congresistas restringir tanto la importación de vehículos exonerados como el monto permitido. Los partidos de oposición también instaron a los legisladores a modificar este privilegio. Las publicaciones, que incluyeron infografías interactivas, generaron gran interés y fueron presentadas en un programa de televisión de análisis político. Actualmente, la Comisión Permanente de Hacienda de la Cámara de Diputados estudia varios de los proyectos impulsados por nuestras investigaciones, lo que demuestra el impacto significativo de estas historias en la opinión pública.","Nos interesa que el jurado evalúe el análisis del gran volumen de datos manejado y la manera de presentarlos mediante infografías amigables e interactivas.

Luego agrupamos la data por las marcas de vehículos importados para verificar la cantidad de autos de lujo y deportivos versus las convencionales. Así, nos dimos cuenta de que persiste la distorsión en el uso de este beneficio. Después, seguimos agrupando la data en otros conjuntos de datos para escribir el texto de las historias. Para diseñar las infografías nos valimos de Flourish. Hicimos una navegable en la que vaciamos la extracción de los datos más relevantes de la base de datos para que el lector pueda conocer el nombre de cada legislador a cuyo nombre se importaron vehículos, la marca, modelo, año, valor y sacrifio fiscal que representaron.  Para otra infografía muy elocuente, comparamos las declaraciones juradas de patrimonio presentadas por los legisladores que aparecen en la base de datos, para verificar si habían declarado los vehículos de lujo importados con exoneración de impuestos.

Brazil,LazCult,Small,,,Acessibilidade no cinema para pessoas com deficiência auditiva,2025-02-01,Solutions journalism,Word,"A matéria aborda a falta de acessibilidade nos cinemas para pessoas com deficiência auditiva no Brasil, um tema que ainda precisa de mais atenção. Mesmo com as tecnologias disponíveis, muitas pessoas surdas ainda não conseguem acompanhar os filmes brasileiros de forma completa. Isso acontece porque recursos como legendas descritivas, audiodescrição e Libras ainda não são aplicados de forma consistente nas salas de cinema.  O objetivo deste trabalho é mostrar que o cinema pode e deve ser para todos, e que é necessário ir além das tecnologias, garantindo que essas ferramentas cheguem de fato ao público que mais precisa delas.","Este trabalho aborda a falta de acessibilidade no cinema para pessoas com deficiência auditiva, um tema relevante para milhões de brasileiros que enfrentam dificuldades em acessar filmes nacionais. Ao destacar as experiências de Rodrigo Pontes, a matéria sensibiliza o público sobre a importância de garantir que as soluções tecnológicas, como legendas e Libras, sejam aplicadas de maneira regular e acessível em todas as salas de cinema. O impacto social se dá ao dar voz a uma minoria muitas vezes esquecida, estimulando a reflexão sobre a inclusão e a democratização do acesso à cultura.","O contexto que gostaria que o júri conhecesse é o cenário de falta de conscientização e investimento nas tecnologias de acessibilidade no Brasil. Apesar de existirem soluções tecnológicas, como legendas descritivas e audiodescrição, a aplicação dessas ferramentas nas salas de cinema é inconsistente e limitada, principalmente nos filmes nacionais. Além disso, a legislação que regulamenta a acessibilidade ainda deixa lacunas, limitando o alcance de medidas inclusivas em filmes exibidos em menos de 20 salas. A dificuldade de acesso a dados completos sobre a implementação dessas tecnologias e a falta de uma cultura de inclusão nas distribuidoras e cinemas também são desafios importantes que dificultam a inclusão total da comunidade surda no ambiente cinematográfico.","Para esta matéria, utilizei entrevistas com especialistas da área e com pessoas diretamente afetadas pela falta de acessibilidade nos cinemas, como Rodrigo Pontes, para trazer uma perspectiva real sobre as dificuldades enfrentadas. Além disso, fiz uma pesquisa sobre as tecnologias existentes, como legendas descritivas e audiodescrição, e os aplicativos que as oferecem, como o PingPlay e o MovieReading. Também utilizei dados estatísticos de estudos como o realizado pelo IBGE sobre a deficiência auditiva no Brasil para contextualizar o problema de forma objetiva e fundamentada. A combinação dessas ferramentas permitiu apresentar um panorama claro da situação da acessibilidade no cinema e as soluções que ainda estão por ser amplamente implementadas.","Este projeto pode ensinar outros jornalistas a importância de investigar e dar visibilidade a questões de acessibilidade, que muitas vezes são negligenciadas ou ignoradas. Por meio da entrevista com pessoas diretamente impactadas, como Rodrigo Pontes, é possível trazer uma narrativa humana e real sobre um tema relevante, além de usar dados e tecnologias disponíveis para embasar o discurso. Também mostra como o trabalho jornalístico pode contribuir para pressionar por mudanças, não só informando, mas sensibilizando o público e as instituições para a necessidade de inclusão. Os jornalistas podem aprender a integrar diferentes fontes, como dados, entrevistas e tecnologias, para criar matérias impactantes e de relevância social.",Português,https://lazcult.com.br/2025/02/01/acessibilidade-no-cinema-para-pessoas-com-deficiencia-auditiva/,,,,Gessica Carvalho,"Com mais de 12 anos de experiência em comunicação, é formada em jornalismo e carrega habilidade em diversas áreas, incluindo redação, mídias digitais, produção e cobertura de eventos, além de fundadora do LazCult.

Brazil,Tv Cabo Branco,Big,,,O futuro da nossa educação,2024-09-18,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Chart, Video, Audio, Elections, Politics, Women, Human rights",Drone,"Uma série de reportagens que analisa dados da educação brasileira com o recorte dos municípios da Paraíba, um estado do Nordeste do país. A intenção era aproveitar as eleições municipais para discutir os problemas educacionais. Através dos números contamos histórias emocionantes de dificuldades de acesso à educação e os impactos disso para pobreza e desigualdade social. São três reportagens sobre acesso à creche (escolas para bebês e crianças pequenas), índices de alfabetização e a qualidade da aprendizagem de crianças maiores. Na última reportagem trouxe exemplos de cidades com dados positivos e refletimos as possíveis soluções com diversos especialistas.","A série teve como foco chamar atenção dos gestores públicos para os problemas, comprovados pelos dados e pelas histórias que contamos. Como a série foi exibida durante a campanha eleitoral para prefeitos, a repercussão foi grande. Discussões públicas e o uso do material para entrevistas de candidatos, a série acabou levantando uma discussão importantíssima, escancarando para o estado um problema constante. O principal impacto foi tornar nítido que os dados devem ser utilizados para o desenvolvimento de políticas públicas que resolvam os problemas da população.","O processo de produção foi demorado e feito com muita cautela, analisamos os dados dos 223 municípios da Paraíba, estado onde fica nossa emissora de TV. Usamos uma inteligência artificial avançada para mapear os municípios com índices mais problemáticos, mas checamos, claro, todas as respostas apresentadas pela inteligência artificial. Selecionamos quais seriam os tópicos tratados, como o acesso à pré-escola, o nível de aprendizagem e de alfabetização. Assim que definimos os recortes começamos a fazer o cruzamento dos dados para, em seguida, buscar histórias de pessoas que fossem impactadas pelas realidades demonstradas pelos números. A produção e a reportagem foi feita por mim, Ana Beatriz Rocha, contamos com apenas uma editora de texto. Na TV local os recursos de estrutura são limitados, mas o cuidado, o planejamento e o protagonismo dos dados garantiu um material de altíssima qualidade, que levou o público para perto da realidade contada. Sobre o contexto político, produzir durante a campanha eleitoral foi um desafio, muitas fontes se opunham a falar, precisei ter cuidado para apresentar a realidade sem parecer que a intenção era prejudicar alguma gestão específica. O propósito era fazer a população entender porque a educação precisa estar no centro dos debates eleitorais.","Utilizamos inteligência artificial para mapear e cruzar os dados, sempre checando as informações, sem depender apenas da IA. O acesso aos dados foi através da Lei de Acesso á Informação, relatórios de entidades públicas e de organizações da sociedade civil. As técnicas usadas foram entrevistas com personagens e pesquisadores. As imagens foram feitas com câmeras profissionais, celulares e drones. O material foi gravado em diferentes cidades, fizemos viagens em diversos dias para captar as imagens e entrevistas.","Acredito que o nível de imparcialidade e a centralidade dos dados pode ajudar profissionais a entenderem como fazer materiais delicados em plena campanha eleitoral. Como os números eram nossos norteadores, conseguimos driblar os riscos de qualquer polêmica sobre a imagem de qualquer político, sendo situação ou oposição. Os caminhos tomados na checagem, na construção do texto, na abordagem nas entrevistas e na edição deixam nítido que a intenção era propor um debate público sobre educação nos municípios.   Também vejo como passaível de aprendizagem a forma como humanizamos os dados. No jornalismo é preciso entender que cada número representa uma realidade, uma família, uma criança impactada. Tivemos muita sensibilidade para mostrar, através da vida real de pessoas que sofrem com essas realidades, na hora de traduzir os dados em experiências de várias famílias.",português,https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHcIR5u2WpLQclBL0uO54EvWSrY7Xaf0j,https://g1.globo.com/pb/paraiba/noticia/2024/09/23/o-futuro-da-nossa-educacao-reveja-reportagens-da-serie-especial-do-jpb2.ghtml,https://www.instagram.com/reel/DACUKY9N9oO/?igsh=MTNsNWY4MGc1YTg5Mg==,,"Produtora: Ana Beatriz Rocha, Repórter: Ana Beatriz Rocha, Auxiliar de produção: Diogo Pinheiro, Editora de texto: Giovana Rossini, Editor de imagem: Petryck Araújo, Cinegrafistas: Bernardo Scotti - Alexandre Frazão - Beto Silva - Magno Oliveira, Drone: Joaquim Neto, Caracteres: Anderson Ferreira","Me chamo Ana Beatriz Rocha e sou uma jovem jornalista.

Na primeira parte de uma reportagem sobre o tema, a Comunidade Cultura e Arte falou com uma sobrevivente, uma psicóloga, enfermeiros, ativistas e a Direção-Geral da Saúde para compreender este fenómeno que já foi criminalizado em Portugal e para assinalar o Dia Internacional da Tolerância Zero à Mutilação Genital Feminina. Na segunda parte da reportagem, falou com entrevistados como a gestora do Gabinete de Apoio à Vítima de Lisboa e a autora de uma dissertação de mestrado acerca do tema.","A reportagem aborda a mutilação genital feminina, uma violação de direitos humanos que afeta milhares de mulheres. Visa dar voz às sobreviventes, desmistificar a prática e alertar para a necessidade de respostas integradas em Portugal, promovendo consciencialização e ação. Em território português, venceu a 12.ª edição do Prémio de Jornalismo na Área da Dor.","Entre as dificuldades, destacou-se o acesso às sobreviventes devido ao estigma e à relutância em falar sobre o tema. Entretanto, a colaboração de ativistas, especialistas e redes de apoio colmatou estes desafios, possibilitando uma abordagem ética, profunda e bem fundamentada. Entre as facilidades na realização da reportagem, destaca-se o apoio de organizações não-governamentais e ativistas que lidam diretamente com as vítimas de mutilação genital feminina. Estas instituições forneceram acesso a especialistas, estatísticas e relatos de sobreviventes, garantindo uma abordagem informada e sensível. Além disso, a colaboração de profissionais de saúde e a disponibilidade de fontes institucionais, como a Direção-Geral da Saúde, enriqueceram a investigação com perspectivas diversas e credíveis.","Relativamente a este ponto, penso que é importante referir que li muitos documentos, inclusivamente Excel, e realizei uma pesquisa extensa para entender, na sua plenitude, a realidade da mutilação genital feminina tanto em Portugal quanto no resto do mundo. A Abi Baldé, guineense de 50 anos, sobrevivente de mutilação genital feminina (MGF) três vezes, foi uma entrevistada que me marcou profundamente e que me levou, mesmo sem saber, até outras pessoas extremamente importantes para a realização deste trabalho. Acho que as ferramentas mais importantes que utilizei são simples, mas basilares no jornalismo: a investigação profunda e a realização de entrevistas extensas. Tentei partilhar com os leitores o máximo de informação possível para que ficassem elucidados acerca deste crime que, infelizmente, ainda é cometido um pouco por todo o mundo.","Sou uma jornalista em início de carreira, com 27 anos, mas creio que me dedico de corpo e alma a esta profissão e tenho a capacidade - por mais pequena que seja - de ensinar algumas coisas a colegas. Principalmente, àqueles que não trabalham tanto áreas como a dos direitos humanos e da saúde. Acredito que este trabalho pode constituir um ponto de partida para uma atenção redobrada e uma investigação cada vez mais aprofundada em relação a esta prática tradicional nefasta que acomete meninas e mulheres e tem um impacto gigante na sua saúde física e, também, psicológica.

Brazil,g1,Big,,,Exposing Justice Failures: A Data-Driven Investigation Revealed Fugitive Candidates Running in Brazil’s 2024 Municipal Elections,2024-09-18,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Elections, Politics",Python,"This project was a data-driven journalistic investigation that identified fugitive candidates running in Brazil’s 2024 municipal elections. Sparked by a reader’s comment, journalists cross-referenced information from the National Bank of Arrest Warrants (BNMP) with the Electoral Court’s Candidacy Disclosure Portal (DivulgaCand). The analysis uncovered 63 candidates with outstanding arrest warrants, including serious crimes such as homicide, robbery, and rape of a vulnerable person.  The investigation exposed communication failures and legal loopholes that allowed fugitives to run. Arrests followed publication. Beyond electoral transparency, the project spurred debate on improving data-sharing between judicial and electoral institutions.","This unprecedented investigation was replicated by several media outlets and sparked discussions on public transparency and the quality of the justice system in Brazil. Among its most relevant impacts are:  Revealed Cases: The project exposed cases such as a candidate running for office for the third time despite an outstanding arrest warrant. Another candidate was approved to run before being definitively convicted of raping a vulnerable person. This candidate was elected as a councilor’s substitute before being arrested following the report. Additionally, three individuals wanted by the Supreme Federal Court for their involvement in the January 8, 2023, coup attempt were actively campaigning despite being fugitives.  Arrest of Candidates: After publication, 36 candidates with open arrest warrants were detained across multiple states in Brazil in an unprecedented operation conducted by the Brazilian Federal Police.  Electoral Transparency: The exposure of fugitive candidates highlighted the need for stricter oversight and control in the electoral process, informing voters about candidates’ backgrounds and encouraging more conscious electoral choices.  Public and Institutional Debate: The investigation sparked crucial discussions on communication failures between the judicial and electoral systems and exposed legal loopholes that allowed fugitives to run.","Limited Access to Data The team faced challenges due to restricted access to critical data. The National Bank of Arrest Warrants (BNMP) blocked downloads from São Paulo—the largest state in Brazil—limiting searches to 30,000 rows. São Paulo represents 20% of the country’s 300,000 open warrants. To overcome this, the team submitted multiple requests for the records.  Lack of Government Transparency A major obstacle was the Electoral Court’s (TSE) removal of candidates’ CPF (Brazilian taxpayer identification number) from public records. Previously, this allowed journalists to cross-reference data and uncover legal issues. In 2024, the TSE excluded this data, forcing reporters to manually scan files to confirm identities.  Reporters verified each case manually, checking crime clearance certificates and authenticating documents via QR codes. This led to identifying 63 fugitive candidates from an initial 108 flagged cases.  Use of Large Databases and Programming The team used Python for data analysis. The code is publicly available for replication (https://github.com/juditecypreste/eleicoes-2024/blob/main/Procurados%20pela%20Justi%C3%A7a/candidatos_procurados.ipynb).  A total of 302,509 arrest warrants were analyzed, alongside 461,564 candidacies from the Electoral Court’s open data portal. The lack of CPFs complicated the investigation, requiring extensive cross-referencing to confirm the final 63 fugitive candidates.",Python: The programming language was essential for data cross-referencing. The code is publicly available for replication (https://github.com/juditecypreste/eleicoes-2024/blob/main/Procurados%20pela%20Justi%C3%A7a/candidatos_procurados.ipynb). ChatGPT: The tool was used to refine the code and assist in troubleshooting during the data analysis process.,"This project demonstrates that reality is often more complex than it seems. While it may seem obvious that individuals with outstanding arrest warrants should not be able to freely campaign for public office, the investigation revealed that fugitives were not only walking the streets but also running for elections.  This methodology can be replicated in future elections and even improved to uncover other irregularities involving candidates who should be ineligible for public office. The project also highlights the importance of open data, data journalism, and cross-referencing information to expose systemic failures and injustices.",Portuguese,https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2024/eleicao-em-numeros/noticia/2024/09/18/exclusivo-eleicoes-2024-candidatos-alvos-de-mandados-de-prisao-em-aberto.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2024/eleicao-em-numeros/noticia/2024/09/14/procurados-da-justica-pelo-8-de-janeiro-se-lancam-candidatos-e-fazem-campanha-sem-ser-presos.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2024/eleicao-em-numeros/noticia/2024/09/20/como-o-g1-fez-a-reportagem-sobre-os-61-candidatos-das-eleicoes-2024-alvos-de-mandados-de-prisao-em-aberto.ghtml,https://gijn.org/stories/reporters-found-63-political-candidates-wanted-brazilian-courts/,Reporters: Judite Cypreste and Camila da Silva Editor: Vitor Sorano,"These reports were produced by the investigative team of G1, the news portal of TV Globo."

Together with Marineschepen.nl (Netherlands), VRT NWS (Belgium), NDR, WDR, and Süddeutsche Zeitung (Germany), BBC Verify (United Kingdom), DR (Denmark), NRK (Norway), Yle (Finland), ERR (Estonia), and SVT (Sweden), we have investigated which Russian ships are mapping our critical infrastructure – such as gas pipelines, internet cables, and wind farms – and how they might be preparing for sabotage.","The investigation was published in five countries and led to multiple parliamentary questions in the Netherlands, as well as new investments in defense and detection by, among others, the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium. In all the countries involved, the publications have raised public and political awareness of the issue.","The publications resulting from the investigation would not have been possible without the underlying data research. The data team focused on creating unique databases that allowed the research team to track suspicious Russian ships. We collected all available AIS data (millions of transponder signals), public images and satellite observations from ships in the Baltic Sea and North Sea. Such a comprehensive public database did not previously exist.  Next, we developed an algorithm to identify suspicious movements of Russian ships. These included, for instance, ships that remained stationary for extended periods, deviated from their routes, or made zigzag movements.  Additionally, we investigated Russian ships which were not transmitting AIS signals but were instead sending Morse code weather reports with their position, direction, and speed. We gathered this unique dataset through anonymous sources and translated the messages into positions on a map using a novel and custom algorithm. The reliability of this data was confirmed by cross-referencing it with satellite images, information from the Estonian Navy, and our own observations at sea.  This allowed us to closely track the ”ghost ships” and determine which infrastructure they approached and when.","We used multiple data sources to track suspicious Russian ships: AIS (transponder signals), Morse code reports, and satellite imagery. Our toolbox was Python w/Geopandas, QGis with custom plugins and various Earth Observation tools. For AIS data, we created our own comprehensive database by combining public datasets from various countries. Thus we could analyze thousands of daily signals, using a bespoke algorithm to identify suspicious patterns, such as deviations from regular routes, zigzagging, or circling. Ships turning off AIS for over four hours or signal gaps of more than 200 km were also flagged.  Some Russian ships, particularly naval vessels, do not transmit AIS. However, sent Morse coded weather reports to Kaliningrad. Through anonymous sources monitoring radio frequencies, we collected 1,427 Morse messages and used Python and Qgis to translate them into ship positions, mapping their routes. To verify these data and track non-AIS or non-Morse-transmitting ships, we used satellite imagery. By combining Sentinel images (10-meter resolution) with AIS data, we located ”ghost ships.” AI models scanned images for ships, and manual checks filtered out false positives like clouds or wind turbines. Ship characteristics, such as length and color, helped confirm their identity, allowing us to map their activities with precision.","Journalists can learn several key lessons from this project. Combining diverse data sources, such as AIS signals, Morse code, and satellite imagery, provides a more comprehensive view of complex issues. When public databases are incomplete, creating unique datasets by merging available information can unlock new insights. Large datasets require automation, using algorithms to detect patterns, such as suspicious ship movements, is crucial for efficient analysis. Collaboration with experts and cross-border networks ensures access to specialized knowledge and resources. Verification is essential—cross-referencing data from multiple independent sources, like Morse code and satellite imagery, enhances credibility.

United Kingdom,"Nikkei, Nikkei Asia",Big,,,Japan’s football talent takes Europe by storm,2024-12-09,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Sports","Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, Json, R, RStudio","Last year, the number of Japanese footballer players - both male and female - in major European leagues surpassed 100, a record high and representing a 90% increase in the past five years. We undertook a huge data processing task, scraping and manually collecting details on every Japanese football player to have played in Europe this millennium. We explained to readers how the Japanese national teams continue to punch above their weight and how success on the international stage has encouraged overseas clubs to offer money and opportunities to players from Japan.","We wanted to highlight how well Japan is doing when it comes to football, the improvements that have been made in recent years and fundamentally provide a positive news story to inspire Nikkei readers.  The story received a lot of attention and praise from within Japan. So much so, that the story was commissioned to be published not only in Japanese on Nikkei.com - https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/japan-soccer/, but also subsequently in English on the Nikkei Asia website - https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/japan-soccer/. This rarely happens with visual and data stories.  According to a recent survey, football (or soccer) is the third most popular sport in Japan, following baseball and Sumo Wrestling. But whilst those two sports are covered in-depth, football is often an afterthought. We delivered an in-depth investigation of the current state of Japanese football to provide fans with the opportunity to learn something new and explore the data for themselves.  From its publication on December 9th until January 23rd, the story had over 25,000 page views across the two language versions.","The data for this project was collected programmatically from several sources. In total, the information on more than 1000 footballers was gathered. We had data on career history, playing stats, age, birthplace and the players approximate transfer value over time. This then had to be painstakingly manually cross-referenced with other sources to ensure we had all the information we needed to tell the story in an accurate way.  This comprehensive dataset of Japanese footballers is something that has never been collated before - even by the country’s official football association -  and so we wanted to present this information in a way that let readers explore it for themselves. The “playing card” format we chose was to allow readers to dive down into the details on individual players. We wanted to keep the article fun and informative at the same time.  Furthermore, each of the cards were hand-designed by the team of designers on the project. We wanted to give a truly rich, engaging feel to the content, so we thought it was best to spend a considerable amount of time to handcraft the cards as beautifully as we could.","For the data analysis, we used the R programming language. The main difficulty was joining together data sources, as we wanted to not only have basic information like name and age, but also more detailed information such as transfer history over a player’s career.  We joined data together using fuzzy matching of players names, as sometimes the names or format differed within different sources. We then manually checked the matches to ensure that the data was correct and accurate.  The front-end application was built using React and Typescript. For the carousel player cards at the beginning of the piece, we made use of the Javascript library “Swiper”. We wanted the carousel to have an endless loop to allow readers to really get lost in the data. Furthermore the “shuffle” players option underneath was to give readers the opportunity to see the vast number of player cards we had prepared. Finally, we decided to present all of the playing cards at the end of the piece, with different filters, to really allow readers to explore all of the players and find their favourites.  The charts in the piece were built using d3.js.","The benefits of doing your own data research and collection. By doing our own analysis we were able to provide impactful top lines and create a dataset that had previously not been done.  This project also highlights the importance of manually checking work pulled together programmatically. This is a vital step in ensuring accuracy and also thinking of top lines to pull out from the data.  Furthermore, journalists should always be thinking of novel ways to present the big datasets they collect. We really wanted to give readers the ability to search the data for themselves and by taking our time to think about how best to do this, we were able to do so in a really engaging and beautiful way.  The story would not have been possible without the data collection process, but it was the visual elements that really brought the story to life. Journalists should be always thinking not only about the top lines and the data, but also about how best to present this to readers.","English, Japanese",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/japan-soccer/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/japan-soccer/,https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Sports/Infographic-Japan-s-football-talent-takes-Europe-by-storm,,Dan Clark Yusuke Hinata  Gaku Ito Toru Yamada Yuta Tsunashima Akira Ikeya,"This project was created by Dan Clark, Senior Graphics Journalist at the Financial Times, and members of Nikkei’s Visual Storytelling team, Yusuke Hinata (比奈田悠佑), Gaku Ito (伊藤岳), Toru Yamada (山田達), Yuta Tsunashima (綱島雄太) and Akira Ikeya (明 池谷).

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,,,Guardian Visuals and Data elections coverage,2024-07-04,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics","D3.js, QGIS, CSV, Preact, AWS, Svelte, MapLibre","2024 was a huge year for elections – and the Guardian was there to cover them visually. Whether that’s the globally-significant US presidential election or the local council elections in England, the team rose to the task of creating multiple live trackers and analysis projects for several elections at once. We approached this challenge in new ways: both technically in terms of working practices – how could we possibly meet the demands of the newsroom with so many elections to cover? But also journalistically – how could we cut through the noise to tell our readers what was happening and why it mattered.","Election live trackers perform a public service in collating, interpreting and communicating results. In some cases, these aren’t published centrally anywhere outside of news organisations. This journalism enables citizens to engage in the democratic process live but accurately.  The Guardian, with its global audience, took great care to tell the story of the live election results in a way that was simple, immediate, and that gave readers the results but also explained how the electoral systems worked. Our elections pieces collectively gained millions of engaged reader minutes, with our biggest stories being the US and UK results pages. Analytics showed that our readers engaged with our analysis pieces significantly, indicating readers were taking time to explore and interact with the stories. Reader comments proved that the time we put into UX testing paid off, with people in particular commenting on the easy usability of the map interactions.  It’s essential that people are able to get timely, open, accessible, informative and interesting election results and analysis in a democracy. Whether that’s the results pages or the analysis pieces that digs into the shifts underneath the headline numbers, our overall package hits well with our readers because they covered all the bases.","We knew that the US elections could be contested and the days after the election could be fraught. That meant that we prepared several components, graphics and visual features that would help tackle these cases: for example, communicating the uncertainty when a race is only ‘leaning’ one way, or trying to analyse how many votes were left to count. In the end these weren’t necessarily for the story that unfolded, but they were still essential parts of our preparation for our coverage.  For the UK election, we also anticipated that a key challenge would be in explaining to readers constituency boundary changes. If they didn’t understand the boundary review, how on earth were they doing to make sense of results that compared the 2024 vote to a “notional result” for 2019? We handled this by explaining the new boundaries on the page, but also by laying the groundwork months in advance with explainer pieces, graphics and the like, in tandem with the wider newsroom, so that our audience understood this key feature of the election.","The projects consist of javascript applications built with Preact. The team built a library of Preact components intended to be reutilised across different election pages. The choropleths were taken from US Atlas (for US elections) or compiled in Qgis using Boundary Commission data (for UK elections). The cartograms were drawn in Adobe Illustrator and converted to geojson using custom scripts. The data feed from the various providers (AP, PA, EU) was fetched and processed at regular small intervals by an AWS Lambda and served to the client pages. The pages were also updated server-side at regular intervals using Github Actions tasks. The analysis pages were made using Svelte and a variety of visualisation frameworks. This included MapLibre for our maps and D3 for charts and graphics.","A core innovation for the Guardian’s Visuals team when approaching 2024 – the year of elections – was our development of a elections components library. The idea was that a lot of the technical and visual parts of results pages were repeatable, and so if we made them into components we could repeat them across projects – especially when those projects overlapped concurrently.  Related to this was our focus on templating. We worked hard to better template our analysis graphics so that we could respond to whatever results scenario presented itself to us. This meant producing a series of graphics – some of which were never published – that would cover a series of potential stories. These were fed by content which several colleagues could edit easily and quickly. This allowed us to be incredibly responsive, launching interactives several hours after the full results were crystalised. For both the UK and US elections, our interactive elections analysis pieces were one of the first published among major national publications.  These pieces were only possible because of a significant amount of forward planning and templating. This enabled us to tackle a greater range and quantity of elections stories, often balancing several at once across the team.",English,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2024/jul/04/uk-general-election-results-2024-live-in-full,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/us-election-results-map-2024-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris-president,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/the-key-swings-that-handed-trump-the-white-house-a-visual-analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2024/jul/05/eleven-charts-that-show-how-labour-won-by-a-landslide,"Ashley Kirk, Ed Gargan, Niels de Hoog, Alex Clark, Anna Leach, Seán Clarke, Antonio Voce, Pablo Gutiérrez, Rich Cousins, Harry Fischer, Garry Blight, Will Craft, Andrew Witherspoon, Lucy McCormick, Philip McMahon, Carmen Aguilar García, Pamela Duncan and Lydia McMullan","Guardian Visuals and Data team, and the Design team."

We then visited those ”hot spots,” talking to neighbors and capturing their experiences-- which were often much different than people living just a few blocks away. The map also includes a continually-updating layer that includes information about every person who dies by gunfire throughout the city in a given year.","The map and accompanying narrative story continue to be an important resource for local leaders, politicians, nonprofits and everyday residents to understand where gun violence happens and think about possible solutions. At a time when crime statistics can be weaponized politically, this map cuts through the sensationalism and noise and shows the truth about gun violence in the city. It demonstrates that most of the city is safe, while allowing those in the ”hot spot” areas to feel seen and heard.","This project was a massive undertaking for a small newsroom like ours, with only one data reporter and one crime reporter. Though the data used to create this project comes from an open NYPD database, it doesn’t exist anywhere in such a concentrated, accessbile form for residents, so we were doing something completely unique by creating this map. Additionally, the NYPD does not differentiate between gun homicides and other kinds of homicides, so there is no other record of how many people die across the city due to gunfire alone. To obtain gun homicide data, a reporter has to manually check each NYPD homicide alert, comb through to see if a gun was involved, add the relevant information to a spreadsheet and geocode it. The map also includes people who have died by gun suicide and in police-involved shootings, which involves even more digging, as there is not much transparency around either of those categories. The map is an ever-evolving entity that will be continually updated in perpetuity by reporters who care about this project. It will continue to serve as a way to fact-check claims about public safety in real time.","We used Felt to make the map, google spreadsheets to organize our data, and open records to find much of the data. We also collaborated with criminology experts to come up with the visuals of how the map would look and what kind of data it would include.","Mapping is a tremendously effective way to highlight an issue that affects an entire city. The power of data visualization is tremendous, cutting through false claims and inaccuracies to show people what’s really happening. A map can also immediately show poeple how a particular issue impacts them in their neighborhood, so there’s something for everyone to learn from it.",English,"https://felt.com/embed/map/Shooting-incidents-2020-2024-Fys2mFFvT8CdwXyM9CF9BEzC?loc=40.7077,-73.9385,10z&legend=0&logo=1",https://gothamist.com/news/hot-spots-nypd-data-shows-most-shootings-occur-on-the-same-blocks-year-after-year,https://gothamist.com/news/new-york-city-gun-violence-map,,"Brittany Kriegstein, Jaclyn Jeffrey-Wilensky","Brittany Kriegstein covers breaking news and crime for WNYC and Gothamist, with a focus on gun violence and how it affects New Yorkers every day.

Para hacerlo más dinámico, se incluyó una animación de Joan Gamper, fundador del club, simulando que camina por la línea de tiempo al interactuar con botones. Además, se implementó un menú superior para facilitar la navegación, ofreciendo una experiencia visual atractiva y accesible que combina historia, datos y diseño interactivo.","El proyecto tuvo un impacto significativo, especialmente durante la celebración de los 125 años del FC Barcelona. Su formato interactivo y visualmente atractivo captó la atención tanto de aficionados como de medios de comunicación. Fue destacado en RAC1, la radio del grupo Godó, donde se elogió su originalidad y capacidad para narrar la historia del club. Además, varios youtubers analizaron en detalle el timeline, resaltando su enfoque innovador y su capacidad para evocar anécdotas y recuerdos de las victorias más emblemáticas.","Es importante que el jurado conozca el contexto creativo y técnico detrás de este proyecto, que va más allá de lo que se aprecia en la obra final. Uno de los mayores desafíos fue innovar en la presentación de un timeline tradicional, transformándolo en una experiencia interactiva y lúdica. La inclusión de Joan Gamper, el fundador del FC Barcelona, como un personaje que ”camina” por la línea de tiempo, fue una decisión clave para hacer el recorrido más ameno y atractivo. Esta idea buscaba simular un juego, motivando a los usuarios a explorar los 125 años de historia del club de manera completa y entretenida.","En primer lugar, diseñamos 7 ilustraciones que representaban la secuencia de Joan Gamper caminando, las cuales se utilizaron para dar vida al personaje y hacer el recorrido más dinámico. Estas ilustraciones fueron integradas mediante un script en JavaScript que gestionaba la transición y el efecto de caminata, controlando la dirección (derecha o izquierda) en función de la interacción del usuario. Implementamos botones interactivos que no solo controlaban la animación de Joan Gamper, sino también el scroll horizontal del fondo. Esto creó la ilusión de que el personaje caminaba por la línea de tiempo, añadiendo un componente lúdico y atractivo para el usuario.  En cuanto a la visualización de los trofeos ganados cada año, utilizamos D3.js, una biblioteca de JavaScript especializada en visualización de datos. Esta herramienta nos permitió generar gráficos dinámicos y personalizados basados en los datos históricos del club, facilitando la creación de visualizaciones para cada una de las 125 temporadas.  Además, implementamos un menú superior que mostraba al usuario en qué parte del timeline se encontraba, permitiéndole saltar rápidamente a diferentes periodos sin tener que recorrer manualmente los 125 años.

Además, se profundiza en el análisis del tiempo de dominio y control en el suelo, proporcionando una perspectiva técnica y detallada que permite comprender la dinámica de los enfrentamientos en la UFC. Este enfoque busca acercar el mundo de las artes marciales mixtas a un público menos familiarizado.","El proyecto ha tenido un impacto significativo, posicionándose como una de las noticias más vistas en el medio debido al creciente interés en las artes marciales mixtas, impulsado por la figura de Ilia Topuria, un peleador residente en España con una fuerte presencia mediática y una amplia difusión en redes sociales. La combinación de un análisis técnico detallado con la relevancia del deporte y la popularidad del atleta ha captado la atención tanto de aficionados como de nuevos seguidores, consolidando el proyecto como un referente informativo y contribuyendo a la expansión del conocimiento sobre la UFC en España.","Aunque dominamos el análisis de los combates de la UFC, nos enfrentamos a la falta de métricas específicas, como el tiempo exacto que los peleadores mantienen a sus rivales en sumisión. Para solucionarlo, revisamos manualmente cada combate y desarrollamos una estructura en Excel que nos permitió contabilizar segundo a segundo el estado de los contrincantes, lo que facilitó la creación de un trimap que visualiza el tiempo de dominio y sumisión en los combates.  Además, uno de los logros más destacados fue la creación de una visualización innovadora para representar la duración de los rounds, que ha sido adoptada por otros medios como referencia para mostrar la evolución temporal de los combates UFC posteriores.","Empleamos un conjunto de herramientas y tecnologías que nos permitieron crear visualizaciones dinámicas, precisas y atractivas.

The lack of safety equipment led to 12 deaths and 8 survivors. Balochistan’s mines, which employ over 60,000 workers, face frequent accidents due to outdated methods, inadequate safety measures, and negligence by owners and inspectors. In 2023, 68 miners died in similar incidents. Experts call for stricter enforcement of safety laws and improved training to prevent tragedies in Pakistan’s largest coal-producing region.","The project shed light on the heartbreaking realities faced by coal miners in Balochistan, emphasizing their daily struggles and the dangers they endure to support their families. It brought attention to the loss of lives due to negligence, lack of safety measures, and inadequate emergency responses. The project led to a special inquiry initiated by the Department of Mines and Minerals Balochistan and the formation of a new policy in November 2024 to ensure better safety measures in mines, aiming to protect miners and honor their sacrifices.","The project was undertaken in a highly challenging and hostile environment, where accessing reliable data was a significant hurdle. Many mining accidents go unreported due to a lack of proper documentation and pressure from powerful stakeholders. Throughout the investigation, there was resistance from mine owners, including intimidating behavior aimed at discouraging the reporting of unsafe practices and exploitation. These threats created an atmosphere of fear, highlighting the risks faced by those attempting to expose negligence.    The political landscape of Balochistan, marked by corruption and weak regulatory enforcement, further complicated efforts to hold mine owners accountable. Legal threats, resource constraints, and limited access to advanced tools for data collection added to the difficulties. Despite these challenges, the project relied on courageous fieldwork, interviews with miners and experts, and fragmented data to shed light on the unsafe conditions and systemic neglect in coal mines. This work aimed to bring about meaningful change by amplifying the voices of vulnerable miners and pushing for stricter safety measures and accountability.","For this project, I used Canva to design interactive visuals and present data effectively, including graphs and infographics, making complex information more accessible. Google Advanced Search helped locate specific and reliable information from credible sources. I employed Excel for organizing and analyzing data, creating trends, and identifying patterns. Field interviews and on-ground reporting provided firsthand accounts and context. Smartphone recording tools were used to capture audio and video evidence. Additionally, I utilized social media platforms to track real-time developments and corroborate stories. Combining these tools and techniques ensured accurate, engaging, and well-rounded storytelling to highlight the miners’ plight effectively.","Other journalists can learn the importance of perseverance and empathy when reporting in challenging environments. This project highlights the need to prioritize the voices of vulnerable communities, navigate data gaps creatively, and remain committed despite intimidation.

Even with anti-corruption institutions in place, many officials and businessmen evade accountability. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion, numerous figures have fled or sought asylum abroad, including in the UK, EU, Israel, and UAE.  Recently, Hennadiy Boholiubov, ex-co-owner of PrivatBank and a key player in the “Privat” group, reportedly outmaneuvered law enforcement and surfaced in Vienna or London. At 62, with five underage children, Boholiubov faced no legal travel restrictions when he crossed the border. Ukrainska Pravda delves into how he managed to leave and the controversies surrounding his escape.","The article was actively shared on social media (thousands of reposts and comments on platforms like Facebook, Telegram, and X). After publication, there was an increase in public debate about the responsibility of elites during the war, as well as calls for enhanced border control for officials and businessmen. The article became an example of investigative journalism, inspiring colleagues to examine similar cases of Ukrainian elites fleeing the country. New materials on other similar incidents have already emerged. Following the publicity, law enforcement began investigating the circumstances of Boholiubov’s departure.","The article addresses the crucial issue of oligarchs and high-ranking officials leaving the country during wartime, directly tied to the political situation in Ukraine and increasing public tension around elite accountability. As with many investigations, there were resource limitations, particularly in accessing specific documents and individuals who could reveal additional details. Access to sensitive data, such as documents that could confirm illegal actions or evasion of responsibility, was restricted, so part of the investigation relied on open sources and testimonies, which also influenced the perception of the material. The use of social media for gathering information and disseminating the material played a key role in the project’s success. Modern technologies and open data helped uncover new details about Boholiubov’s departure.","State registries, public documents, and information available through government platforms were utilized to establish facts about the oligarch’s departure. Social media platforms, including Facebook, Telegram, and X, provided additional information and eyewitness accounts, helping reconstruct the timeline of events and identify possible escape routes. Gathering testimonies from sources with knowledge of Boholiubov’s departure and other individuals involved was a critical element, despite significant limitations in accessing specific individuals. By analyzing media publications, documents on various platforms, and open sources, we collected data that confirmed certain aspects of the escape.","- How to effectively analyze state registries and public documents to gather facts. - How to engage witnesses through platforms like Facebook, Telegram, and X to collect information. - How to seamlessly combine open sources, eyewitness testimonies, and media analysis to create a comprehensive story. - How to conduct investigations with limited access to data and individuals. - How an investigation on a high-profile topic can generate public interest and influence state authorities responsible for border control.","Українська, Російська",https://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2024/07/9/7464840/,https://youtu.be/f-ulg6p_T40,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkY1Na7WESU,https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2024/07/7/7464509/,Andrii Ihnatenko,"Mykhailo Tkach is one of the most renowned investigative journalists in Ukraine, with over a decade of experience in the field.

But civilian communities -- and the environment -- have been bearing the brunt of the attacks. Altermidya documented and verified at least 173 cases of aerial bombardment, artillery fire, and strafing since President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016 until today under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. The war has displaced over 17,000 families in provinces. Disturbingly, our findings show that only 17.4 percent of these military strikes hit actual rebel positions. The vast majority, it turns out, devastated communities of farmers, fisherfolk, workers, and indigenous peoples.","Despite the silence from the Philippine military and government, the investigative report has reverberated across communities devastated by the bombing campaigns. Human rights organizations, from grassroots groups to national alliances, have leveraged the story to shed light on the relentless attacks on civilian populations under the guise of the government’s counterinsurgency efforts. The national human rights group, Karapatan, featured the findings of the investigation in its forthcoming 2024 Annual Human Rights Report.  The report has also made waves in journalistic circles.  The Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) recognized it for exposing a lesser-known dimension of the counterinsurgency war—how bombing campaigns, allegedly aimed at insurgent groups, inflict profound social and environmental harm on civilian communities. The story’s impact reached international platforms, with the International Center for Journalists highlighting the reporter as a model for investigative journalism in its social media campaigns. Similarly, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) spotlighted the journalist in a published profile, aiming to inspire others to uncover untold stories of marginalized communities worldwide.","This investigative reporting project posed a number of challenges in the context of the Philippines. Journalists, especially in local communities, have constantly faced physical, virtual and legal threats because of the work we do, especially when we investigate government wrongdoing, allegations of human rights abuses and cases of environmental damage from human or corporate activity. In this particular story, which is a survey of the various cases of attacks on civilian communities in the conduct of the government’s war against insurgency, I needed to travel to at least four different places (in the different regions of the Philippines) in order to validate the reports that I have been able to gather through remote interviews and open source investigations (OSINT). In all of these areas, I have been advised by local human rights activists and journalists not to go to the actual areas bombed because these areas continued to be under tight military control. I had to work around these limitations, from gaining contacts with locals, interviewing them in safer areas, to doing remote interviews or using civilian drones in field investigations. I have been able to validate the majority of cases of civilian harm in these bombing campaigns.","I used open source investigative techniques in gathering the cases or allegations of civilian and environmental damage caused by military bombing campaigns. I gathered all available reports and then validated these cases through contacts within each locality. In four specific cases, I was able to do field inspection and validation. I used, in some instances, civilian (commercially available) drones in the conduct of my field inspection. I also used open source satellite imagery to compare areas before and after the alleged bombing campaigns on civilian communities. I used secure communication systems (such as Signal and Telegram) to contact sources on the ground and in the localities (such as indigenous activists under heavy military surveillance in Talaingod, Davao del Norte in Mindanao island). Many of the techniques used, however, were traditional sourcing and interview methods -- networking with human rights groups, local organizations (such as the indigenous groups in Cordillera region in Northern Luzon) and even local government units.","I think one lesson that I was able to get from this project is that with some funding and institutional support (from the Asian Investigative Reporting Network and International Center for Journalists) it is possible to do independent investigation into government wrongdoing despite the challenges and risks. AIR Network and ACFJ were also able to provide safety training, in addition to the training and experience I already have as an investigative reporter in the Philippines.","English, Filipino",https://www.altermidya.net/communities-under-siege/,https://cmfr-phil.org/media-ethics-responsibility/journalism-review/altermidya-shifts-lens-to-communities-in-battle-crosshairs/,https://www.usaid.gov/stories/voices-courage,https://pinoyweekly.org/2021/06/isang-araw-sa-brgy-diatagon/,"Kenneth Roland A.

However, climate change is having a significant impact on hydropower generation, as water levels in major dams have been declining due to El Nino. The declining water levels in these dams has led to reduced electricity supply disruptions key sectors such as mining, and healthcare and other small businesses.","Zambia’s power shortage worsens as droughts deepen project did get have an impact on the communities in Zambia especially among those who do not understand the realities of climate change. Firstly, there was increased awareness levels among communities in Zambia on the link between hydropower and climate change. Additionally, the story did inspire many journalists to do follow up stories and expand further investigations on the impacts of droughts on Zambia’s energy sector. After writing the story, the relevant authorities did visit the various hydro power plants in Zambia to update Zambians on the extent of the droughts. This is something that was not done before.","I did face some challenges in investigating and gathering data for this story. Accessing government documents and interviews was a challenge as at the time of the investigation, the Zambian government had not openly disclosed what was contributing to persistent power outages in Zambia. While drought was a topical issue at the time, the opposition political parties used this as a campaign tool to discredit the government making it difficult for government to openly offer interviews with journalists seeking to write stories on the issue. Moreso, accessing data in public documents was not easy as majority of these documents do not have sufficient information making the work difficult to pursue.","I used a number of tools in telling my story. Among the tools I used are data wrapper for visualization. I also used to google charts to extract data. In addition, used drones to capture the dam images, also used charts and satellite imagery to extract data for my stories.","Journalists can also learn from this project the need to be patient when collecting data on an environmental story. While information can be available to do a story on climate change, more effort is required for a data story so as to avoid misrepresentation of figures and statistics. Journalists can also learn from this story the art of simplifying a complicated environmental topic. While some wording might carry jargon in science reporting, it is important to ensure that such is simplified for the public. Another thing journalist can learn is the art of using natural persons to simplify an environmental issue. Similarly, the use of data sets allows the reader to understand the story better and be able to relate to the terminologies been said or put across by climate experts.",English,https://makanday.org/zambias-power-shortages-worsen-as-drought-deepens/,https://makanday.org/government-implements-emergency-measures-to-alleviate-load-shedding-crisis-in-zambia-part-ii/,,,"Andrew Kaniki,Joel Konopo",Cindy Sipula is an environmental and data journalist based in Zambia and also a fellow of the Women in News (WIN) WAN-IFRA Accelerator Program.

Across 2023 and 2024, 14 media outlets, as part of the EDJNet platform, joined forces to investigate cases of deaths in police custody. The team had to overcome the fact that in many countries, governments do not even collect this information and in others, even if this information is collected, it is not public. The team carried out the research by requesting information from all EU countries. By compiling cases, the team was able to analyse systematic failures in police management in several European countries.","In Spain, the investigation was initially published by Civio and republished by El Confidencial and El Salto. At the European level, it has been published by the following media: Voxeurop (in several languages), The Journal Investigates (Ireland), Basta! (France), L’Indipendente (Italy), Der Standard (Austria), Neues Deutschland (Germany), Divergente (Portugal). Following its publication, the World Organisation Against Torture has invited us to participate in an event to give advice to civil organisations to seek and request data from public administrations on police abuses, and the Ponferrada Police Headquarters, as a member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, has requested our collaboration in a preliminary analysis to draw up protocols for judicial action with people with mental illness and in cases of agitated delirium.","The biggest complication has been the lack of formalised data. Already in 2023, the European Commission admitted to the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions that, despite the recommendations of this organisation, this information is not systematically collected in the EU. Most of the information collected has been through FOIA, which has taken a long time because many of the administrations have initially refused. In addition, in Germany and Spain, police powers are spread across several administrations. in Germany alone, 16 requests for information have had to be submitted, one for each state, while in Spain three requests have had to be made (the Basque Country and Catalonia have their own police) and even so, data on deaths related to local police, which depend on each local council, are still missing. Despite this, it has been demonstrated that the number of people who die in contact with the police is very high, and in most countries there is no monitoring of this problem, and also that in many countries deaths occur in police custody that could be avoided, such as suicides facilitated by the configuration of the cells (with bars) or people in a state of drunkenness.","The main technique used in this research has been the use of information requests based on the transparency laws passed in each country.  Once the data were obtained, they were harmonised in an Excel table in order to carry out a quantitative analysis according to different parameters, such as the place of the events, the nationality, age or gender of the person, whether the person suffers from mental illness or was in a state of agitation, or the weapons involved in the event. For this, we have used Excel functionalities such as pivot tables and filters.","I believe that the main lesson of this research is the determination to find information about realities and problems about which there is total opacity.

These unique ecosystems, once teeming with life, are facing an existential threat as water supplies dwindle. The piece likely highlights the plight of the Marsh Arabs, an indigenous community deeply intertwined with the marshes, and examines the ecological and humanitarian consequences of this environmental crisis.","One of the most impact was after publishing the story, I have contacted by couple of NGOs, told me how this piece raised awareness of the environmental crisis and the threats faced by the Marsh Arabs.  As well as I have been invited for an international conference will be held in Baghdad, to speak about the topic I was focusing on the piece, and how the community was affected by climate change and dam constractions. The conference will be attended by international NGOs, this would increase funding for conservation efforts, and in support projects that restore and protect the marshes.","Iraq faces significant water disputes with upstream countries like Turkey and Iran, who have constructed numerous dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. These dams significantly reduce water flow to Iraq, exacerbating the drought conditions. Moreover, the country has experienced decades of conflict and political instability, hindering effective governance and resource management. This instability makes it difficult to implement long-term solutions and prioritize environmental protection.  As mentioned, reduced water flow from upstream countries and increased water demand due to population growth and agriculture severely limit water availability for the marshes.  Weak or poorly enforced environmental laws in Iraq provide limited protection for the marshes and inadequate legal recourse for those affected by environmental degradation.  Sharing data and information between different government agencies and with international organizations, and media outlets, can be challenging.","The tools were:  Interviews: I conducted in-depth interviews with experts, local Arab Marsh people and affected communities to gather firsthand accounts and insights. Paper Review: I reviewed existing research papers, reports, and publications on the Iraqi marshlands and related environmental issues.  On-the-Ground Reporting: Journalists often travel to the affected areas to witness the situation firsthand, observe the environmental impact, and interview local communities. But, for this story, I and my colleague the photographer paid visit to Turkey and Iraq’s southern areas to report and document the story.","The most important thing that journalists can learn from the projecr is how to humanise the story, and this would be by focusing on the human impact of the environmental crisis, the piece likely resonated with readers on an emotional level.",English,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/climate-and-people/iraqs-marshes-drought-climate-change-water-wars-middle-east/,,,,"Azhar Al-Rubaie (journalist), Sebastian Backhaus (photographer).","Azhar Al-Rubaie: is an Iraqi freelance journalist and researcher.He has been working in the field of media since 2014.

Owner of the largest REDD+ projects in the Amazon and Brazil’s largest carbon credits issuer, he made millions of reais selling credits to companies such as GOL Airlines, Nestlé, Toshiba, Spotify, Boeing, and PwC. Thanks to our report, Stoppe’s links to an illegal deforestation mega-scheme that removed 38,000 truckloads of timber from the Amazon came to light. The Federal Police raided the group, and Verra suspended the projects.","After the publication of the story, the Federal Police raided Ricardo Stoppe’s group. Five people were arrested for illegally logging the equivalent of 38,000 trucks of wood. As we found in our investigation, the REDD+ projects were used to issue fake documents used to launder the timber illegally taken from Indigenous territories and protected areas. As we showed in a follow-up, part of this timber was exported to the USA and Europe.   The Police also found out Stoppe had illegally grabbed more than 500,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of public land in the Amazon. Besides timber laundering, he used this area to launder illegal cattle. ”It was the perfect crime,” told the federal deputy conducting the investigation.   The world’s largest REDD+ certifier, Verra, suspended Stoppe’s projects. Prosecutors filed a lawsuit asking for the suspension of REDD+ projects in Amazonas state and mentioned the Mongabay investigation. Stoppe’s case triggered a debate in national media about the credibility of REDD+ projects, and in December, Brazil approved its carbon market law.   We also opened a new front in carbon investigations, showing how common the alliance between loggers and carbon entrepreneurs is in the Amazon.","The investigation started when I found a lawsuit supposedly linking Stoppe to one of Amazon’s largest illegal loggers. At the time, prosecutors didn’t find enough evidence to denounce him. However, I was instigated and decided to dig more into Stoppe.   So far, he has been celebrated as a great example of how to make money while keeping the forest standing. He had even taken part in COP28 in Dubai. But I found indications that he could be making a brilliant move: using his extensive REDD+ projects areas, where the forest was preserved to generate carbon credits, as a factory of timber documents used to launder illegal wood taken elsewhere.   Some of his partners in the carbon projects had been convicted for illegal logging. His REDD+ projects were authorized to perform sustainable logging, but the companies for whom he was selling this timber had a history of fraud.  I had many indications but no final proof. Then comes the most significant innovation of our investigation: combining traditional journalism with a partnership with CCCA’s experts who have a lot of experience in timber tracking.","We used traditional investigation techniques such as reading court files, looking for environmental fines and licenses, searching in social media and public documents, reading Verra reports, and analyzing geospatial data such as farms polygons (in QGIS) and satellite imagery (in Planet) to understand what was going on on the ground.   We used much of this material to feed the work of CCCA, which was concentrated on finding evidence of timber laundering. They used the satellite-imaging technology NDFI  (normalized difference fraction index) to highlight the scars left in the forest by loggers and estimate the volume of wood they took from an area. At the same time, they looked at how much timber Stoppe had declared to have harvested from that same area.   If he declared to have extracted a lot of wood from an area with few signs of logging, it means these timber documents were actually used to launder wood illegally harvested from other areas. And that is precisely what the data showed.   This methodology was firmly contexted by Stoppe, who threatened to sue Mongabay. So, we interviewed sources that confirmed the same method is used by the Federal Police and respectable research institutions.","Our report opened up a new front in the investigation of REDD+ projects. Until then, most of the stories focused on land tenure problems or methodological issues, such as the use of unrealistic deforestation projections to inflate the generation of carbon credits.   With Stoppe’s case, we shed light on the association between these supposedly green entrepreneurs and logging groups with a long history of illegality. In a follow-up story, we showed how common these alliances are in the Amazon. These are criminal organizations that, for decades, have profited from deforestation and are now profiting from carbon credits.  Our methodology is also helpful for colleagues investigating illegal logging in general, as most criminal organizations use the same strategies. Another lesson is to partner with experts in your investigation topic. I am not talking about a bureaucratic partnership, but about discussing every step of the investigation together.   I had periodic meetings with CCCA when I would bring my findings as a reporter and they would tell me their latest advances in their analyses. By keeping this collaborative attitude, I managed to keep the CCCA experts highly motivated to go to the bottom of it.",English,https://news.mongabay.com/2024/05/top-brands-buy-amazon-carbon-credits-from-suspected-timber-laundering-scam/,https://news.mongabay.com/2024/06/brazilian-investigators-raid-amazon-carbon-credit-projects-exposed-by-mongabay/,https://news.mongabay.com/2024/12/loggers-and-carbon-projects-forge-odd-partnerships-in-the-brazilian-amazon/,https://news.mongabay.com/2024/12/illegal-timber-from-amazon-carbon-credit-projects-reached-europe-u-s/,Fernanda Wenzel - reporter  Alexandre de Santi - editor Alex Shawn - fact-checker Andrés Alegría - Art and illustrations,"Fernanda Wenzel is a 16-years experienced journalist based in Brazil.

Brazil,ge.globo,Big,,,”My coach tried to kiss me”: unprecedented survey reveals cases of harassment in women’s football,2024-03-19,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Sports, Women, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Google Sheets, CSV, AI - TRANSKIPTOR","This is the first mapping of sexual violence in Brazilian football history.  It exposes an unprecedented survey, carried out by the reporter, with 209 athletes from the Women Championship about violence, discrimination and harassment. Published in the week of Robinho’s and Daniel Alves trials, convicted of rape, the report shows that 52% of players interviewed suffered some type of harassment in football, whether sexual or moral.  Using interview and data collection techniques, the report exposes unprecedented data that highlights harassment as a systematic problem and demonstrates this with graphics, alongside humanized stories, in order to give ”face” to the numbers.","The report differentiates itself to broaden the perspective on cases of violence and harassment in football, as these are usually restricted to reports of ”isolated” episodes in the press. Never before the institutions have had numbers to measure this problem.  More than 300,000 people were reached and other players were found to share their stories in search for help.  In the following days, athletes from Corinthians, São Paulo, Ferroviária and América-MG held protests in honor of the affected athletes. Ferroviária - a historic club in women’s football - reported, the day after the article was published, a case of sexual harassment against a club physiotherapist in a game. Months later, they  launched a program to report harassment in the club.  Santos athletes, who saw coach Kleiton Lima, denounced for harassment, return to his post, exposed their stories and saw the coach fired once again.  The Brazilian Football Confederation, on March, published a statement on the entity’s actions and repudiating the rape crimes for which Daniel Alves and Robinho were convicted. Among the topics reported, the entity established an action position to combat violence in football and announced a plan to implement a program to prevent and curb abuse and harassment in football.","The players were approached individually by the reporter, some in person and others remotely - to cover different states - and responded, under the condition of anonymity, to questions related to harassment, violence and discrimination.  The identities of the athletes and the clubs were preserved to respect the players’ fear of retaliation, as there are not sufficient legal measures to protect them in times of denunciation. ”I tried to report it, but the situation only got worse, so I let it go”, said of them.  There were nine months of listening, with some of the athletes also heard in in-depth conversations to build the stories, which aim to humanize the data revealed.  There is no institution, department or action plan created to deal with cases of sexual or moral harassment in Brazilian football. The unprecedented survey opened up space for women to share their stories, collecting data and inciting debate about violence and discrimination.  The investigation provides a database for authorities to carry out effective actions to prevent cases and support victims, who are not supported by the institutions that surround them and thus avoid complaints - as can be seen when knowing that only 14,7% of the interviewed turned cases into complaints.","The investigation was born from the objective of mapping, providing data and inciting debate on harassment in women’s football, with the aim of encouraging the creation of work policies to prevent cases and provide due support to victims. There is no institution, department or action plan created to deal with cases of sexual and/or moral harassment in football.  Using interview and data collection techniques, the report presents unprecedented data that demonstrate harassment as a systematic problem in Brazilian women’s football.  It demonstrates this with easy-to-view graphs, assembled using the Datawrapper tool, alongside humanized stories, in order to give a “face” to the numbers presented.  To map the cases, the athletes were individually contacted by the reporter and answered, under the condition of anonymity, a questionnaire with 18 questions related to harassment, violence and discrimination, in order to collect quantitative and qualifying information.  The data was organized in CSV format and Google Sheets were used to visualize the information collected at the end of the listening period.  The listening period lasted nine months, with some of the athletes also interviewed in more in-depth conversations to build the stories described in the report, which aim to humanize the data revealed.","The report demonstrates how to approach sensitive and socially impactful issues, inciting debate through sports - an environment that reflects society and becomes a way of lightly approaching more complex issues.  The unprecedented survey provides a database for authorities to take effective action and demonstrates how quantitative information can expose patterns of behavior and human rights violations in contexts that are often silenced.  Care in approaching victims is also an important point, with sensitivity regarding reports, guaranteeing anonymity and respecting the sources’ limits - which are often violated. This approach protects them and encourages trust in journalistic work as a tool for reporting.  The combination of different formats, in the case of data, texts and videos, as long as personal stories, shows a strategy to broaden the reach of the message, while the impact generated - raising discussions and demanding action - highlights investigative journalism as an agent of change.  It is an innovation for betting on an unprecedented initiative, on a serious subject that is difficult to address in Brazil. Not surprisingly, it is little - or even almost never - explored.","Portuguese, English (attached in the subscription)",https://ge.globo.com/sp/futebol/noticia/2024/03/19/meu-tecnico-tentou-me-beijar-levantamento-inedito-revela-casos-de-assedio-no-futebol-feminino.ghtml,https://ge.globo.com/futebol/times/corinthians/noticia/2024/03/21/brasileirao-feminino-jogadoras-de-corinthians-e-america-mg-protestam-contra-casos-de-assedio.ghtml,https://ge.globo.com/video/levantamento-inedito-revela-que-52-das-atletas-ja-foram-vitimas-de-assedio-no-futebol-feminino-12448142.ghtml,https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQs8DnWxhYNTndMyK2ekpZ3MR_DiMU956uLwf9Ck1_GGfeKCs9sylZbQMWWhfqwT2ecKpQy8DYyuQPe/pub,Camila Correia Alves,"Camila Alves works as a reporter for Globo, in São Paulo, Brazil, and dedicates herself to coverage of football, sports and human rights, as well as issues related to women and the conquest of traditionally male spaces.

"Tanzania, United Republic of",The Guardian Tanzania,Small,,,Lost hopes over tragic fire incidents on SME markets,2024-04-02,"Solutions journalism, Infographics, Business","Scraping, Microsoft Excel","Tanzania’s Fire and Rescue Force has lost the public trust. Its low capacity to respond against fire incidents that break in various places, from homes, schools to SMEs markets, causing loss of lives and properties; leaves more questions than answers. This special report titled ‘Lost hopes over tragic fire incidents on SME markets’ published in The Guardian Tanzania on April 2, 2024 uncovers weaknesses of the Force in responding to fire incidents. These weaknesses are contrary to government’s commitments stipulated in different Tanzania’s laws. The acute shortage of trained firefighters, fire tenders, water hydrants and fire stations are key challenges","Immediately after the story was published and followed by the widespread dissemination of this report, on April 4, 2024, Geoffrey Pinda, Deputy Minister in the Ministry of Land, Housing, and Human Settlements Development clarified the matter in the parliament. Pinda told parliamentarians that the government had finalized procedures to secure a concessional loan amounting to 257.90bn/- (about $100 million). According to the Deputy Minister, this financial support is earmarked for the acquisition of 150 new fire tenders among other facilities. The Deputy Minister’s response irritated parliamentarians who wanted to debate the matter on an emergency notice but the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Musa Zungu ruled out that one of the 393 parliamentarians should submit a private motion in the parliament for debating that will led to the drafting of a new law with regard to responding to fire incidents. In a session held on June 6, 2024, the National Assembly convened for nearly two hours to discuss solutions to the challenges faced by the Fire and Rescue Force as described in the attached articles as published on The Guardian website. Five resolutions were a result of a private motion brought forward by Priscus Tarimo, the Moshi Urban legislator.","The difficulty with this story was having an interview with SACF Puyo Nzalayaimisi, Fire and Rescue Services Force Spokesperson declined to respond on the questions submitted to her on an excuse of delicacy of the matter. She told me to refer the questions to John Masunga, the Fire and Rescue Services Force Commissioner General who also advised me to go back to Puyo since she is the only person mandated with speaking to the media. I had to seek the necessary documents and reports about the Force from the National Assembly Public Relation Officer Zanele Chiza who handed to me a report by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Security parliamentary standing committee covering between February 2023 and January 2024 on February 17, 2024. The report is available if needed. In this report, information about the Fire and Rescue Force are highlighted from page 150 to page 306. The report is in Kiswahili, a formal and government official communication language. I had to find and read the Ministry of Home Affairs budget documents for 2020/21 to 2023/24 to have more information about the Force whereabouts. I designed an infographics as part of innovative techniques. I did the whole task by myself.","There are many options to creating an infographic but for me I opted to use Piktochart. As you are all aware that Piktochart is an online infographic application which allows users including those without intensive experience as graphic designers to easily create professional-grade infographics using themed templates.  The program provides tools to add interactive maps, charts, videos and hyperlinks although I didn’t apply all of it. Piktochart needs one to go through four different steps in getting his infographic done. As a first step: I needed to create a Piktochart account. This part is easy, free and takes maybe 30 seconds to sign up and become a user. I clicked the Piktochart Visual to create visuals for the story in minutes.  This section also helps one to save their projects, access resources, and select whichever template fits the layout I selected to use. At this point, I clicked on my preferred visual format in the dashboard to allow for options namely infographics, presentations, posters, reports, flyers, social media posts or your preferred sizing. Going by the process the next step was to choose the right template for my visual. I went through the process to designing and visualizing the data.","A lesson for other journalists with regard to this project is the difficulty placed on Tanzanian journalists by the Access to Information Act, 2016 which intends to assist government authorities hide information which is meant to be public.  The Act was published on September 30, 2016, and its regulations came into force on December 29, 2017. The Act was enacted in order to facilitate access to information held by public institutions. The law is meant to provide access to information, and promote transparency and accountability of information holders, among other objectives. Its seven years after the law came into effect, a number of practical challenges in accessing information still persist. This scenario poses difficulties for investigative journalism to flourish in Tanzania.  The challenges include interrogation of information seekers, denied access, lack of awareness on the part of the public on the formal information request process, as well as reluctance or refusal by some public institutions to publish procedures for requesting information.  Another challenge is the lack of a designated person responsible for releasing information in some public institutions. Media stakeholders and human rights defending organizations have been actively pushing for amendments to this Act with unfulfilled promises from the government.",English,https://www.ippmedia.com/the-guardian/business/read/lost-hopes-over-tragic-fire-incidents-on-sme-markets-2024-06-18-162853,https://www.ippmedia.com/the-guardian/business/read/parliaments-edicts-boost-fire-rescue-preparedness-2024-06-10-191911,https://ippmedia.com/the-guardian/news/local-news/read/govt-gets-100m-loan-to-buy-150-fire-tenders-2024-04-05-090611,https://www.ippmedia.com/the-guardian/business/read/revealed-unplanned-settlements-jeopardise-firefighting-operations-2024-06-28-131857,Francis Kajubi - Project’s lead journalist Mnaku Mbani - Project’s editor Faraje Masinde - Project’s Infographics editor,"Winner of the Excellence in Journalism Awards Tanzania (EJAT) Data Journalism category for 2021 and 2022 conferred by the esteemed Media Council of Tanzania (MCT), Francis Dhamira Kajubi (39) has been working with The Guardian-Tanzania for ten years now as Business and Data Senior Journalist.

Brazil,UOL / A Hora Podcast,Big,,,Phantom projects in Alagoas funded by parliamentary amendments,2024-06-29,"Investigation, Audio, Politics","Scraping, Python, Google Looker Studio","The team revealed, through data analysis and field reporting, that multimillion-reals projects funded by the Speaker of the House of Representatives with money from parliamentary amendments, in a city where his father was a mayor, had never been carried out. The team developed a dashboard that performs daily web scraping of parliamentary amendments in Brazil (https://datafixers.org/emendas_parlamentares). Using this tool, they supported numerous analyses and investigations. One of the most significant findings came from fieldwork, uncovering that projects listed in the data had not been executed, such as a “lagoon terminal” and a “viewpoint.”","These projects were intended to improve the quality of life for residents and boost tourism in the city. However, despite being planned, the city’s mayor told reporter Thais Bilenky that he had no idea what she was talking about when questioned. In the same year, the Supreme Federal Court began discussing a series of changes to the transparency of parliamentary amendments’ use. It is not possible to say that this story alone caused the change, but rather that it was part of a series of reports that increased the pressure for such changes to take place.","We highlight the long-term effort behind the project. Instead of focusing on a single story, we created a group work methodology that involved the daily and constant analysis of amendment data, collected from various government portals. Using this data, we discussed potential analyses and stories and, in some cases, helped the reporter and presenter in the field identify suspicious situations. Several other reports were published based on this data.  We also emphasize the strong audience engagement: the main channel for sharing the report was a podcast, followed by a videocast, bringing tens of thousands of people to learn about the story.",Python (Webscraping with Selenium) and Google Looker Studio for the dashboard.,"The more a team knows about a subject, the more capable it becomes of producing in-depth stories.

The spreadsheet helped identify detailed data about who these soldiers were and what positions they held. Using their names and IDs, it was also possible to analyze how much public money their families were receiving through open data made available on the Transparency Portal.","Based on this information, the story narrated, through video, podcast, and text, some of the most absurd stories. In the main story, the investigation uncovered the case of a soldier who raped a woman, was imprisoned, and later escaped from custody. The victim, who was interviewed by the reporters, was unaware of the escape or that his family was receiving a government pension. She, however, never received any support after enduring the violence. The story was also able to tell for the first time about this escape and where the soldier lives now. The statute of limitations for his crime has expired, so he cannot go to jail.","This project gained significant attention, with over 1 million views and content produced across various formats, such as podcasts, text, and video. Reaching the information used required a lengthy process of journalistic investigation. Legal cases against military personnel are considered classified by the Armed Forces for an indefinite period. Access to some of these cases was only possible for two reasons: first, because the Lula administration, for the first time in 2023, mandated that administrative inquiries against public employees must be disclosed after their conclusion, even in cases involving military personnel. Second, because our team spent months persistently filing administrative appeals and requests to have the cases released, as the Army initially refused to provide them.  Finally, a Python-based process was employed to collect and analyze individualized data from the Transparency Portal to determine how much of this type of pension was paid to these military personnel.","FOIA for administrative records agains each military personnel; Python for data analysis on how much money each one received from pensions. We also used AI animation for the video, since we didn’t have a way to show the story with real footage.","We want to highlight the effort behind this report in transforming data into real, impactful stories that generated significant interest in the topic. Many journalists had already covered military pensions and the issues surrounding this type of policy, but no report had delved into the cases with such detail, especially since these processes are kept confidential.

Interviews with residents and health professionals, along with air quality tests, reveal alarming levels of pollutants like CO, SO2, and PM2.5 far exceeding WHO limits. These pollutants cause respiratory illnesses and financial strain due to medical costs. Despite the Petroleum Industry Act, weak enforcement allows continued flaring, worsening poverty, health risks, and environmental damage, demanding urgent policy action.","The project unreaveled notable awareness about the health and environmental impacts of gas flaring in the Niger Delta. It prompted discussions among policymakers, environmental activists, and local communities about stricter enforcement of the Petroleum Industry Act. Local NGOs used the findings to advocate for better healthcare support for affected communities, while the data on air quality was cited in petitions to regulatory agencies demanding action against companies flouting anti-flaring regulations. The story also drew media attention to the plight of Obrikom and Egbema residents of Rivers State, amplifying their voices and pressuring stakeholders to address the persistent environmental and health crises in the region.","The project was conducted in a challenging political and socio-economic landscape where powerful oil companies wield significant influence, often undermining regulatory enforcement. Accessing accurate data was difficult due to limited government transparency and industry secrecy regarding gas flaring volumes and emissions. Resource constraints were also a factor; conducting air quality tests and gathering sources through accounts which required navigating remote areas were carried out with several security challenges. Despite these barriers, innovative tools like portable air quality monitors and data visualization techniques, goggle earth imagery were used to present compelling evidence and amplify community voices.","The project employed a combination of tools, techniques, and technologies to gather, analyze, and present data effectively. Air quality monitors were used to measure pollutant levels such as Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10), providing scientific evidence of harmful emissions. GIS mapping tools helped visualize the proximity of gas flaring sites to affected communities, emphasizing the scale of the issue. Data visualization software and google earth imagery were used to present complex findings in an accessible manner for the audience.  Additionally, in-depth interviews with residents and healthcare professionals were conducted to gather qualitative data on health impacts, while investigative techniques ensured that industry and government responses (or lack thereof) were documented. Collaborative networks with environmental experts and local NGOs also enhanced data collection and verification, ensuring the story was both impactful and accurate.","Other journalists can learn several valuable lessons from this project:  Firstly, pairing scientific data with  accounts of affected individuals makes the impact of complex issues tangible and relatable to audiences.  Secondly, innovative  use of affordable tools, such as portable air quality monitors, can help gather hard-to-access data, even in resource-constrained environments. Also, Partnering with local experts, NGOs, and health professionals can enhance reporting accuracy, provide credibility, and amplify the reach of a story.  Thirdly, by employing meticulous fact-checking and legal safeguards, journalists can expose powerful entities while minimizing legal and personal risks.",English,https://humanglemedia.com/niger-delta-communities-grappling-with-health-impacts-of-gas-flaring/,,,,Abdulwaheed Sofiullahi,"Abdulwaheed Sofiullahi is an accomplished international journalist and researcher with several years of experience in environment and climate change.

We cross-referenced the most up-to-date shapefile of the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) from the Pará government, which contains the names of individuals and companies claiming ownership of rural properties, with the ICMBio shapefile of embargoed areas without known owners. The overlapping of these maps allowed us to identify the owners of these areas. We then used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain details about the embargoes and properties, demonstrating that these individuals could be fined for deforestation. ICMBio, a government agency, held a series of technical meetings with our team to understand our methodology and subsequently decided to fine the individuals we identified. The government mentioned in its reports that the fines were issued as a result of our investigation, thus achieving a tangible outcome from the report.",QGIS: cross-referencing state and federal data to find who was responsible for an area where deforestation happened FOIA: getting access to embargo and fine reports Python: Downloading up to date spatial data and transforming it to make the analysis,"It is common for public authorities at different levels (e.g., state and federal governments) not to communicate or share data as much as they should. This story revealed that if the Pará State government and the federal government communicated more frequently and updated their property records, more environmental offenders could be identified. The report did not stop at highlighting the problem; we sought a solution. To achieve this, we spent several weeks speaking with experts to understand how the official methodology works and how it could be improved. The findings showed that if the federal government used the most up-to-date rural property data in collaboration with state governments, new offenders could be sanctioned.",Portuguese,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/desmatamento-amazonia-embargos-icmbio/,https://gijn.org/stories/2024-editors-picks-investigative-stories-portuguese/,https://premio.jornalismodedados.org/edicoes/2024/,,With the support of CCCA - Center for Climate Crime Analysis,"Brazilian journalist and researcher with a proven track record of producing projects based on public documents and data analysis.

France,France 24,Big,,,"Repression in Iran, Ammunition made in France",2024-10-11,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Video, Satellite images, Politics, Business, Gun violence, Human rights",,"In 2022, we launched a two-year investigation into European-made ammunition used by Iran’s security forces against pro-democracy protesters, despite EU arms sanctions. Using OSINT techniques, we traced an illicit supply chain spanning France, Italy, Turkey, and Iran, uncovering loopholes exploited to violate sanctions. Interviews with experts, human rights advocates, and victims revealed the devastating impact of these munitions and systemic failures enabling sanctions evasion. This investigation exposes the urgent need for stricter enforcement and accountability while demonstrating journalism’s vital role in uncovering hidden networks and amplifying the voices of those oppressed in the fight for democracy.","This investigation was the first to uncover this affair, which has had significant repercussions. It prompted a UN fact-finding committee to approach the co-producers for assistance in their inquiry, generated extensive coverage in Iranian media and on social media, and fueled public demand for accountability from both France and the company involved. Following the revelations, a spokesperson for the French government and Members of Parliament were questioned by other media outlets, while the French Foreign Affairs Minister faced direct questions from MPs regarding the findings. Our report also inspired other investigative media outlets in France to launch their own inquiries into the case. These outlets referenced our findings as the foundation of their reports, broadening the scope of the revelations and amplifying public pressure. Additionally, a group of lawyers in France is now preparing a class-action lawsuit based on the findings of this investigation.","Since traveling to Iran to report independently on the Autumn 2022 repression was impossible, the team relied on Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) to collect and authenticate evidence. Each piece of information was meticulously cross-referenced with landmarks and dates to ensure accuracy while working remotely.  To guarantee the safety of our sources in Iran, we developed a secure system for communication. Encrypted messages were set to auto-delete within two hours, and all data was stored on a secure disk to minimize the risk of sources being tracked by the Islamic Republic’s intelligence services.  The investigation carried immense risks. It targeted arms deals involving the Iranian defense industry and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), both under international sanctions. One co-producer, already sentenced to 14 years in prison in absentia by Iran’s Revolutionary Court for his journalism, faced renewed personal threats but continued the work.  The team also exposed one of the world’s largest ammunition manufacturers—a French company with deep ties to NATO, the French government, and major defense contracts. Despite warnings like, “Be careful, the CEO is a very violent man,” the investigation pressed forward to reveal how French-made ammunition circumvented EU sanctions and fueled violence against protesters.","Our team geolocated and verified the photos received from the Iranians to confirm their authenticity. In this regard, we applied OSINT geolocation techniques and used multiple sources such as Google Maps, Open Streetmap, Overpass Turbo and in some cases Google Colab to extract data and compare it with the obtained images to geolocate the photos and also determine the time when these photos were taken.  We also used tools such as “Diagrams” and “Gephi” to illustrate the data and “UNCOMETRADE” and “importgenius” to extract data about the companies and their relationships to document the activities of the companies studied.  Due to the security issues, we used more secure cloud services such as Cryptpad to store our records and Veracrypt to encrypt the rushes and evidence on our hard drives.","Perseverance was key to this investigation. Much of the information—such as the mass use of shotguns by Iranian security forces, public tenders, and financial records in Iran, Turkey, France, and Italy—was technically accessible to journalists. However, our team dedicated two years to meticulously piecing it together, working through immense challenges and risks. At times, progress felt stagnant, with no guarantee of uncovering major revelations, but we pressed on.  To strengthen our efforts, we utilized cutting-edge methods of geolocation and analysis. Python, in particular, proved to be an invaluable tool, streamlining the OSINT portion of the investigation and helping us verify and connect key pieces of evidence.","English, French, Persian",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHFz5vJSm9I,https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/reporters/20241011-repression-in-iran-ammunition-made-in-france,,,"Producers : Julie Dungelhoeff, Ershad Alijani Editor in chief : Derek Thomson, Loick Berrou Editor : Julia Boudet  Graphics team : Upian","Julie Dungelhoeff, Senior Reporter at France 24 since 2011, is a field journalist covering international news both on and off camera.
