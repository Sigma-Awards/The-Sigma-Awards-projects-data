United States,MIT Technology Review,Small,Participant,Young journalist,Karen Hao," Growing up, I didn't know I wanted to be a journalist. There wasn't a single one in my Chinese-American community. Instead, I wanted to be a writer because I was obsessed with reading fiction. In high school, I discarded these dreams under the pressure of applying to colleges that could lead to a stable career. So I found my new love: engineering, and headed to MIT.   In 2015, I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering, and settled in at a comfortable tech job in Silicon Valley. But my nagging desire to write came back to haunt me as I grew increasingly disenchanted by what I saw around me. The engineers of the tech world were rewiring the rules of society without really engaging with and understanding society itself. A year after I started, I left to become a journalist, determined to find a platform for examining and exposing this reality and its consequences.   This is what drew me back to my alma mater to become the <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/profile/karen-hao/"">artificial intelligence reporter</a> at MIT Technology Review in October 2018. The expansiveness and influence of AI across industries, domains, and aspects of people's lives provided a perfect way for me to do this kind of examination. I quickly developed my coverage around a driving thesis: technology people (e.g.: researchers and engineers) and humanities people (e.g. lawyers, policymakers, and social scientists) need to talk more to one another. With my background, I can offer them a common language. I can unbox the complicated technical concepts for nontechnical people to understand, as well as demonstrate how the details and decisions made in the process of technology development directly translate to impact on the ground.   As a visual and kinesthetic learner, I also believe there's more to communication than words. So I am constantly seeking novel ways to utilize my <a href=""https://www.karendhao.com/viz"">visualization, data analysis, and coding skills</a> to help me storytell more clearly and powerfully along the way.   My voice and these approaches have resonated with my readers. In less than year, the weekly AI newsletter I write for Tech Review, tripled its readership (reaching close to 100,000) and earned me a nomination for best newsletter on the internet in the 2018 Webby Awards. My articles are also referenced in nonprofit, government, and intergovernmental reports and have become assigned reading in many university classrooms, including policy classes at Harvard Kennedy School, law classes at Duke University, and technology ethics classes at Stanford University.   On top of that, I have become the <a href=""https://www.karendhao.com/speaking"">go-to speaker</a> about AI and society on podcasts, radio programs, and stages around the world. Last year, I gave an opening keynote at the Marketing Artificial Intelligence Conference, moderated a panel for the UN Foundation with former US CTO Megan Smith, and chaired the AI and education track at the Middle East's premiere AI conference in Dubai, just to name a few highlights. In February of this year, I will also take the stage at TEDxGateway, India's largest ideas festival, in front of an audience of 6,000.   Acknowledging the authoritativeness, influence, and quality of my work, Tech Review fast-tracked my promotion in January to senior artificial intelligence reporter.   I believe, too, that these factors qualify me to be considered for this award. I am less than halfway through my fourth year as a journalist, and I still have so much farther to go. I am determined to continue telling provocative stories that force technology builders and regulators alike to confront its impact on society. And I am committed to preparing them with a common language to do something about it. "," I am submitting two samples as part of my data and visual portfolio. I describe them both below.    Can you make AI fairer than a judge? Play our courtroom algorithm game   This is an interactive narrative that shows why decision-making algorithms can’t be completely fair when operating on data from an unfair world. It visualizes real data used by a criminal justice algorithm to predict whether a defendant will be re-arrested. It then challenges readers to adjust the algorithm to make those predictions fairer. But after every adjustment, a new notion of fairness is revealed showing that the outcomes still aren't fair. This build up leads to the punchline: these notions, in practice, can never be satisfied all at once.   I wanted to do this story to illustrate the complexity of algorithmic discrimination—one of the most important debates currently happening at the intersection of AI and society. To technologists, I wanted to make the point that AI bias is not just a theoretical math problem. To solve it requires grappling with social and historical factors. Data points aren't just numbers; they're actually people. To social scientists and policymakers, I wanted to create a tool that helps them think through the nuances of impact and regulation. While the story used criminal justice as a case study, decision-making algorithms are used across different contexts, including in hiring, healthcare, and lending. It's also timely because the <a href=""https://www.technologyreview.com/s/613310/congress-wants-to-protect-you-from-biased-algorithms-deepfakes-and-other-bad-ai/"">US Congress</a> is currently in the middle of trying to tackle this problem.   I wrote, coded, and designed the visualizations for this story with a collaborator. We conducted every interview, wrote every line of code, and workshopped every sentence together. I principally drove the narrative flow and drafted the original story with the idea of an interactive build up. I also did most of the production coordination becase my collaborator was remote and not part of the publication.   To date, the story has received over 80,000 page views, with an average read time of 2:20 minutes. It has been publicly commended by leading experts and institutions like <a href=""https://twitter.com/AINowInstitute/status/1184887683472154624"">AI Now</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/azeem/status/1184809241187618817"">Azeem Azhar</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane/status/1184877632027951104"">Janelle Shane</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/marylgray/status/1184803065926275073"">Mary Gray</a>.

I scraped the largest open database of AI research papers and analyzed the evolving language in the abstracts, then visualized the most salient trends in a series of charts.   I wanted to show the transformation of the field over its nearly 60 year existence to make the technology less mysterious to lay readers who may be approaching the subject for the very first time. Seeing how AI was created helps elucidate why it looks as it does today, and clarify how far its capabilities are from any true intelligence. It also illustrates the fact that it has always been the creation of humans, born from and shaped by a rich debate of ideas. In this way, it makes AI (and its decisions) feel more tangible than magical, more work-in-progress than perfect, and more contestable than final.   To date, the story has received 131,000 page views, with an average read time of 2 minutes. It was also shared widely on social media, with over 1,000 unique tweets from both by <a href=""https://twitter.com/zittrain/statuses/1088806727435329538"">AI experts</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1092063294297382912"">lay readers</a>. I also published the majority of the code on Github and the <a href=""https://github.com/karenhao/techreview_arxiv_scrape"">repo</a> was starred 38 times and forked four.

South Africa,News24,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Victor Mkhetsane - Social Media Coordinator,"I am Victor Mkhetsane, Social Media Coordinator at News24 the biggest Online News Publication in the continent of Africa. I came with a Film and Television degree into the world of journalism and completely submerged myself into it all. My job specs mostly included social content publishing of all news articles as soon as they are published, yet I took everything further by developing engagement producing mechanisms that will be helpful in terms of aligning the social media audience that we cater for and the best way to give them stories. News24 deals with issues that I have always been passionate about. My 9-year Social Media experience has seen me be a user too meaning . I know what stories people deserve to see on social media and how best to curate them as soon as they are published. Especially on Facebook where users never have data to click on a particular link that was shared and read more on that particular story. I always find ways to cater for such audiences. What I enjoy the most about what I do, is giving those individuals a chance for them to see these stories on such platforms to make sure that even if they don't have enough data to read, they can at least engage with the post. My multimedia skills have also been helpful in terms of creating cool graphics to use on social media. Especially when I have to illustrate a message on a story with a picture. Being a journalist and learning all of this in the real world has been an eye awakening for me because I get to see all the current affairs stuff as they happen in the real world. One of the hardest moments was working throughout Uyinene Mrwetyana's stories and the Gender Based Violence marches that took places after that. Dealing with stories where women were being killed, reading all the graphic stories and trying to package and process them for social media, while taking every response that is coming through was challenging for me. This is mostly because I was never trained into handling the hardcore, graphic and intense moments of journalism during my undergrad, I am learning everything as it happens in the real world and expected to still deliver no matter how triggering it is. Having to keep emotions in check or better yet, switch them off was one of the things I had to do in order to survive that period. I knew that it was not the end, there may be times where fun and lighthearted current affairs moments are going to come. Way harder and emotionally mind whirling stories are also going to come in the future, however learning and preparing for those days now, is a good start. The thing is, I entered the Journalism field mid 2019 where I was only supposed to come and handle the Social Media pages in the absence of the individual who was on a maternity leave. My contract was expired end of October, however I was called in to come and Freelance during festive season in the similar position. During that period, the same position I filled in for was opened as the team was looking at expanding the team and then I applied for it, luckily I got it. Hence, I am now in this space forever. This position keeps me learning and experiencing something new on a daily basis and receiving this recognition means that my seniors and editors made a good call and saw that I habe the potential to grow and be one of the","                                                            My Portfolio URL: <a href=""http://portfolio.victormkhetsane.com"">http://portfolio.victormkhetsane.com</a>    I happen to have a portfolio of a Social Media person for a news publication, hence some people call me a  Social Media Journalist  for News24. This is quite unusual as not a lot of people do have them but then I figured that it would be a good representation of all the work that I have done in journalism up to so far, it will also serve as a hub that houses my achievements in journalism and some of the testimonials from prominent individuals plus the projects that I have been involved in.   The <a href=""https://portfolio.victormkhetsane.com"">front page</a> gives a brief description of me as an individual, while also noting the more intrinsic parts of my job which is being  Social Content Publisher  and an Engagement Producer. At the bottom, it enables you to go straight to my resume where you will get a detailed curriculum vitae that points out everything that I have done in any of the positions I held in the past, the media skills that I possess and also a pdf version if anyone is keen on downloading the traditional version. It also houses a brief note of the institution of high learning that I attended.   My <a href=""https://portfolio.victormkhetsane.com/?page_id=152"">bio</a> answers the  “tell me about yourself”  question but mostly reads like how I would be explaining my journey in journalism. I had to highlight only the important parts like my experience in Social media with how I got introduced to digital content creation. This then points you into how I got to join Media24 and found myself in journalism plus the multiple brands that I happened to coordinate in my role. Another thing that it includes is my motion picture skills where it highlights two of the most unique projects that I worked in as an undergraduate and then closes off with my graduation and where journey is currently as a journalism enthusiast.   My <a href=""https://portfolio.victormkhetsane.com/?page_id=153"">Portfolio</a> tab, which is a bigger and pivotal part has list of all projects that I deemed important which I worked on. Clicking on a singular project, like an example “<a href=""https://victormkhetsane.com/index.php/news24-festive-season-tabled-work/""> News24 – Social Media Freelancing </a>”. That takes you to a page from a main site that shows few things that I did during my freelancing period. It also highlights the highest performing social media post that I created during that period but also has some of the ideas that I worked around including a brief social media stat reported as compiled by the Deputy Site Editor. Another tab is the <a href=""https://victormkhetsane.com/index.php/news24-social-media-coordinator/""> News24 – Social Media Coordinator </a> which was compiled when I was on a temporary position. It has icons of every platform I was curating the social media content for, and when you click on each of them, they take you to a pdf page of the compiled report. Other projects listed are a documentary I worked on, a short insert that show cased garments made for plus size girls, including a short film.   For now it is dressed up as it is, however the main site is still under construction and set to live on 1<sup>st</sup> April and that will be a bigger detailed background of me.

Kyrgyzstan,"RFE/RL Kyrgyz Service, Internews Kyrgyzstan",Big,Participant,Young journalist,Suiumkan Ulanbek kyzy,"  I started practicing data journalism as a journalist through Data Journalism Fellowship by      Internews Kyrgyzstan where I was accepted while being a student of a journalism major at the American University of Central Asia. I learned data journalism after taking two semester long data journalism class from the professor Anastasia Valeeva who came to Kyrgyzstan in order to develop this sphere of journalism. Later on she became my data journalism mentor and inspired me to do data projects.  I practice data journalism for two years and this amount of time is quite short to fully discover the sphere. I still have left a lot to learn in order to strengthen my skills and techniques and also I often make mistakes in the process of making a data project. However, I am one of the first data journalists in my country, and overall in Central Asian region and I am proud that I will be one of the figures started practicing this genre of journalism in my country. I aim to inspire and train other journalists to practice data journalism in the future. This is, in my opinion, the first reason why I should be considered for this award. Most of my works target social problems such as poverty, child labour and women’s rights, etc. I see data journalism alongside with the solutions journalism since it indicated the problems - when problems are discovered - it is easier to find solutions.      I get my inspiration from different sources - they might be professional data journalists whose work I admire, or sometimes people sharing with their experience can play as a motivation for me to make a project. An article “The Last Person You’d Expect to die in Childbirth” by ProPublica’s Nina Martin about preventable maternal deaths inspired me to write more about women and the problems they are facing. I wrote an article about women who get infected with HIV by their sexual partners and I think with the article I could raise awareness about women and HIV. I understand for myself that raising an awareness in any of my work is my professional priority - if my work is able to change minds even of one person, I will know that I am doing my work not in vain. That is another reason why I should be considered for this award - as a rising young journalist, I want to fight stereotypes and disinformation that harm people themselves  and I am sure I can do it with the help of data journalism.   ","  “I was not protected because I completely trusted him”. Why women in Kyrgyzstan started to get infected with HIV more and more” focuses on women who mostly got infected by their sexual partners and did not know their partners HIV status. I used the UNICEF publications on condom usage by women and mostly women were not using it during the sexual intercourse. An article got about 3000 views.      In the article “More than half of the students in the regions do not study well. What does housework have to do with it?”, I wanted to prove the argument that most of the children from the remote areas cannot get into higher educational institutions not because they are not talented, but they were not given a chance because of the work amount that they were responsible for. The challenge for the article was getting the data. Most of the times data is in PDF publications and they need to be transformed into excel format that allows us analyze the data.       ",https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aCsSmCD9Y76r9nuLUN0O8SwwZ4bbHd71ZZX4uoMefc/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jpY8paDTyPM53tgAfOPnumJCBH4NF8Itbc1oUdjwpTc/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/17-EUU0yrCQBGJKAd8wbplwHly6FBISEaUKooj_ARuUg/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
India,CNN News18 (Web),Big,Participant,Young journalist,Akash Gulankar," I see myself as a multilingual, technically sound journalist with an experience of a local as well as national newsroom in a diverse country like India. Along with reporting, I am well-equipped with Data Journalism skills which gives a unique identity as a journalist.    I began my career as a journalist back in college days. I started reporting for a local newspaper which retained me as a full-time journalist as soon as I completed an undergraduate degree. Later, I developed a keen interest in journalism and enrolled for the Master’s degree. That’s when I actually embarked on my full-time career as a journalist. However, I was still in search of something new until I ended up on one of the data journalism portals. That is when I decided to pursue this novel field of journalism.   I was working with daily Pune Mirror back in 2018 when data ticked my mind. The great Indian elections were ahead when I found an opportunity to work around data. I started working as a Data Journalist with CNN News18 in Delhi. As a prerequisite, I had done a little bit of research and rehearsed my MS Office skills. I was prepared, whatever may come. That’s how I began my journey on a data-trail.   I was constantly following the work of Paul Bradshaw who teaches data journalism. Also, platforms like IndiaSpend inspired me. While reading stories of different publications, I realised the huge power data wields within. Then I came across some of the reporting based stories. Bud, the addition of data gave them an unmatched assertiveness. Also, I came across some stories which wouldn’t have been possible without data.   In times like these, where everything is getting digitised and we ourselves are creating gigabytes of data per day it becomes important to render data-driven journalism. And I personally decided to take the onus.   I was mentored by many people throughout this journey. One of the important persons who gave me this opportunity, Saaliq Sheikh (currently with AP, India) taught me a lot of things. He opened up the avenue of data journalism for me. He not only made me familiar with this field but also was open for newer ideas. Alongside his guidance, I myself followed many blogs including Niemen Lab which gave me a thorough picture of the current scenario.   My previous journalism stint gave me a chance to take a closer look at the situation in the country and understand the problems of people while I worked on the ground. Now, data is empowering me with more strength to put across these problems in a scientific way. I can efficiently produce data-driven stories along with ground reporting inputs all by myself.   I am currently working with The Federal (<a href=""http://www.thefederal.com"">www.thefederal.com</a>) as a full-time Data Journalist and continue to be the flag bearer of the same. "," The project began as the Election Data Lab where General elections of India were to be covered from the data perspective. Meanwhile, we extended it to some other areas like the environment as well as education as we moved with time.   In the first phase, I tried to cover various aspects of Indian elections and the campaign chronicles. One of the interesting stories was about the utility of crowd-funding platforms. I found out that the popularity of the candidate in the digital universe mattered a lot. One would be able to collect an optimum amount of funds only if they had a good following on social media platforms. Thus, funding of the candidate was directly proportional to the popularity. This became a story.   There was abundance of cine stars in the candidature lists. That is when the idea clicked! The question was, though stars attract crowd, will they be able to convert it into votes? Then came the answer which was another story in the project. I did two different stories on this topic with different perspectives.   Bogus voting in India is a very well-known phenomenon. The election commission thus uses indelible ink as a mark of a vote. However, social media was flooded with the posts of people saying they were able to remove ‘indelible’ ink. It created a lot of buzz on the internet. Then, I checked the Google Trends to find that Indians were desperately searching for the means to remove the ink. The data affirmed the quirky nature of the Indian voters. No wonder the results were to show the same pattern.   Then came the result with historic figures of majority win by Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP). Their main opponent, grand old Congress had shattered. But the data proved that it was only BJP which crushed the legacy of Congress one at a time. They defeated Congress in more than 80 per cent of the places in a direct fight. The figures were a clear sign of a great paradigm shift in the politics of India which otherwise could not have been tracked without data. I claimed that the story immediately.   Another interesting story came as an extension to the above story. It was a little new party which made a big dent in Congress’ seat share in Maharashtra. Congress had disregarded Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) before the elections. It costed the loss of around 19 seats. Had VBA not turned up for the elections, all those seats would have been won by Congress. Since the VBA candidates swallowed all the differential votes.   Another two beats I explored were Education and Environment. Some of the Indian states face the perennial drought issue. However, last year was no different but it had all the other states too. At that point of time, decreasing levels of reservoirs and later uneven distribution of Monsoon alarmed the signals of a big change in climate cycle. The time-series data of the same was used to arrive at some conclusions about disruptive patterns of monsoon and its probable impacts.   The union budget of India was tabled in the month of July. I analysed the previous five year’s budget and a few other components as well as changes in methods of funding. I found out that the current government was not very keen on educational reforms. They did put across the different image of themselves but numbers told another story. Thus, I managed to track the pattern which clearly deciphered the convenient ignorance of the government towards one of the fundamental sectors of nation-building.

United States,"NJ Advance Media,VTDigger",Big,Participant,Young journalist,Erin Petenko," My journey through the world of data journalism began my last semester at Rutgers University, when then-NJ.com data journalist Steve Stirling came to my class and introduced me to the idea of combining statistical analysis and data visualization with traditional investigative techniques. I soon realized it would be a perfect beat for my background as a public health major and longtime student paper reporter. I joined Steve as an intern, then a full-time journalist as the company's roster of data reporters expanded from just the two of us to a team of six reporters and an editor.   During my <a href=""https://connect.nj.com/staff/epetenko/posts.html"">three years at NJ.com</a>, I learned skills to approach my reporting from many angles: Python to analyze large chunks of data, Javascript and D3 to visualize it and the art of public records requests to gain a deeper context for my reporting. Those skills helped in the largest NJ.com data project ever attempted: <a href=""http://force.nj.com/"">The Force Report</a>, a 18-month investigation into police use of force that included a never-before-seen database of five years of police force in New Jersey and a series of articles delving into our findings. For the project, I wrote an article examining victims' stories and created a map of police force rates, but I think my biggest contribution was the months of data cleaning and analysis I did as part of the team. My time on the project convinced me that collaborative journalism is the key to producing high-quality local journalism reporting, particularly when it comes to giving readers access to hidden or challenging datasets.   In September 2019, I moved to Vermont to take a job as data reporter for the <a href=""https://vtdigger.org/author/erinpetenko/"">VTDigger</a>, a small nonprofit newsroom devoted to watchdog governmont reporting. Although I'm still learning about the state, my goal here is to spend more time working on high-quality reporting for Vermonters. While I don't mind an occasional lighthearted story —like <a href=""https://www.nj.com/news/g66l-2019/08/80df18bd046430/how-many-beachgoers-visit-the-jersey-shore-we-flew-over-it-to-find-out.html"">counting the number of beachgoers from a plane</a> or <a href=""https://www.nj.com/news/2019/08/plastic-forks-be-damned-what-we-learned-from-our-month-of-reducing-waste.html"">tracking how much plastic I throw away</a> —my passion is for a blend of investigative reporting and data journalism that delivers real impact for the public good. I also love to mentor reporters as they delve into data journalism. I've taught several classes on <a href=""https://github.com/epetenko/datawrapper-tutorial"">creating charts</a> and using Census data in the newsroom, and have led conference sessions on D3 and coding. My hope is that my teaching will inspire another young reporter to try this new field the way Steve inspired me that day in class. "," My last investigative solo project for NJ.com was also, in a way, my first: I started looking into Jay's Bus Service, a local bus vendor with an oddly high crash rate, back in October 2017. My progress was slow at first, halted by my time working on The Force Report and a number of failed records requests. But when I uncovered their court records showing a history of lawsuits tied to deadly crashes, I knew I had to forge ahead. Along the course of the investigation, I gained a deeper background on Lakewood, New Jersey — the crucible of some of the state's toughest cultural and economic divisions — by attending meetings, developing sources and writing minor stories in my free time. I met a man permanently injured in a crash with a Jay's school bus and spoke with many parents who had seen the buses' dangerous behavior firsthand. Although the story failed to make an immediate change to Jay's contracts in the area, it got a lot of passionate responses from locals and <a href=""https://www.nj.com/news/2019/06/public-deserves-a-response-to-concerns-over-school-bus-companys-safety-record-lawmaker-says.html"">questions about the safety</a> of private bus companies.    I've also decided to include my story for the VTDigger about out-migration in Vermont, one of the most-read pieces of all time on the site because of Vermonter concerns about our shrinking population. I later followed that story with an analysis of <a href=""https://vtdigger.org/2019/10/03/as-vermonters-leave-small-towns-they-flock-to-burlington-region/"">migration within Vermont</a>.    I included links to my bio pages for each newsroom in case you would like to see a broader swath of my work.

Russia,"Novaya Gazeta, Rossia Segodnia",Big,Participant,Young journalist,Alexey Smagin," Hello! My name is Alexey Smagin, I'm 23-years-old data-journalist from Russia.     My slogan is: always try something new and never forget to surprise. I think my profession is a perfect illustration for this words.    First of all, data journalism helps to find interesting knowledge about how our world works. In 2019 I worked for the most powerful opposite newspaper in a Russia — Novaya Gazeta and for the goverment news agency — Rossia Segodnia. I did plenty of works in very different areas: culture, tecnology, politics, science, demography and even judgement system. I figured out that the russian judges copy and paste texts in their judgements even when they try to judge different people; I discovered that there is no place for woman in most of Oscar nominations; proved that the screen became the most important part of mobile phones and got to know that Zelenskiy's most important task for first 100 days of work was to fire all the wrong officials. I love my work because it gives me opportunity to know something new in every project.   The second reason why I am so crazy about my job is that it lets me to do very different tasks. I use Python to scrape and work with data, I write text sometimes, I think about project ideas, I make visualizations with Tableau, Nodebox, Datawrapper and the other tools, sometimes I even do design and use JavaScript to make interactive things. And I love that my work is not routine.   I am very interested in data-storytelling and have a channel in Telegram where we with my recent collegues write about data journalism: <a href=""https://t.me/novaya_data"" target=""_blank"">https://t.me/novaya_data</a>     ","  1. https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2019/03/20/79929-sudi-derzhat-nas-za-bolvanku    This is a project about copy-paste in judgements. We discovered that copy-paste in Russia is not surprising thing: it's not it is not prohibited and widespread practice. It's very bad for defendants because judges can be not enough critical when simply copy text from their previous works.    My part of work:  I made an instrument which could compare the texts, show a result and highlight the same parts; I write the part of story, was an editor of the project (storytelling and literary editing) and did most of data visualisation.    2. https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2019/02/23/79660-kto-takoy-oskar    The research about discrimination in Oscar. We made a dataset of all Oscar nominants (1929-2019) and manually labeled all of their sex and skin colours. Then we looked what is surprising about nominants' age, skin and gender.

Serbia,Balkan Investigative Reporting Network - BIRN,Small,Shortlist,Young journalist,Ana Curic," My name is Ana Curic and I am a young journalist based in Belgrade, Serbia. I entered the world of investigative journalism as soon as I graduated from the Faculty of Political Science at University in Belgrade. In 2017 I joined BIRN Serbia, which is part of Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, where I mostly cover misuse of public funds, justice and financial crime. Besides investigations, I also monitor organized crime trials.   After last year, my career is richer for one nomination for the prize, one cross-border investigation, few data-driven stories, development of digital tool together with human story, collaboration with ICIJ and fellowship of GIJN.   I was nominated for the Annual Prize for Investigative Journalism in Serbia for the series of articles about illegal engagement of high officials from the ruling party at Medical College in central Serbia, as revealing the fifth salary of the MP and visiting his classes grabbed enormous attention and reactions from citizens, media and authorities.   My favorite investigation published in 2019 was “Illumination of Serbia, Hungarian Style”, a cross-border investigation about network of companies connected both to Hungarian and Serbian authorities which are getting all the jobs for implementation of LED lights in Serbia, financed by public funds, in the same way they did it in Hungary.   With passion for financial crime and after attending courses for it and learning from senior investigative journalists and financial forensics, I was inspired to investigate how Serbia deals with money laundering. Trainings for financial investigations gave me skills to detect schemes for money laundering and to become the one in charge of analyzing financial records in the newsroom.   In November 2019 my name was added to contributors of the ICIJ’s International Medical Devices Database, which is part of big investigation called Implant Files done by International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, for adding 137 medical records from Serbia. During months, I was working on collecting documents about implants in Serbia and making a database from it in a way that it could be implemented in one of the biggest medical databases ever made.   In the meantime, I was attending some of the most important happenings for journalism in the world during 2019. European Investigative Journalism Conference and Dataharvest was where my collaboration with ICIJ has started. In September 2019 I attended Global Investigative Journalism Conference in Hamburg as one of the fellows of Global Investigative Journalism Network. These are the places where I found a lot of inspiration and motivation for my work, while being surrounded by excellent journalists from all around the world with the same passion for struggle for hidden true with the name “investigative journalism”. And in that struggle, contacts and knowledge gained at these events are priceless.   My mission is supported with high motivation based on belief that I am doing one of the most important things – giving people the truth every day by revealing the things which were supposed to kept secret and reporting on it while trying to make this world a better place. "," ""Illumination of Serbia, Hungarian style"" is a cross-border investigation which revealed that the “scheme” for public lighting tenders in Hungary, where companies connected to government won the most of the tenders, has been exposed to neighboring country – Serbia. A network of companies connected to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic and Serbian ruling party secured at least 50 million euros from public funds at very suspicious tenders. The story is based on documents from public procurements, contracts between these companies and municipalities, dozens of interviews with businessmen, politicians, experts, mayors of municipalities and team members who participated in the process. This investigation is important because it revealed the corruption in one whole area and because it is ongoing story so we publish follow ups.   ""Serbia weak on Penalizing Money Launderers"" ("" Pranje novca u Srbiji - bez velikih slucajeva i rezultata"" ) is a big analysis about money laundering in Serbia which for the first time showed the scope of money laundering in this country and punishment policy for this criminal act over the last decade. While Serbia was recognized as a country with high-risk of money laundering by FATF – The Financial Action Task Force, the international body for monitoring money laundering and terrorist financing activities, the fact how we came to that point was important but completely unknown. That is how it started - obtaining and analyzing data from more than hundred verdicts and information from courts and prosecution which led to this data-driven story. It was the first opportunity both for citizens and authorities to see the exact true results based on data, instead of results proclaimed by high officials on the television.   ""Mothers in Serbia feel the brunt of new law"" is a human story about all the challenges that mothers in Serbia have faced after the new Law on financial support for families with children was adopted. New formula for calculating their compensation while on maternity leave left a lot of women with miserable amounts of money. In depth interviews are the bloodstream of this investigation, which besides revealing all the troubles for new mothers also helped in detecting their needs and developing an online tool which will help them while trying to secure their rights. The tool, which is mix of calculator and kind of manual, developed to navigate you through the process and calculate if your allowance is higher or lower with the new law, was also a response to authorities who denied providing us any data. Besides for new mothers, the project was significant for decision-makers as well since they organized a working meeting with the civil society representatives a week after the article was published. Prime minister Ana Brnabic, Ministry of Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy Zoran Djordjevic and Minister without portfolio responsible for demography and population policy Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic set together with more than 10 NGO's and showed interest in fixing problematic law.

Indonesia,PT Narasi Citra Sahwahita (Narasi TV),Small,Shortlist,Young journalist,Sharon Margriet Sumolang," I am a recent graduate of International Relations (IR) major with a degree in IR. While most of my friends choose to work as a diplomat or a government official, I prefer to develop my knowledge by being a journalist. Before working as a full-time reporter, I've already had my internship here, on Narasi TV. Narasi TV is digital broadcasting media, producing one of Indonesia's most favorite television programs, Mata Najwa, for the past decade. Hosted by Najwa Shihab, one of the most prominent journalists in the country who's well-known for her ability to moderate a panel interestingly and to dig informations deeply from the speakers. Now, I am grateful that she is my Boss. Can you imagine, your role model can be someone who you share newsroom with, learning directly from her, and to observe daily what she does, hoping that someday you can also follow her footsteps?    I have always wanted to create something that brings impact to society. I believe that it's part of the learning process to produce contents that could touch the hearts of many people or even to express our concerns and critics to the regulators. In addition to Ms. Shihab, I have other mentors who have been helping me to shape my skill and answering my curiosity. It's precious to see their patience in answering my everyday's questions, from politics, to social, to the economy, and culture. I definitely cherish every moment I have in the newsroom, because I know I'm not just reading theories from books, but I'm learning from the practioners themselves with years of experience.   Every day I challenge myself to propose a topic to producers, as I'm also working in the daily news division now. It's so good to make videos about something that matters to me. And somehow, what a great feeling that I could do this for a living. My first ever news coverage was about refugees in Jakarta. It's painful to see how people have to flee from their countries because of war, terrorism, etc. However, I also found an interesting fact that there are some of them who just went out from their homes just because they want to move to first-world country.  My 2019's highlight was also when I covered the biggest demonstration after the one in 1998 that successfully collapsed Soeharto's Government.    I took several classes about mobile journalism, story telling, basic investigative reporting, and photography for research and still craving for more. In the future, I wish I could have my master degree, specializing in politics and government, and how it's related to the development. The outcome is not only benefitting me, but also my community even my country. I dream to be a journalist who's expert at one thing and can help the aspiring future generation to make their dreams come true, too.   I still have a long way to go. My hope for myself will always be the same, to have a mindset of a disciple who loves to learn and to be taught. Just like when I was asked by a manager on the recruitment process, ""People say that journalists exploit stories. What do you think about that?"" I answered, ""We don't exploit. It's never the idea of journalism. We open ourselves to furthermore develop trust with people. We tell stories so that in many cases, justice can be advocated."" Journalism, is literation moving for a cause.  "," The project's titled  ""Tracing InsightID: The Digital Footprint of Papua Propaganda Machine"" . So, the issue that erupted last year about Papua conflict that happened in several cities in Indonesia has been a long-lasting one. It was not new, but last year was quite catastrophic with many people died, demonstrations occurred here and there, the restriction of the internet by the government, and military apparatus placement in Papua. Foreign journalists couldn't even move freely in covering the news about Papua. Benjamin Strick, a Bellingcat investigator, found bots on Twitter, Facebook, and Youtube used to spread propaganda about government's programs toward the island, with the European communities as their targets. They also used English as their language. This was to tackle the issue in the international arena. Facebook eventually took those accounts down.   Then, Facebook uncovered Insight.Id, the state-controlled institution behind the operation, as a fake account to carry out the pages. A few hours after Facebook released the list, their website was no longer active. Someone who behind the Insight.ID desk, Pera Malinda Sihite, also deleted all of her social media accounts, from Twitter to Instagram. Pera was also the founder of Ladang.ID, as mentioned on her Linkedin account. The address of Ladang.ID office is the same as the Insight.ID office. So, we went to the location of the address, but the house number didn't exist. We hardly located number 21A, only 21B. It's strange that in January 2019, when we tracked the house using the Google Street View, house number 21B was supposed to be 21A. It was pretty visible that the number had just been changed.   We contacted Pera but got no response, so we contacted Fitri Handayani who was also Ladang.ID's founder. She denied every accusation, including the USD 300.000 ads. She was firm that InsightID was merely a content creator company used against the Papua Separatist group. Fitri was unwilling to disclose her boss. Meanwhile, Fitri Handayani showed her anxiety to work as a propaganda machine. She poured out her feeling on tense poetry, “Berias dalam Narasi” which was up on her blog. We still got a chance to catch her poetry before she took it down.    “My heart groans for how many victims are down because of my fingers. My heart cries as I support to shut the democracy.” “Now I realized, it’s not about truth. It’s the propaganda that I have injected.” “I’mma keep silent, let his power tearing people down. My glasses are not blurry, I just cannot speak.” I’m sorry, Gie.   The blog has now vanished.      Departing from the ""WHY?"", why we created this content in the very first place was to prove that there is a propaganda machine used by the government. Therefore, the public could be informed to be more aware of contents spreading in social media regarding Papua. We gain many positive reviews, especially when Open-Source Intelligent (OSINT) is still not yet that popular here in Indonesia. As we're introducing OSINT in Indonesia, we hope that journalism in Indonesia could be more modern, hi-technology without neglecting the essence of journalism itself, such as honesty, integrity, and fact.   We got more than 26.900 viewers and more than 1.500 likes on Youtube. The producer of this project, Aqwam Fiazmi put the video on his Twitter (@aqfiazfan) and it gained more than 80.700 viewers with more than 1.600 like. The commenters raved about it after we exposed the truth. ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_-Msc1j_fU&t=18s,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turkey,Medyascope.tv,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Sema Kahriman Gökçe," As a student at the Üsküdar University in Istanbul I've got data journalism lessons from Pınar Dağ. Since then I am very interested in data journalism. Through my teachers reference I joined the Data Literacy Association (DLA) Turkey (<a href=""https://www.voyd.org.tr/tr"">VOYD</a>). I tried to visualize data weekly for VOYD.   After studying I started at <a href=""https://medyascope.tv/"">Medyascope TV</a> where I found the chance to practice data journalism.

United Kingdom,BBC,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Rob England," I am a data journalist based in Birmingham, UK, working for the BBC England Data Unit.    Since graduating with a masters in journalism from Cardiff University in 2016, I worked in investigative documentaries for ITV Studios, as a producer for various BBC radio stations and as a digital journalist for BBC News online, before joining the unit in January 2019.   Over the last year I have thrown myself into innovative and original data-driven investigations, upskilled myself in coding, while retaining the mindset of a local reporter, who prioritises connecting his work with the regular lives of people across the country.   I have a lot of freedom in the range of stories I can cover within our relatively small team of three, but have had to quickly adapt and embrace new skills such as wrangling and visualising data using code - as we do everything between us.   My main task is to create original, data-driven stories by researching a topic through traditional tip-offs or finding interesting an interesting source of data. I’m then responsible for cleaning the data, pitching the story, writing it and visualising the data. A keystone of this is also finding compelling case studies from a diverse range of people - to show our readers why the data we’ve gathered affects them and their lives.   This is by far the most important aspect to every piece I write. While I believe a data-driven story without a human voice can still be compelling and technically impressive, the personal aspect brings it under the noses of everyday readers, where it can be a better force for change.   I’m also often tasked with reacting to data released into the public domain - usually by public bodies such as the government or the NHS - and finding an original take on any story that emerges, to make it more than just an update to statistics we may have seen before.   The technical part of my job I find most satisfying is finding ways around the challenges of cleaning and structuring data, to build original datasets. For this I use a variety of tools which I’m constantly updating and changing as I learn.    Every week I will find a new use for a package in R, or a way to use a combination of Excel functions to do a complex task. I also find using this technology improves my workflow in breaking data stories, by preparing scripts for visualisation to allow swift publication.   The projects I’ve attached show how I’ve applied my skills to a range of different subjects, all driven by issues faced by people in the UK in everyday life. I’ve also shown a mix of original journalism and ‘on the day’ stories, which required investigating prior to release to establish whether there was a newer, better public interest story behind the numbers. The technical skills required have ranged from visualisation in R, as well as data wrangling and analysis, to using advanced formulas in Excel.   For the vast majority of submissions I was responsible for all aspects of the story, however, all were sub-edited by our team’s senior journalist, Dan Wainwright, who has also helped me immeasurably develop over the past year, and Paul Bradshaw, who in times where I was overwhelmed by technical challenges, offered me invaluable advice and suggestions on ways to overcome any issues.    My submissions are a small selection of pieces from January to October 2019. "," Link 1:    In July 2019 I published my original investigation into the effectiveness of the public’s ability to appeal “lenient” criminal sentences in the UK - I found many appeals were being discarded automatically because there were huge limits to the types of crimes that were eligible to be reviewed.   I acquired the data through the Freedom of Information Act, asking for how many sentences had been appealed over five years and what the results had been, which was provided to me in an excel spreadsheet.   To get the headline figures, I had the issue of sorting large blocks of text which were not uniform, but meant the same thing, such as mis-spelt offences which were skewing the overall figures. To get over this hurdle, I merged the data for each year together into one spreadsheet using Rbind, then ran the results through OpenRefine to clean these descriptions up.   However, the main technical issue with one aspect of this story was extracting the lengths of each criminal sentence before and after it was reviewed, when the raw number was embedded in a block of text in each cell of the spreadsheet.   To do this, I had to create a system of functions to access where the number began in the cell and then a further set of functions, nested within each other, to extract it.   The story was published in July, and in September the government announced an expansion of the scheme, to include more offences.   Link 2:   Every year the UK government reveals how many families have been fined for taking their children out of school for holidays during term time. However, the shock story to emerge this time was the numbers had nearly doubled in a year.   I was able to ascertain the significance of the story well ahead of the release, by finding and approaching Jon Platt, a father who had lost a historic court case in the previous year for taking his child on holiday during term time. Jon had conducted his own research in his local area, and we were able to obtain enough information for other parts of the country to suggest there had been a surge in fines. This led me on to other parents, who formed the heart of the story.   On the day, when the data was released, we had the bones of the story ready to go, and were able to quickly turn around the data using R to quickly analyse the relevant spreadsheet - this was then visualised as an interactive map using Carto, as well as some simpler charts.   Link 3:   An example of data journalism and news that our audiences can use in their day-to-day lives, this piece on the cost of school uniform was a collaboration between myself and a colleague in national TV.   I incorporated the results of a scraper written by my colleague Paul Bradshaw, which calculated how many Facebook groups were created relating to school uniform swaps in the UK. We also used one of the groups we approach as examples in the piece.   We combined this with data from UK government surveys, independent surveys and information I scraped from supermarket websites, to look at the costs of school uniforms, how it varied between primary and secondary school clothes and discussed possible ways for families to save money.

Egypt,InfoTimes,Small,Participant,Young journalist,Young journalist,"  I grew up watching the news; hearing stories from around the world, realizing that the Sudan people are reporting about is not the Sudan I know. I am part of the diaspora generation. Everywhere I go I hear the same comment: ""Is it safe in Sudan?"" ""Do you guys have streets?"" ""Is it an actual country?"" ""What is Sudan like?"" These questions REALLY frustrated me because it showed me how ignorant the world is. But how could I have blamed them if all they see in the news is the war that broke out in the south and west? I want people to understand that my country is more than just a conflict zone. I want them to know that there is a deeply embedded cultural heritage that goes beyond war. Most of our history has been written and told through a colonial perspective. I believe that people's stories should be told by one of their own. I want to be the voice of my Sudanese generation because I understand what they are going through. The role of journalism is to inform. It is my duty as a journalist to revive my country's history and shed light on its present by sharing these stories with the public sphere. The opportunity to grow as a journalist in Sudan is very difficult with the tight leashes on the press. Most of the regional and international opportunities available are not open for Sudanese. There are very limited opportunities for women to work in the field of journalism in the region because it is  relatively conservative, especially when it comes to the matter of gender roles, as well as the restriction on media outlets. Despite the limitation, I have persisted to contribute to the field of journalism by working as a reporter and producer. With the help and support of my previous professor and now mentor, Kim Fox, I was able to pioneer different multimedia tools, such as infographics and video stories, in several local media outlets. I attended a workshop on data journalism two years ago - to me the field was intriguing as I believe that data supports a story by providing numerical evidence and non-numerical information. However, the opportunities are very scarce as there is only one platform that tackles stories using this form of reporting. Currently, I am now a part of a team in the region’s first data journalism platform, InfoTimes. InfoTimes’ founder, Amr Eleraqi introduced me with the necessary tools to create data-driven stories supported by data visualizations. I was shortlisted for the BBC Komla Dumor Young African Journalist in 2018. I was selected as one of 7 journalists in Egypt to produce a short documentary as part of Open Media Hub's ""Being 20"" series.   ","  I introduced video stories to the platform as well as produced and edited high impact video stories about mental health hospitals, homeless shelters, animal shelters, and water pollution in Egypt generating over 200,000 views and 50,000 new followers during my time at Egyptian Streets - leading independent media outlet. I wrote stories about current events, arts and culture and entrepreneurship, as well as feature stories tackling social issues like single motherhood in Egypt, sexual assault and harassment, environmental challenges facing Egypt. I conducted interviews with high authoritative figures knowledgeable about each story's subject matter. When i was working in Egytpian Streets, we partnered up with NGOs to create campaigns to raise awareness about sexual harassment and assault in Egypt by releasing a series of articles tackling the subject from different angles. We also partnered up with NGOs to launch a campaign against the disposal of plastic waste in the Nile River by releasing a series of articles tackling the subject from different angles as well as participating in the Nile clean up campaign. In Business Forward - business and finance platform- I piloted visualizing stories through video storytelling and produced stories on AI, health tech, entrepreneurship, blockchain and the automotive industry generating over 55,000 views. I also researched industry trends and created visually appealing infographics using data to shed light on topics such as entrepreneurship ecosystem, and Egypt’s road network funding.  As part of the InfoTimes team, I generated data driven stories ideas and used statistical analysis tools to write stories about air pollution, marriage age, and agriculture in a compelling format. I used statistical tools to identify significant data trends for stories such as obesity rate, sucide rate, annual rainfall rate. I also design infographics in accordance with each story using data visualization tools such as Tableau, Infogram, Flourish and Datawrapper. I led editorially on data projects related to clients and supervised the work of other data team colleagues. In 2018, I directed and produced a short documentary for Open Media Hub's ""Being 20"" series that aimed to tell stories about people in their 20s. My documentary was about the first ballet school in Upper Egypt. This experience really put my skills to the test because I had to single handedly organize the whole production. I was able to hire cameramen, rent the needed equipment and book a car to take us to the location (which was approximately 5 hours away) all under 4 hours from the expected travel time because the interviewees confirmed at a short notice. I learned how to manage a team and plan for a production under pressure.           ,      ",https://infotimes.org/egypts-residents-can-gain-up-to-1-27-years-if-air-pollution-decreases/,https://infotimes.org/egypts-average-annual-rainfall-dropped-to-nearly-50-since-1960/,https://infotimes.org/mens-suicide-rate-is-4-4-times-higher-than-women/,https://infotimes.org/algeria-and-tunisia-have-the-oldest-average-age-of-marriage-where-is-egypt/,https://infotimes.org/cairo-expansion-devours-its-outskirts-as-population-grows/,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Denmark,Devex,Small,Participant,Young journalist,Maja Wisenberger," As a young and aspiring data analyst with more than 4 years of progressive experience in the global development community, I thrive on leveraging data for social impact. In my current position as Senior Development Data Analyst at Devex, which is the world’s largest platform for development professionals and aid workers, I inform 1,000,000+ members and partners to make decision-making and operations more efficient. The global development industry has been suffering from information asymmetry and lack of capacity to use the insights from data for many decades and it is only now that the change to data-driven narratives are encouraged. My day-to-day work involves translating the overwhelming world of data, often trapped in pdf files and massive datasets from a variety of donors and across different locations and sectors, to actionable and well-informed solutions.       My journey with data analysis began already during my university time, where most of my works entailed primary data collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative nature related to a range of issues, such as gender equality, trade relations and nonprofit scope and role in the society. One of my biggest achievements during my studies was being awarded a prestigious research grant to conduct an 8-week field study around China to collect data on the presence and challenges of the nonprofit sector, which was published to inform future policy decisions of local government entities across a few provinces in China.         Although data and its dissemination have been at the forefront of my tasks for nearly six years now, it was only two years ago when my data expertise has expanded to a fulltime undertaking. Since the beginning of my tenure at Devex, I have learned to work with many data sources, including from multilateral banks, development finance institutions, European and US-based private foundations, corporate foundations, bilateral development agencies and OECD. As I tackled more complicated datasets, I learned the data visualization tool Tableau in the span of a couple of weeks to build interactive visualizations for the members to encourage others in their discovery of how data can be applied to their particular context.       Prior to my current position, I was working in research and partnership at UN Women, UNOPS, and a number of development organizations locally and internationally. As an avid traveler and trilingual, I have studied and worked abroad in Ghana, Malaysia, Denmark, India, China and the Philippines. I hold a B.Sc. in Development Studies from Lund University and a M.Sc. in Public Management from Chinese Academy of Sciences and Copenhagen Business School (dual degree), for which I spent two years in Beijing, China. My academic experience encompasses five years of research in the fields of international development, political science and public policy.       I believe the Sigma Awards for the category of “Young Journalist” would enable me to continue my journey with leveraging data for social impact and connect with other conference participants to discuss on how to best deliver results for the most impactful solutions. I am still learning and wish to deepen my data analysis and dissemination skills and I could not think of a better setting than that of the International Journalism Festival. While the Sigma Awards pose an incredible opportunity for learning, I wish to raise awareness of success stories in the global development industry. I believe many in the industry struggle to connect data to strategic insights and by showing it is possible and gaining recognition for the efforts might just be the starting point to truly keep the momentum up for the data-driven approaches applied to the development programming in the past couple of years.     ","Having experienced how powerful the insights stemming from data can be for development programming, I continuously seek to advocate for data transparency in aid and other funding reporting. For instance, I have been supervising a story written by my subordinates on funding from Japan's development cooperation agency, JICA, which was the first analysis in the world for this donor (project link 4). The insights from this piece have and will continue to inform people working on the ground, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), implementing private sector partners and other relevant civil society actors, increasing understanding of Japan's development priorities and how they play out in the funding data. With time, my analysis became more sophisticated and reaching more prominent members. For example, my analysis of five years' of climate funding data (project link 1 ) has been referenced during Devex's coverage on COP25 – the annual United Nations climate conference. My work on HIV/AIDS funding data (project link 2) has also been acknowledged by Ambassador Birx, who is in charge of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which is the largest initiative in the world addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Through my involvement in numerous webinars explaining the data analytics for certain sectors and actors, for instance looking at the development cooperation of Chinese government agencies or discussing the newest changes to PEPFAR data (project link 4), I connect the different parts of the development ecosystem by inviting external speakers validating the reality behind the data. Frequently, the data we analyze and report on concerns sensitive topics and I believe it is the responsibility of the analysts and writers to attach humanity to numbers, especially if they are large. Beyond data transparency advocacy and linking different actors in the industry through dialogue, some pieces I have worked on analyze data for the purpose of business development purposes. Most of data in the industry is highly decentralized and not always readily found, but at the same time many professionals rely on it to bid for opportunities and build up their programming portfolio. In those cases I have for instance analyzed and created interactive visualizations for UK's development cooperation agency, DFID (project link 5), and ranked top US-based private foundations (project link 6) for improving institutional knowledge and better understanding of donor funding landscape. The underlying challenges across all the coverage I have done has been the lack of timely data as well as incorrect tagging, which not only make the analysis of future trends difficult but also makes certain conclusions inaccurate, if for instance the classification of certain sectors, locations or even funding amounts is faulty. To catch these issues requires substantial familiarity with the data source itself, as well as great attention to detail, but with more experience it becomes easier to navigate. I have also a leading position in generating insights and content for specific research questions, which are solicited by numerous implementing agencies working in development. In one year only, I have successfully finished five major projects with world-renowned clients related to fundraising strategies, donor alignment assessments, and funding pipeline building. An example of a project that I recently finished was a donor landscape mapping, primarily analyzing major US-based foundations, in 22 of the client's focus countries across Africa and Asia. The insights and findings from this project have helped the organization diversify their donor base and they are soon expecting further engagements with the identified donors. Moreover, the client's satisfaction led to a series of follow-up projects with Devex, building a long-term partnership.

Kenya,"The Star Newspaper and People Daily - with the editorial help of Code for Africa (proof-reading, editing and data visualisation)",Small,Participant,Young journalist,Mirriam Wakini Njogu," I am a 27-year-old freelance data journalist based in Nairobi, Kenya. I am enthusiastic and passionate about telling health, gender and human rights stories. I have been a communications professional for the past five years, with a focus on Communication for Development. In mid-2018, I decided to channel my passion for storytelling for organizations to storytelling using data for mainstream media. I am a member of WanaData-KE (a Code for Africa project), a network of female journalists working on changing the media landscape by producing and promoting data-driven news. It is through their monthly trainings and editorial support that I have grown so much and gained exposure as a data journalist.   My approach to news reporting has been solutions journalism, where I don’t just focus on the problem, I look into the responses, solutions and alternative means to solving social issues. In 2020, I am extending my scope to producing audio content where I’ll create thought-provoking documentaries on gender and human rights abuses. I am inspired by Outlook and Tech Tent podcasts. both produces by the BBC World Service.   I am currently a resident at the Aga Khan University Media Innovation Center in Nairobi under DEBUNK, a new digital media start up that is working on shaping storytelling around Africa. I contribute in the team as a data journalist.   For the one year and a half that I have worked as a freelance data journalist, I have encountered several challenges, the main being outdated/unavailability of data, and refusal by newsrooms around Kenya to pay for quality work done by freelancers. This, however, has not deterred me. Instead, I have used my work to leverage for media opportunities and work on growing my brand, as I fight for better wages for my fellow freelance journalists. My mentors, Catherine Gicheru (ICFJ Knight fellow and Head, Code for Kenya) and Naima Mungai (WanaData Lead, Code for Africa) keep me grounded and have supported me editorially throughout this journey.   I am excited for the stories I plan on covering this year around Intersex Persons, Female Genital Mutilation, Adolescent Parenthood, and much more. I am also excited about the online courses that I have lined up; starting with Investigative Reporting in the Digital Age from the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas. ","Project 1 – Human Traffickers Ride on Desperation of Job Seekers Kenya is one of the countries with a high unemployment rate. This leads to job seekers looking for opportunities in the Gulf, and their experiences abroad are more saddening than encouraging. It is sad to note that unemployment, above anything else, makes Kenyans vulnerable to trafficking. 15.6% of these trafficking victims have attained University education. My article highlighted some of the human trafficking red flags they can look out for when seeking jobs, both locally and abroad. This was also a call to the government to take charge and deal categorically with these two issues that are interlinked; unemployment and Trafficking in Persons. According to the 2019 Trafficking in Persons report, Kenyan authorities are accused of penalizing victims for crimes they have been compelled to commit by their trafficker due to inadequate screening for trafficking indicators among vulnerable groups. More needs to be done to ensure that Kenyans do not feel the need to travel to the Middle East in search of green pastures. And even if they do, their safety shouldn't be compromised. The biggest challenge was that data on trafficking is outdated and scarce. However, this article has been presented in Trafficking workshops w Project 2 – Anguish of Working Breastfeeding Mothers As the world pushes for exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of a newborn's life, it's regrettable to note that only a few Kenyan employers have established breastfeeding facilities at their workplaces. No government office has a designated breastfeeding area, including the Parliament. According to a research by Philips, 52% of working women in Kenya resume work within three months after birth, contributing to a rapid decrease in breastfeeding rates. The Government of Kenya enacted the Health Act, 2017 which requires all employers to support working women to breastfeed at work by establishing lactation stations However, a huge number of institutions have not complied, which means that for the majority of the women who return to work after maternity leave, there are few sanitary places to express breast milk if they want to continue breastfeeding. Some opt to wait until they get home to breastfeed, thereby putting their health and their babies' wellbeing at risk. This article aimed at challenging the government to implement the Health Act, to challenge institutions to create lactation stations, and to also challenge archaic beliefs about breastfeeding, such as perceptions that breastfeeding is a domestic matter and should not be accommodated in the workspace. Project 3 – Wage Implications of Menstrual Health Management In 2017, Kenya's President, Uhuru Kenyatta signed the Basic Education Amendment Bill, which would ensure that the government provides free, sufficient and quality sanitary towels to every girl registered and enrolled in a public basic education institution and has reached puberty. Two years later, still, girls in rural areas and urban slums miss school since they can't afford sanitary products. With the help NGOs who visit schools within slums areas to donate sanitary products to girls above the age of 12, the number has significantly reduced. A harsh reality is that girls who do not attend school due to lack of school fees cannot access these free products. The aim of this article was to show how low wages (in the informal sector) lead to women neglecting proper Menstrual Health Management due to other pressing financial needs. Employers should evaluate the whole economic situation and offer better wages in order for families to meet these needs. The article was also a call to the government and its partners to stop taking Menstrual Health Management as an",https://s.the-star.co.ke/Human-traffickers-ride-on-desperation-of-job-seekers/,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YyDPvcAf-hO9nRCuvv5M1Yp-3xZBihbO,https://www.the-star.co.ke/amp/news/2019-05-28-wage-implications-of-menstrual-health-management/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Young journalist," Dear Committee,    I would like to be considered for the Young Journalist category. I work on the Guardian’s data projects team, producing data-driven stories and investigations. Throughout 2019 our work regularly led the Guardian’s news coverage online and in the paper, and has promoted the power of data journalism within the organisation and more broadly.     During 2019 I covered a wide range of topics from the gender pay gap to the plight of migrant workers building Qatar’s stadiums to digital campaigning in the UK’s general election. Four of these were front-page stories. I had a particular focus on investigative reporting and saw through several long term projects from idea stage to completion, including an investigation into UK schools’ use of crowdfunding websites to plug gaps in budgets.    As well as being widely read and shared, my work has had real world impact. Following our reporting into heat stress in Qatar, Liverpool FC <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/10/liverpool-back-investigations-qatar-deaths-club-world-cup"">called for an investigation</a> into migrant deaths before they played the World Club final in December. Leader of the opposition Jeremy Corbyn used <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/10/liverpool-back-investigations-qatar-deaths-club-world-cup"">our crowdfunding investigation</a> to hold the government to account over the schools funding crisis at Prime Minister’s Questions.    Each story presented unique challenges and I used a wide range of methods to obtain and analyse data: writing Python and Javascript scripts for scraping, building my own datasets, or merging open datasets to add value through making new and interesting connections.    Best Regards,      ","  Project link 1 - Schools Crowdfunding    After years of real-terms budget cuts, state schools have been increasingly forced to seek out donations to cover their costs. We produced the most comprehensive investigation to date into schools’ crowdfunding activity, revealing more than 1,000 schools had crowdsourced online donations since 2017.Our <a href=""https://twitter.com/SkyNewsPolitics/status/1131157815475822592"">research was cited </a>by Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition, as evidence of a schools funding crisis at Prime Minister’s Questions on 22 May 2019.    In this piece we built our own dataset to quantify a trend that was not captured in official data sources. Custom python scripts were written for each of the biggest crowdfunding websites and Amazon wishlists in order to scrape key data points and return the information in a structured form.    Project link 2 - Migrant workers     In a ground-breaking collaboration with meteorologists we were able to shed new light on the plight of migrant workers in Qatar.    Through our collaboration with Erik Hansonn, an academic at the University of Gothenburg, we were able to show it was unsafe to do any physical labour outside for large parts of the summer months despite the claims of the UAE authorities and construction firms. In particular we were able to show the “working ban” which most Gulf countries observe during the hottest part of the day in some summer months was completely inadequate in ensuring worker safety.   Hansson calculated the wet-bulb globe temperature values at regular intervals for each day between May 2008 and October 2017. I transposed these onto summer daytime and worked with the visuals team to produce a powerful graphic to represent the safe and unsafe times.     Project link 3 - The decline of dockless    I worked on a data-driven feature looking at the boom and bust of dockless bike schemes in the UK. This involved another collaboration with an academic at University College London, who gave me access to an exclusive dataset he had built tracking the peaks and troughs in bikeshare coverage owned by private dockless operators. I believe this entry shows my capacity to use data as the basis for engaging features as well as hard news stories.   The process involved counting up kilometres in geoJSON to illustrate shrinkage and collaborating with the visuals team to map the changing boundaries to tell a powerful story about their decline.     Project link 4 - Donations and inequality    In this story I built my own dataset to investigate the inequality within Britain’s state sector. We revealed a handful of elite state schools in England received millions of pounds in donations from wealthy parents. We used the data to show while some schools were able to weather sweeping budget cuts to English schools with supplementary income, many could not.    I built my own dataset from a variety of sources: data from the Charity Commission where donations are registered, Department for Education data on relative deprivation of a school and geographical data from the Office of National Statistics. Through building this dataset we found schools with the highest donations had lower than average proportions of poor students and were overwhelmingly concentrated in the affluent South-East.     Project link 5 -  Digital campaigning    As part of the Guardian’s digital campaign team we used data-driven reporting to investigate online campaigning in the UK’s most recent general election. This involved working with a number of different social media APIs and scraping data to provide a valuable explainer series for our readers. We were able to track how much political parties were spending, shine a light on whose videos were going viral and reveal Conservatives were lying routinely in the Google adverts.      ",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/09/cash-strapped-english-schools-turn-to-online-donations-to-close-funding-gap,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/02/revealed-hundreds-of-migrant-workers-dying-of-heat-stress-in-qatar-each-year,https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/22/life-cycle-is-it-the-end-for-britains-dockless-bike-schemes,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/14/wealthy-parents-stoke-school-divide,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/26/how-do-you-promote-a-party-manifesto-on-social-media,,,,,,,,,,,,,
India,Business Standard,Big,Shortlist,Young journalist,Somesh Jha," When I started my career as a 21-year-old journalist in Business Standard, India’s most credible financial newspaper, I had a fair idea that I would be dealing with a lot of numbers, especially since I was given the responsibility to cover statistics. The knack for digging out numbers was an inherent quality in me and I realised it just in six months of b when I reported on India’s rising inequality amid falling poverty ratio by getting access to the official data, which was not released in public domain, through a right to information law. My quest for data was not limited to the economy. While one day I wrote on fundraising tactic of India’s most successful political startups, the Aam Aadmi Party, the other day I exposed how the government had put private data of citizens online without checks and balances. More than six years in journalism, I have covered a range of subjects from politics to statistics to government policies, especially in the area of labour and banking for two leading general and business newspapers. It was a life experience during my teenage that put me in awe of what journalism was capable of: holding authorities to account. Not being allowed to play my favourite sport cricket due to a rule by residential administration disallowing children from playing in the park came as a big blow to me as a 14-year-old kid. More so because the New Delhi government had gone into overdrive to convert public playgrounds into parks and gardens, barring any sports activities there too. Dejected, I decided to write a letter to one of the leading national dailies The Hindustan Times, which my family had subscribed to. I dug out as many reporter contacts as I could from the newspaper and wrote my heart out. It was a child’s plea. It must have touched someone’s heart as the newspaper decided to carry a lead story in their local coverage, quoting me. Soon, all the major dailies latched on to the news. It turned out to be a big issue that found resonance across the city. The kids wanted to claim their parks back! Today, I am recognised a journalist who brings out in public the uncomfortable truth, often rugged under the carpet by the authorities. My work got recognition in the national press pretty early in my career and in over six years, I became an assistant editor, a feat achieved at a young age of 27 years. After being a financial journalist for more than two years when The Hindu, one of India’s biggest and oldest English dailies, offered me to cover the transportation sector in 2015, I took on the challenge of writing on policy for a general newspaper. But my love for data lured me back to Business Standard, when the opportunity to cover financial services - a prized beat in a business paper - came my way in 2017. Since then, I have put all my efforts into investigative journalism which has often shown the growing discomfort of the Indian government with statistics. I broke one of the biggest banking crises in 2017 – ATMs drying up in various parts of the country – that was followed up by both national and international press and drove the government into action. My news reports became a source of research paper on the state of India's labour market by prominent researchers based out of India and abroad. Today, I can say with some confidence that my spirit has continued to be that of a 14-year-old kid who holds the authorities to account. "," It was early 2018 and the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was under immense pressure to prove that it had been successful in creating millions of jobs, especially since it came to power in 2014 promising to create 10 million job opportunities a year. All the estimates were presenting a grim picture on the state of India's job market. Days before Mr. Modi was supposed to address the World Economic Forum in January 2018, an independent survey claimed 7 million jobs were created in India in 2017-18. The government was quick to endorse the survey. However, my investigation report established how the survey was secretly commissioned by the government to two independent economists, giving them unauthorised access to private data of citizens only to establish ‘robust’ job creation. Since then, working on the politics of statistics has become my pet project. A year later, in 2019, my investigative journalism was reflective of how politics has officially crept into India's renowned statistical system. Before the national elections in 2019, the Indian government held on to an official survey report on the country's labour market that eventually prompted a top government statistician to quit in protest. Following months of investigation, I managed to get my hands on the whole report, based on which I wrote that India's unemployment rate touched a 45-year high in 2017-18. For three months, I wrote a series of articles on the Indian labour market at a crucial time when the national elections were going to take place. No other journalist could get access to the report. The government, which denied the news initially, was compelled to release the same survey report after it was re-elected to power in May 2019 – re-affirming how India’s data architecture is under a political threat. My news report, published in January 2019, was followed up by the likes of The Economist, The New York Times and The Washington Post. I faced several challenges going forward while reporting in the power corridors as bureaucrats didn't want to be seen with me and my access was restricted in the government offices. To make matters worse, the government had officially set up a committee to find out the source of the leaked unemployment report. Though the committee wasn’t able to discover the whistle-blower, it was enough to intimidate the bureaucratic system. Did a curb on my access to government officials become a deterrent? No. I continued to dig deeper and 9 months later reported on the findings of another withheld official report which showed consumer spending falling for the first time in over 40 years (ever since India started collecting the data). It revealed fears of rising poverty levels. Since India's independence in 1947, the official poverty ratio had only declined. The day my news report was published in November 2019, the government decided to scrap the survey report – an unprecedented event in the country’s history. My work found a place in research papers written on India’s state of economy by prominent authors whom I helped with access to the data for their studies. The impact of my story was momentous. Over 200 economists, including Nobel laureate Angus Deaton and French economist Thomas Piketty, wrote an open letter demanding autonomy over India's statistical institutions. This prompted the government to release five survey reports, most of which were withheld, and set up an expert committee to look into the data credibility issues. My work became a missing piece in India’s statistical puzzle, helped fill a void in its economic story and presented a grim picture of the demise of statistical autonomy.

United States,The Arizona Republic,Big,Shortlist,Young journalist,Agnel Philip's 2019 portfolio," I’ve been fortunate to participate in large national and regional projects in the early years of my career that have produced meaningful findings and impact. In three years as a professional journalist, I’ve developed an array of data and traditional reporting skills. I’ve taught myself how to write complex web scrapers that reliably gather information I couldn’t receive from a public records request. I’ve used large databases and analyses to find sources for projects that shed insight into the human toll that the numbers on the screen hinted at.   Last year represented a large leap forward in my work that demonstrated my ability to excel in various formats and projects. In 2019, I helped launch a database hub for The Arizona Republic, led the aggregation and standardization effort for public salaries from more than 20 public agencies in Arizona, uncovered dubious business practices buried in an auction’ site code and helped a Native American community hold their leaders to account.   Now, I am the data reporter for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network, which supports more than 20 local investigations. In this role, I’ve provided key assistance to more than a dozen projects from web scraping to cleaning to analysis.   I’m incredibly grateful to the editors I’ve had at both The Arizona Republic, ProPublica and my alma mater Arizona State University who have pushed me to do that makes a difference. "," My highlighted project is an in-depth examination of the causes of pedestrian deaths in Arizona. This story drew on numerous data sources and techniques. The analysis provided compelling evidence for street design’s central in Phoenix’s high rate of pedestrian fatalities.   Phoenix, the state’s largest city, was of particular interest because it had the highest rate of fatalities. I used the state’s crash data to analyze both the crash circumstances and locations in the city. I found fatal collisions typically occurred on fast, wide stretches of road with few pedestrian safety measures. By digging into archival photos, I found these roads hadn’t been redesigned in decades, and, in some cases, were widened. And the city failed to build crossing signals in high crash areas, casting doubt on officials’ ability to meaningfully reduce deaths. We used the data to identify victims in the hotspot areas and reached out to families.   As a result of this story, the city began more explicitly calling for road design changes and considered adopting a plan to eliminate all roadway deaths.   The second project involved catching a company using a suspect practice in the act. My reporting partner received a tip that an online auction house was routinely bidding on its own items in an effort to raise the price for its sellers. The tipster provided a database and a way to identify these house accounts on the auction house’s website.   Using this methodology, I created a web-scraper to pull down full auction results for a 60-day period and found these accounts, identified by misspellings of common email providers, were bidding in an unusual manner relative to others on the site. They typically bid on high-dollar items like jewelry or cars and bid later in the auctions. The company confirmed the practice, saying it was disclosed and legal. But others who bid in those auctions — who we found via the scraper — told us they were unaware of it and thought the practice was unfair. The story was a top-performer on The Arizona Republic’s website for days, and others came forward with stories of suspicious auctions.   The third project involved breaking into a typically hard to reach community. After a story I wrote on casino regulations in 2018, some members of the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, reached out with various concerns about their tribal nation. Near the top of the list was that their share of the tribe’s gaming enterprise profits was lower than a decade ago. This created some financial hardship in a community that had a high poverty rate. They also felt misled because they were promised great dividends after the tribe constructed a luxury casino and resort. Using check stubs, they provided and publicly available figures on enrollment, I was able to estimate the casino’s state profits– a figure they didn’t release publicly or to their members. The resulting analysis found the casino had yet to recover to its pre-Recession profit level, raising questions of whether the gaming enterprise’s finances were being properly managed. Some residents called for increased payouts and transparency as a result of my reporting.   Finally, the last set of stories are fruits of AZ Data Central, The Arizona Republic’s collection of public databases that I helped launch a year ago. From restaurant inspections to public salaries, these pages generated above average engagement. In the case of public salaries, it spurred at least one public agency to address concerns of pay disparities. I designed the pages and assembled most of the databases themselves. The salaries database, for example, required standardizing disparate data from more than 20 public agencies.

United Kingdom,"The Times, The Sunday Times",Big,Participant,Young journalist,Tom Calver," To whom it may concern   I’d like you to consider my application for ‘young data journalist’. I feel that I’ve shown a broad range of analytical, visual and journalistic skills that make me a prime candidate for the award.   In January 2019 I joined the Times and Sunday Times and I’ve been proud of the work I’ve achieved since then.   I’ve worked on more than 60 exclusive stories on a number of different topics ranging from online reviews to online trolls. Five of my stories have made the front page.   Inspired by my first job at Which?, many of my investigations have a consumer focus. Specifically, I believe that tools such as scraping can be immensely powerful assets to consumer journalism: when making huge life decisions, whether buying a home or picking a school for your children, the average person is bombarded with bamboozling data in the form of prices, promotions and review scores. Scraping enables us to see the biases present in that data, and show the things that some companies would prefer be kept hidden. This approach has led me to exclusive stories about review sites, fire safety, trains and political campaigns, to name a few.   I use the programming language R on a daily basis which I’ve largely self-taught. I use it to gather data using APIs, scraping, or processing obscure open datasets. I’ve also led the Times interactive and data team in encouraging us to produce more graphics using ggplot. This culminated in being able to create stunning viral visuals in a matter of seconds on the morning of last year's election.   In many of my investigations I've shared bylines with other reporters and editors, and this is something I’m proud of – I’m honoured to work with some of the best reporters and editors in the industry, learning from them and combining their specialist knowledge with my data skills to tell the best stories possible.   However, this doesn’t mean that I’m just a data analyst. A data story is nothing without the people it affects, and I’ve demonstrated this mantra through my work on unfair gambling promotions where data analysis accompanied stories from people whose lives had been ravaged by gambling.    Just like the other members of the Times and Sunday Times newsrooms, many of my stories begin with tip offs from contacts, while during the election I was able to develop a patch in digital campaigning and advertising which resulted in my most prolific period of the year. I've also enjoyed writing longer features which tie data analysis, visuals and text together, as with my piece on the Apollo moon landings. In short, I’ve been keen to make myself a journalist who also codes, rather than the other way round.   Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.   Tom "," I am proud to present a selection of the stories and features I worked on in 2019, which I hope demonstrates a wide range of skills from getting data from unlikely sources to complex and effective visual storytelling.   I believe that data journalism can be hugely powerful for consumers, and my first two stories reflect that. The first one involved scraping and analysing thousands of listings on review site Trustpilot to prove how companies were gaming the website by effectively buying up reviews. The data showed how estate agents and banks would jump from just a handful of bad reviews one month, to thousands of good reviews the next, usually following a prize-for-review promotion of some kind. My story – which was met with feirce opposition from the company – nevertheless showed consumers that you can’t always trust a five star score.   The second story made the front page of the Times – no easy feat for a consumer story in a year dominated by politics. Through analysing hundreds of thousands of property listings, I was able to show which estate agents were wildly overvaluing homes to attract sellers. What’s more, the agents who were overvaluing the most – Foxtons, infamous to anyone who has ever sold or rented in South East England – were the ones charging the highest rates of commission, meaning they had a motive to attract as many sellers as possible. Our interactive tool ensured the story was useful as much as it was interesting.   My third submission shows my ability to tell a compelling visual story that keep readers hooked. While this year’s moon landing anniversary spawned a series of pieces as complex as the mission itself, I decided to take a different approach. Out went the pictures of rockets and black starry backgrounds; instead I opted for a simplistic style and drew on a boyhood obsession with space to show how close the Apollo 11 mission came to failure. With a little help from our brilliant design team, we also demonstrated complex laws of physics through line animations. Out of the dozens of moon landing stories published by the Times, this feature had the longest dwell time, while I was delighted with the many positive comments from our readers.   The fourth and fifth stories show my ability to turn open data into an explosive story, whether that be exposing how older, poorer areas with worse broadband are being impacted the most by bank branch closures – in other words, the people who rely on access to banking the most – or how the pressures on schools is leading to thousands of pupils as young as 11 being taught in super-sized classrooms. These are just some of the dozens of data-led stories I've pitched and written this year.   Finally, I ended the year by leading the Times’ day 2 election coverage. I wrote R scripts to load and analyse the election data as it came through and turn it into complex visuals using the ggplot package. Scripting these in advance meant they could be produced even before all of the results had come through. Some of the graphics, such as the “arrow” swing map, went viral after being shared by the paper’s political writers in the early hours of the morning.

El Salvador,Háblame de Respeto de la Fundación Latitudes,Small,Participant,Young journalist,Fundación Latitudes," My name is Milena Steffany García Arce, 21, currently a sixth semester student of the Bachelor of Social Communication at the “José Simeón Cañas” Central American University, located in El Salvador. From the first year I started at the university I have trained in the area of ​​data journalism at the Photography Center collaborating for the Specialized Portal “Talk to Me about Respect” which focuses on comprehensively addressing gender violence in El Salvador since 2014.   For me the study and interpretation of the data have acquired great importance since I learned to tell about the violence that women are experiencing in my country (El Salvador) which is considered one of the most violent in Latin America. Unlike most media and other organizations that work on data journalism, I, together with my team, have built a true LAB to address the phenomenon of gender violence that allows us to interact with anthropologists, forensics, psychologists studying in depth the reason for this violence. Using data journalism has allowed us to create a model where we convert these data and images to make it easier for more women to understand the different edges that converge in gender violence. This is my main reason why I continue to make data. I use the data and the narrative for the compression of diverse audiences, I develop multiple spaces of digital dialogues for a better understanding of gender violence.   In December of the two thousand nineteen to continue specializing in this area I took a free course in ""Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas"", I have also trained in courses in ""School of Data"". Among other diplomas I have the certification of Microsoft Office and other workshops. In the Center I have learned how to clean the data, how to develop stories based on them, among other techniques. The main mentor I have had is the President of the Latitudes Foundation who has given me the space to learn and develop.   In our country there is a lot of violence against women and there are no organizations that carry out an investigation like the one we carried out in the foundation since we focus on a systematic and educational process, in this way we have a continuous development since every so often it is being updated information.   In the ""Latitudes Foundation"" I have been specializing in these topics for three years through the ""Talk to Me Respect"" portal. Where I have understood that gender violence is a multicausal phenomenon in El Salvador, today the Salvadoran population has lost the capacity to be amazed at it. Women in areas with a greater presence of gangs, as well as in political strata continue to be used and underrated by society. Today the index of violence against women is high in the different forms of expression such as rapes, missing persons, unwanted pregnancies and femicides. These four edges of violence against women have helped us to reveal that pandemic at a national and global level that the data reflects that every day, 5 women are victims of aggressions in the world. In this project I participated in the narrative of the data.   This work is very important for me because when I discover the data of rapes and pregnancies they are in the minors, which leads me to a personal reflection of the real situation that women live in these ages. "," It seeks to identify the role of women within criminal structures in El Salvador from different data sources. This effort has required the foundation to integrate security and protection models for journalists, to create a timeline and structure information request processes through the Offices of Access to Public Information of the different state institutions, interviews with public officials,  prosecutors, police, site visits, story tracking developing a creative roping model that took us six months to present an academic scientific analysis.   With this database, the true role of women within the gang is achieved for the first time and demystify what many are secondary, and it is one of the main causes of feminicidal violence.   To give an answer, it was necessary to make a comprehensive approach that would help us systematize the different data that is collected through civil society, the State through public information among others. By having them we can link or cross the data to make an analysis of the different edges, which allows us to have a wider knowledge, in this way people can understand in a different way the dimension of violence that is not the product of a single action.       Obstacles:   • Personal security of the equipment   • Direct and indirect threats of criminal structures   • The refusal of the offices of access to information that seek to find flaws in the writing of the requests create a series of pretexts to delay the processes of delivery of the information   • There are public information officers who threaten articles of the law to generate intimidation and that one desist from requesting the information   • The lack of ethics of the officers who, because they are students, first provide the information we request to the media one or two days before to remove the impact of our investigations.   • When they ask for an appeal, they often send it on Friday, counting on weekends so as not to file a counterclaim   • I have faced two appeals trials   • We do not have great resources to do this research   A search, data collection and processing model was designed, and then transformed into images so that people who read us can understand this phenomenon in a simpler way. It is done in this way, because we analyze our audience, which detailed that they read more images than text. However, we have designed a communication plan for our readers as we create different content on our platforms, so that they can choose the most convenient way to interact with the data and get informed.   The specific public: women, journalists, organizations, the State. Our main goal is not only to reach a professional group, rather they are women who can become victims of violence, they are young people who, according to our statistics, are the most vulnerable to suffering all types of violence. Age range is between 15 to 55 nationwide although we try to focus on the municipalities that our data show the highest rate of violence. Currently, we use different tools to disseminate our research, each one fulfills a different communication objective for the website or for our social networks. Most of our publications that are for social networks have an average reach of 50%, as are our specialized reports. In addition, different organizations, media and government sectors request our information to have a better context on gender violence.

Portugal,Rádio Renascença,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Rui Barros,"My name is Rui Barros, a 25 years old data journalist based in Portugal. After a three months internship in 2016 at Rádio Renascença (a radio, and now online publication, founded in 1934), I was hired to create our data team – one of the first in the country. Since then and until this month, I have been working there, bootstrapping the data journalism field in the country, boosting the open data community and innovating article formats. With a background in maths and science in high school, I ended up studying journalism to realize that statistics and my interest in computer science shouldn't be a mere hobby, actually being a valuable asset in the journalism field. From 2013 to 2016, inspired by The Guardian's data blog, I started improving my programming skills. First, because I wanted to be able to make those amazing D3.js interactive data visualizations and secondly because I realized that Excel, or any other WYSIWYG software, imposed too many limitations for data analysis. For the past year, I worked on a variety of data-based projects and every new one was an opportunity to learn something new and expand my skill set. As the only dedicated journalist working directly with data in my newsroom, I was responsible for all stages of the data journalism workflow: data gathering, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Even though that makes it impossible for me to specialize in any specific field, the will to achieve the excellence seen in places like ""The New York Times"", ""FiveThirtyEight"", ""The Economist"" or ""La Nación"" made me work hard to learn everything needed o be able to contribute on all stages of a project. With European and Parliamentary elections in the same year, 2019 was the year of pushing my limits to achieve projects that I am proud of. To achieve the quality level I aspire to, I worked hard to learn several new technologies. I was able to learn Vue.js, use R and the tidyverse as a second language. Learned more about maps and D3.js and even wrote my first API using R package plumber. That kind of knowledge led me several breakthroughs: a national scoop about a doctor who worked 100 hours weekly for a year, a creative approach about sentiments and readability on political manifestos, the first poll of polls published by a media outlet in the country, an algorithmically generated text to find out if you could live in some cities in Portugal and a news application that allowed voters to know all the 4.603 candidates that were running for the seats in the national parliament. The work I was able to produce was only possible because of one thing: the community. The data-driven journalism community that keeps using Twitter, newsletters, blog posts, and other online resources to share their knowledge and always offer a helping hand when your code simply doesn't work. Only a community so eager to share resources allows someone in Portugal, with no official training in data or computer science, to do that kind of work. Aware that there is still so much to learn, and that the projects I present below could still be improved in lot of ways, 2019 is the year that I'm submitting my entry without feeling that I could have done much more. Even knowing that awards are not what define us, I hope that you take into consideration my portfolio as proof of my effort to push forward, the desire to grow my skill set and use data to explore topics in new and engaging ways, without ever putting aside what true journalism should","Project link 1: Can I really afford to live in this place? Using multiple data sources - some of them publicly available, other scraped or even collected by me, I've built a personalized news story that allowed the user to input his name, how much he gets monthly and other information to find out if he can afford to live in one of seven Portuguese cities. The idea was not to produce a simple ""fill in the gaps with data"" report but an actual personalized story that ended up having multiple ramifications according to the data inputted. The story went totally viral, being the most read piece at Renascença's website for some weeks. Project link 2: Trust me, but don't read me. What political manifestos for the European elections say Using Natural Language Processing techniques, I analyzed the 93.216 words present in the 17 political manifestos that Portuguese parties published before the European election. Found out that while right-wing major parties used words associated with trust, left-wing parties used words more associated with anger. The project included a web-based tool that allowed the reader to explore those contrasts in the texts. Another interesting finding was that, on an election with very low turnout percentages, the political manifestos seemed to be written to not be read: almost all manifestos failed a readability test. Project link 3: 7 things we learned about freelance doctors in the Public Health Service By collecting and categorizing all the contracts made by public hospitals in Portugal, I was able to provide an insight on the doctor's freelance market — a 104 million euros business that exists because of the lack of in-house doctors on the National Public Health Service. This investigation found an instance of an anesthetist who was working 100 hours weekly during one year, sleeping between surgeries and not resting enough. This sparked a debate about the quality of the Portuguese Public Health. This was also the first journalistic investigation in Portugal using data analysis with a 100% transparent methodology: besides writing an article explaining how the data was collected and analyzed, Renascença published the code and all the data in a reproducible and open-source regime. Project link 4: Who are the candidates to the national parliament? Using public data, interviews and some crowdsourcing directly from the political parties, we were able to gather a complete picture of the 4.603 candidates, thus enabling the electorate to get to know who they were voting for, using filters such as constituency, gender, work experience or if they have children. The tool also allowed readers to get to know details such as the University they attended or their social media profiles, among other particularities. Project link 5: Poll of the Polls Using Kalman's filter algorithm, I was responsible for the first Poll of Polls published in Portugal. I used multiple sources to collect data from all major polls in the country. With this algorithm, Renascença, my newsroom, was able to keep away from statistically insignificant changes on polls, but also provide a glimpse of how public opinion changed across the last three years. Project link 6: Find the opened gas stations near you during the strike A strike from an almost unknown union created a sudden rush to the gas stations. That forced the government to create a national network of gas stations where people were sure they would be able to get some fuel. The problem? The government published that list on a PDF file. Scraping and geolocating those gas station, I've created news app with geolocation enabled that allowed readers to find out where they",https://rr.sapo.pt/calculadora-custo-de-vida/,https://rr.sapo.pt/multimedia/152006/o-que-dizem-os-programas-dos-partidos-para-as-europeias-confia-em-mim-mas-nao-me-leias,https://rr.sapo.pt/2019/06/19/pais/sete-coisas-que-aprendemos-sobre-os-medicos-tarefeiros-no-sns/especial/154922/,https://rr.sapo.pt/candidatos2019/,https://rr.sapo.pt/sondagens/,https://rr.sapo.pt/2019/07/26/pais/descubra-os-postos-de-combustivel-com-servicos-minimos-mais-perto-de-si/extralarge/159295/,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brazil,"Fiquem Sabendo, Estadão, CNN Brasil, TV Globo",Small,Shortlist,Young journalist,Luiz Fernando Toledo," I am working as a data news producer and reporter for CNN Brasil. I write about public policies and education, for both local and national stories.  My stories have been published in the most important journalistic websites in Brazil, such as Estadão, G1, UOL and TV Globo. I have also helped to find data and documents to support journalists from The Washington Post and ProPublica. I am the youngest journalist to become director of the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (Abraji), most traditional and respected NGO for investigative journalists in Brazil. I'm pursuing a master's degree in Public Administration at Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV).  I was a visiting fellow of the International Center for Journalists (ICFJ) in Washington D.C. for two months in 2018. During that time I studied entrepreneurship in digital journalism with a scholarship granted by the American government and had the opportunity to work at ProPublica, an independent investigative journalism  outlet. I worked there with research for projects related to the Freedom of Information Act. Working there was my inspiration to create Don't LAI to Me newsletter - a sucessfull project that I started as a volunteer during my free time and was already used as a source in more than 400 articles published by national and local newspapers. We have more than 4,000 subscribers now, from all over the country.   As an activist for open government and data, I was the brazilian person who most sent FOIA requests for the federal government in Brazil, according to Controladoria-Geral da União (federal agency responsible for FOIA), with more than 2,400 requests. The data I found in those requests were used to publish my stories and many other people's stories, since I share the data I get using the newsletter and my social media accounts. I believe that journalism is more powerful when what we get is shared.   Things I've learned during the last 7 years sending FOIA requests are being shared in a lot of workshops in different brazilian states. I made workshops in more than 50 universities, conferences and journalism companies since 2018. Just in 2019 I created a project with Jeduca (Brazilian Education Writters Association) and visited over 800 students from 15 universities in different parts of Brazil (Sao Paulo, Rio Grande do Sul, Sergipe, Rio de Janeiro and others) to teach how to get and use data from the government.   In seven years as journalist I won 10 journalist prizes, such as Claudio Weber Abramo de Jornalismo de Dados (Open Knowledge Brasil), Estado (Estadão newspaper), ANPR (Federal Prosecutor's Association) and Allianz-Ayrton Senna (Public Education). I also won in 2019 the main scholarship in Brazil for journalists to study in the US, granted by the Brazilian NGO Instituto Ling (Visionary Journalist Program or Jornalista de Visão). "," I created the free newsletter Don't LAI to ME  (LAI means Lei de Acesso à Informação - FOIA in Portuguese) - <a href=""https://fiquemsabendo.substack.com/"">https://fiquemsabendo.substack.com/</a>, a service to spread data obtained using Freedom of Information Law in Brazil. This project was designed when I visited ProPublica as a visiting fellow in 2018 (during an International Center For Journalists' program), when I realized journalists shouldn't ask information for themselves, but to share data they are not using or that can be helpful for other purposes. Usually we publish our stories and forget to share what we discovered - sometime the data isn't even part of the story, but we still keep it for tradition. I realized that when hundreds of newspapers use the data you found to build their own local or nation stories can be more satisfying than publishing a scoop. The impact is much stronger and, at the same time, affects many other audiences that wouldn't read or watch what I produced by myself.    Don't LAI to Me is the result of my career until now, gathering data from municipal, state and federal government to create stories that make a real impact. Stories I have published from 2013 to 2018, when I was a reporter at Estadao, made the São Paulo's City Hall to save more than R$ 15 million, made the government fire corrupt officers and  put down many Facebook pages (with more than 4,000,000 followers together) that were responsible for spreading misinformation during the brazilian election.     ",https://sites.google.com/view/luizfernandotoledo,fiquemsabendo.substack.com,https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2019/11/06/ex-funcionarios-de-industria-nuclear-de-sp-pedem-indenizacao-na-justica-por-problemas-de-saude.ghtml,"https://www.estadao.com.br/infograficos/educacao,no-enem-1-a-cada-4-alunos-de-classe-media-triunfa-pobres-sao-1-a-cada-600,953041",https://jeduca.org.br/texto/jeduca-abre-serie-de-oficinas-em-faculdades-de-jornalismo,https://abraji.org.br/institucional/#quem-somos,https://www.icfj.org/about/profiles/luiz-fernando-toledo,,,,,,,,,,,
South Africa,"Mail & Guardian, Grocott's Mail",Small,Participant,Young journalist,Gemma Ritchie," My name is Gemma Ritchie. I am a 25-year-old journalist based in South Africa. My journalism career began at the Mail & Guardian in August 2017, where I worked as a digital journalist until February 2019 when I was awarded a fellowship to study investigative journalism. It was during this period of study that I was introduced to data journalism, and the pieces I have published since have been on a freelance basis. I am currently completing a six-month fellowship at amaBhungane, the centre for investigative journalism.   I was mentored by Laura Grant who taught me everything I know now. Before Grant's six month course, I had always felt Intimidated by data journalism but she removed any fear I had in dealing with numbers. We forget as journalists that although it is easier to base stories on numbers and data, we still need to present these numbers in such a  way that people can easily  comprehend the information. This has been a key lesson for me and one I enjoy sharing with fellow journalists.       I have attached two long form narrative pieces to my submission where I used data journalism to unpack issues regarding school safety and libraries in the rural province of the Eastern Cape. "," The two pieces I will submit have made use of tools such as infogram and datawrapper to visualize the information. But in order to obtain the data, I trawled through annual reports for the Department of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture going back five to six years. For my school security piece, I captured every media mention of a school break in from 2012 to 2019, employing several variations of a site search. I then amalgamated the data I had with the schools which had incidents to where the schools were based. I then checked this list against an official number of break-ins reported during the 2018 December holiday where I learnt that the media was underreporting on school break-ins which targeted the poorest schools.  ",http://witsdatajournalism.mediahack.co.za/breaking-into-schools-the-art-of-flouting-security/,http://witsdatajournalism.mediahack.co.za/connecting-to-the-future-broken-promises-in-eastern-cape-internet-access-projects/,https://mg.co.za/article/2019-08-26-the-art-of-flouting-security/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Brazil,Agência Pública,Small,Participant,Young journalist,How bot accounts on Twitter are pushing hashtags pro Bolsonaro,"  Dear Madam or Sir,     I am very happy to submit my application for The 2020 Sigma Data Journalism Awards. I am a brazilian journalist, who just graduated at University of São Paulo, class of 2015. Being considered for this award is a great honor and would mean a big step for my career.      Journalism has brought me a lot of opportunities and adventures. In my first year of college, I took part in a project where I would research, write and record short sum ups of international broadcast news for the university radio along with other colleagues.      Also during my graduation, I was a reporter at Jornal do Campus, a journal produced by journalism students that covered news around the university. This was where I started with data journalism. Along with other 2 colleagues, we did a fact-checking piece on affirmations from the university dean at the time.     Outside of college, my first paying-job was at an educommunication NGO, called Viração, where I worked at a news agency and a magazine ran by young people and children. The organization purpose was to empower young people through communication techniques, such as journalist, photography, and media literacy. They had a project with Google where we would do activities to teach children about cybersecurity. Through this project I had the opportunity to go to Google Campus in California and talk to other young leaders about social networks, privacy and fake news. This was when I started to get interested on this subject.      I’ve put together my interest in online behaviours and data journalism by working with fact-checking during brazilian elections in 2018, at the Truco project, from Agência Pública. After six months covering a campaign filled with fake news pushed by social networks algorithms, I decided to investigate more in depth the problem of desinformation online. Still in an internship at Agencia Publica, I was mentored by experienced journalists such as Natalia Viana, one of the few journalists who were with Wikileaks at the Cablegate leak in England in October-November 2010.     I learned how to use TCAT to scrap data from Twitter, have made a course and attended an event from the brazilian investigative journalism organization (Abraji), and used this experiences and tools to produce pieces on how debate is being manipulated online. I use data to investigate this issues and journalism to bring it to light.      In august 2019, during the fires that took place in the Amazon Forest, I investigated a couple of hashtags on Twitter that accused NGOs of starting the fires and supported the brazilian environment minister, Ricardo Salles. By analysing more than 100 thousand tweets, I found automated accounts that engaged in the hashtags and wrote a piece on it. After it was published, I received a lot of attacks and threats online. But that didn’t stop me. A few months later I found that one of those automated profiles was still pushing pro-government hashtags on Twitter and made another piece on it.     It has been a long journey to get here and I don’t mean to stop it so soon. Winning this award would be a confirmation that I am in the right path.     Thanks for the consideration  ","  For the last year working at Agencia Publica – first as an intern and then as a reporter –, a brazilian organization of investigative journalism, I have been looking into the desinformation environment online.      One of the most important pieces I wrote about it was the one I described above. In august 2019, during the fires that took place in the Amazon Forest, I investigated a couple of hashtags on Twitter that accused NGOs of starting the fires and supported the brazilian environment minister, Ricardo Salles – #AmazoniaSemONG and #SomosTodosRicardoSalles, meaning “Amazon without NGOs” and “We are all Ricardo Salles” in English. With the help from researchers from Atlantic Council, I got access to the first 50 thousand tweets from each hashtag. Both of them reached the Trending Topics in Brazil for two consecutive days.     From the data, I could track the first tweets with the tags and the users who used them the most. With that, I managed to analyse and plot into graphics how many times the hashtags were tweeted per hour.      I also found that only 1% of the users who used the tags were responsible for more than 20% of the tweets with the tags. The profiles who used the hashtags the most had several evidences of automation, such as high volume of tweets (more than 400 per day), frequent use of tags, text disconnected to the tags, links to other websites. Among them there were 5 profiles that were very similar. They retweeted each other, had the same profile pictures and names – evidences of what is called a botnet.     Besides the bots, I also found the tweets that were most retweeted with the tags. Adding all this elements up, the piece made a good mapping of how a network of bots was connected to influential pro-government accounts and how they were manipulating the public debate by rising hashtags to Trending Topics. To discuss the issue, I interviewed researchers that look into the desinformation environment on social networks, specially Twitter.      I also asked the platform about their policies against automated accounts that try to manipulate the TT metrics.     When published, the piece had more than 11 thousand shares in Publica’s website and more than 2 thousand reactions on Twitter and 1,9 shares and likes on Facebook. It was also republished by other 26 news websites, including El País.      After the publication, some of the accounts charged as robots were excluded. Others remained.     So I made another investigation on one of those that were still active. By using Twitter’s TCAT, I scrapped data from 1 month of activity of the bot account. The result was a dataset of almost 10 thousand tweets, which I analysed by frequency and content. I found the account has tweeted 368 per day during november of 2019 and I found a pattern in its tweets – most of them contained pro-government hashtags and links to a conservative Youtube channel. According to specialists, this is a strategy used by many accounts and it would be clarifying to expose that to public.     The piece also showed which tags were used the most and profiles that the account has mentioned. It was shared by more than 2,7 thousand people on Publica’s website and republished in other 20 news websites.     The pieces are both in portuguese and linked on this application.

Austria,Kleine Zeitung,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Michael Sommer," Although the name  Kleine Zeitung  implies a small newsroom ( ""Kleine"" means small in German ), the Austrian daily newspaper is the second-largest medium in the country, with around 150 journalists in the newsroom. Despite its size, the paper is very print-focused and digital innovation is a difficult topic. In these difficult circumstances,  Michael Sommer,  a 24-year-old visual journalist, has laid the foundation for the formation of a new team dedicated to the narration of digital visual essays and data journalistic stories.First as a theoretical concept in his bachelor thesis, then put into practice through active lobbying and pitching in front of various stakeholders up to the newspaper's editor-in-chief.   In just one year the 24-year old has risen from a Journalistic Intern to the Project Lead of the new established newsroom-accelerator  Kleine Zeitung INTERAKTIV . Due to monetary pressure, especially in digital reporting, Michael has developed a system through which he brings together journalists from various departments with technicians from the parent company Styria Media Group to temporarily create new interdisciplinary teams within the inflexible newsroom structure. Thanks to this kind of collaboration, which is new to the newspaper, some fabulous stories full of visual storytelling have been published in a very short time.   Virtually all stories in the Kleine Zeitung INTERAKTIV are team achievements. Even if this is normal in data journalism, it makes it difficult for an author to submit a large scale project of various kinds. Nevertheless, in the following, we as Kleine Zeitung would like to submit a story that Michael did on his own, from the procurement of the previously unobtainable data set up to the technical implementation. We think that this exceptionally successful story is a good representation of his journalistic qualities paired with a high level of technical skills.    In addition to that we would like to ask you to also consider the enormous achievement of creating a new team in a difficult environment at such a young age. That's why we also linked the landing page of Kleine Zeitung INTERAKTIV in the application, which would not have been possible without Michael and his innovative thinking.  Journalism definitely needs such all-rounders and strategical thinkers to be sustainable for many years to come. We hope that the jury will honour this.  "," The attached story is a mixture of data journalism and visual storytelling around the topic of the new appointment of a parliament in Austria. After the spectacular failure of the ""Ibiza Coalition"", the whole of Austria was looking forward to the National Council elections in 2019 and the attention to the composition of a new parliament was accordingly high. The entry of ministers into this parliament is a complex process in Austria, involving the ranking of various federal lists, before provincial lists and district lists. Before the official announcement of the new mandataries, the whole of austrian newsmedia was therefore puzzled by the question of who would represent the country in the National Council over the next four years.   In the tension of this important event, the author has done what he does best and what journalists all over the world have to do again and again: Operate in a very short timeframe to publish the right story at the exact right time.  And he succeeded.  While many daily newspapers in Austria were still puzzling over which persons exactly would take up ministerial positions, Michael Sommer drew up a provisional list of ministers and added personal characteristics to it through hard and honest journalistic research. The result was a list of 183 neo-politicians, enriched with numerous characteristics such as date of birth, place of birth, marital status, educational background and many more.    Within a few hours after announcing the final list to the media, Michael prepared the hand-collected data in a completely new story-design and added a few personal details to his almost flawless list. Using the scrollytelling technique, a word creation of ""storytelling"" and ""scrolling"", the reader can literally determine the pace of the story and the numerous animations themselves and thus navigate interactively through the characteristics of the 183 new ministers. Michael not only collected the data for this story, cleaned it up and found out exciting aspects in a very short time, he also took care of the complete technical implementation on an alternative platform, which he introduced in the newsroom. Journalists still use his scrollytelling template for other news stories to this day.   The story went online right at the start of the first session of the new National Council and was one of the most successful digital stories of the year for the Kleine Zeitung.     Celebrated by the readers with a lot of positive feedback, we would now like to propose this story for the Sigma Awards, thus highlighting the skills and creativity of the author Michael Sommer.

Pakistan,"Balochistan Review, The Diplomat Magazine, The Balochistan Point",Small,Participant,Young journalist,What is Hindering Greater Empowerment of Women in Pakistan," Dear Data Journalism Awards Team,   I am the first female data journalist and editor from Balochistan -Pakistan's most impoverished and voiceless province. I started my career as a reporter in 2014 with an online newspaper Balochistan Point, in a time when women hardly joined newsrooms in Balochistan which has still not changed much. I was later selected in a highly competitive data journalism certificate program which ran from 2016-17 in Pakistan through Internews. Under the supervision of my trainer/mentor Eva Constantaras, I graduated from a 200-hours data-journalism training as one of the most competitive participants. I later produced several important investigations including  issues of the indigenous population in Pakistan’s south-western region being affected by China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, women’s lower participation in politics in Balochistan, lack of female labor force participation in Pakistan, illegal fishing in Balochistan coast and water crisis in Gwadar.    In 2018, I founded an online newspaper Balochistan Review which also won an international grant last year through Internews. I have since then helped many young writers publish their stories highlighting some of the very underrepresented parts of the country. I have also conducted several data journalism trainings and workshops in Gwadar and have participated in DW's Training of Trainers' Workshop in Institute of Business Administration in Karachi Pakistan.    Unfortunately, Pakistan lacks the kind of robust forward-looking organizations that value regorous research methodologies used in data journalism, therefore I have devoted myself to this innovative journalism field to push the conversations past politics, have many of our issues highlighted with evidence and lead a real chance of policy change. "," I would like the jury to consider my story on ""What is Hindering Greater Empowerment of Women in Pakistan"" for the award.  <a href=""http://balochistanreview.com/2019/07/what-is-hindering-greater-empowerment-of-women-in-pakistan/"">http://balochistanreview.com/2019/07/what-is-hindering-greater-empowerment-of-women-in-pakistan/</a>  Pakistan has one of the lowest female labor force participation in South Asia and one of the highest gender inequality in the world. These were some of the highlighted facts while I was working on this project, while data supported to have facts on record but I believe a good data story equally incorporates human aspect. Therefore, i had to do a number of interviews to find out why we have disturbing figures when it comes to women's empowerment. Finding supportive data is one of the most challenging part of working on a data story in Pakistan but specially working in a place like Balochistan with limited access to internet is another big challenge. I was invited by Balochistan's women development organization and rural development council in Gwadar to discuss the story further with experts working on women's development in the province.  ",http://balochistanreview.com/2019/07/what-is-hindering-greater-empowerment-of-women-in-pakistan/,https://thediplomat.com/2019/12/near-disaster-gwadars-little-village-faces-a-crumbling-coastline/,https://thediplomat.com/2019/10/balochistans-students-take-to-the-streets/,https://thediplomat.com/2019/04/will-chinas-plans-for-gwadar-destroy-fishermens-livelihood/,http://thebalochistanpoint.com/illegal-fishing-in-balochistan-coast-causes-catches-to-fall-faster/,http://thebalochistanpoint.com/gwadars-growing-water-war/,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spain,"Fundació Periodisme Plural (mainly Catalunya Plural, but some also published at Diari Educació)",Small,Participant,Young journalist,Victòria Oliveres Torrescassana," I am a 26 years old journalist based in Barcelona, the city where I am originally from. I have been working as a data journalist for the last year and a half, but my time in this speciality started some years before this.   While I was studying for a bachelor's degree in Journalism at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona), I had interests beyond the curriculum. With some university colleagues, we organized  after-class  workshops and masterclasses to satisfy our curiosity. Luckily for me, one of those days we invited Eduard Martín-Borregón to talk about data journalism.   From this point on, I got fascinated with this field. I started following data journalism projects around the world and I took the ‘Doing Journalism with Data MOOC’ from the European Journalism Centre. At the same time, I developed some other skills related to graphic design for designing static infographics.   When I had saved money enough, I decided it was time to immerse myself fully in this discipline. I moved to Birmingham to study the Master’s degree in Data Journalism at Birmingham City University (United Kingdom), leaded by Paul Bradshaw.   This was a wise choice. In just one year, I was able to channel and increase my motivation for data journalism and boost my knowledge of tools and programming languages, but also of reporting techniques. Meanwhile, I got a work placement mentored by Caelainn Barr at The Guardian (London), I was involved in many industry events, and I participated and won prizes in some competitions (the Midlands Media Student Awards and the 360Giving Data Visualization Challenge).   Straight after completing my Master’s degree, I went back to Barcelona. Since then, I am working at the small newsroom of Fundació Periodisme Plural, a non-profit organization that has five online media sites. I also design infographics for the Anuari dels Silencis Mediàtics, a print yearbook of investigative reports edited by Media.cat, and shoot a documentary about LGBTI people in Morocco and their exile to Barcelona, for a cooperative media called la Directa.   In Catalan media there are not data teams yet. There are just a handful of  lonely  data journalists trying to do their best in different newsrooms. That is why, convincing the directors of Fundació Catalunya Plural to allow me to spend part of my time doing data journalism was challenging.   But I achieved it. Not all my work at Fundació Periodisme Plural can involve data journalism, but I try to make the most of it. Aside from the selection of data projects I present in the following portfolio, I have also done many data analysis and visualizations to support my colleagues stories. "," I am the only data journalist in the five reporters newsroom of Fundació Periodisme Plural. This means I am in charge of the whole process data journalism requires: from getting the data, analysing and visualizing it, to look for the context, interview experts and stakeholders, and write the story.   This situation is very challenging but also satisfying because I have been able to experiment with a variety of topics, approaches and methods. I usually work on issues around education, health, housing and social inequalities, and sometimes institutional politics (specially this year, as there have been many elections in Spain).   One of the steps that usually takes me more time is getting the data, particularly when this is not published in an accessible format. This was the case when working on a story about <a href=""https://periodismelapislatzuli.wordpress.com/2019/12/20/8-out-of-10-companies-fail-to-fulfil-environmental-requirements-in-catalonia/"">companies environmental breaches (link 1)</a> and another one about the <a href=""https://periodismelapislatzuli.wordpress.com/2019/05/09/only-30-political-parties-lists-for-the-local-election-are-headed-by-women/"">gender gap in political parties lists leaders (2)</a>. In both cases, I used R to download, scrape and structure data spread in multiple PDFs. This way, <a href=""http://catalunyaplural.cat/ca/la-meitat-dels-habitants-de-catalunya-viuen-en-municipis-governats-per-una-dona/"">I could also reuse it later</a>.   FOI requests are another way I use to get data. The investigation about <a href=""https://periodismelapislatzuli.wordpress.com/2019/01/13/two-out-of-three-public-schools-in-barcelona-have-more-than-twice-immigrants-than-its-nearest-charter-school/"">school segregation in Barcelona (3)</a> could be published after a transparency request that needed a long follow up. I got the number of immigrant students in each school in Catalonia – for the first time released to the press – at the same time as another Spanish media (elDiario.es). This is why we decided to work on the story together (I did the data analysis and visualizations, and they wrote the story).   It is not the only case I collaborated with people outside my newsroom. I was able to investigate <a href=""https://periodismelapislatzuli.wordpress.com/2019/03/11/airbnb-recovered-in-three-months-the-number-of-flats-in-offer-it-had-before-to-the-closing-down-of-2500-illegal-flats-in-barcelona/"">changes in the Airbnb offer in Barcelona (4) </a>and look for possible fraud because I attended a hackathon. There, I started working with the data scrapped by Inside Airbnb, together with a group of activists, and it turned into an innovative way of verifying data released by official sources.   When it comes to visualization, I go from simple and quick when we want the user to get the information on a first sight (created mainly with Flourish and Datawrapper) to more creative ones created using programming languages like D3.js and R. This was the case when I tried to analyse election results with an innovative approach: with two <a href=""https://periodismelapislatzuli.wordpress.com/2019/05/29/neither-by-district-nor-by-neighbourhood-two-cartograms-so-that-the-election-maps-do-not-lie-to-you/"">cartograms of the vote in Barcelona’s districts and neighbourhoods after the local elections (5)</a> and with <a href=""https://periodismelapislatzuli.wordpress.com/2019/11/11/electoral-repetition-further-divides-the-vote-in-catalonia/"">triangular graphs to show the vote change between the 3 Catalan pro-independence parties after the parliamentary elections (6)</a>.   Sometimes I also take advantage of external third party tools to <a href=""http://catalunyaplural.cat/ca/resistir-ocupar-o-cedir-les-alternatives-per-a-fer-front-a-la-crisi-de-lloguer-de-barcelona/"">create interactive visualizations</a>. For example, in a story about <a href=""https://periodismelapislatzuli.wordpress.com/2019/02/15/by-their-tweets-you-will-know-them-who-have-sanchez-and-rajoy-congratulated-during-their-term/"">whom the two last Spanish presidents congratulated (7)</a>, a visualization I could develop after scraping Twitter data. Finally, we also like to make our data stories attractive on social media, so I take care of designing GIFs for promotion.   We are a small media group, so our stories usually have a specialized and local audience and engage the communities they affect. For example, the story about school segregation was widely commented on social media specially by activists and academics, and quoted by other Catalan media; and the story about Airbnb’s supply made many neighbourhood associations demand on Twitter for more action from the City Hall.   When possible, either because it is not sensible data or we have finished working with it, I publish the code analysis on <a href=""https://github.com/PeriodismePlural"">the organization’s GitHub page</a>. This is welcomed by other journalists, who use the database I put together to fact-check their own stories. For example, this happened with the story about environmental breaches.

Argentina,A24.com,Small,Participant,Young journalist,Ignacio Ferreiro," My name is Ignacio Ferreiro and I work as a data journalist in A24.com, a recently born news site from Buenos Aires, Argentina. During 2019, I was 25 years old.   I am the result of an erratic academic path, wich I intend helps me improve my projects. I studied industrial engineering for 2 years but then decided to change to Anthropological Sciencies. All these experiencies allow me to balance between the social sciencies and the mathematical approach .  Besides these academic career, I am a heavy user of online courses for journalist, such as the ones given by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas and the European Journalism Centre. I owe these institutions a major part of my specific data journalism applied knowledge.   I am the only data journalist from my newsroom, meaninng that I work alone without the help of any developers. This pushes me to learn how to use new tools and techniques in every project or story I work in. Until now, I have learn some R and Python. Also, I love maps, so I have learned (in babysteps) to use QGIS. My next goal is to learn javascript, which will allow me to improve my D3.js and Scrollytelling skills.  In my two years working in A24.com, I have always used free tools, meaning that any journalist or newsroom is able to work on this kind of projects without any superlative financial costs. I found that amazing!    I consider myself an activist for open data iniciatives. That is the main reason why I work on data journalism: reusing public data is a vital role for journalism to work towards an open goverment. It is through data journalism that goverment transparency will become an even more relevant aspect in national politics and public speech. That is why I work most of the time with goverment's open data. In some cases, I had to use scraping techniches to build my own databases, but I try to avoid that. Is much better to use official information, provided by the goverment.   Also, in my point of view, data journalism is not only about politics and economics. It could also be about the day to day life of people, and the problems they have to solve on a daily basis. On this last subject is where I found the social essays from The Pudding specially inspiring. That is why I love working on projects that show on empiric evidence any kind of inequality dimensions. The post truth era we live in leaves no other path but data driven content for journalism to restore the lost trust from the audience and get people to agree on facts.  "," The project i liked the most working on was about public buses user complaints (link 1) in Buenos Aires City. There was not an open database for this project, so I had to make a request to access public data. That allowed me to show which was the bus company with more complaints. Also, I noticed that three of the most denunciated lines shared a part of their route. On that same route that the lines shared is where a new subway line should be constructed, but the city goverment refuses to start these public constructions arguing that there will be not eneough users for that subway line, based on unclear and private studies. This project ended up being about a greater issue than the original idea I started working on, and that was a amazing feeling. Also, this work resulted in an open and easely searchable database for the complaints on every public bus company.     Link 2 shows, street by street, where city goverment achivieded (o did not) to reduce crime.    Link 3, for exaple, is one kind of crime map, specially about car thievery. That map allowed me to show that citizens from the south region of Buenos Aires City were more exposed to violent car robbery than the citizens in the north. That is an inequality dimension never shown before with empiric evidence.    Link 4 is more a service kind of project: i took a database that had every gluten-free product approved by the national agency for food regulation and enabled an searcheable table. This got really used by the celiac community thanks to a SEO strategy and a also to getting in touch with the community.    Link 5 is the answer to the following question: do more public construction get inagurated close to the election day in the City of Buenos Aires? For two different eleccions, the answer was yes. For the first election, a lot of rather small public construction projects were inagurated. Two years later, on the next election (and a more important one), less public construction project were inagurated, but among these projects were the most important ones, the ones with bigger budget.     Link 6 shows the deterioration or improvement of education quality in every agentinian province. For this project, i worked with ""Aprender"" results, the national evaluation for education quality. Notice I avoided showing wich provinces were the worst, but which ones got worse/better with the years. As a matter of a fact, on both subjects of the national evaluation (maths and grammar), Chaco province showed the worst evolution. After publishing this project, I tried to correlate education funding with results, but the analysis was not possible due to non-standarized ways to fund education in the different districts. This is one of my pending projects.   All of these stories were readen by 15.000 unique users on average with long retaining time, which are great and really atypical numbers for the newsroom I work in, which started publishing on april 2018. Also, project link 1, for example, was citated by bigger newsrooms such as Lanacion.com, one of the biggest newsroom of Argentina (great honour!).

United Kingdom,The Times,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Ryan Watts," My name is Ryan Watts and I have been an Interactive Journalist at The Times and Sunday Times for two years. I worked previously as a local reporter for two titles in Buckinghamshire, England, for six months following a master’s degree in Interactive Journalism at City University, London, in 2017.   As a member of the Interactive Team at The Times, I split my time between working with our specialist reporters to help bring their stories to life visually and developing my own stories as a data journalist.   The focus of my work this year has been to reveal regulatory failures by the UK government which pose a threat to our environmental health. I’ve aimed to add context to open but unwieldy datasets by making them easy for our readers to understand and explore themselves. Along these lines, I have produced three front-page investigations in 2019: on air quality, food standards and the health of Britain's rivers.   As a Lead on The Times Clean Air Campaign, I used spatial data to produce London’s first air quality school league table and revealed that 2.6m school children attend schools where air pollution exceeds recommended limits.   For an in-depth piece on the state of Britain’s rivers, I collated and questioned the Environment Agency’s water quality archive: an open dataset of 20 million tests made from 2000 to 2019. I matched this with the government’s own limits for hazardous pollutants to  conclude that one in every ten tests carried out last year were breaches – the highest on record.   To assess food hygiene standards across the country, I matched the restaurant names and postcodes of half a million establishments on the Food Standards Agency database with restaurants featuring on Just Eat, Deliveroo and UberEats to create the most comprehensive analysis of hygiene standards on leading takeaway services.   For each of these investigations I built bespoke interactives and graphics to help explain our findings in the best possible way and to place the reader at the heart of every story.   On top of my own investigations, I regularly help reporters question and query data they’ve found and find news lines for them to report on. In the past two years, I’ve built well over 1,000 charts, maps and tables for The Times and Sunday Times using the chart-building tool Datawrapper.   In 2019, I’ve worked to establish myself as the digital team’s mapping expert and I hope to develop this interest as my career progresses. At the UK’s 2019 general election, I built a dasymetric dot density map to show how votes were distributed across urban areas within constituencies. My maps featured in the last Red Box newsletter of the year as an election sign-off. There are many stories hiding in spatial data and ways of presenting geographical information that I feel The Times can capitalise on in 2020 and I hope to help us pioneer this kind of data journalism.   I work predominantly in R (tidyverse for data wrangling, rvest for scraping, sf for mapping) and QGIS. I also use Google Sheets, Datawrapper and Adobe Illustrator day-to-day. "," I’ve submitted my author page at The Times. It features the majority of my bylined stories. The projects I feel are of note are:    Air pollution on streets is poisoning 2.6m schoolchildren    This story involved matching 20m by 20m air pollution point data in London to school boundaries. I did this by carrying out  a point-in-polygon analysis on buffered school shapefiles, followed by averaging the pollution measurement of each point. We then built a dashboard for readers to enter schools of interest and compare their school to others in their borough.    How do we make the air in our cities breathable?    We wanted to be constructive and look at how we might fix the air pollution problem. This project used a bespoke storytelling template, similar to the stories featured on Instagram, and aimed to redesign a London street to promote healthier air. I worked with an air pollution specialist from Imperial University, London, to explore a healthier future for the capital. This project features 3D pollution maps I built using MapBox and designed in Adobe Illustrator.    Pollution: no river in England is safe for swimming    In an analysis of 20m water quality tests made by the Environment Agency from 2010 to 2019, I discovered that one in ten tests revealed a serious breach – with at least one breach recorded at half of all testing sites. To determine whether a test was a breach or not, I compared the recorded result against a CSV file of “hazardous pollutants” published in the government’s guidance to businesses with Environment Agency permits. The investigation also revealed the decline in testing performed by the EA, from 5m to 1m tests a year.    Just Eat, Deliveroo and UberEats host thousands of unhygienic restaurants    The main challenge with this piece was scraping Just Eat and Deliveroo in their entirety. I wrote a script that used Selenium to responsibly crawl their sites and grab the details of each restaurant in just under a week. The results were shocking: 4,000 failing establishments were hosted by Deliveroo; one in eight takeaways on Just Eat were in need of improvement and 30 out of a sample of 500 on Uber Eats scored lower than acceptable.    Tactical voting guide: Who should I vote for in the general election?    Working with The Sunday Times, I built a tool to help readers vote tactically at the 2019 general election. I used constituency-level polling provided by YouGov to present the parties with the best chance of winning a selected seat. I added the context of the majority held by the incumbent to show how big of a lead a party would need to overturn.    How many crimes were committed in your neighbourhood?    Our tool used Police.uk data and grouped street-by-street recorded crime by LSOA (output areas of about 1,000 people) to calculate the number of crimes by crime type in that area in 2018-19. We designed a barcode chart to display the distribution of local authority areas from those with the least crime per 10,000 to areas with the most.

United States,The Wall Street Journal,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Elbert Wang," Elbert Wang is in his first year with the award-winning Wall Street Journal graphics team. In that time, Elbert has distinguished himself as a passionate visual reporter who engages audiences on a variety of socially important issues.    Mr. Wang came to the Journal from the Texas Tribune, where he was a fellow on the data-visuals team. Before that, he was an intern on the interactives team at the San Francisco Chronicle. He is a graduate of Brown University, where he studied Computer Science and Classics.   Mr. Wang is interested in distilling data into graphics and visualizations and in digging into the numbers to understand the people behind them. These three projects are examples of the breadth of Elbert’s talents:   ""What Happens if SAT Scores Consider Adversity?"" Charts median SAT against Adversity scores, letting readers look up individual schools.   ""The Nest Egg Game"" is an interactive that guides readers through the impact of various financial choices   ""Tracking Shootings in America""  is a deep dive into the statistical details of shootings in America "," Increasingly, readers crave stories that are smart, visual, and interactive. Stories that allow them to see the entire story in a chart, play with the data themselves, ans immerse themselves in a story rather than just read it. Mr. Wang’s work pushes these boundaries of how we tell stories on the web, in different mediums, and on different devices, helping place readers in his stories and engaging them on important topics that affect their lives.   For “What Happens if SAT Scores Consider Adversity,” Mr. Wang produced a data-visualization project that shows how students’ socioeconomic status affects SAT scores. The project also includes a lookup tool that allows readers to see how their own high school performed and its corresponding adversity score, shedding light on how College Board measures and compares high schools’ performance and adversity.   In “Tracking Shootings in America,” Mr. Wang presented a database of mass shootings in several different ways: as a traditional map of locations, as an extremely tall timeline, and, at the top of the article page, as a wall of the shootings described in plain language by the FBI, showing that in America, mass shootings happen anywhere, at any time. The visuals allow readers to meditate on the sobering reality of shootings in America.   “The Nest Egg Game” allows readers to map their personal financial journey through ten milestones. Mr. Wang’s project allows readers to simulate how their financial decisions affect their long-term savings and retirement. A fictional “egg” persona makes a serious topic less intimidating and more whimsical. Ultimately, the project aims to give readers a better sense of how they compare with average Americans and thus to better prepare for retirement.  The Nest Egg Game project is part of the Journal’s <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/news/collection/rulesofmoney-537c9828?mod=article_inline"">“The New Rules of Money”</a>   package about the financial challenges facing young adults.   Tools used:   Mr. Wang primarily relied on Google Spreadsheets and Python for data analysis, as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript (particularly d3.js) to produce interactive data visualizations online. React.js was used for the “Nest Egg Game.” ",https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-happens-if-sat-scores-consider-adversity-11574773201,https://www.wsj.com/graphics/fbi-active-shooter/,https://www.wsj.com/graphics/nest-egg-game/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spain,Civio.es,Small,Participant,Young journalist,María Álvarez del Vayo," I became a data journalist mainly because I believe data provides journalism accuracy and a sort of scientific base I felt it was somehow missing. That is why I became a data journalist in the first place. How did it happen? I graduated with a degree in Journalism and Communication Sciences in 2015. After six months studying in Australia, I decided I wanted to develop my investigative skills by joining the master’s program in investigative reporting, data journalism and visualisation at Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid. That is how I began my career as data and investigative journalist. As I wanted to learn from the best professionals in the field I joined Civio, a non-profit  data-driven journalism organization. With the support of my editor Eva Belmonte and my colleagues I <a href=""https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2017/10/30/el-debate-sobre-los-incentivos-europeos-a-los-medicamentos-huerfanos/"">co-authored my first investigation</a> on the proliferation of the so-called 'orphan drugs' in Europe. Many other projects followed after that, on different topics such as the pharma industry. Related to this, I co-run an in-depth<a href=""https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2017/11/30/los-hospitales-publicos-recibieron-18-millones-de-las-farmaceuticas-en-2016-en-donaciones-patrocinios-y-pago-por-servicios/""> investigation on obscure sponsorships to schools and hospitals by pharmaceutical companies</a>. In the meanwhile, I became very much interested in gender equality and did this <a href=""https://civio.es/el-boe-nuestro-de-cada-dia/2017/11/21/igualdad-de-genero-en-las-listas-del-21d/"">piece on gender inequality in politics</a>. This was when I realized it was necessary to look at data, not only with a fresh mindset, but also from a gender perspective.   In 2018 I co-published what I consider to be my  best articles. During this year I have mainly focused on a major investigation called <a href=""https://medicamentalia.org/contraceptives/"">Medicamentalia</a>, on access to healthcare,  which involved the whole team. Among other groundwork, we <a href=""https://medicamentalia.org/contraceptives/data-use-barriers/"">conducted transnational research on the use of birth control</a> methods. The investigation made during this year that  I feel particularly proud of is the one about<a href=""https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2018/11/07/14-european-countries-levy-the-same-vat-on-sanitary-towels-and-tampons-as-on-tobacco-beer-and-wine/""> VAT on sanitary towels and tampons in the EU</a>. With the collaboration of my editor-in-chief Eva Belmonte and the whole Civio team, we analyzed data from all EU countries on VAT rates finding that almost half of the 28 EU member states continue to apply the standard VAT rate to sanitary towels and tampons, in a bracket applied to items such as jewellery, wine, beer and cigarettes. This could seem a minor issue, but considering that over half of the EU population are women, who half of their lives pay for such products, makes you think of how forgotten women-issues and women themselves tend to be by policy-makers.    This same year, I began researching wildfires, in the framework of a larger series called <a href=""https://civio.es/en/spain-in-flames/"">Spain in Flames</a>. I particularly focused on<a href=""https://civio.es/espana-en-llamas/2018/09/20/el-interior-de-cantabria-que-arde-cada-invierno/""> winter wildfires in the Spanish region Cantabria</a>. By checking trends in wildfires it caught my attention the fact that wildfires in Cantabria tend to begin in winter, something anormal in Spain. By having a closer look into the data and after a field trip to the region I found out that those wildfires were intentional, to regenerate pasture, and in some cases went out of hands. No one before had looked at the real cause of those fires.   At the moment I am focusing more on environmental topics related to wildfires, combining it with topics related to gender issues and access to healthcare. I am continuously supporting the team in their investigations, learning about new fields like public procurement. "," I would highlight from 2019 my investigation on hate crimes: ‘<a href=""https://civio.es/2019/07/04/el-odio-que-no-se-cuenta/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> The untold hatred </a>’, published in Spanish the 4th of July 2019. The investigation is, to be precise, about the lack of reliable statistics on hate crimes. Everything began when I started looking into the rising numbers of fake news related to migration and criminality rates. Migrants are usually victims of crimes, but tend to avoid reporting them to the police, I thought. And I wondered: what about hate crimes? Are there differences in EU countries? When I checked statistics in Spain, I felt they did not match the real world. Later, after consulting several experts I learnt that indeed, they did not adjust to reality. Statistics in other EU countries were not better. On the one hand, methodologies used are standardized, so results are not comparable.   This article was read 1,770 times and had 15K impressions on Twitter. A total of 70 people interacted with it. It reached 1,368 people and it prompted 41 reactions.   My article <a href=""https://civio.es/espana-en-llamas/2019/07/31/municipios-que-no-se-preparan-contra-el-fuego/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> ‘Municipalities that do not prepare against wildfires’ </a> was a follow-up on a previous investigation about winter wildfires in Cantabria. The publication of this one prompted a reaction by the public prosecutor’s office that assured they would take measures to prevent wildfires. They did, and one year later, the prosecutor’s office contacted all municipalities  with no prevention plans against wildfires in areas considered of high risk. Then I decided, with the support of my team, to cross-check the names of municipalities pointed out by the prosecutor’s office with the number of wildfires in each of them, and whether they count on a prevention plan, to find out whether there was a correlation. The result was that many municipalities in areas identified as with the highest risk for wildfires lack prevention plans.    While doing this research it was particularly complicated to navigate the legal and jurisdiction differences between different regions in Spain. That was probably the hardest part.    The article was read a total of 3,163 times on our site and got 33K impressions and 260 interactions on Twitter. 15,415 people were reached on Facebook with this story and received 258 reactions, comments and shares.       In the area of transparency, I wrote the article <a href=""https://civio.es/tu-derecho-a-saber/2019/01/30/orange-telefonica-y-vodafone-lideres-en-multas-de-proteccion-de-datos/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> ‘Orange, Telefonica and Vodafone, leaders in Data Privacy fines’ </a>. I obtained the information for this investigation after filing a FOIA request at the Spanish Data Protection Agency. Once we received the data, we found out that it was the main large telecommunication companies the ones that were not complying with the law. We created a visualization for the article where you clearly see that the three biggest companies are the ones infringing the law more often. Also banks and Facebook were punished for practices against the law. The main setback I would highlight is that I had no access to the final costs of the fines, after appeals.   This article was read 1, 875 times on our site, received 24K impressions and 500 interactions on Twitter and 49 reactions and comments.     ",https://civio.es/2019/07/04/el-odio-que-no-se-cuenta/,https://civio.es/espana-en-llamas/2019/07/31/municipios-que-no-se-preparan-contra-el-fuego/,https://civio.es/tu-derecho-a-saber/2019/01/30/orange-telefonica-y-vodafone-lideres-en-multas-de-proteccion-de-datos/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spain,eldiario.es,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Raúl Sánchez," My name is Raúl Sánchez, I’m a data journalist and coordinator of the data unit of eldiario.es, a young digital media outlet in Spain that has been rewarded for its model of memberships. I’m specialized in covering stories about inequality, gender and corruption based on databases to tell news and explain phenomena.   Although I have a  Master in Investigative and Data Journalism, I have done data journalism since I was 20 years old, when I created the Map of Power in the Canary Islands, an interactive database that showed the links of political and economic elites in the Canary Islands (where I was born). Since that time, networks of power and inequality have become the topics I have researched the most.   Since 2015 I have been publishing on eldiario.es stories based on data analysis, always starting with a spreadsheet, an R script or hundreds of PDFs to organize. I have tried to use all the technologies at my disposal to improve my work processes but always adapting to what I need: some R script lines, a chart with Datawrapper, a map with Mapbox GL, an interactive D3, some calculations with Excel or an infographic with Illustrator.   I also was the coordinator of the La Tierra Esclava (Unslaved Land), a transnational journalistic project on the dark side of plantation crops in the world that was nominated for the European Press Prize, received an honorable mention from the Inter-American Press Society and was a finalist for the Awards Rele. I was also a member of the investigation of Los Papeles de la Castellana (Castellana Papers), where we reveal how large Spanish fortunes evaded taxes.   In recent years I have managed to integrate data journalism methodology and process in the different sections of the newspaper. Now data journalism is a transversal area in the newspaper work. I almost always work with official sources but sometimes I create my own databases scrapping from websites or creating them from PDF’s or paper documents. I usually include coding with R, D3 and other Javascript libraries in our contents to create more powerful content and deeper analysis.     "," 2019 in Spain has been marked by political reality: we have experienced two general elections, one local, one regional and one European during the year. My work, which includes more than 100 publications throughout the year, has been marked by this electoral phase. The linked projects, however, do not speak only about  votes or political parties. They talk about inequality, environment, corruption, tax evasion or city growth.     A third of the income of the richest comes from the income of capital: we analyze the origin of the income of the residents in each of the 34,000 census sections of Spain, where we reveal that one third of the income of the richest 1% does not It comes from work income. For this analysis we did an analysis with an R script to identify the percentage of income in each percentile, we map the data with Mabpox GL   The Office of Conflict of Interest that never sees conflict of interest. I compiled in a database the more than 500 resolutions (in PDF) of the Office that is in charge of supervising the high positions of the Government and we discovered that it had only vetoed 2% of the revolving doors in a decade   How the suburbs of the big cities concentrate the demographic summer in Spain. We compiled in a database all births and deaths in each of the 8,000 municipalities that exist in Spain from 1996 to 2018. A task that involved a crossing of 15 databases with Excel and R to see that the medium-sized municipalities around the big cities were the only ones with more births than deaths.   Graphic guide on how large Spanish companies and multinationals avoid taxes thanks to tax havens and tax engineering. An interactive explanation made with Scrollama, Illustrator and Javascript.   The demography of the general elections: how each social group votes in Spain. For the November general elections we publish a live demographic analysis of the election results with other variables such as average age, income, place of birth or level of studies. An interactive tool based on Flourish code and enhanced with Javascript and other libraries.   How rich neighborhoods were enriched twice as much as the poorest during the economic recovery. We analyze the average income of the neighborhoods of the 31 largest Spanish cities between 2013 and 2017 and see how the richest areas grew more than those with less income. Analysis with Excel and R and visualizations with Javascript, Datawrapper and R.   0.3% of fires burned 40% of the surface in Spain since 1968. When a large fire was the cover of national newspapers, we published this story about how the virulence of fires in Spain had increased and its importance. An analysis of a database with more than 2,000 fires of more than 500 hectares with R.     These stories, which do not include many contents of the elections we publish during the year, have been among the most read of the year in eldiario.es and have occupied a space on the main cover of eldiario.es, with more than 8 million of monthly readers.    ",https://www.eldiario.es/economia/tercio-ingresos-proviene-rentas-trabajo_0_955054873.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/Oficina-puertas-giratorias-conflicto-intereses_0_876662862.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/Demografia_0_972903422.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/DATOS-Guia-entender-multinacionales-impuestos_0_968353645.html,https://www.eldiario.es/politica/demografia-grupo-social-elecciones-generales_0_962054202.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/desigualdad-aumenta-enriquecieron-recuperacion-economica_0_858814307.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/superficie-Espana-incendios-Gran-Canaria_0_936156625.html,,,,,,,,,,,
El Salvador,"El Diario de Hoy, elsalvador.com",Big,Participant,Young journalist,Karla Patricia Arévalo Mancía,"  My career stared at May 2016 as digital journalist in elsalvador.com. In August 2016 I joined to Data Unit of El Diario de Hoy and elsalvador.com     There I learned to analyze and visualize data by a massive course on line of The Knight Center for Journalism with Sandra Crucianelli but also with Omar Luna, fellow of Escuela de Datos. My coworkers, my editor, Lilian Martinez, and I join with Luna and the freelancer journalist Rodrigo Baires to learn to analyze and visualize data through tool as Tableau Public and Excel.     In March 2017, I published The11 thousand Salvadorans that nobody looks for (<a href=""http://especiales.elsalvador.com/2017/desaparecidos/"">http://especiales.elsalvador.com/2017/desaparecidos/</a>), about the phenomenon of the disappeared in El Salvador. To do this work I asked the Police about missing persons between 2006 and 2016: ages, gender, municipality of origin.     That year, I was Fellowship of the Data and Investigative Journalism Bootcamp of Internews in El Salvador. In this bootcamp I investigated and published, in November 2017, the data driven reporter:  The mistakes of Plan El Salvador Seguro (<a href=""http://www.especiales.eldiariodehoy.com/2017/12/plan-el-salvador-seguro/"">http://www.especiales.eldiariodehoy.com/2017/12/plan-el-salvador-seguro/</a>).      I asked for public information about homicides between 2009 and 2016. When calculating homicide rates by municipality and age, the data revealed that the municipalities included in the plan were not the ones with the highest homicide rates per 10 thousand inhabitants or per 100 thousand inhabitants between 2009 and 2016, the year in which the plan was implemented.     Another aspect revealed by the data was that the population under 18 was the most affected by homicides in municipalities not included in the plan.     In January 2018, I participated in the Security and Journalism Workshop of investigation with John Dinges, at the invitation of Border Center for Journalists and Bloggers in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Mexico. In this workshop also there were a practice of data analysis with Daniela Guazo, coordinator of Data Unit of El Universal from Mexico.     That same year I participated in the TECH Camp, ""Informa, Conecta y Activa"" in     Antigua Guatemala, where I had the opportunity of learn about data storytelling with designers of Datasketch.     After that, I published The fleeting passage of drugs in El Salvador      <a href=""http://especiales.eldiariodehoy.com/2018/drogas/index.php#link"">http://especiales.eldiariodehoy.com/2018/drogas/index.php#link</a>.  That work was an attempt to identify the routes of entry of cocaine, heroin and marijuana to El Salvador through the places where the seizures occurred.  ","  The report “Nine out of ten prosecuted police officers are released” was a work started in April 2019. Firt that all, I asked for data about police complaints filed with the Prosecutor's Office from 2016 to 2018.     The data revealed that the majority of complaints against police are for crimes against life: homicides, threats, illegal searches, and injuries.     Another insight has been that the number of judicialized nunciations has been increasing. However, nine out of ten police officers taken to trial were acquitted.         The publication had 5164 page views between May 9 and 16 and an average reading time of 4:56 minutes.         This was because in addition to the text and graphics, a search engine was made where each user could search how many complaints against police officers there were in the municipality where he lives.         In addition, a map was presented with the rates of complaints by municipality.

United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Cale Tilford," I am a 24 year old newsroom developer and data journalist working in the Visual and Data Journalism team at the Financial Times. Collaborating with other data journalists, designers and reporters, my work stretches from data analysis to the design and development of interactive data visualisations, static graphics, and games.    Between April and May, I led the FT’s efforts projecting the result of the European Parliament elections, a first for our team. Combining polls from across the European Union’s 28 member states, I built a tool to project how many seats each European grouping would win in the May election. This was a huge task that involved creating profiles for all major political parties in the EU. To calculate our projection, I had to first analyse and clean hundreds of polls, research the way each country apportioned its seats, and then implement the best method to estimate the output of their allocation system from imperfect data.    I started practising data journalism as a computer science student in 2017, with my masters project exploring the visual perception of cartograms and choropleths. I brought my interest in visual perception with me to the FT and this year was able to produce an interactive story that also acted as a visual perception experiment. This was one of the two games which I led development on last year.   The FT has explored the use of games as a way to tell stories and explain concepts in a different way. What excited me most about the games that I worked on was how they visualised and contextualised reader responses to situations or tasks. A game about running companies more ethically showed that most readers’ main concern was the future success of their company. Our Chart Doctor game showed that readers responded in the way research expected them to, performing worse on tasks that involved chart types our team try to avoid.   In our work on Brexit, I’ve been a proponent of iterative development and design on our team, showing how it can be used to produce data visualisations and interactives that evolve as the story and our ideas change. An interactive I built visualising parliamentary votes on Brexit in the UK parliament turned into a recurring story we regularly published. With each vote we were able to iterate on the previous design with the end result offering readers a more complex visualisation of the breakdown of each vote and a more exploratory tool for those who wanted to dive deeper.   After reflecting on my experiences working on a wide range of stories over the last year, I’ve started to make an effort to improve the delivery and design process of projects I’m involved in. The internal tools and templates I’ve helped develop have made it easier for us to produce good journalism quickly and effectively. With the wider use of these, the need for training across our team has increased. I’ve taken an active role in training others on our team to use these tools, making it easier for them to produce the great visual and data journalism our team is capable of. ","  European parliament election projection and results page    The FT was the only major UK publication to calculate a projection for the European parliament. We combined this with reporting from over a dozen FT correspondents to give readers context to the situation in each country. Updating daily, unlike the monthly official European parliament projection, we visualised our projection in an easy to understand and interactive form. Readers could further explore our projection at a country level and see how the makeup of the European parliament would be affected after Brexit. To predict the seats in each country, I modelled their electoral systems to reflect how they apportion seats to parties. Our polling average was fed into our model which ran three times a day, updating our prediction for nearly 300 parties as new polls became available. Our final projection predicted the nearly exact distribution of seats in most countries and the exact distribution in three. Leading up to the election, the story became one of the most read on FT.com, performing 17 times better than the average world desk story. I also led development on the live results page published on the night of the election.    The Trade-off    I turned a spreadsheet based game about environmental, social and corporate governance into an interactive playable in the browser. Based on real-life scenarios, the reader assumes the role of CEO of a fictional company over four years. Each year the player has to make decisions about where to spend their company’s resources. Readers could see how many players made the same decision and were able to compare their final resource distribution to others. Despite the game’s focus on environmental and social issues, the data we collected showed that players were more likely to prioritise meeting growth targets and the long-term development of the company.    How MPs voted on May's withdrawal deal defeat    MPs voted on a number of important Brexit issues in early 2019. One of the many on-the-night visualisations of these votes, this iteration of our parliamentary vote story combined an interactive visualisation of how each MP voted and a searchable database of dynamically generated MP profiles, describing how each had voted in previous Brexit votes. To better link the text and visuals, we added inline buttons to directly link readers between the story and preset searches in the database. For example, readers could click a button which showed all MPs who had switched their vote since the last meaningful vote.    Repo: How the financial markets' plumbing got blocked    I worked with the Markets desk to produce this scrollytelling charticle explaining the events that led up to the September 2019 repo rate spike. As the reader progresses through the story, a fixed chart shows how each decision or event increased pressure on the overnight repo rate market. A challenging topic to understand, the story was overwhelmingly praised by our readers. One reader wrote: “Fantastic and informative journalism-well done! You made an important but arcane subject very penetrable.” The story performed well for the markets section with more than four times the average number of page views.    The science behind good charts    An interactive experiment and game that tried to demonstrate basic visual perception concepts to our readers as part of the FT’s Chart Doctor series. Our biggest challenge was choosing tasks that would show significantly different results but were also easy enough that readers would enjoy the game. After readers completed each task, we visualised their results so they could compare themselves to others. Thousands took part in the experiment and their results validated the theories we were explaining.

India,India Today,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Mukesh Rawat," It was in May 2016 when within 24 hours, two journalists were shot dead in the Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand by people linked to those against whom they had been reporting. As a college student, when I discussed these murders with my friends and spoke about the increasing attacks on journalists, many said I was exaggerating the situation.   They demanded evidence. I had none.   This forced me to research about similar attacks over the past two decades. The result was a data mine. I realised that data on such attacks was available but hidden in unvisited government websites and Parliament records. It remained unreported.   Armed with this data, I put forward a compelling case in a data-driven article titled ‘Who cries when a journalist dies?’ for Outlook magazine.   Throughout my under-graduation, I had been contributing to leading Indian publications as a freelancer. So writing wasn’t new for me. But what was new was finding meaningful patterns in an unorganised dataset and writing an article based on it.   The job was done well and I could provide my friends empirical evidence of attacks on Indian journalists.   This was when my love for data started. In it I saw a powerful tool using which I could tell a story and explain a situation, not just by subjective anecdotes and quotes, but by using hard numbers as irrefutable facts.   For past three years I have been a journalist and have been actively working on data-driven reports since 2019. I do not hold any formal training in data analysis. Hence, much of what I do is self-taught or learned from publicly available sources like data journalism websites and observing what leading organisations in the field are doing.   My data driven articles for India Today have brought to light uncomfortable truths about a wide range of subjects.   Many of these articles have been cited/referenced by publications like The New York Times, The Guardian, The Washington Post, The Conversation, Quartz, Pacific Standard etc.   As a journalist, I believe my duty doesn’t end with just reporting an issue. I want to contribute in finding solutions too. And that’s one another reason why I fell in love with data journalism.   When presented with creativity and context, data-driven reporting can turn numbers into meaningful stories that otherwise remain hidden in Excel sheets and PDFs. It can turn unstructured data into solution-oriented stories and make pro-active decision-making possible.   This is of great importance for the Indian state of Uttarakhand where I come from and is located in the ecologically fragile central Himalayan region.   Growing up in the Himalayas, I have seen nature from close quarters. It is one of the regions on Earth where the impact of climate is profound and visible. In my own village water in the two perennial rivers has halved over the past two decades, fish are scarce during summers and spotting migratory birds have become rarer. This part of the Himalayas also faces the problem of large-scale human outmigration due to factors that are both climatic and economical.   In the long run, I aspire to use data journalism to tell the everyday stories of everyday people from my region and beyond so that people from other parts also know what climate change and outmigration are capable of.   The beauty with data analysis is that besides ensuring reliable and effective communication, it also contributes in finding patterns and loopholes that can be harnessed to find solutions on ground. And that is what makes me all the more excited to learn and experiment more with data and stories. "," My first data story is about the condition of undertrial prisoners in India who often languish in jails for years (at times decades) not because they are convicted by a court, but because they are so poor and illiterate that their socio-economic condition doesn’t allow them access justice.   Analysing data from India’s National Crime Records Bureau, my story revealed that 68% of Indian prisoners are in jail even though no court has held them guilty; that 70% of these undertrials are barely literate; most of them are from the weakest economic sections of society; and a majority are young people.   This lack of resources means many of them would spend years of their productive age in jail. Many don’t see their first court hearing in decades.   My second story is a data-driven fact check of the claims made by the Narendra Modi government in the Indian parliament. While moving a controversial amendment to the citizenship law, the government told Parliament that one of the important reasons for the amendment was the widescale persecution of religious minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh. It said share of non-Muslims in Pakistan’s population has fallen from 23% at the time of Independence to just 3% at present. It made a similar claim about Bangladesh.   To verify these figures, I dug out data from old census records in Pakistan and Bangladesh to establish that the government lied to the Parliament. Unlike in India and elsewhere, Census records in Pakistan aren’t easily available. I had to dig through tens of public sources to collect data from government records for this story.   My third data story is a review of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Campaign) launched by the Indian government that has been showcasing it as one of its great achievements.   My report revealed that despite the government’s tall claims of having built millions of toilets across India and making the country open defecation-free, 38% of government health centres in rural India don’t have toilets for their staff. I found that in some states this figure is more than 80%. Besides, there are many states where more than 40% govt health centres in rural areas don’t even have regular water supply. In states like Bihar and Jharkhand, over 605 of these health centres are operation without any electricity supply.   These centres form the backbone of rural health in Indian and cater to emergencies including pregnancies.   I also did a story on terror attacks world over in the past 50 years using the Global Terrorism Database. My report revealed that despite the so-called global war on terror, the world is a more unsafe place in the post-9/11 era than in the past. My story found that 60% of terror incidents between 1970 and 2017 took place after 9/11, indicating that terror attacks haven’t decreased in the post-9/11 period. On an average, there were 19 terror incidents world over daily between September 12, 2001 and December 31, 2017. In comparison to this, the average number of terror incidents per day was six in the 31 years before 9/11 (1970-2001).

United States,The Center for Public Integrity,Small,Shortlist,Young journalist,Pratheek Rebala," I’m a 23 year old data-journalist working at the Center for Public Integrity, a non-profit investigative newsroom based in Washington, D.C. I have been practicing data-journalism since I was 18 years old. I joined the data-team at TIME Magazine during the summer of my freshman year and worked there until I graduated college   I have always worked on small teams, which has taught me how to do more with less. This has also given me the opportunity to learn how to work with every level of the technical stack and all aspects of the reporting process.   At the Center, my job primarily involves working with reporters to identify how data can be used to enrich their investigative projects, and helping report and communicate their findings. Another important aspect of my job involves building tools that can make it easier for state and local reporters to find and report stories affecting their communities. My most recent project the “Copy, Paste, Legislate” tool helps local local reporters identify when special interests and lobbying groups are pushing model legislation in their state legislatures. I hope to build simiartools in the future that will further the Center’s mission to hold people in positions of power accountable to the public.   Like most others in this field, I have largely learned through experimentation and I am incredibly grateful for folks like my mentor (and first editor) Christopher Wilson who took a chance on an 18 year old with no real portfolio. His guidance and mentorship has been extremely critical for my personal and professional development. I hope that I can pay this forward and help other aspiring data-journalists break into this field. Much like the broader industry, people of color are not often represented in the data journalism community. I hope that I can provide guidance and support to other aspiring data-journalists of color. At the Center, I am hoping to make a small impact towards this goal by advocating for a more equitable workplace as a member of our union bargaining committee and the Center’s diversity committee. "," My most recent project was part of the Center’s collaboration with USA Today to study the phenomenon of “model legislation” - the practice where legislators introduce bills that are usually written by outside organizations or special interest groups. This project was recently selected as a finalist for this year’s Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting.   The Center had done reporting in the past on groups that sponsored model legislation. However, most of that reporting was based on tips from human sources. Kytja Weir, CPI’s former state politics editor, wanted to see if there was a way to identify model legislation that was sponsored by groups not advertising their work (like ALEC), and automate the process so we could organically identify model legislation as it’s being debated.   The tool I built for this project was used to identify tens of thousands of bills that had un-original language. Our reporters used the ledes from this tool to investigate numerous laws--like those loosening regulations on the sale of defective cars; ""religious freedom"" laws that promote religious discrimination; laws banning (and allowing) the sale of puppies and bills promoting work-requirements for those receiving SNAP benefits among many others.   This project was a pair-wise similarity problem. For 1.1 million bills, this involved roughly 648 billion comparisons (comparing every pair of bills). We also had to perform these comparisons for every future bill that would be introduced across all 50 states. The scale of this project presented a huge hurdle.   After much trial and error, I developed a system that decomposed every legislation into  “shingles” consisting of 4-7 words each. Then, I generated a MinHash on these shingles and queried those hashes and shingles using elasticsearch. This generated a “similarity score” for each bill. Next, I used a graph clustering algorithm to generate “clusters” of similar bills. This process allowed for discovery of bills that were models but were still heavily modified, greatly limited the work required for each search. Finally, the clustering process allowed for reporters to search for results in an intuitive manner.   This entire process, from start to finish for all 1.1 million bills, can be run in under 8 hours, which allows us to update this database once a week. The final product, is now available for anyone to look for model legislation in their state or around a specific topic.   Another project that I worked on was the Center’s investigation into the oil and gas boom in the Permian basin. I created a succinct way to highlight the magnitude of change this boom was bringing West Texas.   I developed a tool that queries daily satellite imagery around each of the thousands of oil and gas related facilities permitted in the West Texas region. I then used a pixel-diffing algorithm to identify a set of “before” and “after” images for the construction of each permitted-facility. Using this database of images, I created an intro video that showcases the unprecedented magnitude and pace of oil and gas development in West Texas.   For the same story, I also developed other graphics showcasing the lack of environmental monitoring in this region, and how some of the facilities could be contributing to an increase in earthquakes. Finally, another pair of graphics showed how, nearly all of the resources extracted in this region are being shipped abroad, despite being sold to local communities as a means to make the U.S. less dependent on foreign oil.

Brazil,G1,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Gabriela Caesar," Gabriela Caesar, 27, is a data journalist at “G1”, graduated in Journalism in 2015. She has already worked for the largest newspapers in Brazil “O Estado de São Paulo” and “Folha de S.Paulo” and for the news website “Poder360”.    She codes with R programming to scrape, extract, clean, organize, analyze data and write journalists reports. Nowadays she is also the leader of the project “The votings of the Brazilian Congress” and a member of the fact-checking group “Fact or Fake”.   Gabriela Caesar has been coding with the programming language R for two years, while learning R on her own and on Datacamp as well, since her graduation is on Journalism at the Pontifical University in Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), in 2015.    Her technological skills were important to help and simplify the daily work at the newsroom “G1”. She was the first person of data team to learn R programming language. In 2019 she was also the teacher of intern courses to spread this knowledge with programming language as well as Microsoft Excel. At that time, she created a website with all the content of the course, which is still available on the internet (in portuguese): <a href=""https://www.curso-de-programacao-em-r-para-jornalistas.com/"">https://www.curso-de-programacao-em-r-para-jornalistas.com/</a>   In October 2019 she was a speaker at the Brazilian Conference on Data Journalism and Digital Methods (Coda-BR 2019), in São Paulo. There she had the grateful opportunity to teach R to more than 70 event attendees.   Her main articles are about politics, especially about Congress and party democracy. In addition, she also writes frequently about public transparency and publishes surveys based on the Access to Information Act.    Currently, Gabriela lives in São Paulo, but she has already lived in Brasília, when she covered the impeachment of former presidente Dilma Rousseff and the the revocation of the mandate of former President of the Chamber of Deputies Eduardo Cunha, both in 2016.   Gabriela was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August 27th, 1992. Besides Brazil, she has also lived in Germany for an international semester as well as for a language course with a scholarship of the German government.    While she was still an intern, she has worked for the long form magazine “Piauí”, for the TV channel “Band”, for the “Rio de Janeiro Legislative Assembly” and for the news website “PUC-Rio Digital Portal”. Before she started the studies at the university, at age 16, she also had experiences at the magazine “Veja Rio” and at the newspapers “O Globo” and “Jornal do Brasil”. "," The main subject reported by Gabriela Caesar is politics. She is very concerned with overseeing and showing the work by elected politicians. Are they really going to Congress? How often? Who else was absent? What were the punishments? Has there been a reduction in salary?   The report showed that 44% of the deputies spoke to at least 25% of the nominal votes in the first semester of 2019. And the absences of the deputies still resulted in the discount of 1.2 million BRL of the parliamentarians salary.   That's why she made reports that use public data about the House of Representatives to analyze and publish surveys. In some cases, it was necessary to request the data by the Access to Information Act. Still on the House, she also showed to which parties belong the deputies who least follow the guidelines and vote differently from the party.   One of his reports published in 2019 also approached the growth of the Constitution. She interviewed political scientists, read books and articles, and showed how much the constitutional text has changed since 1988. The Social Security Reform, for example, was the 109th amendment to the Brazilian Constitution.   The party structure was also one of the highlights of Gabriela's reports. She analyzed data from the Superior Electoral Court and showed that parties are mostly undemocratic in Brazil. The survey revealed that 26 of the 35 Brazilian parties have more than half of their structure provisionally - allowing power to be in the hands of few powerful people.   It is also routine to use the Access to Information Act to lobby for public transparency. And the classification of documents by the federal government also became a report. More than 70,000 documents were classified in just one year ",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-CfkWZVvT5pKv7w32wGrhua6bhb0dUIbZKf68qXzoc/edit,https://docs.google.com/document/d/17KegN-b7dceMDavd4GdO3rFIuBszKqCvp_pcVM001sg/edit,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MTxFVzmexE-54iQ3P-WUEhWmnKCL88IFMcK51J7_VQ0/edit,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_0T1ryIC4iVmnXX4xs8uYhmi2mYFfuv707aiur1nT24/edit,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B_xIp9jGiboBhI8lJC5wjb5NXg8KiOu5Znv_gzL4RK4/edit,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDWF9IdIvewvG0tAsnz6XUW-NnvMrxmjMcCtF75ltug/edit,https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sCVIT68s5GpJ-JJ-fQ64Ta10xT55WCS_,,,,,,,,,,,
Nigeria,PREMIUM TIMES,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Yusuf Akinpelu," Akinpelu Yusuf   Akinpeluyusuph@gmail.com   Enugu Court, Gaduwa Estate   Abuja, Nigeria   (+234) 9032788612       January 10, 2020       Marianne Bouchart,   Competition Manager,   marianne@sigmaawards.org       Hello,   RE: 2020 Sigma Awards   From childhood, before I knew I was Yusuf Akinpelu, becoming a renowned journalist was all I ever dreamed. So, passion for the profession has never been missing in my toolbox. This has helped me develop strong storytelling ability and solid news judgment.       I began as a campus journalist in the University of Ibadan, where I majored  in Statistics but made more waves in journalism than I did in class. I graduated as the Best Campus Journalists — one of the fifteen awards I won as a student journalist.       But before graduation, without any formal training, I was among the first few names that popularized fact-checking among Nigerians. I was chosen as an external contributor for Dubawa, Nigeria's  foremost online fact-checking platform. And upon graduation, I was immediately hired.       The prospects I showed enticed me to Nigeria's only Pulitzer Winning Newspaper, Premium Times, under which Dubawa is. I was immediately transferred to the parent company, where I now cover Nigeria's National Assembly, arguably one of the most important beats covered by the company.       So barely three months into the job, not only have I written nearly over a hundred stories, each of my reports have been layered with depth, in terms of angling, delivery, presentation and even multimedia. For my creativity and critical thinking, my editors have entrusted me with stories which even staffers of the company hardly could have pursued.       In my current internship with Premium Times, as interns, we are not under any duress to deliver certain numbers of stories per week. But because my eyes for story ideas is so eagle-like I see beyond this limitation. Today I have averaged one story per day, weekend and holidays inclusive.       My drive has been to tell human angle stories which are hardly told. This is why, this year, upon the advice of my mentor, Musikilu Mojeed, PREMIUM TIMES' Editor-in-Chief, I devoted so much energy in analysing Nigeria's budget. I focused mainly on how the nation's intended spending would affect the common man.       In the course of my analysis, I was able to show that the nation's budget was stuffed with barrage of fraudulent, frivolous and untraceable projects. By juxtaposing these projects with the reality of the people, I also unveiled where the funds for such money would have better been spent. This got the public aware and even some federal lawmakers themselves faulting the budgeting process they oversaw.       This notwithstanding, as a young journalist, I have  also devoted my craft to the untold stories on education. For instance, one of my latest piece borders on the reward system for best graduating students in Nigeria relative to institutions around the world. My findings show that the academic excellence in Nigeria is less rewarded. The piece brought a new perspective to the discourse of education in the country: that apart from the less attention paid to funding education, the system's best brains are left frustrated even after defiling all odds.   Also, I co-run with a friend a satire blog (punocracy.com), Nigeria's first strictly satire blog. Last year we organized the first ever Satire Writing Contest in Nigeria, if not in Africa, where we declared November 9 as World Satire Day.   Sincerely yours   Yusuf Akinpelu "," My story explored the potentials Nigeri's 2020 budget has for the citizens. Before passage, I pored the budget to spot possible overpriced items in the document. I discovered, in just 22 budget lines, over 1.2 billion naira was inflated into the budget items.   I followed this, upon passage, with the kinds of capital projects billed for this fiscal year. I dug deep in ascertaining what these projects translate to the Nigerian people.    Many of the projects, as I showed throughout my analytical pieces, are misplaced priorities. I was able to deconstruct the barrier of understanding numbers which the nation's federal lawmakers hid behind to sidestep Nigerians with little understanding of figures.   In my projects, I revealed the fraudulent, frivolous and untraceable projects which federal lawmakers stuffed into the budget and how this means bad for Nigerians.   For instance, one which is perhaps the height of it all is the plan to spend N37 billion in renovating the nation's legislative building while the renovation of all federal roads in the country would get N36 billion. This is a country with very indecent stretch of road networks.   I examined the over 1000-page document, to extrapolate meanings out of it. Apart from this, I was also concerned about knowing what kinds of projects the Nigerian government intend building that they seek a whopping $30 billion foreign loan. My resolve paid as I would later show that offsetting infrastructural deficit which the government said it intends to use the loan for was not so.   Bringing this dimension of analysis to the table opened the eyes of many readers to the twist in the whole matter. It, in fact, further got the condemnation of some lawmakers whom ordinarily were part of the process that produced the document (See my interview to one of them https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/370876-interview-₦37-billion-for-nass-renovation-wasteful-needless-nigerian-lawmaker.html).   Making meaning of figures is daunting but my background in statistics gave an edge. My goal was to help readers know what they need to know without ambiguity or budgetary jargon. This I did quite well in every of the projects submitted here.   Achieving this, I knew, is not just about writing in a crispy way. I knew I had to do more. So this is why I used as many illustrations as possible using analogies my readers can relate with more. Also, with the use of tables, charts and infographics, I delivered the message with tact and poise. Hard work, meticulousness and patience made this so.   I'm hoping the jury would consider this for the award.   The popularity of the stories in terms of shares and likes on social media also is a key parameter I hope the jury would consider. This means many people saw, read and most likely understand the budget better than they ordinarily would not have had they not read it. The impact this makes is that because readers know more, they are able to ask the right questions as well.

Rwanda,Voice of America,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Young Albino Woman in Rwanda Gains Fame With Music Video Appearance by Eugene UWIMANA," My names are Eugene UWIMANA, I am 25 years old. I will be turning 26 in June 2020.  I was born in a remote village in Western Rwanda. In a poor family. As an orphan of the genocide perpetrated against the Tutsi, to afford to study was a hustle that my guiding parents managed to overcome. From the first day of my educational background languages were my preferred programs. In my country, the School of Journalism and Communication is for the best students of languages from High schools. Good marks were the bridge to my dream ""studying and being a journalist"" in 2014, I got the chance to enter in the school of Journalism at the University of Rwanda.    At University we used to be discouraged by students in upper classes. They used to tell us that we have badly chosen because journalism career doesn't pay in Rwanda. They were right, many media practitioners in my country don't get paid, others get payments on the 90th day or never. For many contracts are just papers. the media owners say the industry is not profitable. However, this has never been an impediment, for me- the boy who wanted to be the voice of voiceless. For the boy who has always lived in poverty-who cannot worry about being poor.    When I was in level two at the University, I wrote ten letters to Managing Directors of different media houses. My favorable Radio station was Radio10. It is the first private radio in Rwanda. That is where I had to start from. I met the managing Director, my request was to be a volunteer in my province- eight hours drive from Kigali, Rwanda's capital city where the station was located. She, the Manager noticed my courage and confidence and gave me the chance. She ordered her subordinate to print a card for me. Wow!!! I am a journalist (who is working for free)   I rushed to the field, yes to do what I like the most. I reported for three months, this time we were on holiday at the University. My hope was to be allowed to keep reporting in my free time when back at school. The surprise was that when I arrived at the station three months later they hired me. in 2015. From this year I held many positions: Reporter, Senior Reporter, Presidential Reporter, Radio Presenter, Tv Presenter, and Chief News Editor. I was blessed a lot to wear those hats when I was still a student. After graduation, I quit the station started to work independently as a Freelance journalist. As a freelance, I had the privilege to work with many big media houses including the Voice of America/English service, Xinhua News Agency, Rwanda Tv and many more. Throughout these past five years, I file many stories that have had very good impacts.    I think I should be considered for this award because I am young and passionate in a country where young journalists are encouraged. The award could be an encouragement for many Journalism students in my country.  Without them, the fourth power cannot be stable.    I look forward to hearing from you,   Yours Sincerely    Eugene UWIMANA     "," The story that I entering this competition has drawn considerable attention and impact here in Rwanda. This is the Intro of the story:     A Rwandan albino woman has appeared in a music video, attracting widespread attention and helping alleviate the stigma of albinos in Africa.  Claudine Mukarusine has described the video as a spark of light in a life filled with discrimination and fear.    I reported this story from the Eastern Province of Rwanda. This is the script:    ( TEXT ))  Claudine Mukarusine is a 28-year-old graduate from the University of Rwanda with Albinism, a genetic condition that makes her hair, skin and eyes pale.       In parts of Africa, Albino body parts are considered to have black magic that brings luck and wealth.  Their graves are dug up and bodies stolen, while the living face constant fear of abduction and murder.        But here in Rwanda, Mukarusine has become famous.        ((SFX:  SOUNDS OF MUSIC VIDEO))       She shows a reporter a music video by Rhythm and Blues singer James Ruhumuriza, known as King James, which she acted in.  The music video, for the song called “Igitekerezo,” meaning “Ideas,” shows King James serenading Mukarusine in the city and countryside.        In Rwanda it has gone viral.       ((MUKARUSINE ACT IN KINYARWANDA))   She says this video played a very big role in her life because many people have come to realize that people with Albinism can do something that is good and appreciated.   (( END ACT ))       The United Nations says nearly 100 albinos were killed in Tanzania alone in the past two decades, including at least 10 children whose bodies were found in January.        For Mukarusine, the song released in January is a spark of light in her dark days of fear that she too could be killed for being albino.       (( MUKARUSINE ACT IN KINYRWANDA))   She says on the first day she heard about this threat, she cried a whole day in class.  She used to cry also in her bedroom, it strongly affected her, says Mukarusine.  She used to worry so much, wondering if she is going to die.  But she couldn’t share her sorrow with anyone, says Mukarusine, and it affected her studies.   (( END ACT ))       R&B singer King James says he composed the song after watching accounts of albinos being killed in Rwanda's neighboring countries.         (( KING JAMES ACT IN ENGLISH))       “That’s when I decided, that I can feature her so that I can give a good message to people that even if they are albinos, they can do anything we can do, anything they want to do.”       (( END ACT ))       Mukarusine works as a mentor at the National Union of Disability Organizations of Rwanda.  She helps three groups of 300 people learn about saving money and accessing finance.       (( MUKARUSINE ACT TWO IN KINYRWANDA))   She has hope and confidence that her future will be good, and she will have a family, says Mukarusine.  She will contribute to developing the lives of people with albinism and other disabilities in general, she says, as well as her family and country.   (( END ACT ))       There are no accurate statistics on the number of albinos in Rwanda.  But Mukarusine hopes her music video fame raises attention to their plight and helps remove some of the stigma and fear for other albinos as it did for her.        ((Eugene Uwimana, for VOA News, Kayonza, Rwanda.))         ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRad2b1XA_8&t=45s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeKxXOHmW_0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyBTq9cPcKs&t=35s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KZEpBinqaQ&t=44s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkGs-qJhjiE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1jYYoHvDOo,,,,,,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,The Daily Telegraph,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Marianna Hunt,"  For a broadsheet national newspaper that was founded 165 years ago, innovation is key.      My analysis of large data sets and introduction of graphics, maps and online calculator has played an important role in attracting new readers to The Daily Telegraph and re-engaging current ones throughout this year.       I found new ways to approach important topics for our readers, such as finding schools for their children and buying property.      These are incredibly personal topics that can be hard to address with individual relevance within the scope of a single article. However, by using wide data sets that have national import and breaking stories down by region or price bracket, I believe I have created helpful articles with real insights.      This new approach has meant that, despite being just 24 years of age, I have become of The Telegraph’s top reporters for bringing in paid subscribers. This shows that clearly people are willing to pay for data journalism.      I appreciate that data works best when given a human touch and make sure to combine my digital stories with personal interviews and expert opinions to make them easy for people to engage with.   ","  Getting their children into top schools is a key concern for our readers. As such, I launched a very successful series using data to find the best places to live in Britain to be near the most ‘outstanding’ schools. To fit the criteria, each place had to have low crime rates, low unemployment, affordable homes, high household incomes and more than a certain number of top schools. This involved deep analysis of multiple data sets, creating maps to help readers identify key areas, and qualitative analysis through speaking to local estate agents in each area.      The series brought in around 40 new paying subscribers.      I also worked with a mapping agency using Ordnance Survey data to identify the British cities with the most green space. This I overlaid with property prices and interviews with estate agents to give readers a true sense of what it would be like to live in these places, bringing the data to life.      Some of the most successful stories I have published are those where readers are able to personalise the data to themselves. In one article I analysed data on Britain’s national broadband coverage, identifying local trends and areas with particularly poor internet. Within the article I embedded a broadband checker so that readers could see how their own internet speeds compared to those across the country.

Brazil,"Colaboradados, UOL",Big,Participant,Young journalist,Judite Cypreste," I am a 26 year old data journalist based in Brazil and currently working in Colaboradados, the collaborative vehicle on data transparency and open data in Brazil and in UOL, a big brazilian newspaper. have been through the newsroom of Folha de S.Paulo, a big brazilian newspaper, and the fact-checking agency Aos Fatos, the first Brazilian platform for verifying public discourse. I am a member of the Pyladies group and an enthusiast of free and open source teaching projects.   In Folha de S.Paulo I was a data journalism trainee, producing reports using Python programming language, the first with which I had contact. Inside the essay, I published some individual and other reports in partnership with other journalists. In each one of them, I participated in different production areas, having been responsible sometimes, for all their development until the publication. As one of the largest Brazilian newspapers, the repercussion of the reports in society was enormous, and was even responsible for the changes in transparency policies of the Brazilian National Justice Council.   In Aos Fatos, I acted as a reporter and a fact-checker, having produced several reports where the data was the main subject. Most of my job was to check if the political speeches said by candidates in the 2018 elections were verificial, which was only possible using real and serious data. In Aos Fatos I also published great reports, investigating data and requesting information for Brazilian government agencies.   After I left the vehicle of fact checking, I felt the need to dig deeper into the world of public data. I have always been active in the production of open source materials, with the objective of being, in addition to being open, collaborative and transparent. Thus came the Colaboradados, a nonprofit project, of which I am founder and director. It is a cross-platform project that promotes greater knowledge in society about the benefits of government transparency, and how it is useful for monitoring political entities.   In the UOL my work is very important since I am the only data journalist in a newsroom of approximately 300 journalists. I work helping my colleagues to understand the data and make intelligent and consistent reports with data. Like this: [https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2019/09/19/fake-news-pro-bolsonaro-whatsapp-eleicoes-robos-disparo-em-massa.htm] where we found out a large network of bots on WhatsApp in favor of the current president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro and this [https://www.uol.com.br/universa/noticias/redacao/2019/09/13/prisoes-e-muito-dinheiro -do-sus-as-revealed-histories-of-abortion-in-the-country.htm] where we talked with women who had been prosecuted for committing abortion on their own, an analysis of data of the requests of arrest.   I currently participate actively in the Python community, and try to help both programmers and journalists understand how beneficial the use of programming in journalistic practice. Because of my active role in the community, I am constantly called to speak on the topic at conferences and events, and was recently accepted to speak on the subject at the largest Python International Conference, PyCon, which will take place in May this year in Cleveland, in the United States of America.   I have chosen each of these projects to illustrate my work. Each of them was a result not only of my efforts, but also of the partners who accompanied me and accompany me on my journey. My current goal is to continue working with data, and bringing more knowledge to the community not only of journalists, but also of developers, joining the two professions for a greater good: to bring information to society.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Shortlist,Young journalist,Niko Kommenda," I’m a 26 year old journalist and developer from Austria, working on the Guardian’s interactive team.   I studied software engineering in Vienna and specialised in the field of information security before discovering a curiosity for finding stories in data.   It was in the wake of the Snowden revelations that I first realised how technology, journalism and civic society all influence and shape each other. Incidentally, these stories were published from the very same offices that I work in now.   While studying Computational Journalism in Cardiff, Wales, I was selected to join the Guardian as Google Newslab fellow in the summer of 2016. The months I spent in the newsroom proved highly tumultuous in terms of news cycles, with the UK voting to leave the European Union and Rio de Janeiro becoming the first South American city to host the Olympic Games.   Working with journalists, developers and designers, I discovered the power of visual storytelling to give added context to a data story and to cause a strong emotional response in readers. I also learned that with this power comes great responsibility, and that data-driven reporting can be just as biased or misleading as any other journalism if done the wrong way.    After finishing my degree I returned to the Guardian in 2017 as the youngest member of the Visuals team.   Data analysis and visualisation frequently feed into each other in my projects. Sometimes it is only through visualising a dataset that I discover an interesting avenue for further research; sometimes graphics help me to efficiently communicate my findings to readers.    Apart from producing innovative visualisations, my unique talent on the team is sourcing data sets from very unusual places and finding strong news lines in them.   For a project on the environmental impact of flying, I scraped emissions figures for 10,000 flight routes from an online calculator.   For an interactive about regional inequality in the UK, I rerouted my phone’s network requests through a computer to intercept and download price lists for 900 pubs belonging to a chain that offers ordering through a mobile app. From these I was able to construct the first county-level dataset of beer prices in the country.   And while being involved in all steps of a complex data story – from research and initial data analysis to writing and producing visuals – can be extremely taxing, I enjoy being able to create bespoke pieces of journalism that integrate data, text and interactive elements from the start. "," For 2019, my main journalistic goal was to focus on the growing climate crisis and the emissions side of it specifically, which I feel lends itself to data-driven reporting and the use of interactive formats.   In May, I launched an interactive page live-tracking the use of coal for power generation in the UK. I produced and wrote the article in the space of three days, just before the power grid broke the record for going ‘coal-free,’ and set up the page to update itself every 15 minutes.   This loop has been running (almost) uninterrupted ever since and eight months later the page is still viewed more than 500 times a week. We are currently discussing how to resurface the interactive with new copy and added context.   In July, my interactive feature on the climate impact of flying highlighted, for the first time, that even a single flight can generate more carbon emissions per passenger than the average person in dozens of countries produces in an entire year.   The piece was viewed more than 350,000 times, and following suggestions from senior editors the interactive carbon calculator was re-published as a permanent standalone page in the Guardian’s travel section.   A news story based on a FOI request to the UK’s Department for Transport revealed that the 10% most frequent flyers in England take more than half of all international flights. The findings were immediately picked up by a number of environmental groups and cited in the Channel 4 leaders’ debate on climate change in the runup to the UK general election by Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.   Towards the end of the year, I wrote up and visualised the findings of an International Energy Agency report which found that growing demand for SUVs had a surprisingly large effect on global emissions increases.   Away from the climate beat, I also contributed to some of the Guardian’s most ambitious series on other social issues.   In April, I teamed up with data projects editor Caelainn Barr to analyse the gender pay gap figures submitted every year by British employers. I’ve had a leading role in covering these filings since they were first made mandatory in 2018.   Our teams joined forces to set up an automated system to track all submissions, which allowed us to point out numerous flaws in the practical implementation of the law, such as companies submitting figures months after the legal deadline, or entering mathematically impossible figures.   Finally, for a series highlighting the difference between life in London versus the rest of England, I built a comprehensive interactive that allowed readers to see how their local area scores on eight different metrics ranging from average earnings to the price of a pint of beer.   The interactive accumulated more than 300,000 page views – which is unusual for an England-only piece – and more importantly it scored a median attention time of 1m34s, far above the average for our interactives. All data analysis and development was undertaken by myself, with editing by visual projects editor Lydia Smears.

Nigeria,BusinessDay Media Limited,Big,Participant,Young journalist,Ibrahim Adeyemi," Dear Jury,   I am writing to express my interest in the 2020 Sigma Awards: Young Journalist category. I am a self-motivated and progress-driven Graduate Trainee Investigative Reporter with an extensive background in the media industry. With an excellent record of initiative and innovation, I have developed and executed data-driven investiagtive reports for my medium, BusinessDay.   Throughout the course of my journalism career, I have honed my writing and data-driven storytelling abilities. I am an astute energetic reporter with burning passion for data and investigative journalism. I am capable of prioritizing and managing complex projects with proficiency.   As a former reporter for reputable media organizations in Nigeria, I have produced a reasonable number of data-driven news stories, features and investigative reports.   I strongly believe that teling good, data-driven stories could hold government accountable and the piece I am submitting for this award is a typical example of such story.   I'm looking forward to your response and thank you for your consideration.   Sincerely,    Ibrahim Adeyemi.  "," UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION: Sokoto's Ghost Teachers, Corrupt School Principals Stealing FG's N-Power Funds   This entry is a data-driven investigative reports that exposes how ‘ghost teachers’ scattered all over Sokoto -- a north-western state in Nigeria --are operating in cahoots with principals and headmasters of disadvantaged schools to steal the Federal Government's empowerment funds in the state.   N-Power was conceived by the government as a youth empowerment scheme aimed at fostering productivity through skill development and valuable knowledge sharing and acquisition for economic growth and social development. In 2016, the N-Power was introduced as part of the National Social Investment Programme (NSIP).   Although NSIP has five components – N-Power Teach, N-Tax, N-Health, N-Agro and N-Build – the N-Power Teach seems to be most popular because a large number of Nigerian youths have shown interests in it. The scheme was designed to support regular elementary school teachers in educating young minds. Thus, the Federal Government pays the programme’s volunteers a monthly stipend of N30,000 and gives them tablet computers. However, shoddiness, ghost working and other forms of official malfeasance continue to blight the N-Power Teach scheme in schools across the country. Public schools in Sokoto State are no exemption.   Ghost working and payroll corruption are a trend in Nigeria’s public service system and the perpetrators do not think of repentance – unless they are caught with their hands in the cookie jar.   However, after publication, the Federal Government sacked all ghost teachers exposed in the story and launced further official investigation on other racketeers in the system.

Nigeria,International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR),Small,Participant,Young journalist,Kunle Adebajo,"January 25, 2020 Marianne Bouchart Manager The Sigma Awards Team Dear Ms Bouchart, I'm excited about this unique opportunity to present myself for the Young Journalist category of the 2020 Sigma Data Journalism Awards. I've often found the interrelation between data and journalism delightful and it all started in 2017. Between July and August, I attended two workshops of data journalism and fact-checking, in Ibadan and Abuja, organised by the Premium Times Centre for Investigative Reporting. This experience ignited my interest and empowered me with the basic skills needed to delve into the space myself. It was the first time I learned about the analytical features of Microsoft Excel, the beauty of visualising with Infogram, and the possibility of finding information more accurately through the Google search engine. The following March, I joined the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), a nonprofit media organisation, as an investigative reporter and that was when I could really apply the skills I had picked up and ultimately grow. I have since benefited from various other learning opportunities such as the Workshop on Strengthening the Capacity of the Media to Investigate and Report Procurement Processes held by the ICIR in July 2018, Advanced Training on Investigative and Data Journalism by the ICIR in January 2019, and a two-week Fact-checking Fellowship by Africa Check in August 2019. I now have a deeper grasp of the potentials of spreadsheets in mining and analysing data. I make use of various other online visualisation tools, such as Venngage, Visme, Piktochart, and Canva, having become familiar with their strengths and weaknesses. Even though the ICIR has a data desk, I often do not need to consult them before I can do a good job with my cleaning and illustrations. As you will notice in some of my entries, if I am not working on essentially data-driven stories, I endeavour to incorporate data elements into regular or investigative reports that I write. I have read fantastic works from ProPublica, Bloomberg, and The Guardian. Last year, I also came across stories written by NewYork Times' David Barstow, Sussane Craig, and Russ Buettner about the Trump family's history of tax evasion. And I understand that I still have a long way to go as a data journalist. This is especially because, here in Nigeria, the field is still growing and newsrooms are hardly investing in the kind of skill acquisition and software development necessary to produce great data reports. Also, as I noted last October (in this report: https://www.icirnigeria.org/analysis-nigerias-massive-data-poverty-and-why-we-should-be-concerned/), Nigeria suffers from massive data poverty, which limits how much can be achieved by any ambitious journalist in many areas. Drawing inspiration from the 2018 report, Hurricane Maria's Dead, done by Quartz, AP, and the Centre for Investigative Journalism, I will be telling the story of Shiite casualties of genocide and extrajudicial killing in Nigeria in 2020. From 2015, hundreds of them have been unlawfully killed in various circumstances, and I am confident data journalism that puts a face to the number of deceased will go a long way in renewing and enriching the conversation. Going forward, my intention is to strengthen my capacity in using Power BI, Adobe Illustrator, as well as other tools. I also look forward to getting the Pulitzer Africa Data Journalism Scholarship grant for a masters programme in Data Journalism at Columbia University. Not only will winning this award mean a lot to me, it will also encourage other journalists in Africa to embrace this growing genre of journalism despite the institutional challenges and resource inadequacy we often have to contend with. Sincerely, ‘Kunle Adebajo Investigative Reporter ICIR,","  As someone who is both enthusiastic about fact-checking and data journalism, I have able to bring both together successfully in individual reports. In  Has Electricity Generation Worsened or Improved Since 2015? We Verified , I fact-checked a couple of claims from Nigeria’s two major political parties bordering on how well the country has fared over the years when it comes electricity generation.      It was based on a large set of data mined from daily operational reports made available by the Nigeria Electricity System Operator (NESO), a subsidiary of the Transmission Company of Nigeria. NESO itself did not make the data available in an easily accessible and analysable format, and I had to mine the reports for 60 days by downloading one file at a time, mostly for the first day of each month from April 2014 to January 2019.      From there, I could observe a trend. I made use of Infogram to show the electricity generation trend in an interactive infographic, and Venngage to summarise the key discoveries in a comparative form. I also tabulated my mined data and shared using Scribd. The report was shared on Facebook alone nearly 300 times and was widely read.     In  Has Nigeria’s Agricultural Output Really Reduced or Increased since PDP Left Power? , I used a similar approach in verifying a similar claim about Nigeria’s agricultural output. Here, I had to mine data from 35 quarterly reports released by the National Bureau of Statistics, providing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) estimates four times every year. I also visualised using Infogram and Venngage.     In a third fact-check,  No, It is Not True Nigeria has Recorded Only 18 Convictions in Rape Cases , there was no readily available data to confirm or debunk the claim, so I had to mine both law and news reports focusing on court cases where there were rape charges. Eventually, I traced and gathered 65 rape convictions between 1973 and 2019, and shared this data in a tabular form in the report.     Another form of data collection I have used in my reports is surveys. In  ‘One Chance’ Robbery Attacks Rise in Abuja, and ‘Police are not Helpful’ , a poll I conducted on the prevalence of transit robberies established that nine in 10 residents of the city have either had an encounter with the robbers or know someone who has. It also showed, among other things, that seven in 10 (66.7 per cent) of the respondents do not “feel safer living in Abuja today, compared to previous years”. Having observed that conducting a poll on Twitter for a geographically restricted audience would compromise the result, I had to stick to using a Google Form. The poll results were visualised and embedded in the report.     Similarly, in  Nigeria Police, Army, NAFDAC have Worst Govt Spokespersons, Media Poll Shows , I conducted a survey among journalists, who disclosed the government Public Relations Officers with whom they have had their best and worst experiences.     My final two entries demonstrate how data elements and visualisations can add great value to investigative reports. In  Injustice in Ivory Tower , I used an infographic (tagged ‘Academic Massacre’) to capture the faces of lecturers of the Tai Solarin College of Education who have passed away due to the non-payment of their salaries and pension by the government.     And in  Pushed Beyond Borders , I used infographic designs to illustrate rising currency exchange rates between Nigeria and Benin Republic, and also the hardship that children in the latter have to go through as a result of an unfavourable socio-economic environment.

Philippines,"Rappler, Inc.",Big,Participant,Young journalist,Jodesz Gavilan," I have been a journalist for close to 6 years already. My career trajectory mostly focused on social issues. First focusing on poverty and malnutrition as a fresh graduate hired by Rappler in 2014, then to human rights now, especially under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte. These beats are not the most ""sexy"" out there, but I took it as a challenge to strengthen the coverage by approaching these problems in unique ways. In my reporting, I often go beyond the fiery exchanges and pursued stories that explain why we’re in this situation and what we can do. I waded through unnecessary soundbites to really report on things that matter all while answering the questions in my mind. My journalism became more of explaining complex issues rather than focusing on the he-said-she-said formula. Using data in my stories has been an inate part of my journalism career. Being in Rappler, one of the first media agencies that utilize data-driven reporting on issues, it was part of our DNA. We are fact-based and data don't lie.   But I am always reminded of what one of my editors, Chay Hofileña, often tell me: Put a face to your numbers. I should not settle on presenting the statistics or data. I should go beyond that, go to the field, and gather as much information on the people my numbers are based on. It is the way that we can bridge the gap between a foreign concept of data and statistics to real gut issues that are affecting our nation.     With that in mind, I have been on a relentless path of forging my understanding of data and my passion for human rights reporting to produce stories that seek to expose and push for conversations, if not real change.  "," My main project for 2019 is a map of killings in Negros province in the Philippines, seen as a killing field due to the high number of deaths beginning 2016 under Rodrigo Duterte. The history of Negros Island has been marred by violence yet it is severely underreported or at the very least, victims are reduced to statistics. In my project, I focused on mapping each killing to see where the epicenters are. I also included details about each victim, the manner of their death, their occupation, and affiliation. Including these key information enabled me to draw a big picture of the situation in Negros. The main challenge that I faced in doing my work is the collection of the information. For this, I consulted with a local human rights organization which tracks killings but the information provided weren't enough. What I did was to go through several news reports, using tools to extract key information such as date of killing and other identifiable information of each victim. Since I saw how hard it was to retrieve these data, I decided to place all the information I've gathered into a searchable table within the published story so other groups can also access them. No other media outlet in the Philippines has done this. It took me almost a month gathering all the data I needed but I had to persevere. Almost 6 months after I published my map, the Philippine Senate released a resolution urging an investigation into the situation in Negros Island.    I am a human rights reporter more than a data journalist. But doing this story made me realize that one could be both. Numbers are important, yes, but putting them in context, placing them within the situation of the issue, and giving faces to the numbers provide to be a more difficult task. But we have to do it so people can further appreciate our data and hopefully, will lead to changes.      ",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/238672-map-negros-killings-since-july-2016,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/220595-duterte-government-drug-war-deaths-unsolved,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/234183-duterte-halfway-mark-war-on-dissent-human-rights-defenders,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/222846-list-party-list-nominees-2019-elections-political-clans-powerful-figures,https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/issues/hunger/100037-pantawid-pamilyang-pilipino-program-ph-dswd-beneficiaries,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The title is ""Come Romelu Lukaku si è impadronito della Serie A"", meaning: How Romelu Lukaku is dominating Serie A.   Romelu Lukaku is the center forward of Italian side Internazionale F.C. and is having a great frist season in the Italian league. He is scoring a lot, is a fundamental in Antonio Conte's tactics and is amazing everyone with his peculiar style of play.

"," I am a young journalist with a lot of experience. I worked in La Repubblica daily while I was in my School of Journalism for the Master Degree (until 2018). Then I started to work for a news video agency in Naples (SìComunicazione) where I got used to video editing, tv journalism, radio journalism, and  etc. etc . Last summer I decided to learn  company communication,  so I joined Costa Cruises' press office. Since 2017 I write for Rivista Undici, probably the best Italian magazine on football and sports. And on January 30th comes out my first book ""STAND UP, SPEAK OUT"", about the connection between sports and civil rights in the Usa.   I always try to go beyond sports when I write about sports. Nowadays it's impossible to ""Stick to sports"". Because of the polarization of the politics, because of the integration of sports and society, because sports doesn't quit when the ring bell or the clock goes to 0 or the referee blows. Sports and politics are conncted, talking each other. And sticking to sports is pretending to not see what happens around us.

United States,Florida Today,Small,Shortlist,Young journalist,Alessandro Sassoon," Dear Sigma Awards Committee,   When I first met Alessandro Sassoon, he was applying for a position as a watchdog reporter and had been back in the U.S. about a year after spending three in Cambodia working for the Phnom Penh Post. He was having a hard time finding a job, let alone an employer who understood his work. As a long-time foreign correspondent, I was initially drawn to Ale’s overseas experience which had captured my attention. It was how he processed the experience that held it. That experience alone changes how one sees other human beings and themselves. It often produces either an insane curiosity and drive to better understand the world, or a dreadful cynicism. Ale revels in that curiosity and drive. He possesses an agile mind and is a wonderful lateral thinker.   As Ale’s editor, I’ve watched him channel his energy and enthusiasm into a project, quickly arriving at theories and motives, and attaching expectations to his reporting. And then the process would take a sharp turn. New information would come to light, complicating that perfect story he had already constructed in his head. He would then step back, distance himself from his expectations, process the new data and produce wonderful, clear but nuanced journalism.   During his work on our investigation into the jail death of Gregory Lloyd Edwards, a U.S. Army vet, the exact process I’ve described probably happened no less than three times. Ale kept digging and discovering more facts about this tragic case. He broke new ground by looking statewide at “excited delirium”, a controversial diagnosis used by some medical examiners in cases where police and violence are factors. It was his idea. He took the initiative, created a database and contacted every ME in the state, as well as lawyers and experts across the country. He also combed through more than 500 pages of sheriff’s office investigative reports, listened to more than 50 audio recordings and cross referenced them with hundreds of pages in the Brevard County Sheriff’s Office policy and procedure manual. He tracked down and reviewed medical examiner files, hospital reports, EMS paperwork, death certificates, Taser training manuals and restraint chair practices.   In the end, Ale almost single-handedly uncovered multiple violations of the jail’s own policies in the handling of Edwards. Ale raised questions about the integrity of Edwards' autopsy report, the ability of police to deal with people suffering from public mental health breakdowns and the sheriff’s investigation into the death. In the process, Ale inspired far older colleagues in the newsroom and his reporting led to more than  thousand letters and emails of support and calls for action that led the governor to ask for a review of the case. It was a remarkable performance for a 27-year-old reporter.   I cannot recommend Alessandro Marazzi-Sassoon enough for this award.   Sincerely,   Bobby Block "," On Dec 10, 2018, an anonymous tipster alerted Florida Today that an inmate -- a U.S. Army veteran -- died at the Brevard County Jail, possibly as the result of a confrontation with corrections deputies. Thus began a 10-month investigation into the untimely death of former US Army combat medic Gregory Lloyd Edwards.   What surfaced was the tragic story of a 38-year wounded warrior suffering from PTSD caught by a system unprepared to deal with him. Arrested after a psychotic episode outside a Walmart, he was taken to jail, resisted a booking officer and was set upon by seven deputies. Edwards was punched, pepper-sprayed, tased, and secured in a restraint chair with a spit hood over his head and pepper spray still on his face. He was denied medical care and left alone until he was found unresponsive in a cell 29 minutes after being subdued.   The medical examiner attributed Edwards’ death to “excited delirium.” The state attorney ruled the use of force justifiable.   FLORIDA TODAY’s investigation, spearheaded by watchdog reporter Alessandro Sassoon, found that excited delirium has become a go-to diagnosis in Florida when deaths happen in police custody. The paper also uncovered multiple violations of the jail’s own policies. The stories raised questions about the integrity of Edwards' autopsy report, the ability of police to deal with people suffering from public mental health breakdowns and the sheriff’s investigation into the death.   To do these stories, Marazzi Sassoon, reviewed more than 500 pages of sheriff’s office investigative reports, listened to more than 50 audio recordings and cross referenced them with hundreds of pages in the Sheriff’s Office policy and procedure manual. In addition, he tracked down medical examiner files, hospital reports, EMS paperwork, death certificates, Taser training manuals and restraint chair practices. Sassoon combed through academic literature on excited delirium and scraped data from the state’s 25 medical examiner districts.   At one point, the sheriff’s office tried to stop the municipal police agency that arrested Edwards from releasing bodycam footage to FLORIDA TODAY. It failed. One key piece of evidence, a video recording from jail surveillance cameras, has been exempted from release by Sheriff Ivey. Florida Today is still fighting for that footage.The reporting led to calls for action and in December 2019 the case was referred to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The FDLE review concluded that it did not have cause to open a criminal investigation. A decision by the Florida Medical Examiners Commission to review the autopsy is still pending.   Laurie Fan, a reader and veteran, was one of hundreds who praised the coverage. She wrote: “We were taught to uphold three important virtues while serving…honor, courage and commitment.  These are not just words…the words require action…action to do the right thing…even when that may be unpopular, even when it is uncomfortable, even when it requires an enormous amount of fortitude to continue.  You and others are demonstrating those virtues by publishing this expose… Keep sharing these stories, it matters.” ",https://www.floridatoday.com/in-depth/news/2019/10/24/excited-delirium-custody-deaths-gregory-edwards-melbourne-taser/2374304001/,https://www.floridatoday.com/in-depth/news/crime/2019/11/06/death-custody-army-vets-jail-treatment-violated-policy/1991676001/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United States,None,Small,Participant,Young journalist,From Ancient Cloth in China to Your Jeans," Dear organizers of 2020 Sigma Awards:   I'm Yutong Han, the second year Interactive Media student from the University of Miami. I want to be a data-driven storyteller in the future. Because data can't tell a lie, and the story is full of humanity. With many tools’ help, like D3.js, ArcGIS, Illustration, Procreate, I can communicate with people from different places through data visualization stories. Now I’m creating infographics and building the website in Marine Biology and Ecology Department in UM. Here is my portfolio website: <a href=""http://yutong-han.com/"">http://yutong-han.com/</a>. "," On August 20th, 2019, I attended professor Alberto Cairo’s Infographics and Data Visualization Studio course. We needed to individually develop a large visualization project in 4 months. I chose Chinese indigo dyeing as my topic. Many Chinese northern village workers relied on indigo dyeing for their livelihood last century. But their businesses were going up in flame. Because industrial indigo was successfully developed overseas. It is much cheaper than hand-made indigo. At that time, they were also war-torn. To some extent, indigo mirrored the decline and revival of China. How did this small blue fabrics mirror Chinese history?

Belgium,Birmingham Eastside,Small,Participant,Young journalist,Hugo Barbieux - Big Four Investigation," I became a journalist because of my penchant for the truth, pertinence and accuracy, as well as a concern for holding leaders to account. After few years in the TV industry, I decided to expand my skill set and learn how new technologies can lead journalists to tackle new issues as well as keeping new audiences engaged in digital age.  For example, I acutely observe how noble, dignified organisations like The New York Times, the BBC or the Financial Times are transforming their editorial line according to their audience's new uses of information. But I am also very curious about new media organisations like Vox.com, Bellingcat or The Intercept benefit from all the tools that the web 2.0 has to offer to convey ambitious and smart contents.   Connected to that, in September 2018, I undertook what has been the most challenging experience to date which was the decision to return to university to develop new and more competitive skills such as proficiency in data investigation, multiplatform journalism among others.   Being granted an award by a jury of experienced data journalists working in trusted organisations is not only a great prestige brand. Before all, it is an award of hard work and it crucially enhance one's credibility in an industry where getting hired is often a tough and taxing path. That is why I am applying for the 2020 Sigma Awards with the most advanced investigation I have produced so far proving my ability to work with cutting-edge digital tools.   I worked for three years for an international television called France 24 after I received an M.A. in European Journalism from IHECS School of Journalism, in Brussels, where I completed a successful thesis entitled The Political and Sociological Reasons for the Resurgence of Populism.  Then, my ambition to be a journalist who presents valuable content to a worldwide audience lead me to the UK where I have honed by ability to extract facts with a high level of precision and efficiency, in addition to studied innovative conveyance formats to keep the audience enthralled as well as informed.  Additionally, I took the advantage to follow conferences and workshops organised by the Consortium of Investigative Journalists in London to broaden my web of contacts in our industry and to keep my skills up to date.   I believe that a vital part of professional achievement comes from personal experience and observation which is why I am a voracious traveller and travel alone frequently. This is an indispensable prerequisite of any serious international journalist.   I have also come to appreciate in most mature manner the immense responsibility we as journalists have as participants and officers in a society which is changing quickly and perpetually changing. Journalistic integrity may be a cliché phrase, but it is also vital, more so today than ever. Therefore, because of this common fact, I am constantly affirming, questioning and reaffirming my role and responsibility as a sort of officer and agent of information conveyance or analysis. "," I am submitting my latest data-driven investigation about the deeply-rooted web that the four main accountancy firms, known as the ""Big Four"", maintain within the European institutions and how the changing industry of auditing is threatening smaller firms and, consequently, the quality of audit.  As a matter of fact, over the last decade the EU has spent over €118m on checking the figures on development cooperation projects. But more than a half of that money has gone to just a handful of accountancy firms, the ""Big Four"" and a fifth big actor, Moore Stephens.   This investigation gathers never-before-seen figures, actual transactions between DEVCO - European commission's directorate for international aid - and enterprises like audit firms. Although publicly accessible, the datasets that I have gathered are generally wrongly formated, inconsistently entered or stored in file formats that common people wouldn't be able to read. That is why this work is also matter of public interest. Even I struggled putting all the data together. It required a lot cautiousness in the data cleaning process with OpenRefine, in aggregating and analysing the data with R. I had also built a scraper to gather the data sets.  Furthermore, I have contacted key specialists like Prem Sikka or Eugene Rausch, a senior independent auditor, in order to bring vital relevance to this story.   The biggest challenge in creating this story was to find solid background information. The topic of cooperation development audit business has never been documented yet by any media organisation or NGO. Finding relevant interlocutors was thus a challenge. But data mining helped me to find small audit firms whose employees were happy to talk about concerns then untold.  Also, the ""Big Four"" are known to talk as less about their business as possible. So, finding an employee who would agree to speak was a big challenge and I had to build a strong network to finally find the right person to talk to.   To sum up, the fact that five big audit firms are not only sharing the bigger part of the pie to the exclusion of smaller companies but also getting them on a consistent basis is a big USP of the story. But it shows an important fact too: the industry is changing to the advantage of big actors thanks to strong lobbying actions. Furthermore, small firms actors warn about the fact that European framework agreements also favour the ""Big Four"".  A group of investigative journalists named Investigate Europe has shown interest in this investigation and will soon work on that basis and investigate further on the ""Big Four"" ubiquitous presence within European institutions and framework agreements.

United States,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,Young journalist,G. Elliott Morris," My name is G. Elliott Morris and I am a 23-year old data journalist for The Economist. Combining data with statistical analysis, I write stories for our newspaper that illuminate topics ranging from politics and economics to religion and mountaineering to climate change and technology. These pieces are published both in print, in our Graphic Detail section, and online, where our visualizers bring the full force of interactive design to our work.    A Texan who studied history, political science and consumer science in college, most of my work answers interesting questions American politics. I have written about how the Senate protects Republican politicians—such as defending Donald Trump against the US House's impeachment inquiry—and about how Americans who aren't politically active are more likely to be Democratic, under-representing liberals in our government. I crunch the numbers on The Economist's raw polling data from YouGov, lending insights about a wide range of issues regarding US public opinion. I also write about global topics, such as why China's greenhouse gas emissions are better than expected for a country its size and why rentier economies in the Middle East have produced authoritarian government.    Almost all of my work is buttressed by sophisticated tools of modern computational social science. For example, I have used multinomial non-linear regression to tease out the relationships linking music preferences to political behavior, and I've used autoregressive models to analyze what events do—and do not—influence US presidential nominating contests. My experience in statistical model-building has also lent itself to the paper's development of election forecasting models in both the United States and the United Kingdom. In December 2019, I developed an election-night model to predict each party's chance of winning a majority of seats in the UK parliament live as new results came in. I developed a similar model for the 2018 US House mid-term elections. My works on state-level attitudes about impeachment and the 2016 presidential election were developed using the cutting-edge Bayesian programming language Stan for running models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, which allowed us to distill national-level survey data to state-level estimates using multilevel regression and post-stratification. These tools are part of our cutting-edge offerings in data journalism today, and I hope to develop them further in the future.    A benefit of The Economist's data team's relatively small size for a big paper is that I get to work closely with all of my colleagues. Most of my work is thus created in collaboration with my peers. And though I am but a cog in the wheel of our data journalism team, I have helped the paper push the boundaries of what is possible with data journalism.    I see my job as asking normatively important questions about how people and their governments work together and espousing the answers for our readers. I hope to continue helping readers learn more about the world around them through data. I believe my endeavors in this mission so far warrant consideration for this year's award for Young Journalist. "," Throughout the last year, I have produced ambitious data-driven stories across a variety of subjects. By far the one that took the most amount of work, and of which I am most proud, is our work in exploring how the 2016 election could have gone differently if more voters turned out to the polls. We found that higher turnout benefits Democrats, but that they face a disadvantage in the electoral college because the voters that live in swing states are more Republican than the ones who live in large, non-competitive states. This project took months of work; we had to clean thousands of rows of raw census data and estimated nested multi-level regression models for both voter turnout and voter preferences. We turned to a sophisticated statistical language called Stan to run Bayesian models that were too complex and high-dimensional for our normals tools. In the end, were used these data to create an engaging interactive data visualization for Americans to explore how their behaviors impact the world around them (sometimes in big, consequential ways!).    I used similar modeling in December to analyze the ways that the pro-Republican bias of America's senate influenced the (still-ongoing) impeachment of President Donald Trump. Because smaller states have more rural and white voters, who lean Republican, they tend to elect Republican senators. These small states enjoy the same representation in the Senate as big states, however, which distorts the will of the American people.    Both of these projects used sophisticated analyses of polling microdata—tens of thousands of interviews with Americans—to derive insights into how America's systems of representation work, because it's the states that matter, not the nation as a whole. This is a contribution that few other newspapers have provided to our understanding of American politics.   I also worked on global pieces. My work on country-by-country emissions efficiency revealed, puzzlingly, that China is surprisingly carbon-efficient at its point in economic development than most western nations were at the same point in their histories. It's the sheer size of the country that's the matter.   I also used data that researchers living near Mount Everest hand-collected over the past 100 years to show how commercialization has simultaneously crowded the mountain and made climbing much safer than before. We published this piece just after news broke of massive crowding on the route to Everest's summit, making the article both timely and helpful for people trying to understand the broader story.  My work on the 2020 Democratic primary also began in mid-2019. It required building complex models of polling that allow readers to see the uncertainty underlying the race for president. Our models are new to the scene, so-to-speak, not least because we've chosen more complex statistical processes (Dirichlet distributions with splines, anyone?) to better represent both the underlying data and the theories of public opinion. Along with my visualization-focused colleagues, we built a pipeline for data gathering, modeling, and visualization that will help our readers understand the Democratic primary throughout the race.   In December, I also built a live election-night model of Britain's 2019 parliamentary election. It helped readers understand that early projections from the exit poll and BBC were likely to change. I published a methodology for this article, as well as the analysis of voting in 2016, on our Medium blog.

Spain,El Confidencial,Big,Shortlist,Young journalist,Cristina Suárez Vega,"Dear members of the jury, As a young, motivated data journalist I am extremely interested in submitting this application for the ‘Young Journalist' category of the 2020 Sigma Awards. I believe my chosen path in this type of journalism has enabled me to shed light on stories that would have otherwise gone unnoticed to by the public eye. Being that so, it would be extremely rewarding to receive such a prestigious award in acknowledgement of my work. For the last two years I have been the youngest member of the Data Team in El Confidencial, a digital Spanish newspaper that reaches more than 3 million daily readers. During this period of time I have had the opportunity to develop my professional skills in data and investigative journalism by working with statistics tools, public databases, FOIA requests, data scrapping, mapping and visualization to cover more than 30 data-related issues focused on public interest. Some of the examples are the projects on the continuous failure of escalators and elevators in Madrid, the shocking figures of accidents at work suffered by truck drivers, the most typical causes of death in each province or how owning a car marks the difference between high and low classes inside the metropolitan area of Madrid. These and four more projects have been attached to this application. My professional career is short but I have been interested in data journalism since the very beginning, even when it was not fully established in Spain yet. It was during my first internship in the local newspaper of my hometown where I began to dive into hand-written databases and documents to publish simple but engaging stories, such as There are less weddings in Zamora, but marriages last longer or Who are you? This is how names have evolved in Zamora. Maths and statistics had never been my strength but they somehow made sense to me when they were observed through the social lenses of journalism. That was the main reason why I decided to specialize in them by taking a Masters Degree in Data Journalism, Investigation and Visualization imparted by journalists, programmers and other professionals with high-level experience in this field. Two of them were Daniele Grasso and Jesús Escudero, my mentors at El Confidencial. By the end of the semester, I was asked to g Before joining the masters, my skills in tools such as Excel or SQL as well as Photoshop, Illustrator, Datawrapper or Qgis were almost inexistent. Nevertheless, by the end of the term, I managed to carry out a full investigation on the business of operating shelters for children under local authority care as my final dissertation. The results provided an insight on the few enterprises that were owning the majority of the shelters and how they benefited from them, even when their methods were questionable. But that was only the beginning. My professional growth has reached unexpected levels at El Confidencial. The Data Team is composed by only three people, so I have had to find my way through working with databases and finding stories every week while providing the rest of my colleagues with graphics and data analysis. I am confident that my resilient personality and my will to keep on growing as a professional have helped me to come up with the projects I am showing the jury today, which I am particularly proud of. Behind these achievements there is still a strong desire to learn. I am convinced this award will serve as an enormous incentive to keep on expanding my horizons. I would like to thank you in advance for considering my"," As much as us data journalists love numbers, readers can get easily tired of them. Our charts have shown that readers love a data story when there is a face representing the numbers.   I believe <a href=""https://www.elconfidencial.com/autores/cristina-suarez-2029/"">that’s what makes my projects different</a> from the rest: it is data journalism but in the form of explanatory reporting. They include the numbers but also the testimonies, interviews and pictures. In order for the jury to consider my application, I have divided my projects in three categories based on different visual results.    Interactive projects:    How old is your home? The map that shows how Spain has been built  (1)  and  Spain's orbituary: this is how we die now and how we did 40 years ago (2)    The more interactive the projects are, the better. Readers like to explore through graphics to find their story.    P.1  is a coloured map showing the date of construction of every building in Spain's 52 main cities. It also includes an address searcher. It was our first time using Mapbox and the data was extracted from the Spanish Land Registry through Qgis app and transformed into .gml databases.    P.2  is an interactive table that shows the most typical causes of death per 100.000 inhabitants now and 40 years ago per province. The extracting process was easier than P.1 but had the same problem: the numbers were divided into 52 databases we had to clean and join.    Reporting on social issues:   Heart attacks, threats and mugging: truck drivers, the 'riders' nobody is talking about (3); Gender violence as a senior: ""I had to take care of my aggresor until he died"" (4); The social gap of not owning  a car in the city (5)    These two are based on public information and talk about a specific social group undertaking a situation of inequality.  P.3  shows that, according to work accidents data, truck drivers are the most affected due to job insecurity and bad conditions.    P.4,  however, covers gender violence on older women, a poorly studied topic: since 2010, one out of ten murdered women were older than 60. For this story, we used our own database were we register every murder on the grounds of gender by age and other factors.   Finally, traffic information in Madrid helped me realize that having a car widens the gap between social classes. I cross-matched the cars per 1.000 citizens with social rates such as medium wage, unemployment and vulnerability per neighborhood.    Special formats:   Inaccessible underground (6)  and  25 years of Friends in 25 data (7)    Aesthetics are an essential part of data journalism. Some topics can only be covered if there is a design work behind. I have teamed with the Format Team in some of my projects to make them a good bait.   For example,  P.7  identifies the inaccessible stations in Metro de Madrid and whether they are close to hospitals and neighborhoods with children under 5 that use baby buggies. Metro gets hundreds of daily complaints about failures in elevators and escalators, so we also scrapped the notifications from Metro’s official website to find out how long they were out of period.   Also, when Friends turned 25 years old, I had the opportunity of leading  P.8 : we watched the 236 episodes to underline 25 curiosities such as the number of laugh tracks per episode, the scenes in each flat per season or how many extras were hired.   The audience results for these projects were more than satisfying. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U788WmOg6mtusqenB249CNsGxCGpwihBiBEivjl6eHk/edit?usp=sharing"">In here </a>you can find the exact numbers for each story.
