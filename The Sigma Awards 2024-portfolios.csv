United States of America,"Armando Info, InfoAmazonia, La Liga Contra el Silencio, Repórter Brasil, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, The Intercept Brasil, Mongabay.",Big,Shortlist,,Pulitzer Center,"I write this letter on behalf of an alliance of journalists and media outlets that collaborated to reveal how organized crime and illicit groups are destroying the Amazon rainforest. Their projects and stories were published by Armando Info, InfoAmazonia, The Intercept Brasil, La Liga contra el Silencio, Repórter Brasil and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). All collaborations were coordinated by the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network.
The Rainforest Investigations Network (RIN) was launched in 2020 to harness investigative reporting and cross-border collaboration to expose the intersection of climate change, corruption, and governance in the Amazon, Congo Basin and Southeast Asia. 

Since 2020, this network has promoted and supported collaborative investigations that unveiled some of the causes of environmental destruction in these regions. Also, the Rainforest Investigations Network is driven by making an impact, and we are proud to say that some of the projects and stories we have supported have led to societal transformation. 

As an example of these impacts, the database created by the project Amazon Underworld was presented to authorities attending the high-level meeting called the Amazon Summit, organized by the Brazilian government in August 2023. Since then, the data has been used in several publications from local and international press and reports by NGOs and think tanks.

The portfolio we are submitting represents an important breakthrough. The journalists’ use of data analysis, innovative methodologies, and their commitment and passion for environmental journalism uncovered a crucial and underreported issue in the Amazon: the connection between criminal and illicit groups and deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. This is why we, as a team, believe we should be considered for this prestigious award. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Gustavo Faleiros

Director of Environmental Investigations for the Pulitzer Center","The Rainforest Investigation Network, a community of investigative journalists created by the Pulitzer Center, has supported collaborations that have enhanced environmental coverage. In this portfolio, we present a series of unique stories and groundbreaking data analyses published in 2023 that serve as a blueprint for other journalists and civil society actors investigating criminal activities in the Amazon rainforest.

Our portfolio comprises four projects that used data to reveal how organized crime and other illicit activities converge to destroy the Amazon. In our portfolio, you will find:

Amazon Underworld: a series of nine stories published by Armando Info, InfoAmazonia and La Liga contra el Silencio, written by a team of 37 journalists from 11 countries and led by journalist and RIN Fellow Bram Ebus. This series uncovers the extent of illicit activities that destroy the Amazon. For that, it created a mapping methodology that indicates the presence of armed groups in 69%of the Amazonian municipalities.

The Big Green Laundromat: a series of four stories published by Repórter Brasil, and written by Brazilian journalist Hyury Potter. This series shows how the Amazon rainforest has been used as a “dirty laundromat” for organized crime groups and how they take advantage of the fragile regulations and political connections. 

Señores del Oro (The Gold Lords): a series of four stories by Joseph Poliszuk and María de los Ángeles Ramírez, published by ArmandoInfo and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. The stories show how Venezuelan gold is trafficked through its borders to feed a global trafficking network.

Forest Thieves: Who Profits From Federal Lands? is a series of five stories and one video by journalist Fernanda Wenzel, published by The Intercept Brasil and Mongabay. The stories reveal how criminal groups— that include politicians, businessmen and public servants— have invested large amounts of money to destroy public forests in the Brazilian Amazon. 

Journalists faced challenges producing these projects and stories, such as difficulty accessing data and collaborating. But that is not all. Unfortunately, Amazon’s illegal economy is extremely dangerous, and investigating it poses a risk to some of our journalists. However, they were thorough in their research and took necessary safety precautions, enabling them to conduct extensive and successful field reporting trips. 

This portfolio demonstrates the scale of the illegal economy destroying the Amazon. In all the stories submitted, we have seen an effort to consolidate databases that were collected firsthand and to work on a deep analysis of thousands of documents and geospatial information. 

With the help of the RIN team of editors and data experts, the findings of these investigations were presented in clear and eye-catching visualizations, maps and graphs, making the information more accessible to our audiences. Furthermore, despite being different projects based in different parts of the Amazon, all research methodologies have been shared, reflected in the quality of the results.","English, Portuguese, Spanish",https://amazonunderworld.org/,"https://armando.info/oro-de-sangre-por-alimentos/#:~:text=Un%20esquema%20que%20involucra%20a,terminaron%20en%20el%20mercado%20global.",https://www.occrp.org/en/blog/17676-how-venezuelan-gold-is-trafficked-through-brazils-borderlands-to-the-us,https://narcogarimpos.reporterbrasil.org.br/en/,https://www.intercept.com.br/2022/11/14/amazonia-desmatamento-pasto-terras-publicas/,https://www.google.com/url?q=https://news.mongabay.com/2023/04/professional-services-abound-for-amazon-land-grabbers-seeking-legitimacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1705436476142667&amp;usg=AOvVaw11i0Fad8epQOMaZXfdZ90R,https://www.intercept.com.br/2023/04/10/video-por-dentro-da-industria-da-grilagem/,
Indonesia,Narasi Newsroom,Small,Shortlist,,Narasi,"Our editorial staff consists of less than 35 people (small newsroom). Our reporting platform focuses on video reports and our main target audience is young people. Although we are a small newsroom, we have considerable influence on platforms such as Youtube, TikTok and Instagram. Since 2019, the investigation and data division was formed, with me as a leader. Investigative reports in video platforms using data and OSINT in Indonesia are very rare. We are trying to fill that void. In addition to extensive research, a creative approach is needed so that the public understands the complex data. 

Last year, we were nominated in the portfolio category for small newsrooms at the Sigma Awards. Before that, in 2019, our reporter Sharon Sumolang was nominated in the young journalist category. We hope this year we can be nominated and win. Because, in 2023, we experimented and covered big data processing with the latest methods. Among them: installing link traps in telegram accounts, using AI in fish theft cases and installing trackers on barges of deforestation perpetrators. (You can read the details in the portfolio description section.)

What we do is very unusual for media in Indonesia and Southeast Asia, especially non-documentary video-based media. We want to spread new ways of how journalists search for and work with data. For example: combining spatial data of forest imagery with Apple airtag trackers installed on barges, or using ship-identifying AI tools to calculate fishing activity. Since our target is young people, we are also required to process the complex data with a visual approach in the style of young people who are colorful and not rigid. The content can be cut short and shared on platforms such as Tiktok or IG reels without compromising the investigative context of the stories","1. This report tells the story of how Russia utilizes a local media outlet, Tribun Timur, to spread propaganda to Youtube audiences in Indonesia. This relationship is symbiotic mutualism, through Tribun Timur Pro-Russian war content can remain on air without being banned and taken down by Youtube. For Tribun Timur, Russia's algorithm manipulation efforts were able to make them gain many views which were converted into ads from YouTube reaching millions of dollars. 

This analysis reveals how YouTube's algorithms are manipulated to promote certain content, creating a misguided reality for viewers.
Nearly 60% of the Tribun's videos were war-related, with comments dominated by the Russian language, suggesting a foreign influence in the narrative presented.

Further investigation indicated the involvement of Russian web forces in this operation, with evidence pointing to St. Petersburg, Russia. We experimented with creating pro-Russian content on Youtube and distributing it to telegrams with a tracking script.

In-depth experiments and analysis revealed how Indonesian-language Ukrainian war content attracted audiences in Russia, including the alleged involvement of Russian tourists in Bali in this propaganda operation.

In conclusion, the case of Tribun Timur illustrates how local media can be caught up in global propaganda networks, with Russia as the main actor in manipulating digital algorithms to influence public opinion. 

2. General Santos City, is one of the most important fishing centers in Asia-Pacific. The problem is that the majority of tuna in Gensan comes from Indonesia.

When Susi Pudjiastuti was the Minister of Fisheries, she made a policy to eradicate illegal fishing which caused the supply of fish to Gensan to decrease drastically. 

However, in 2019, after Susi Pudjiastuti was no longer , illegal fishing activities by Filipino vessels from Gensan started to increase again in the border area. 

We used AI technology to detect the activities of vessels that docked at Gensan harbor during 2015-2020. We also used data on the lights shining in the Sulawesi Sea to strengthen our conclusions. In fact, fish thieves from the Philippines came back to steal fish after Jokowi's policy softened in the second term of his presidency.

3. Royal Golden Eagle Group (RGE) and APRIL, major players in the wood pulp industry in 2015 pledged to eliminate deforestation from all its production operations, but field investigations using Airtag Apple and geospatial data analysis show this pledge is not being fulfilled. RGE and APRIL continue to obtain wood from deforestation, despite having committed not to do so.

These greenwashing practices are revealed through the use of shadow companies and shell companies in tax havens, making their ownership structures complex and difficult to understand.

These greenwashing schemes also affect the global fashion industry. Well-known brands such as Marks and Spencer, Esprit, H&amp;M, Uniqlo, and Adidas source viscose rayon from RGE, which is considered environmentally friendly. Ironically, some of these brands have committed to sustainability and zero deforestation.

The ""greenwashing domino"" effect occurs when one company's greenwashing triggers a chain reaction in its business partners, spreading inaccurate information to consumers.","Indonesia, English",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CPfN5hONM4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6yU0M8WOM8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUy8Eh051SU,,,,,
Spain,RTVE,Big,Shortlist,,RTVE,"DatosRTVE se creó durante la pandemia de COVID, fruto de la necesidad. Desde entonces, el proyecto ha seguido creciendo tanto en las habilidades del equipo como en los temas que aborda: salud, pero también medio ambiente, política o cultura. Y dentro de esas áreas, todo tipo de temas, tratando de ofrecer enfoques informativos y novedosos a través de los datos y la visualización. Dentro de la sección hay perfiles diversos, desde periodistas tradicionales que se han reconvertido hasta perfiles más técnicos y especializados. Además, una parte fundamental de nuestro trabajo es la colaboración con otros profesionales de la casa, desde el equipo de Infografía hasta los compañeros de El Tiempo. Como responsable del equipo, en esta ocasión presento una apuesta de la sección a la que dedicamos un porcentaje considerable del tiempo de trabajo de cada año, y en el que creemos firmemente. La cobertura del cambio climático es una de las principales líneas de trabajo de DatosRTVE que seguirá crecienco y mejorando.","El servicio público es la razón de ser de RTVE - la radiotelevisión pública española- en general y de DatosRTVE en particular. Y por eso uno de los temas a los que dedicamos más esfuerzos a lo largo del año es el cambio climático. Nuestra cobertura tiene dos ejes principales. Por un lado, los trackers de distintas temáticas que mantenemos actualizados con periodicidad variable en función de la actualidad y que vamos mejorando año tras año. Esto incluye un tracker de incendios donde al mapa de incendios activos en España y Europa -con datos satelitales que procesamos, analizamos y visualizamos- le sumamos el análisis con gráficos sobre los incedios históricos, las hectáreas quemádas, los grandes incendios y mucha más información de contexto para explicar el tema de la mejor forma forma posible. También un tracker de embalses perenne durante todo el año en el que detallamos la situación de cada embalse, así como los datos de las cuencas hidrográficas, el registro de precipitaciones y los indicadores de sequía; un compendio de datos explicados y contextualizados que permite un seguimiento completo del agua disponible en España. 

El segundo eje es el seguimiento habitual de los fenómenos meteorológicos y el cambio climático que realizamos mediante piezas concretas. Desde el recuento de las noches tropicales el pasado verano hasta el repaso mensual de las temperaturas, con contenidos aún más elaborados como el análisis de las piscinas españolas en un contexto de emergencia por escasez de agua. 

Y a todo ello se suman contenidos adicionales y originales, como una calculadora de olas de calor que utiliza los datos desde que la Agencia Española de Meteorología tiene registros hasta la actualidad y los presenta al usuario de una manera personalizada que muestra, al final, cómo estos fenómenos meteorológicos son cada vez más frecuentes.

Elaborar estos contenidos es un reto constante dentro de la sección. El esfuerzo por acceder a todos los datos disponibles y comunicarlos de la mejor manera posible nos ha hecho avanzar en el uso de nuevas herramientas -por ejemplo, nuevas librerías en R para geolocalizar las coordenadas de los incendios; QGIS para manejar los polígonos de las áreas quemadas; o Sentinel para obtener imágenes satelitales- y nos mantiene alerta, siempre pendientes para mejorar nuestra cobertura.",Español,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230907/incendios-ultima-hora/2436349.shtml,,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230914/calculadora-olas-calor-espana/2446505.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230703/medio-millon-piscinas-espana-afectada-sequia/2450800.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230426/mapa-lluvias-cuanto-zona/2441344.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230824/estamos-ante-verano-extremo/2454501.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20231201/calido-record-noviembre-veranillo-caluroso/2463710.shtml,https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20230831/incendios-devastadores-verano-2023/2454816.shtml

They are responsible for the implementation of all data journalism projects on ZEIT ONLINE.

Whether wars, climate change or the energy crisis: the team finds the latest data and the right format for every topic. In addition to current news topics, the team also manages to set its own, such as the focus research ""The new city"" (https://www.zeit.de/die-neue-stadt), which lasted over a year and a half. The team collected all available data from the 80 major German cities and was able to show in detail for the first time how the major trends of the present have transformed Germany's major cities. 

The coronavirus pandemic has made data journalism systemically relevant. Never have figures and their presentation been so important, never have decisions with such great social relevance been made on the basis of key figures, data and maps, and this development has continued seamlessly ever since. Will the energy transition succeed? What does climate change mean for me? Questions like these can be answered with data.

At ZEIT ONLINE, data and visualizations are no longer an accessory, but the focus of reporting. In collaboration with other departments, its own community, as well as authorities in Germany and researchers around the world, the team tries to break new ground in journalism every day.

On the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ZEIT ONLINE offers a completely new perspective on the war to date with the help of a comprehensive collection, evaluation and visualization of data and satellite images.

My neighborhood, a bubble
There is often talk of an urban-rural divide when it comes to political lines of conflict in Germany. In reality, however, many divisions run right through German cities. Whether west or east, metropolis or medium-sized city - similar patterns emerge time and again. ZEIT ONLINE has remapped the political landscape of the republic.

This is how much hotter the current heat would be in the future
One of the hottest days this year was July 9, 2023. It was not only warm in Germany, but in large parts of Europe, especially in the south. Using exclusive research data from the Alfred Wegener Institute, we show what this heatwave would look like in Germany Europe with and without climate change.

Where the Earth is becoming virtually uninhabitable
Traditionally, humans live in what is known as a climate niche. In these places, for example, the average annual temperature is below 29 degrees. With climate change, not only are global temperatures rising, but the regions where it is simply too hot to live are becoming ever larger, shows our data analysis and interactive graphic.

This is where all the wind turbines could be located
Many Germans are in favor of wind power - until it comes to the question of where the wind turbines should be located. However, the energy transition is not possible without wind energy, or more precisely: the energy transition is not possible without tens of thousands of new wind turbines. For the first time, we have calculated that there is enough space for all the wind turbines that would be needed for the energy transition in Germany. 

What climate future will we live in
Climate change will soon fundamentally alter the earth. But what do these abstract scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mean? Are 1.5 degrees or 2.7 degrees really still so far away and what will we, our children and grandchildren experience? Our interactive calculator uses scientific model data to show what kind of future a person can expect

The new city
Around a third of Germans, 27 million people, live in large cities. How have their lives changed in recent decades? How do inequality, migration and high rents shape life in cities? A team from ZEIT ONLINE spent a year and a half collecting all available data from the 80 major German cities, from authorities, statistics offices, data service providers - and from the administrations of individual cities themselves. In some cases, the team came across unpublished data sets, while in others it was able to make data available for the first time that documents the development of recent years.

United States of America,MuckRock,Small,Shortlist,,MuckRock,"[MuckRock](https://www.muckrock.com/) is a nonprofit, collaborative news platform that brings together journalists, researchers and the public to request, analyze and share primary source data and documents in the public interest. In 2021, MuckRock created an editorial unit, which operates as a hybrid newsroom and journalism support organization. 
The newsroom’s editorial policy defines its work as “both collaborative and independent reporting efforts on issues of public importance.” The editorial team works with existing local publications that have large data, analysis and document needs, supplementing both the specific partner investigations while helping them build their own capacity for reporting in the future. Through these partnerships, MuckRock works alongside other, early-career journalists to provide much-needed help in obtaining and analyzing primary source documents and data for investigative projects.
Each year, we manage dozens of partnerships with local newsrooms around the country, helping these newsrooms increase their impact while covering critical stories that would otherwise go untold. There are few newsrooms that have a stated mission as a local journalism support organization and even fewer with federal, state and local open-records and data expertise.
Our work has grown to more than a dozen partnered investigations with local newsrooms across the country, including deregulation and wildfire management in California; sex trafficking and migrant issues in Texas; nuclear waste and its resulting public health effects in Missouri; and air pollution with our own sensor journalism network in Cook County, Illinois.","In 2023, MuckRock’s editorial team worked on data investigations with local newsroom partners across the United States, focusing largely on the environment and public health. 
Our “Atomic Fallout” series, published with The Missouri Independent, a new States Newsroom-affiliated politics-focused outlet, and The Associated Press, was a six-month multi-newsroom investigation that revealed, with the help of newly-declassified federal documents, how the U.S. government downplayed and ignored health risks associated with St. Louis radioactive waste for decades. The investigation sparked bipartisan federal legislation that would expand a program compensating those who lived near the Superfund sites, to include Missouri and other states.
Within days, Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican, and Rep. Cori Bush, a Democrat, pledged action, calling the investigation “devastating” and decrying the federal government’s “negligence."" ""This report confirms what we in the community have known for decades: that for the past 75 years, the federal government actively and knowingly treated St. Louis as a dumping ground for harmful and toxic radioactive waste,"" Bush said. 
“The Air We Breathe,” with the bilingual community newsroom, the Cicero Independiente, is an ongoing yearlong project involving air quality sensors we installed on volunteers’ homes. Those sensors found comparably, and dangerously, high concentrations of particulate matter 2.5, or soot. We hosted a local event in Cicero in August, sharing our initial findings on the town’s air pollution with residents, before publishing a two-part series in November and December. Following the series, Cicero’s town board president publicly criticized the Independiente’s journalists, and threatened to bar their reporters from speaking during public meetings.
“Smoke, Screened,” an investigative series by NPR’s The California Newsroom, MuckRock and the Guardian, focused on the large environmental impact of a little-noticed deregulatory tool found in the federal Clean Air Act. The legal provision has allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to strike pollution from clean air tallies in more than 70 U.S. counties, enabling local regulators to claim the air was cleaner than it really was for more than 21 million Americans. The loophole allows regulators to forgive pollution, and avoid costly cleanup work, caused by “natural” or “uncontrollable” events, including wildfires. Following the series, our reporters presented their work at the annual American Geophysical Union conference for a forthcoming paper.

MuckRock also supported newsroom data projects in other ways. We compiled and released a data repository to track U.S. maternal mortality rates to share with local newsrooms across the country, resulting in several stories in North Carolina, Michigan and Georgia. We continued our investigative series on the U.S. child care industry, called “Disappearing Day Care,” which showed that despite hundreds of millions in federal pandemic relief money pouring into the state, child care facilities are facing huge staffing shortages and parents are struggling with long waitlists for care. And a government spending and data investigation from STAT News and MuckRock shows that the nearly $1.2 billion in taxpayer money for long Covid research has resulted in few tangible results.","English, Spanish",https://www.muckrock.com/project/atomic-fallout-records-reveal-the-federal-government-downplayed-ignored-health-risks-1164/,https://www.muckrock.com/project/smoke-screened-the-clean-air-acts-dirty-secret-1117/,https://www.muckrock.com/project/the-air-we-breathe-how-industry-is-polluting-ciceros-air-1168/,https://www.muckrock.com/project/disappearing-day-care-child-care-crisis-in-the-us-1161/,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/apr/20/long-covid-nih-billion/,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2023/jul/25/tracking-maternal-mortality-rates/,,
United Kingdom,BBC,Big,Shortlist,,BBC Shared Data Unit,"The BBC Shared Data Unit has continued to promote and support data journalism at a regional level across the UK, whilst making national and local headlines with a series of public interest data investigations. The team’s collaborative model sees it share its data journalism with more than 1,000 local news outlets across television, radio, print and digital. 

During the course of the year, the team have also led week-long masterclasses in investigative journalism and launched a coding course for journalists. We help to strengthen local news output by giving journalists the skills to interrogate data and tell stories of importance to their communities.
A key part of the team’s editorial remit is to find news stories that are hiding in plain sight, using data journalism techniques to explore the impact of local and national government policies on the lives of individuals. Its reporters take the time and space to work on exclusive investigative journalism, using digital techniques to tell stories that would otherwise go untold.

The SDU believes in making its journalism accessible to as many people as possible, and in being transparent and accountable in its reporting. The majority of our data, methodologies and code are published on our website.","In March, we reported how hundreds of sex offenders across the UK had slipped off the radar of police by changing their identity to escape the authorities. 

The research involved interviews and FOI requests to police forces and security agencies. We found dozens of examples of abusers who had changed their names and compiled their pictures into a gallery to visualise how widespread this issue was in our television reporting

Two abuse survivors, Della Wright and Lauren-Eden Sullivan, waived their legal right to anonymity to share their personal experiences as part of our reporting. 

Our research was quoted in a debate in a House of Commons Chamber on the day after publication and received widespread coverage in the national and regional Press. 

Six months after our report, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced a plan to ban sex offenders from changing their name and gender - what’s been called Della’s Law.

In April 2023, we worked with BBC's Newsbeat to report that six out of 10 recently inspected UK rental homes failed to meet a proposed new standard for energy efficiency.

In June 2023, we analysed The Gazette to gain a regional picture of the business insolvencies being experienced across the UK as a result of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis.

In July and November, we teamed up with BBC Wales Investigates to take a deeper look into care in the UK over the course of two exclusive stories. 

We found a system in chaos with parts of the UK experiencing 100-day waits for assessments, patients stuck in hospital for nearly a year because there was nowhere for them to go and more than 13,000 care contracts handed back to councils, largely because private companies could not provide enough staff. 

Our investigation found more than 1,300 people had died in the space of a year while waiting for their care package to start and also looked at how a lack of available care was causing large backlogs in the health system. The data was acquired through more than 500 Freedom of Information requests and by interrogating daily hospital discharge data.
The investigation resulted in the BBC documentary I Want to Go Home as well as bulletins across the BBC network and two online stories in July and November. 

In August, we revealed that a black hole in local authority budgets had continued to grow, prompting fears some will not be able to provide basic services. 

The research involved surveying 190 upper-tier authorities in the UK to find out the extent of the financial difficulties facing town halls.

Our investigation featured across BBC platforms, including the BBC News website, News at Six and Radio 4's Today, as well as BBC Wales and around 20 other BBC radio outlets. The story was also published by over 80 local media such as Manchester Evening News and Wales Online.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,,,LA NACION: 2023 national elections: the disruptive use of data and AI to cover the arise of an unexpected candidate,"LA NACION is a major national newspaper in Argentina, founded in 1870. In 1995, we launched lanacion.com, and since then, we have embraced the opportunities of digital media, data, and technology.

This Elections portfolio is submitted by the LN DATA and New Narratives teams, boasting over 13 years of experience developing journalistic products based on data and innovative formats for visualization. 

Our expertise includes data-driven investigations, maps, graphics, and data-tainment. We dreamt big, started small, and never stopped.

Our team comprises diverse professional profiles, including journalists, backend and frontend programmers, designers, engineers, political scientists, and data analysts. Working by projects, we aim to enrich content and produce better information. 

Our overarching goal has always been to add value and innovate through the use of data, technology, artificial intelligence, and the human capital of our team.

We began by gathering allies within the company and forming bonds with the emerging Hacks/Hackers, open data, open government, and data science initiatives. To accelerate change, we hosted four Datafest public events in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. 

These events strengthened our learnings on opening, analyzing, and visualizing data of public interest generated by various stakeholders, including government, multilateral organizations, academia, media, NGOs, etc.

Over the last 13 years, our main inspiration has come from organizations such as Propublica, The Guardian UK, Los Angeles Times, NYTimes, WaPo, Civio (Spain), The Economist, Reuters, Ojo Publico, and Texty.

We get ideas from NICAR, ONA, GEN Summit, Abrelatam, and Hacks/Hackers Argentina conferences.

Our mentors include Knight Mozilla OpenNews, EJC, JSK at Stanford University, Prof. Rosental Alves, and, more recently, PolisLSE Journalism AI Collab.

We are passionate about our editorial mission and our motto is ""Never stop learning""!","In 2023, Argentina was the country with the second-highest year-over-year inflation in the world (over 160%), poverty over 40% and a strong distrust in government institutions as a result of its levels of corruption and economic failures. This situation deepened social polarization and political apathy, and it allowed for the rise and triumph of an eccentric outsider in the presidential elections: the media economist and far-right candidate Javier Milei.

How did we innovate and overcome with such a particular election? Taking into account a data-driven coverage where we not only reused historical data, but also performed complex analyses and applied new technology to create more and better content. For example, we used AI to analyze the speeches and facial expressions of the candidates in real time during the three presidential debates and Milei's inaugural speech.

To address audience apathy, we redoubled our bet on interactive content. Our “Political Test,” a quiz to identify one’s affinities with the main candidates for president, went viral on social media, received more than 1 million pageviews and registered more than 10 responses per second on its first day of publication. Politicians from all parties shared it on their social media, including Milei. It was the topic of conversation among friend groups and families as well as radio, TV and streaming shows.

We processed and published minute-by-minute information on more than 27.6 million votes in 24 provinces detailed for the 529 departments of Argentina. Milei not only surprised by beating the traditional political parties in the primaries, but also won by more than 10 points in the second round. At LA NACION, we were able to show with empirical evidence the origin of this social and political phenomenon that spanned all jurisdictions, social classes and ages by making complex analyses comparing electoral results with socioeconomic data.

The electoral performance of Milei's political party was unexpected and many political outsiders entered Congress. In order to tell more comprehensive stories, we formed alliances: we worked with a specialized NGO to systematize information on more than 320 legislators.

As the electoral maps are historically one of the most-viewed features on LA NACION’s website, we reconfigured them to offer more services to the user. We added maps with average salaries and public employment levels, added hyper-localized electoral results that only we had, and made comparisons with previous elections and analyses of vote redistribution more complex. The average reading time for this project was almost eight minutes.

As a Muslim reporter tasked with covering the controversial issue of budget cuts in India’s Ministry of Minority Affairs by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the centre, it was difficult. It was difficult at all stages, starting from difficulty in securing information related to the ministry—responsible for addressing the concerns and promoting the welfare of religious minorities across the country, including India’s largest minority group: the Muslims, to receiving death threats for picking up this issue. I feel that the challenges I faced while working on these reports were unique and went beyond the standard rigours of reporting. I faced prejudice from people around me, sources and even the readers of this report who accused me of not being “objective” simply because of my religious identity as a Muslim woman. As a Muslim reporter, I have often also faced online harassment and death threats. As was the case with this report, it happens mostly when the report points towards information that is critical of the government’s action. The self-assigned dedicated trolls on social media protect the Hindu supremacist BJP government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which often means issuing death threats to journalists like me. During these times, I have felt extreme pressure to self-censor my reporting and avoid critical commentary or in-depth investigations to avoid the kind of backlash I have received for covering such stories. The portfolio of my stories includes three news reports, all of which deal with the issue of the reduction in the budget for the Ministry, which critics say casts a question over the BJP government’s claim of inclusivity. The question looms large: is there space for Indian Muslims, India’s largest minority, in the Narendra Modi-led government and nation?","English, Roman Hindi (translated to English)",https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/why-the-ministry-of-minority-affairs-is-staring-at-a-major-crisis/article66338112.ece,https://frontline.thehindu.com/the-nation/how-budget-allocation-for-ministry-of-minority-affairs-declined/article66338066.ece,https://frontline.thehindu.com/news/budget-cut-for-minority-affairs-ministry-intensifies/article66462801.ece,,,,,

I firmly believe in the power of constant learning and actively combine various tools to construct data journalism stories from scratch. This approach has enabled me to innovate and maintain a dynamic edge in my work. My commitment to excellence and innovation in the field has been recognized; in the previous year, my portfolio was shortlisted for the Sigma Data Journalism Awards. Additionally, I was a finalist in the Information is Beautiful Awards in 2022, and most recently, I was honored with the prestigious Gold for Infographics at the Indigo Design Award last year.","Historically, creating data visualizations was a task primarily undertaken by expansive newsrooms equipped with teams of journalists and designers. However, the emergence of new technologies, coupled with the widespread availability of open-source platforms, has revolutionized this landscape. Now, even smaller and medium-sized newsrooms have the capability to produce high-quality visualizations efficiently and with fewer resources. This shift has leveled the playing field, allowing these smaller entities to craft narratives as engaging and impactful as those from larger organizations.
My aspiration for 2023 was to broaden the reach of data visualization, making it not just widely accessible but also deeply resonant with audiences. To achieve this, I focused on selecting stories that not only highlighted societal issues but also presented grand-scale concepts, simplifying comparisons through meticulously collected data. Moreover, 2023 was a pivotal year where my primary focus was on democratizing the use of interactive data stories. This initiative was particularly significant in a countriy with a limited history of large, multi-disciplinary data visualization and graphic teams in newsrooms.

Portugal,PÚBLICO,Big,,,Rui Barros,"Caro júri do Sigma Awards,

Todos os anos, desde que este prémio existe, sento-me em frente ao meu computador para fazer uma reflexão sobre o ano que passou. É sempre um momento para olhar para trás, lembrar os sete anos que já tenho de profissão, mas também de apreciar aquilo que melhor fiz durante o ano. No entanto 2023 foi um ano complexo. Tão complexo que, este ano, permitam-me, a minha carta será um pouco mais pessoal.

Começou com a expansão da minha equipa no PÚBLICO de um para três membros, um marco que representou um grande avanço profissional. Terminou com incertezas devido a um acidente vascular cerebral que afetou minha visão e me fez questionar a continuidade nesta profissão.

Este ano, explorei as raízes do Precision Journalism, criei um mural sobre inflação, desenvolvi simuladores para ajudar os leitores a entender as medidas de apoio governamentais, contribuí para a transparência da contratação pública com um tracker do Ferrovia 2020, e usei dados de satélite para informar sobre a temperatura da água nas praias portuguesas. Além disso, trabalhei no “Ranking das Escolas”, permitindo que os leitores desenhassem o seu ranking de acordo com seus critérios.

Paralelamente, e enquanto via um jornalista de dados nascer ao meu lado na redação, comecei a ensinar na universidade, desenhando a disciplina que sempre quis ter. Voltei a descobrir que, afinal, o jornalismo de dados realmente é o novo punk. E que com entusiasmo e originalidade podem-se fazer grandes histórias.

Ser pioneiro em jornalismo de dados em Portugal não foi fácil, mas as conquistas e desafios tornaram a jornada gratificante. E é por isso que, apesar de tudo, olhar para trás reforça a minha determinação em continuar a fazer jornalismo de dados.

Atenciosamente,

Rui Barros","1 - [Contas à vida: enfrentar a inflação]
Fomos às raízes do jornalismo de dados e do “Precision Journalism” e decidimos que nada melhor do que criar essa base de dados de testemunhos que tomavam o pulso à economia. Um trabalho que veio dar rosto à crise económica vivida no ano de 2023. Fui developer, designer e produzir a análise de dados.

2 - [A que velocidade anda o Ferrovia 2020?] 

O Ferrovia 2020 projetou um investimento próximo a três mil milhões de euros para a modernização e eletrificação da rede ferroviária portuguesa, mas as taxas de execução continuavam, em 2020, abaixo do estimado inicialmente. Este projecto quis analisar o investimento público realizado no sector. Fui developer, designer e produzir a análise de dados.

3 - [Veja a temperatura da água na sua praia favorita]

Num ano marcado por recordes consecutivos de temperatura, criou-se uma ferramenta que permitisse saber a temperatura da água do mar em cada praia da costa portuguesa e monitorizar a temperatura média da água de toda a costa portuguesa. Desenhei a metodologia de raiz com o meu colega de secção, tendo sido responsável por parte do script e do frontend.

4 - [Como estava o planeta quando nasceu?]

A propósito da COP28, quisemos mostrar aos nossos leitores como o mundo tem mudado num período tão curto de tempo. Para isso, desafiámos os leitores a introduzir a sua data de nascimento e a descobrir como o mundo mudou desde que nasceram. Auxiliei no desenho do conceito do trabalho. 
5 - [Faça o seu Ranking]

Há mais de 20 anos publicamos aquilo que ficou conhecido como o “Ranking das Escolas”. Este ano decidimos dar essa possibilidade aos nossos leitores: se fosses tu a desenhar o ranking das escolas, que critérios escolherias? Fui autor por completo do algoritmo e dos cálculos e do frontend deste trabalho.

6 - [Onde é que consigo arrendar uma casa com o meu salário?]
Mapa interactivo que permite ao leitor perceber o peso da habitação nas diferentes regiões do pais. Recolhi e analisei os dados, sendo também autor do código de frontend com recurso a Svelte.

Russian Federation,"Добро.Журнал, LesMedia, Tilda",Small,,,Устелёмов Владислав Анатольевич,"Меня зовут Владислав Устелёмов, я молодой журналист, блогер, аспирант Санкт-Петербургского государственного университета и общественный деятель. За моими плечами уже более 7 лет активной помощи людям и целый багаж добрых дел, о которых я бы хотел рассказать. 
До 2016 года я не предполагал, что буду заниматься журналистикой. Тогда я только окончил экономический университет и искал работу, а заодно и способы самореализации. Однажды друзья посоветовали мне попробовать себя в медиа. Заинтересовавшись новыми возможностями, я пришел в общероссийскую молодежную общественную организацию «МИР», где стал участником известного федерального проекта «Медиа-волонтер».
Освещая городские события и создавая о них журналистские материалы, я вскоре понял, что эта работа стала не только моей отдушиной, но и профессией. За четыре года бескорыстной деятельности медиа-волонтером я подготовил свыше 400 публикаций, которые информировали петербуржцев о главных событиях города: концертах звезд эстрады, международные и всероссийские форумы, спортивные соревнования, патриотические и благотворительные акции, масштабные праздники и фестивали с участием первых лиц города и страны. Они - свидетели современной истории, которую я создаю в творческих работах. 
Мои статьи в соцсетях и молодежных СМИ уже помогли сотням людей и организаций, в том числе: рассказать о социальных проектах и значимых инициативах широкой аудитории, привлечь внимание общественности к острым социальным проблемам города и оказать адресную помощь уязвимым категориям граждан, продвигать осознанное потребление и раздельный сбор мусора, привлечь горожан Санкт-Петербурга в ряды волонтеров, добиваться создания доступной городской среды для людей с инвалидностью и их интеграции в инклюзивное общество, и конечно, оперативно информировать петербуржцев о ключевых событиях , мотивируя к созидательной активности на благо страны.
Впереди – множество планов, которые призваны развивать цифровые коммуникации и с их помощью сделать жизнь миллионов людей еще комфортнее. Будет здорово, если моя история успеха послужит примером и вдохновит неравнодушных граждан совершить мирные подвиги. А я продолжаю созидательный путь в медиа, чтобы подарить планете и живущим на ней людям еще больше добрых свершений.","Уже 7 лет я освещаю социально значимые события в качестве медиа-волонтера, блогера культуры и журналиста интернет-СМИ. За это время довелось написать более 400 авторских публикаций, которые рассказывают о жизни российской молодежи, культуре и искусстве, социальных проектах, деятельности волонтеров и гражданских активистов, патриотических и благотворительных акциях, инклюзивных технологиях и достижениях людей с инвалидностью. 
Первые шаги в журналистику я сделал в 2016 году, став участником федерального проекта «медиа-волонтер», который реализуется Общественной организацией «МИР». Участие в нем в течение четырех лет позволило раскрыть таланты в написании текстов, что стало точкой отчета моей профессиональной карьеры в медиа. Далее я продолжал сотрудничество в качестве корреспондента городского студенческого пресс-центра Санкт-Петербурга, освещая студенческие события для портала studpressa.ru . Благодаря репортажам тысячи студентов смогли найти досуг, посетить события культуры, узнать много полезной информации о возможностях для молодежи. Аналогичного эффекта удалось добиться в арт-клубе Санкт-Петербургского государственного университета, где я оттачивал навыки журналиста на позиции контент-редактора и руководил производством медиаконтента студенческой редакции. Одновременно с этим освещал деятельность волонтеров и события некоммерческого сектора для «Добро.Журнал» и платформы LESMEDIA». Среди ключевых тем – работа волонтеров в период пандемии covid-19, проблемы вакцинации и жизни в условиях самоизоляции, статьи о добрых людях, а также социальные проекты и общественно значимые события по всей стране.
Участвуя в проекте «Я созидатель!», разместил на портале «МояРоссия.РФ». серию историй о людях, которые помогают и создают, вопреки сложным жизненным обстоятельствам.. 
Также сотрудничал с известным деловым изданием «Эксперт Северо-Запад Online», освещая в роли внештатного корреспондента молодежные и инклюзивные события. Созданные публикации внесли серьезный вклад в продвижение инклюзии, позволив проявить свои таланты в новой сфере - социальной журналистике. 
Не ограничиваясь журналистикой, я пробую силы в развитии молодежных движений и волонтерских центров, будучи пресс-секретарем нескольких организаций: осуществляю информационное сопровождение молодежной политики и повышаю социальную активность молодых граждан, привлекая их к волонтерской деятельности и участию в социальных проектах. 
Полученный опыт способствует моему профессиональному росту в медиа. В настоящее время я занимаю должность заместителя главного Интернет-журнала «МИР. Не серые будни»., в котором пишу о ключевых событиях культуры, освещаю крупнейшие городские события и создаю уникальные интервью и репортажи с медийными персонами. Общая аудитория в соцсетях составила 50 000, а совокупный охват в медиапространстве достиг 700 000 человек.
Кроме того, занимаясь ведением тревел-блогов и созданием авторских мультимедийных лонгридов, посвященных 
актуальным социальным проблемам: самореализации инвалидов, развитию доступного туризма, образовательных и карьерных возможностях для молодежи. На канале Дзен и Вконтакте размещаю авторские, которые помогают узнать о городских событиях, достопримечательностях, молодежных активностях, образовательных ресурсах. Среди наиболее интересных –блог-туры и студенческие экспедиции, форумы для молодежи, истории успеха и федеральные проекты поддержки талантливых людей. Качественные публикации, актуальные информационные поводы, глубокое погружение в материал, известные герои, ответственное отношение к работе - все это гармонично сочетается в моем журналисстком творчестве, благодаря которому я получил признание как лучший медиа-волонтер Санкт-Петербурга и удостоился наград в более 100 конкурсах. Достигнутые успехи мотивируют меня продолжать развитие в медиа и совершенствовать контент. Хочется, чтобы публикации помогали людям, мотивировали творить добрые дела, меняя окружающий мир в лучшую сторону.

Many stars of Russian journalism have emerged from our editorial office – for example, the winners of the Sigma Awards 2022 – journalists from ""IStories"". Following the war's onset, our data department relocated from Russia, now working in exile.

Annually, we publish over 50 data-driven pieces, resonating in Russia and internationally.

We pay special attention to fact-checking, visualisation and inventing important topics that were not described through the prism of data.

In the face of military censorship, we [utilise](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/11/01/vakhta-armiia-donbass) alternative sources like the Russian network Vkontakte to uncover unique insights, such as the identities of Russian volunteers in the conflict.

Many Russians support the war against Ukraine, and propaganda plays a key role in that.propaganda generates falsehoods and distorts the truth. Sometimes it seems that all we need to do to counter it is tell the truth. We analysed over three million articles by Russia’s main propaganda outlet RIA Novosti to understand how this system works.

A year after Russia's mobilisation, the impact of the Ukraine invasion profoundly affected Russian homes, with many soldiers returning in coffins. Families questioning their losses were silenced and offered compensation. This conflict has surpassed Russia's post-WWII military losses, reflecting the Kremlin's long-standing militarist ideology. The ""Mortal Regiment"" project documents the stories of 500 Russians killed in Ukraine, highlighting the grieving families deprived of their right to mourn. For this material we used language models to summarise the stories.

United Kingdom,Carbon Brief,Small,,,Carbon Brief,"Carbon Brief has spent more than a decade developing a style of data-driven reporting that aims to shine a light on complex topics related to climate change. We are a highly collaborative newsroom consisting of reporters, editors and multimedia specialists who work together to create in-depth explainers and investigations. 

With this work, we wanted to produce something that could serve as a vital resource for anyone trying to understand this complex topic. At the same time, we used data to tell new stories about carbon offsetting at a time of growing demand for transparency around this practice.","In 2023, Carbon Brief published a special week of coverage focusing on carbon offsetting – a controversial topic that has faced growing scrutiny in recent years. It allows a company or government that emits greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to pay for another entity to pollute less. To their detractors, offsets provide some of the world’s biggest fossil fuel interests with a “licence to pollute”. 

We wanted to explain the complex processes underpinning the carbon offset market and use data to reveal its many problems.

The series was topped with two significant data projects. First, an investigation into how the world’s largest companies with “net-zero” goals are using offsets to help achieve them. We used Sankey diagrams to show how purchasing offsets allows emissions cuts taking place in the global-south to “flow” into the balance sheets of large companies, often based in the global north. This allows fossil-fuel producers, carmakers and tech firms to claim they have “cancelled out” their emissions, based on trees planted or solar panels installed thousands of miles away.

Despite the prevalence of offsetting, it is surprisingly hard to find comprehensive data on how many offsets are being purchased by companies, and where they are sourcing them from. This is important because many offset projects are facing accusations of everything from human rights abuses to selling sham offsets. In general, publicly available transaction registries either provide no information about who has purchased the offsets, or provide incomplete information.

To overcome this, Carbon Brief’s Josh Gabbatiss adapted a methodology developed by a team of climate researchers in a recent academic study. He used data from an analysis firm combined with manually extracted information from company questionnaires to identify recent transactions. These were combined with publicly available registry data to build a database capturing who was buying offsets, in what quantities, and from where. The result was a detailed picture of the countries and projects that businesses have been relying on to make claims about carbon neutrality.

The second big data-driven project was an attempt to map where and how carbon offset projects are causing problems around the world. Over the past year, in particular, there has been a flurry of investigations into offset projects that harm Indigenous people, spark land disputes and overstate their emissions reductions. 

Carbon Brief’s Daisy Dunne and Yanine Quiroz drew together media reports and cases raised by campaigners around the world to provide a comprehensive overview of this problem. Together, they built a picture of systemic issues that are facing offset projects from Scotland to Colombia.

Our analysis was praised by the Global Investigative Journalism Network and highlighted by other media outlets including Bloomberg and the Times.

These features slotted into a series of content that also included an in-depth explainer on the topic, and an infographic explaining the complex process of buying and selling carbon offsets. To demonstrate the scale of the project, we have included all of the features in this application.",English,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/companies.html,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/mapped.html,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/infographic.html,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/timeline.html,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/glossary.html,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/carbon-offsets-2023/biodiversity.html,
Kenya,The Elephant.,Small,,,Nelly Madegwa,"I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for considering my application for the Journalism Award. My name is Nelly Madegwa, a dedicated freelance journalist with a passion for human interest and data-driven storytelling.
Over the past four years, I have contributed to renowned publications such as The Elephant, Open Democracy, The Star, African Women Journalism Project, and Taz Panter 
My journey in journalism has been marked by a commitment to uncovering the human data stories behind critical issues, such health, misinformation, food security and climate change.
In response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, I was part of health misinformation project, providing rapid and accurate response to the impact of the crisis on access to reliable information in Africa. Additionally, my work with the One Campaign Africa Data Project highlighted the effects of COVID-19 on African countries as the world slowly emerged from the pandemic.
I am proud to have received recognitions such as the ONE Campaign Africa Data Journalism Fellowship, the 2021 African Journalist Gender Equality Awards First Runners Up, and fellowships from Finance Uncovered, Thompson Reuters Foundation, CIFAR Illicit Financial Flows Investigative Journalism, and The taz Panter Foundation fellowship on Africa reconnecting .
I believe my unwavering dedication, diverse experiences, and passion for impactful journalism make me a deserving candidate for the Journalism Award. I am eager to contribute further to the field and appreciate your consideration.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Nelly Madegwa.
I was the author of the article, I also worked on the data analysis and had editorial support from the Africa Women Journalism Project.","The project looked into the food security with the current government lifting the ban on importation and open cultivation of genetically modified organisms and citing one of the reasons for lifting the ban to be the need to for new alternatives ways of farming that will ensure early maturity and more production of food to cushion Kenyans from famine. The articles looked into the concept of food security, analyzing available data to understand the state of food insecurity in the country and the contributing factors to it,the connection between GMO and food security and if and how GMO could contribute to food security and if it should be prioritized as a solution in kenya and other available solutions that we could be keen on by investigating key factors contributing to hunger and food insecurity .
Challenges included getting recent data on food security from relevant Kenyan agencies, they had varying data which I resolved from reaching out to the national drought authority to understand the variations and complimented it with data from the global security index.
The article was read by at least ten thousand people , I was invited to speak on the issue on twitter spaces and to social justice working group members who are working on right to food in Kenya by sensitising the communities on their role on holding the government accountable in ensuring it facilitates the achievement of the right to food for citizens, the articles in the project have been referenced in different conversations.",English,https://www.theelephant.info/analysis/2023/05/17/are-gmos-the-answer-to-kenyas-food-insecurity/,https://www.theelephant.info/analysis/2023/09/29/state-of-hunger-unravelling-kenyas-food-crisis/,,,,,,
United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,,,Sondre Ulvund Solstad,"The Sigma Awards seeks the best data journalism from around the world. Something one can only aspire to! 

I began my career as a data journalist in the special time of February of 2020. My very first article was on a new disease circulating in China, and for the next few years (excepting scattered articles on racism, climate change, democracy, algorithmic bias and war), it feels like I mostly wrote about covid-19. I did our in-house SEIR models in early 2020, estimated the true scale of infections that summer, made our death and hospitalisation risk tool the following winter. My story and estimate of ""the pandemic's true death toll"" was published in May of the following year - after which I was soon picked up as an advisor by the WHO and (briefly) the UN on how to model the pandemic. 

In the time since, I've expanded my focus. The past year, war has taken center stage. I've also, gradually, been able to spend more time helping, mentoring and recruiting data journalists. In the year to come, I believe climate change will be the main focus (in my professional life). 

I have the pleasure of great collaborators: I want to mention in particular Ainslie Johnstone, who collaborated with me on the latter half of the first article in this submission. 

Throughout my career as a data journalist, I've benefited from great mentors. I cannot name all of them here. Some ""mentors"" are collectives: the OSINT community, so important this year, for one. I try to give back in the ways time allows: sharing code openly, mentoring junior colleagues, and through talks and presentations for students and other journalists.","Sondre Solstad is The Economist’s Senior data journalist. Since starting at the paper in February 2020, Sondre’s work has been widely cited in other publications, including BBC World News, Le Monde, the New York Times, CNN, and many others.

Ever since the war in Ukraine began, Sondre started thinking of ways in which the fighting could be covered: no media organisation has the resources to station reporters in every neighbourhood of Ukraine, and none would if they could, given the lethal dangers involved, especially in Russia-occupied areas or near the front line.

Through a series of print and digital articles, video, and a live-updating tracker, Sondre pioneered new ways to track conflict around the world. In doing so, he created - and shared openly - something which, in the words of a former CIA section chief, “rivalled what governments had monopoly over not so long ago”. 

The Ukraine war tracker is a first-of-its-kind system to track and report fighting based on data from satellites. To create it, Sondre, among other things, developed a machine-learning algorithm to process data originally used to track forest fires in an entirely new way. This allowed him to automatically map the Ukraine war in real time.

Viewed by thousands every day, it may be the first publicly available tracker of conflict using satellite data. It is now used by academics in Germany, Italy, Norway and the United States. In addition to the live-updating article, this work has been the basis for a video viewed by hundreds of thousands and a series of follow-up articles which continue to the present day.

Beyond Ukraine, Sondre has covered the civil war in Sudan, drawing attention to its spread beyond Khartoum and Darfur, and used analysis of satellite images of air bases to assess Chinese intentions (or lack thereof) to imminently invade Taiwan. He has also used satellite data to track the rockets fired by Hamas on Israel and the IDFs response, and, as acting section editor, facilitated the first quantification of building damage in Gaza using radar, showing that nearly a hundred thousand had lost their homes. Beyond war, he has written data-led articles on topics ranging from grandparenthood to corruption.

In addition to reaching a wide audience, Sondre’s work has had crucial material impact. In Sudan, local refugee groups have used his maps of probable fighting to direct efforts to provide mental health aid to those fleeing or scarred by the conflict. Within days of publication of the Ukraine war article, he received an email from the UN Operations and Crisis Center, who wanted help to use it to improve their humanitarian response - and at least one British NGO in the country already uses his maps to direct aid.

For his work uncovering the pandemic’s true death toll, Sondre won the inaugural Future of Media Awards in the fall of 2022. Ultimately, Sondre wishes to use his skills to help his readers make better decisions by offering clear, rigorous data and analysis of the world we live in.",English,https://www.economist.com/interactive/briefing/2023/02/23/data-from-satellites-reveal-the-vast-extent-of-fighting-in-ukraine?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_r-zQx05Rfk,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/07/20/data-from-satellites-suggest-violence-has-surged-in-much-of-sudan?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2023/07/27/data-on-air-bases-suggest-a-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-may-not-be-imminent?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/07/12/a-new-study-finds-that-47000-russian-combatants-have-died-in-ukraine?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/11/23/deaths-in-gaza-surpass-14000-according-to-its-authorities?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2023/11/06/the-threat-of-hizbullah-can-be-seen-from-space?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/ukraine-fires?fsrc=core-app-economist

Belarus,Belarusian Investigative Center,Big,,,Alina Yanchur,"As a Belarusian Investigative Journalist specializing in Data Journalism, my journey has been shaped by a commitment to impactful stories revealing the truth. 
Armed with a master's degree in Investigative Journalism from Gothenburg University, Sweden, I gained valuable experience during an internship at Uppdrag granskning, SVT (Mission Investigate, Swedish Television). Contributions to Forbidden Stories' Mining Secrets project and an investigation into corruption at Securitas showcased my dedication to exposing complex issues. My pivotal role in the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) revealed how Grodno Azot circumvented sanctions, exposing the misrepresentation of urea fertilizers.
Beyond borders, I collaborated with an international team, investigating the financial beneficiaries of the migration crisis along the Belarus-EU borders, emphasizing a commitment to global issues. Recently, I contributed to the Cyprus Confidential project initiated by ICIJ and Paper Trail Media, exposing secrets of tax havens and revealing the offshore dealings and sanctions evasion of Anatoly Ternavkiy, linked to the Lukashenko regime.
Recognition followed with a shortlisting for the Swedish investigative journalism award Guldspaden 2022 for the EU artificial intelligence regulation lobbying investigation. Additionally, my data research on the denial of asylum to Belarusians in Europe for Euronews earned a longlisting for the One World Media Award in 2022.
Among my mentors I want to name my teacher from Gothenburg University Brigitte Alfter, my biggest teacher from SVT Joachim Dyfvermark and my current editor who believes in me Stat Ivashkevich. They all have played pivotal roles in shaping my journalistic path. 
My country Belarus is experiencing horrible repressions, and it needs good journalists. Considering me for this award acknowledges my contributions to investigative journalism, impactful collaborations, and dedication to addressing global issues. This recognition serves as inspiration to continue unveiling the truth, aiming to make a meaningful difference in the world, but first in my country.","Investigation 1: ""Silent Money""
As the principal creator of the ""Silent Money"" investigation, I unveiled the intricate financial maneuvers of Belarusian businessman Anatoly Ternavskiy, revealing his connections to the Lukashenko regime. The investigation exposed offshore deals and strategies to evade sanctions, notably thriving in oil dealings with the state-owned Belarusian Oil Company. Ternavskiy's businesses were implicated in constructing a school for Lukashenko's mistress, raising concerns about financial transparency and the enforcement of sanctions. The findings prompted a call for improved regulations to prevent abuse and evasion through offshore structures.
Investigation 2: Grodno Azot's Sanctions Evasion
In my role as the primary creator, I led the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC) investigation uncovering the sophisticated evasion of EU sanctions by Grodno Azot, a sanctioned Belarusian company. Despite being on the EU sanctions list, Grodno Azot allegedly misrepresented urea fertilizers as originating from Uzbekistan through intricate schemes involving straw companies. The investigation raised concerns about the efficacy of sanctions enforcement and called for stricter measures to curb circumvention.
Challenges Faced:
Both investigations encountered challenges due to limited resources and restrictions in Belarus. Interviews in Belarus were unfeasible, necessitating a focus on offshore dealings. The Ternavsky’s clever concealment of assets through proxies and family members demanded extensive efforts to establish his connection. Fear among sources in Belarus, stemming from our organization being labeled extremist, hindered information gathering. The oppressive political climate posed safety risks for our team, requiring innovative approaches to protect sources.
Impact and Metrics:
""Silent Money"" Investigation: The impact of ""Silent Money"" has been significant, with human rights organization Respect-Protect-Fulfill leveraging our findings to petition the US State Department and Treasury Department for sanctions. The investigation garnered a vast audience engagement of 335,000 on Belarusian Investigative Center platforms, with 249,488 coverage from reprints on third-party sites. Reputable media outlets, including OCCRP, Belsat, and Radio Svaboda, contributed to the widespread reach of the investigation. The report's republications, discussions on social media, and international coverage underscore its resonance and pivotal role in exposing financial malpractices.
Grodno Azot Investigation: The coverage of the Grodno Azot investigation on the Belarusian Investigation Center's platforms reached 249,075 views, with an additional 422,485 views from reprints on third-party sites. The investigation's impact was evident in Lithuanian media reports on tightened cargo inspections and calls for stricter sanctions on Belarus. This widespread coverage demonstrates the investigation's societal resonance and its contribution to shedding light on deceptive practices affecting international trade.
In conclusion, both investigations underscore the resilience and impact of investigative journalism in navigating challenges, revealing hidden truths, and prompting action on critical issues of financial transparency and sanctions enforcement.","English, Russian, Belarusian",https://investigatebel.org/en/investigations/okno-v-evropu-dlya-grodno-azota,https://investigatebel.org/ru/investigations/okno-v-evropu-dlya-grodno-azota,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKHrTQS5dn0,https://investigatebel.org/ru/investigations/kak-anatolij-ternavskij-izbezhal-sankcij,https://investigatebel.org/en/investigations/kak-anatolij-ternavskij-izbezhal-sankcij,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aTxSxQxDeY&amp;t=635s,,

Desde las listas de espera hasta la telemedicina, pasando por la situación de los profesionales sanitarios, la percepción general de la sanidad pública o el estado de la sanidad privada. La principal dificultad estuvo en la recopilación y selección de datos en un sistema autonómico como el español, con competencias transferidas en ámbitos como la Sanidad, lo que en la práctica supone que en la práctica hay 17 sistemas distintos.

Portugal,PÚBLICO,Big,,,PÚBLICO,"O ano de 2023 foi especial para os dados no PÚBLICO. Aquilo que era uma equipa de uma pessoa, passou a ser uma equipa de três pessoas: um editor e dois jornalistas. Esta expansão trouxe dores de crescimento. Houve a necessidade de uniformizar processos, equilibrar formação de pares com a produção jornalística e, acima de tudo, conseguir um balanço entre produção própria e trabalhar com outras secções do jornal.

Daí que peças jornalísticas como o “Contas à Vida”, que tentou dar rosto aos números da inflação que afecta o país, ou o “Como evoluiu o cabaz IVA zero nos últimos meses?”, que acompanhou o impacto da inflação no bolso dos consumidores portugueses. Estes são exemplos de um jornalismo que não perdeu proximidade com o digital - ganhou sim, mais uma ferramenta de contacto.

O ano de 2023 ficou marcado por recordes consecutivos de temperaturas, tanto no ar como nos oceanos. Esta nova e reforçada equipa não podia passar ao lado deste tema: criamos um bot que todos os dias recorre a informação de satélite para avaliar a temperatura da água na costa portuguesa e recorremos à personalização através de dados para mostrar ao público do PÚBLICO como o mundo tem mudado em termos de indicadores climáticos.

A atenção ao contexto económico e social a nível nacional e internacional também faz parte do que é o jornalismo de dados do PÚBLICO, contribuindo e colaborando com todas as secções do jornal para identificar as melhores histórias. O caso de simuladores “Veja em quanto pode reduzir a prestação da casa com fixação da taxa Euribor” ou trabalhos como “Faça o seu ranking” são um espelho desta prioridade de incorporar os dados nos grandes projectos e temas do PÚBLICO.","1 - Contas à vida: enfrentar a inflação

Brazil,Gênero e Número,Small,,,Schirlei Alves,"Sou Schirlei Alves e atuo com jornalismo investigativo orientado por dados e sob a perspectiva dos direitos humanos. Como repórter de dados na Gênero e Número, escrevo reportagens a partir de bases de dados e com o olhar de gênero e raça. 

Formada pela Universidade do Vale do Itajaí desde 2008, me especializei em Gestão Editorial, na Universidade Tuiuti do Paraná, e em jornalismo de dados, automação e storytelling, no Instituto de Ensino e Pesquisa Insper. 

Colaborei para o The Epoch Times, no Canadá, atuei como repórter nos principais jornais da região Sul e em veículos independentes. Recebi os prêmios ABC de Jornalismo, Unimed e RBS. Fui finalista do prêmio CNI e recebi menção honrosa no 5º Prêmio de Jornalismo-Mosca.

Um dos meus trabalhos de maior impacto foi a reportagem sobre o caso Mariana Ferrer, publicada no The Intercept Brasil, que revelou a violência praticada contra a vítima de estupro no curso do processo judicial. A reportagem motivou a aprovação da Lei Mariana Ferrer (Lei 14.245), que prevê punição para atos contra a dignidade de vítimas de violência sexual durante julgamentos e a implementação do protocolo para julgamento com perspectiva de gênero pelo Conselho Nacional de Justiça (CNJ). Por causa desta reportagem, tenho sofrido assédio judicial do promotor, juiz e advogado que atuaram no caso denunciado. 

Recentemente, atuei em um projeto do Google/Pinpoint, no jornal Folha de S. Paulo, no qual tornamos acessíveis coleções de documentos públicos e publicamos reportagens que envolvem denúncias de mau uso do dinheiro público. 

Como jornalista de dados no projeto CruzaGrafos, da Abraji e o Brasil.IO, participei, junto com o mentor Reinaldo Chaves, da equipe de JournalismAI, da London School of Economics and Political Science News Initiative, na qual trabalhamos em soluções inovadoras para melhorar o jornalismo por meio de inteligência artificial.","A série começou com uma reportagem que revelou que Roraima lidera o ranking nacional de taxa de fecundidade entre meninas de 10 a 14 anos. O trabalho também mostrou que mais da metade das meninas que tiveram bebês no estado são indígenas, enquanto povos originários representam 11% da população roraimense.

A reportagem revelou casos de violência sexual dentro de abrigos da Operação Acolhida, do governo federal, que recebe imigrantes venezuelanas que entram no Brasil por Roraima.

O levantamento de dados foi compartilhado por autoridades regionais, como a Mandata Coletiva Bancada Mulheres Amazônidas, em parceria com a Resistência Feminista do Pará. 

A reportagem inova ao analisar a taxa de fecundidade de meninas de 10 a 14 anos de idade, uma vez que essa taxa é comumente calculada apenas para mulheres com mais de 15 anos. Com isso, lança luz sobre o evento da maternidade entre crianças, que atinge populações específicas, mais vulneráveis. Particularmente, coloca em evidência a situação encontrada no estado de Roraima e o quanto ela destoa da tendência nacional, que é de queda na taxa de fecundidade em todas as regiões. 

A metodologia inovadora propõe um caminho para investigar estupros de vulneráveis e foi citado pelos jurados do Prêmio Livre.jor de Jornalismo-Mosca 2023 ao conceder às autoras menção honrosa na categoria Profissional.

O ineditismo dos dados levou ao financiamento de outras duas reportagens, a partir de recurso captado com o Instituto Patrícia Galvão, para custear o trabalho de campo em Roraima. Republicadas pelo UOL, o maior portal de notícias do Brasil, outras duas reportagens especiais completaram a série. 

A primeira, mostrou que, entre 2018 e 2021, para cada menina que teve acesso ao aborto legal, 31 deram à luz em Roraima. O levantamento inédito revelou que, no período, 251 crianças de 10 a 13 anos deram à luz no estado, enquanto oito interromperam a gestação de acordo com a lei, uma vez que qualquer conjunçao carnal com menores de 14 anos configura crime de estupro e a vítima tem direito a interromper a gestaçao decorrente dessa violência. 

A reportagem visitou o único hospital do estado que realiza abortos legais e conversou com profissionais da saúde que integram a equipe, que confessaram que dificultam o acesso a esse direito mesmo nos casos previstos por lei.

A segunda reportagem mostrou que imigrantes venezuelanas não têm acesso a informações sobre a legislação e o serviço de aborto legal. O levantamento de dados revelou que 15% dos abortos legais registrados em Roraima foram realizdos por venezuelanas.

United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,,,The Times Data Team,"The Times and The Sunday Times have more than four centuries' experience of putting newspapers together. Yet it was in 2023 that its data team – a collaboration of journalists, designers and developers – truly came of age. 

Our portfolio is just a small subset of the work that our team does every week; for several years now, the data team has played a starring role in the Times' treatment of the news.

Yet this year the challenges have changed, and the goalposts have shifted. If 2020 showed newsrooms the importance of data analysis, 2023 proved how essential verification techniques are to the modern newsroom. Our team has risen to the challenge, using data-led techniques to show the realities of living in very different parts of the world to our own.

Closer to home, however, our work has also become more reader-focused. At journalism school each of us had ""what's the story?"" drilled into us. Yet modern data journalism has become just as much about the reader. This year we pooled our resources into databases and postcode lookups, to great success. Our property price tracker, for example, turned a national story of house price slump into a local one. 

Thank you for considering our application.","Our portfolio is, we hope, a compelling advert for the kinds of stories that can be told through data-led techniques. 

We are The Times and The Sunday Times data team, a winning combination of data editors (Tom Calver and Ryan Watts), data journalists (Venetia Menzies, Rachel Lavin, Anna Lombardi, George Willoughby and Matilda Davies) and data developers (Michael Keith and Narottam Medhora), with help from our digital designers (Anthony Cappaert and Cecilia Tombesi).

Our best work of 2023 spans the two main poles of data journalism: finding stories and telling them. Once again The Times data team continues a proud tradition of breaking exclusive stories. Through using R to analyse unwieldy Home Office data, we found some parts of Britain where police forces were failing to solve crimes for months at a time, effectively giving up on low-level offences; our front page Sunday Times story showed the debilitating impact this has on victims of crime and faith in policing. Then in Ireland, our research proved that just 25 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, young Irish people are forgetting the conflicts while showing more radical Republican views.

But some of our strongest work last year was on the visual side. Our interactive face wall of the 200 Israeli hostages was one of our best-read and highest-engaged-with pieces of the year. We wanted to humanise each of the hostages and allow readers to explore their story, while also demonstrating the scale and sheer number of those captured. Yet doing so involved a huge amount of verification work by our journalists to ensure more than 200 storiies could be accurately told. Elsewhere, our project on Ukraine air strikes documented the destruction facing Ukrainians every day through a unique day-and-night visualisation. 

Once again, the data team was called upon to explain complex issues affecting modern Britain. When Conservative ministers claimed that raising the VAT on private school fees would force middle class parents to pull their children out, we used a series of devastating charts to prove that actually, most private school children aren't from middle income families after all: the vast majority are from the richest echelons of British society. 

Working across two newspapers with 400 years' collective history can have its challenges; in legacy newspapers attempting to break new ground in digital journalism, tradition can be a hindrance as well as a help. However, last year we produced some truly innovative, personalised content for our readers, overcoming many technical challenges in the process. Perhaps the best example is our house price tracker page, which took a national story - that house prices, when factoring in inflation, are no greater than they were in 2008 - and made it local. Readers were able to enter their postcode and get personalised charts on what was going on with house prices in their area. It was a great example of the maxim that data journalism is as much about the *reader* as it is about the story.",English,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/who-are-hamas-hostages-israel-gaza-gallery-nkjrxl6kc,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/uk-property-prices-tracker-qknt3d6fc,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/who-are-private-schools-really-for-in-modern-britain-these-charts-will-tell-you-hgh56m35c,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/young-irish-people-idolise-gerry-adams-ireland-the-troubles-3xcmjjw7g,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/crimes-with-no-charges-have-police-given-up-on-low-level-offences-l3hb2lxgz,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ukrainians-live-in-a-state-of-alert-as-the-battle-for-the-skies-rages-above-them-zwxxh9zbb,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-city-where-residents-put-out-13-bins-each-week-pt82pg5m2,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/harry-kane-breaks-england-goal-record-how-striker-reached-54-goals-r8wp5j36q

Russian Federation,Сибирь.Реалии (Siberia.Realities),Small,,,Егор Федоров (Yegor Fedorov); Сибирь.Реалии (Siberia.Realities),"На мой взгляд, мало кто из российских региональных авторов проводил подобные крупные дата-исследования в прошлом году, которые бы изучали не только локальный, но и федеральный уровень проблем.

Без анализа данных по всей России не удалось бы выделить особенности в некоторых регионах России. Например, где чаще всего в стране преследуют за оскорбления органов власти, или солдаты из какого региона Сибири дольше всех не появлялись на службе в период мобилизации на войну в Украине.

Расскажите нам о своем карьерном пути, как долго вы работаете в этой сфере, источниках вдохновения, идеях и наставниках.

Я занимаюсь дата-журналистикой на любительском уровне с 2021 года. Я не проходил какого-либо специального обучения журналистике данных, пытаюсь разобраться в профессии самостоятельно.

Моя область интереса: изучение данных судебной системы РФ, открытых баз данных органов власти и OSINT-поиск по социальным сетям.

По большей части меня вдохновляют работы коллег из российских медиа, а также материалы американского издания The Marshall Project — в будущем я бы хотел добиться такого же уровня качества сбор и анализа данных в своей работе.","Мое портфолио состоит из трех публикаций. Они созданы для регионального проекта Радио Свобода (Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty) Сибирь.Реалии (Siberia.Realities), который освещает события в регионах Сибири и Дальнего Востока.

Их объединяет тема войны в Украине и ее влияние на применение уголовного или административного законодательства против жителей России.

В первой истории я рассказываю о том, как изменилось число уголовных дел по статьям о сексуальных преступлениях против российских военнослужащих — в 2022 году в российские суды поступило максимальное количество за последние десять лет.

Во второй истории я изучил, как российских военнослужащих преследуют по статьям о преступлениях против военной службы: побег с фронта, отказ отправляться на войну, применение силы к начальству и другим статьям.

В третьей истории я узнал, как изменился уровень преследования россиян по административной статье о ""неуважении"" к власти с началом войны в Украине — в 2022 году в суды поступило рекордное число дел.

Так как Сибирь.Реалии — это региональный проект, освеющающий общественно-политические события в регионах России, в каждой истории я старался найти угол, который позволил бы обратить внимание местных жителей на проблемы федерального масштаба.

Для создания исследований я собирал и анализировал данные государственной судебной системы РФ, а также по возможности общался с фигурантами дел, чьи истории, на мой взгляд, лучше всего иллюстрировали новые тенденции в правоприменительной практике РФ.

Главной сложностью в процессе создания материалов были сбор и очистка данных. С каждым годом российская система становится более закрытой, а работа дата-журналистов усложняется (введение капчи, отключение сайтов в определенные периоды времени, блокировка доступа к сайтам из-за рубежа).

Somos uma instituição coletiva que defende a igualdade de gênero, o empoderamento e a representatividade das mulheres na sociedade em geral e especialmente no ambiente jornalístico.

Nosso objetivo é conscientizar a sociedade sobre esses assuntos, através da produção e divulgação em mídias de matérias, textos, artigos, reportagens de TV, entrevistas, fotografias.

Promovemos, desenvolvemos e apoiamos cursos, workshops, palestras, visando um intercâmbio de informações e experiências. Buscamos alcançar a minoria, apoiar, orientar e educar a população a consumir um jornalismo de qualidade, feito por mulheres que se apoiam nos valores da ética, transparência, sororidade, igualdade de gênero e responsabilidade social.

Nos diferenciamos ao produzir e mostrar conteúdos que não são vistos na mídia de massa, e principalmente, por estarmos em todas as regiões do país. Atualmente, o Instituto Mulheres Jornalistas atua em nível nacional e internacional, no Brasil e no mundo, trabalhando de forma ética e profissional, além de ser a instituição de jornalismo feito por mulheres mais premiada do país.","O maior desafio é ter uma equipe diversa e multicultural. O Instituto Mulheres Journalistas trabalha com todos os gêneros, apesar do nome ser Instituto Mulheres Journalistas, e todas as etnias, em todas as regiões do planeta, o que gera um impacto muito positivo na hora de produzir uma reportagem.

Kyrgyzstan,Peshcom,Small,,,"Peshcom (Alexey Juravlev, Altynai Nogoibaeva, Aigerim Ryskulbekova, Savia Hasanova)","The ""Peshcom"" team is proud to submit our portfolio of data driven stories, which has had a significant impact on the urban agenda of Bishkek city and beyond. Our approach to urban issues by using data analysis is quite unique for Kyrgyzstan — using data we can provide practical solutions, inspiring changes in the urban environment. 

""Peshcom"" is a small but mighty media and activist organization, which was established five years ago. Our goal is to give voices to citizens and protect their right to have a ""City for people"" by reporting on urban problems, analyzing data and offering solutions. 

It is very important for us that our conclusions have become a valuable source of information for local experts and members of the City Council. For instance, in 2020 we reported on suburban train services, which stopped their operation because of the pandemic. After our story was published, the local officials resumed the train services in Bishkek's suburbs. 

We are constantly striving for improvement, undergoing intensive data journalism training, trying to explore new data analysis and data visualizations tools. Apart from commonly used Datawrapper, Flourish and Google spreadsheets, we incorporate Python and QGIS to make our research even more profound and influential. Our efforts are inspired by industry leaders such as StrelkaMag, Texty.org and The Economist, and we take pride in making our unique contribution to this important field.

We believe we are worthy of this award because we make urban development issues and challenges clear and accessible, thus bringing the urban debate closer to the average citizens. We are not just influencing the improvement of life in Bishkek; we are shaping the future of urban data journalism in Central Asia.

[Confirmation letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14sneEJID0Xcl3jGbbA168z6tYt2yTLmF/view?usp=sharing)","During 2023 we published seven data-driven stories in total, out of which we are submitting four, which we consider the most important ones. 

Research on road traffic accidents in Kyrgyzstan focuses on analysis of traffic collisions, injuries and mortality. We reported on the scale of the problem, mapped the most dangerous intersections in the Bishkek city, and explained that attributing accidents solely to the ""human factor"" is false. We demonstrated that the numbers of road traffic accidents can be reduced through proper infrastructure reforms. Using solutions journalism methods, we highlighted the Vision Zero program, which is being successfully implemented in many countries.

After the story was published, the local NGO ""Road Safety"" used our analysis to promote infrastructure solutions among different stakeholders, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs of KR. Furthermore the story [was featured](https://gijn.org/stories/data-journalism-top-10-bangladesh-gaza-protests-china/) in the top 10 #DDJ selection by Global Investigative Journalism Network in November 2023.

Story about newly established residential areas, which are underdeveloped and remote, discusses problems faced by their residents. We were the first journalists to map the existing residential areas, digitized bus and trolleybus routes, built isochrones, visually demonstrating that residents lack access to safe and quality public transportation. Our analysis showed that even within the existing city limits, nearly one-sixth of the capital's residents face discrimination in access to water, gas, and transportation. The story resonated among other media and was quoted during a public meeting on SDGs' progress in Kyrgyzstan. 

While analyzing the streets' names of Bishkek for our third story, we conducted extensive and meticulous work, manually studying each of the 1600+ street names and categorizing them. Despite similar projects in other countries, we were the first to conduct such an analysis in Central Asia.

The relevance of this project is closely tied to decolonization, which is being widely discussed in Kyrgyzstan due to Russia's invasion in Ukraine. Our analysis revealed that Bishkek's street names are still closely connected to Russia and the Soviet past. Through this project, we also highlighted the gender gap in urban toponymy, crucial for advocating the representation of female names in the city.

To do the story on underground passages — special areas for pedestrians to cross the streets underground, which is very popular in Bishkek — we visited all of them to collect data on their condition. Inspired by the [methodology](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2019.pdf) of calculating the Global Competitiveness Index for infrastructure indicators, we came up with our own Quality Index of Underground passages. The article was done as a response to the municipality's desire to build new underground passages. Our story demonstrated that such a decision would discriminate against people with limited mobility in the city. In response to this story, city deputies promised to take it into account when making decisions and laws.

The impact is profound. Homelessness, previously a rarity, has become common. The health care system is under strain, with no clear path for building it up. House prices have soared above the capacity of people to pay for them.

Netherlands,NRC,Big,,,Rik Wassens &amp; Wouter van Loon,"We, Rik Wassens and Wouter van Loon, are data journalists at the Dutch national newspaper NRC. Rik published previously about Russian social media trolls and delved into the dark corners of the internet and the hosting business. Wouter was a political reporter and published extensively on the corona crisis. 

The nitrogen problem is one of the biggest crises in the recent history of the Netherlands. The government has a vital monopoly on information: it is the only organization that has enough information to make calculations in the crisis. Members of Parliament struggle with their information position since they do not have the same amount of information. 

We tried to open up that monopoly and test the justifications of the policies. We want to make them more transparent. We were the only individuals, outside the government, in the country which knew which farmers were so called 'peak polluters', which is the focus of government policy. It resulted in farmers calling us to find out whether they were also a target of the Dutch government’s buy-out program.

NRC is a leading newspaper in the Netherlands, with around 300.000 subscribers. The newspaper focuses on investigative journalism and has a Data Desk since 2022. This project was the first major project of the Data Desk. We have to thank Winny de Jong, the chef of the desk and data journalist herself, for her support, tips and coordinating skills. Without her help it would have been impossible to finish this project.","The Netherlands is facing a crisis: its extensive agricultural industry is emitting more nitrogen than its protected natural areas can process without environmental damage. In 2019, after decades of dilly-dallying, the highest Dutch administrative court issued a now infamous verdict, in essence halting additional nitrogen emissions until a significant reduction has materialized. The building of new roads or houses, desperately needed in an overheated real estate market, effectively ground to a stand-still that continues to this day. 

Since then, little progress has been made. Dutch farmers, fearing their livelihoods, took to the streets in their tractors in highly publicized protests. The minister's private residence was visited by protestors, and a completely new party (called the Farmers and Citizens Movement) scored a landslide victory in regional elections. 

Central to the Dutch government’s approach to tackle this ‘nitrogen crisis’ is a complicated computational model used to calculate nitrogen loads of single sources: farms, construction works and factories. The model, Aerius, is used to identify ‘peak polluters’, top candidates for a costly buy-out scheme. However, the government did not publish which farms would qualify. 

We, Rik Wassens and Wouter van Loon, are data journalists at the Dutch newspaper NRC and delved into the highly complex model behind the nitrogen policy. We learned how to make calculations ourselves. The model was complex and we spent hours in the evening to make it work, which succeeded with the help of leading experts in the field. Furthermore, we gleaned information on livestock counts, farm locations and emissions from purveying countless permits. 

Based upon this research, we published a series of articles. First, we identified so called peak polluters, for whom a buyout program is available. Together with our colleague Martin Kuiper called dozens of them, and we spent a lot of time gaining their trust. The investigation demonstrated that very few were actually interested in selling their farms, questioning the efficacy of government policy. And even if successful, the buy-out scheme will have very little impact on the overall nitrogen emissions, our investigation shows. 

We also took a deep dive in how the model functions. In a visual explainer, with help from our visual team, we showed how the model works: which factors are important, and how do the outcomes look like? 

In an elaborate article, we revealed every aspect of the model, and found flaws in all of them. The marges of error are huge, the underlying maps have mistakes and for policy makers it is sometimes impossible to rely on the model because of the updates that are implemented every year, and which can have huge consequences.","Dutch

Ukraine,Опендатабот / Opendatabot,Small,,,Опендатабот/ Opendatabot,"Вітаю шановне журі! 


Хочу познайомити вас із проєктом **Опендатамедіа** — медіа підрозділом сервіса для роботи з відкритими даними **Опендатабота**. Проєкт з 2016 року досліджує та знаходить тренди відкритих даних в Україні, створюючи на їх базі грунтовні розвідки та аналітичні дослідження. 

Від початку повномасштабної війни наша робота набула нових викликів. Сумніви в існуванні української держави та державності стали однією з формальних підстав для вторгнення рф в Україну. Саме тому протягом 2023 року команда Опендатабота працювала з відкритими даними, зокрема, державними, протидіяли ІПСО та створювала матеріали, які доводили: Україна та її народ, попри війну та темряву блекаутів, готові боротися за свою незалежність та розвивати державу. 

Це матеріали на основі big data, які показують реалії життя у розпалі конфлікту та надихають українців та світ. Водночас наші тексти популяризують сферу відкритих даних та показують, що важлива інформація доступна для перевірки кожному -- як про себе, так й про важливі теми, як-от корупція, державні закупівлі, податки тощо. 

Дякуємо за можливість поділитися своїми матеріалами. Впевнені, що цьогоріч на журі чекає багато цікавих проєктів та пишаємось можливістю стояти пліч-о-пліч з сильними та цікавими суперниками.

З повагою та сподіванням на зустріч,
Тетяна Демахіна, головна редакторка Опендатаботу.","Протягом 2023 року щомісяця медіа проєкт Опендатаботу сягав охоплення близько 1 млн переглядів на власних майданчиках та 200+ цитувань власних розвідок від топ-100 ЗМІ України.

Наші дослідження публікують медіа в Україні та світі, як-от NV, Forbes, BBC (Великобританія), Aikko (The Financial Time Group, Japan), The Wall Street Journal тощо. 

Матеріали Опендатаботу/Опендатамедіа покладено в основу дослідження єкономіки під час російсько-української війни у Гарварді — **The Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University (HURI)**. 

Ми об'єднували наші матеріали у певні серіали, адже вважаємо, що важливо досліджувати зміни системно та у динаміці. Деякі серіали розпочаті ще до повномасштабного вторгнення, інші ж з'явилися через початок великої війни. На розсуд журі представляємо, згідно з вимогами конкурсу, з цих серіалів саме тексти, які побачили світ у 2023.

1. Як українці донатять під час великої війни? Від початку повномасштабної війни українці створили певний феномен, конвертуючі біль після масованих обстрілів та блекаутів у свою підтримку ЗСУ та постраждалим. Наратив, що ""підтримка та віра українців у вигляді донатів згасає"", протягом року був однією з найулюбленіших тез ІПСО рф, проте аналітика даних доводить протилежне. 

Так, наприклад, на тлі підриву Каховської ГЕС та екологічною катастроою, що їй наслідувала, донати лише на одну з найбільших платформ United24 за червень 2023 перевищили суму пожертв за попередні 5 місяців та сягли рекордних 2,4 млрд гривень.

2. Релокація бізнесу: як бізнес адаптується до викликів роботи у країні, на частині територій якої ведуться бойові дії. Через напад росії значна кількість бізнесу втратила свої ресурси та була змушена шукати можливості релокуватися, аби продовжувати працювати, створювати робочі місця та сплачувати податки. 

Опендатабот досліджував, які компанії переїздять та які регіони України стають найбільш перспективними для бізнесу. https://opendatabot.ua/analytics/relocation-in-war-2

3. Жінки-підприємиці. Від початку повномасштабної війни значна частка чоловіків пішла боронити країну. У цей час українські жінки сміливо підхопили виклики воєнного часу та підтримували економіку, реалізуючись у бізнесі. За неповний 2023 рік українки відкрили 154 тисячі нових фопів та очолили понад 10 тисяч нових компаній. Гендерний баланс змістився — 56% нових справ відкривають саме жінки,

Tenho como inspiração a jornalista e escritora Eliane Brum, que de forma singela e emociante prova o poder do jornalismo humanizado. 
Acredito que sempre devemos buscar maneiras de transformar o mundo em um lugar melhor.","O projeto é uma série de reportagens sobre pessoas em situação de rua em Curitiba, capital do Paraná, no Brasil. Depois da pandemia foi observado um aumento no número de pessoas vulneráveis. Durante as buscas pelo tema, foi descoberto que não há na cidade nenhum censo que mostre a real situação dessa população. Outro ponto interessante é que cruzando dados do número de pessoas que buscaram abrigo com o número de crimes no centro de Curitiba, foi constatado que não houve nenhum aumento da violência, em comparação com os anos anteriores. Esse ponto foi fundamental, já que muitas pessoas apresentavam a crença de que o número de roubos na região havia aumentado por conta do maior número de pessoas em situação de rua.

Cameroon,"Crtv, Cam10 Tv, Galaxy Tv, Onu femmes, Kalack Fm, Data Cameroon",Small,,,Gender Data Journalists Network,"Crée en Mai 2018 avec l’appui du Programme « Women Count » d’ONU FEMMES et enregistré en Octobre 2019, le Gender Data Journalists Network (GDJN) est une association camerounaise qui regroupe plus de 140 journalistes et professionnels des médias travaillant sur les questions du genre, du traitement de l’information statistique sur le genre et sur le suivi des ODD.
Son objectif est de susciter, favoriser, et promouvoir la prise en compte du genre à travers la vulgarisation et l'utilisation des données dans la planification, le suivi et la mise en œuvre des projets de développement en Afrique. A travers son large éventail d’activité de formation des journalistes à la pratique du data journalism, le GDJN se positionne comme un acteur important dans la stratégie de mobilisation à l’utilisation des données par les journalistes.
A travers l'incitation aux médias à produire et diffuser des contenus s’appuyant sur les données en leur offrant la possibilité de renforcer les compétences de leurs personnelles, nous contribuons à créer une grande communauté de data journalism. A notre actif, plus de 200 journalistes formés qui produisent régulièrement malgré des difficultés liées à l’accès aux données, plus de 26 capsules vidéo thématiques et productions journalistiques s’appuyant sur des données ont été produites et diffusées dans plus de 22 médias au Cameroun. 
En six années, nous avons pu influencer notre espace médiatique et institutionnelle de tel sorte que notre réseau a pu se positionner au centre du système national Statistique avec qui nous travaillons afin d’améliorer l’accès et l’utilisation des données par les journalistes. 
Convaincu de ce que notre organisation fait partie de celles qui influencent la pratique du data Journalism en Afrique, l'opportunité que nous offre le prix 2024 du Sigma Awards de présenter nos travaux est donc une belle occasion de sensibiliser et inspirer d'autres journalistes et médias.","Le present portfolio presente les travaux du gender data journalists Network produits à l'occasion des journées mondiales en lien avec la santé et l’autonomisation des populations. 
En effet, fortes de sa multitude de membres issus d’une trentaine de médias (presse, télé et radio), notre organisation, spécialisée dans le traitement de l' information en lien avec les données sur le genre et le suivi des ODD est fière de proposer une large variété de contenus basée sur les données et permettant aux populations de mieux comprendre, analyser et apprecier les avancées de certains phénomènes et situations. Grâce à notre expertise dans ce domaine, nous sommes en mesure de produire du contenu de haute qualité, adapté aux besoins des médias classiques et ceux diffusant en ligne.
Cette année, notre portfolio présente des travaux qui se compose principalement de deux types de contenu :
1.Capsules vidéo : Nous produisons régulièrement ces contenus à partir des illustrations 2D et 3D qui rendent compte de l’évolution de certaines situations aussi bien sur le plan sociale, que économique. Jugé innovant par la plupart des utilisateurs, ce support vise à simplifier la présentation des notes de politiques, des rapports ainsi que tout autres documents d’orientations socioéconomiques afin d’informer au mieux les usagers et d' attirer l' attention des dirrigeants sur certains phénomènes. Cette ressource, facile à partager et contenant des informations sous forme de données inédites est également utilisé par les ONG, les OSC et les structures gouvernementales lors des formations et des sessions de présentations des projets. Pour l’année 2023, sept capsules ont été édités en français et en anglais. Elles portaient sur les thématiques du budget de l’état, la féminisation du VIH Sida au Cameroun, l’évolution du cancer du sein et les problèmes d’accès aux données de suivi des malades, les feminicides et les VBG (production largement diffusée par les ONG et les OSCs en raison de la récurrence des cas de féminicides au sein de la population).
2.Infographies 2D: Nous sommes conscients que les données peuvent être complexes et difficiles à comprendre pour certains. C'est pourquoi nous créons des infographies attrayantes et faciles à lire pour aider nos téléspectateurs et nos lecteurs à visualiser et à comprendre leurs données. Ces infographies sont conçues de manière professionnelle et peuvent être facilement intégrées dans des présentations, des rapports ou sur des sites web. C’est le cas avec la série d’infographie que nous avons conçue dans le cadre des campagnes médias initiées à l’occasion des 16 jours d’activismescontre les VBG et destinées à informer et sensibiliser les populations sur l’évolution des VBG au Cameroun. A cette occasion, nous avons conçu une série d’infographie en nous appuyant sur des données disponibles et collectées auprès des organisations spécialisées tel que l’INS, le BUCREP, les OSCs et les médias. Grace à notre travail largement repris sur la toile, nous avons pu interresé plusieurs personnes sur la réalité des faits.","Francais, Anglais, foufouldé",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O953KHA96G8p,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZhi0H-7yBY,https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.flourish.studio%2Fvisualisation%2F15861008%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR3jbVj1n7MzfPQlKYY-2_HXMz8w0PQLbuztxu92mrbwVDZ-vTZh4kwNoDI&amp;h=AT13UVNaWMVqexr31XF-YbvJ_ga3qYFP7V8XVvPA91WEWhF8CJvCT1sMTkWcjcYPdxaJ1acDwJNCAwKFvYvt2AzIDxFVBJngW2JHn0A1RU3BTk8l6N-lG_qOqztmCbdCtxmZ&amp;__tn__=H-R&amp;c[0]=AT0xdJL4H2ksnAgbjSDriHsX8zJUGNnAr_W5AYoHQ9N2Ct9PKbIdDGM6LStXTqC31rjYyvx2HBXJIMkdE7ZRW2gxfziR4RqTWY0q5yk9o9YaUKcseNv96dgvs32ctfpwjx_qvflmVjki-8RtVPvFFUS8-luShipwLEDhCz-IGc33TpssoI6ri5xZSRRBKmeQ4kdGypUqaCqbIQGjR64Z4n3UUOf6mJodoD1J,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DNe_Y9QmX-pFDiJaHr4rvOrtc-F-XI7v/view?usp=drivesdk,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DS4GdPPY7pmXoLxsXC_ruth-pre5kx3w/view?usp=drivesdk,,,
China,网易数读 NetEase Datablog,Small,,,网易数读 NetEase Datablog,"Founded in 2012, NetEase’s Datablog is one of the forerunners contributing to data journalism in China with dozens of millions of subscribers. With insightful stories and top-tier data visualisation, NetEase’s Datablog not only stands out among its peers, but is also one of the most recognized data journalism columns in China.

Over the past year, we have a wide coverage in social, economic, urban and educational issues. Presenting a high-quality and accurate data storytelling is our strength. While we believe that the form of presentation is only a tool, we are not limited to the plain articles and static infographics. We are seeking break through in video content.

NetEase’s Datablog has a standardized editorial procedure to ensure efficiency and quality, helping the content to develop a consistent tone. The team currently comprises two editors, a designer, and a front-end developer, each with well-defined roles and responsibilities.

As a small data journalism team, we are entering this competition to make an entry to this behonored award, we hope to learn from peers worldwide who contribute to data journalism and make better works together.","Today’s Chinese youth is a generation growing up with the Internet. Over the past year, our team has delved into the vast virtual environment to uncover the issues that resonate most profoundly with these young individuals, and the challenges they confront daily.

We present a collection of our most seminal works with a brief introduction, which helps you better understand our work.

In the work “Overwhelmed by Life, Youth Seek Hope in Temples,” we analyzed the trending phenomenon of young Chinese people fascinated by temples. It reflects the fact that young people who are studying for graduate school and civil service examinations are trying to relieve their anxiety in an insecure and highly internalized society.

Another article, “No Breaks, Elementary Students Make Friends in Toilet,” tells of primary school pupils who are not allowed to move around freely. While the school is concerned that the children might get injured while playing, this can lead to physical and psychological problems.

In addition to social issues, young people’s attitudes towards marriage have also been a focus in China in recent years. “Why Young People Shy Away from Relationships and Marriage” and “Why Chinese End Relationships with a Green Light for Civil Servants or Master Candidates” respectively explore the reasons why young people shy away from marriage or relationships – such as lack of time and energy. People are increasingly looking for family, education, and other conditions to be reciprocal in their marital relationships.

We also used questionnaires to explore Chinese young people’s funeral culture identity their willingness to save and their current savings situation. The findings are presented in the below two pieces.

“How Hard to Save Money for Young People” reveals the persistent insecurity of young people even though they have fought hard for their lives, trying to save money. And in “How Young Chinese Face Life and Death,” we find that young people do not face death in a hard way.",简体中文 - Simplified Chinese,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/G-M61SxUE2O_oZWrFC4fzA,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ZMJf33_OLMpM_CLwNSNlig,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/79J-PIVJWfhl_HB9a9hZOQ,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/r838rHUd4Tg4m3fMP6FRJA,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UVDIC6bR17RlEpfVXPt4Sw,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/NtjaOfhYmJiM50Iaf-jJFw,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/J-muyXGo8oOyuEXMHhuQpg,
Taiwan,天下雜誌,Small,,,天下雜誌 CommonWealth Magazine,"天下雜誌是台灣唯二有建立資料新聞跟數位敘事專業團隊的媒體。

2023年，我們的作品，集中在資料獨特視角、以及回答全台最嚴重的社會問題。也想在台灣、華文世界做一個示範，好的報導，不是只有傳統的文字跟影音，資料帶來的獨特視角、還有視覺衝擊，更能讓讀者理解和了解新聞表面下的另一面。","2023年，我們的作品的突破，集中在資料獨特視角、AI Chatgpt的嘗試，以及回答全台最嚴重的社會問題。

例如「台北升溫」報導，2023年全球暖化問題嚴重，我們率先在夏天之前，想做一個相關升溫報導。原先，我們以為可以透過跟研究學者合作，取得可視覺化的資料，但在資料清整過程中，才發現學者的資料出現錯誤，並需另外自行研究、計算，這過程就花費許多時間與內部討論。最後，我們自產的研究跟資料，除了從中找到台北升溫幅度遠遠高於全球平均、甚至排上全球第三，並透過採訪和資料堆疊，發現除了自然地形因素，還有建築因素。並透過微型動畫，呈現出城市裡的風廊概念。

還有從蘋果公佈的供應鏈名單，找出生產國家的變遷。表面上，中美貿易戰、中國新冠封城，加速蘋果「去中化」的腳步，製造地大搬風。但我們爬梳近 10 年蘋果供應商名單卻發現，中國企業的佔比不減反增，直接排擠美企、日企。

而2023出現AI風潮，我們也嘗試運用到相關資料庫的呈現中。《天下》有台灣歷史最悠久的企業財務大調查，也因此養出《天下》的旗艦資料庫「全台兩千大企業調查」。 《天下》數位敘事小組也運用 OpenAI 的大型語言模型（LLM）GPT-3.5-turbo，把公司這份重量級祖產加上「ChatGPT查詢」新功能，融合GPT的創意、跟實際財務數字，例如把台積電的財報變成一首歌。

最後，關於回應全台重大的社會議題，我們則有推出都市更新為什麼成為房地產的資本遊戲？還有透過資料，來說明台灣為什麼詐騙打不完？

先看台北房地產問題。台北是台灣「最老」的城市，從我們清整的獨家資料來看，全市有 72％建物屋齡高達 30 年以上。市容老化，但最該都更的地區，卻是都更案件最少的地方。為什麼？因為建商反而透過讓建物翻新的「都市更新」政策，競逐獲利，成為投資遊戲。


再看台灣詐騙問題。根據國際組織調查統計，台灣去年詐騙總財損超過2000億台幣，佔GDP約0.9%，全球排行第15，卻是已開發國家的第1名。《天下》跟台灣頂級的科研機構資策會合作，獨家取得3.6萬筆臉書詐騙廣告資料，揭開詐團如何跟隨新聞時事，編輯詐騙文字。

為了要凸顯詐騙集團如何緊跟時事，我們另外抓取google trend的熱門關鍵詞，跟臉書上的詐騙廣告對比，一比，發現詐騙集團的確善用時事，台灣檢調單位也透過我們的報導，把他們的查案流程因此再往前推。",中文,https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/urban-renewal-taipei/,https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/covid-airline-travel/,https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/taipei-heat/,https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/how-apples-supply-chain-evolves/index.html,https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/cyber-scams-and-taiwan/,https://www.cw.com.tw/graphics/cw2000database/chatgpt/,,
Finland,Helsingin Sanomat,Big,,,Data &amp; Design team from Helsingin Sanomat (HS.fi),"Helsingin Sanomat's Data &amp; Design has grown from a small-scale experiment with just a few people to a professional editorial team of about 25 members in 12 years. We are a Nordic pioneer in the field of data journalism and data visualization. In addition to creating individual standout articles, we have developed our own tools that enable the editorial team to produce impressive digital storytelling and graphics for their stories.

In recent years, we have come to understand more clearly that it is beneficial to divide the team's operation into three lines:

The news team ensures that the editorial team receives the best graphics and other visualizations for daily news, which are also featured on the front page.

The team responsible for visual features produces the most impressive, major articles. Many of the articles mentioned in this portfolio are the work of this group.

The product team is responsible for tools as part of the editorial team. It is crucial to maintain daily contact with the journalists making the stories. The product team has developed three key services for the editorial team: a tool for creating news graphics, a tool for producing visual special articles, and the voting aid application and election results service.

The next challenge is to bring generative AI into the everyday work of the editorial team, moving beyond just ceremonial speeches.","Data &amp; Design is the visual and data journalism unit of Helsingin Sanomat newspaper. We are team of visualists, developers, producers, and data journalists. We have three lines of work: visual news, visual feature articles, and products and tools. We operate within the editorial room, collaborating with every department.
In recent years, a key goal has been to introduce visual thinking at the very beginning of the ideation process. Many journalists are accustomed to thinking through text, but when ideated with a visualist, stories can take on a completely new life.

This portfolio's articles illustrate the breadth with which our team practices visual data journalism.

1.Voting aid application, Parliamentary Elections 2023
A service used by nearly a million Finns. The goal is to assist in making voting decisions and finding like-minded candidates. In 2023, we revamped the service. Key innovations included improved infographics and comparison tools for the user. Additionally, we created a new algorithm that calculates the most suitable candidate, taking into account the ideological dimensions of Finnish politics more effectively.

2.How Finland Voted in the Parliamentary Elections
Maps are a powerful storytelling tool. In this article, we used slightly unusual maps – cartograms or population-weighted maps. The story was published at a time when demand for such information is at its highest.

3.Personalized Stories are our team's specialty. This article addresses whether things were really cheaper in the past. Users can enter their current salary level and see what it could have bought in the past. The article attracted about 145,000 visits.

4.Another example of personalized stories is this article about music. The reader selects their year of birth and gets to hear the biggest hits in Finland from when they were 13-17 years old, the years when musical taste is formed. The article utilizes Spotify's API to source the music. Over 248,000 readers spent a considerable amount of time with this article.

5.This article compiled data on who signed the support cards for an openly fascist party. The story sparked a broad discussion on what kind of parties should be allowed to form in Finland. It had 210,000 readers.

6.Russia's attack on Ukraine is evident in many areas of life, one of which is fishing. This article shows that, despite sanctions, Russian fish still ends up on Finnish family dinner tables. The discussion about the origin of fish spread to Sweden and Denmark following our article. Major manufacturer Findus had to admit that it uses Russian fish in its fish sticks.

7.This story is something completely different. Since Russians cannot get the truth about the Ukraine war from their own media, we created a map and a room inside the popular Counter-Strike game that tells about Russian military operations in Ukraine. It had been downloaded 23,000 times before, apparently, the game company closed the view for Russian users.

8.We continuously acquire housing market data from a popular website that publishes housing ads. Based on this data, we produce articles monthly.",Finnish.

United States of America,Reuters,Big,,,Reuters Graphics Portfolio,"Reuters continues to tell important stories visually and through robust data. Our projects follow a narrative driven expressly by visual journalism. Regardless of subject matter or project size, data journalism remains a cornerstone of our storytelling.

**Making data understandable**
One of our missions is to make complex data easily digestible to tell stories. For example, our project explaining toxins released following earthquakes in Turkey combines data with clear explanations and animations to visualize the scale of destruction and rubble left behind.

**Innovation**
Reuters is continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of gathering information. We are constantly experimenting with striking ways to deliver stories too. Take our projects on deep-sea mining and rehabilitating Lahaina, for example, where we combine data with hand drawn illustration.

**Public service**
A Reuters data analysis, the first of its kind, revealed how human incursions into the world’s bat lands are laying tracks for the next pandemic. Reuters identified areas in 113 countries where conditions are ripe for such disasters. The analysis aims to anticipate and mitigate future risks.

**Breaking news coverage**
Data, deep reporting and powerful presentation create insightful explainers that give readers everything they need to know about an event. Our coverage of the Israel and Gaza conflict is a prime example. The consistent flow of data and maps have quantified everything from water shortages to global protests.

**Analyzing and contextualizing the news**
Beyond the real-time response to unfolding news, Reuters strives to produce timely stand back pieces that investigate the wider impacts or potential directions of a story. The team’s coverage of earthquakes in Turkey and wildfires in Hawaii are strong examples of this.

Our job is to tell stories, and to further understanding of the news. We believe data, design, and narrative need to connect with the reader to bridge this.","**Bat lands**
Reuters conducted an analysis to predict potential future global health pandemics by examining outbreaks of bat-borne viruses over the past 50 years. Focusing on conditions associated with these outbreaks, especially those related to human interactions with bats, such as spillover events, the analysis considered ecological factors like tree loss, precipitation, temperature, and land cover. By comparing the conditions of past spillovers with global annual ecological data, Reuters identified over 9 million sq km, covering 6% of the Earth's surface and inhabited by 1.8 billion people, as ""jump zones"" where bat-borne viruses may likely infect humans. The analysis aims to anticipate and mitigate future pandemic risks.

**The day the Earth moved**
Reuters visualised and explained how the ground in Turkey and Syria was torn open and dragged in different directions after the massive 7.8 magnitude quake and its aftershocks in February. This was some of the most detailed analysis published in the aftermath of the quake.

**Turkey's toxic dust**
Turkey’s deadliest quakes in modern times may have also unleashed a health catastrophe for generations to come. Asbestos, silica, mercury and lead are among thousands of toxins released by the earthquakes. Our investigative report on toxic dust illustrates the dangers and examines the government’s handling of the 200 million tons of quake rubble.

**Rehabilitating Lahaina**
Following the devastating wildfires in Hawaii, focus shifted to the rehabilitation of Lahaina town. Local and federal agencies were reckoning with the toxic chemicals and hazardous materials left behind when a built-up environment burns. We visualized and explained what happens during this delicate process. Our analysis of government building data revealed that the majority of buildings in Lahaina were built at a time when toxic materials were common.

**Deep-sea mining**
A vast treasure of critical minerals lies on the ocean floor. Should they be extracted to help fight climate change? The International Seabed Authority is working to set regulations for deep-sea mining as companies engaged in the clean energy transition clamor for more minerals. Reuters visualized how much of the metals are required to meet energy transition targets and illustrated how they can be extracted from the sea floor.

**The rise of anti-trans bills in the US**
142 bills to restrict gender-affirming healthcare for trans and gender-expansive people this year, nearly three times as many as last year. Four-fifths target gender-affirming care for trans children under 18, while the remainder target adults or anyone regardless of age. Reuters has reviewed the bills, taking stock of where they stand in the approval process, the treatments they seek to restrict and the penalties they would impose.

c'est un Site d'infomation générale mais consacré aux infos de sociétés dans les differents coins du Togo.",Small,,,AZIATO Kokou Midodzi,"Objet : Candidature au Prix Sigma pour le Journalisme

Madame, Monsieur,

C'est avec enthousiasme et passion que je soumets ma candidature au prestigieux Prix Sigma Awards. Fort de sept années d'expérience dans le domaine du journalisme, je suis convaincu que mon parcours professionnel et mon engagement indéfectible envers l'intégrité journalistique font de moi un candidat idéal pour recevoir cette distinction honorifique.

Durant ma carrière, j'ai eu le privilège de travailler au sein de divers médias, où j'ai cherché à repousser les limites de l'investigation et de la narration. Mon engagement envers le journalisme de qualité s'est manifesté à travers une série d'articles qui ont non seulement informé le public, mais ont également suscité des réflexions approfondies sur des questions cruciales de notre société.

En tant que journaliste, j'ai acquis une expertise particulière dans la couverture des affaires politiques, sociales et culturelles. Mon approche méticuleuse de la recherche et ma capacité à décortiquer des sujets complexes m'ont permis de fournir des analyses approfondies et éclairantes. Mes reportages ont souvent été salués pour leur objectivité, leur rigueur et leur capacité à mettre en lumière des problématiques souvent négligées.

Cordialement,
AZIATO Kokou Midodzi","Mon premier projet est intitulé ""Mendicité dans les rues : un système d’exploitation des enfants se développe à Lomé"". Il évoque comment les enfants sont associés à la mendicité au Togo par leur parents. Pendant que bon nombre de ces enfants sont dans les salles de classe, eux ils sont sur les routes, dans les carrefour sous le soleil demandant de quoi se survivre. C'est en effet une ""exploitation d'enfant"" qui ne dit pas son nom puisque habituelement, les parent de ses enfants restent à l'ombre et envoient les petits sur les route aller ramener de l'argent pendant qu'eux ils prennent de l'aire frais sous l'arbre. Et donc à travers ce projet nous avons exposé le probleme pour que les gouvernant arrêtent cette manoeuvre. 



Le second projet est intitulé ""[Dossier]VIH SIDA : la peur retarde les chiffres attendus'

Il parle en effet des raisons qui font que malgré les efforts des organisations, et gouvernants, on enrégistre encore des cas de VIH SIDA dans nos pays surtout au Togo. Entretemps considéré comme la plus dangereuse et mortelle des maladies, le VIH SIDA est de plus en plus banalisé au Togo. alors qu'uns petite enquête dans les structures de prise en charge nous a montré que les chiffres grimpent malgré que le virus ne tue plus, des personnes le contratent toujours sur la minorité sexuelle (LGBT+). Et donc le projet à proposé des manières à adopter pour ne pas être infecté du virus.

Uruguay,Montevideo Portal,Small,,,Federico Pereira - Montevideo Portal,"It was a long job of processing and segmenting the data, followed by the concern for the landing and contextualization of that information, linking it with the historical process of the fall of Pluna, which at the time was one of the most important topics of the political and judicial sphere of the country. It is a report that also serves as a compilation to review the history and present of the Uruguayan aeronautical market, which allows us to identify some challenges that the country faces in this matter.

It was led and supervised by Paula Barquet, editor-in-chief of Montevideo Portal and journalist with more than 16 years of experience in the main media in Uruguay. The editors were Gonzalo Charquero — who started working in 2010 at Últimas Noticias and then worked at El Observador, El País, Bloomberg Línea and Montevideo Portal — and Federico Pereira — who started in 2018 at Radio Universal and then worked at El Observador and Montevideo Portal.

The report was based on the observation of how air connectivity was in the post-pandemic and how hit the Uruguayan market seemed in relation to the years before the arrival of the covid. Then, this impact was related to the one suffered in 2012 with the fall of Pluna and there the focus of the report was defined.","The journalistic special sought to make an analysis of the state of the Uruguayan airline market, to answer how much it was affected by the two most important blows to the sector: the covid-19 pandemic and the bankruptcy of Pluna, the historic Uruguayan flag airline.
It reviews the evolution of Uruguayan air traffic, since the last years of Pluna; shows which airlines fly and which stopped flying to Montevideo; and lists the direct routes that connect Carrasco Airport with the world and how frequently, to try to answer if it managed to be the regional hub that the country projected more than a decade ago.

It is made up of five articles. The first is titled: “Eleven years without Pluna: what has connectivity been like in Uruguay without a flag airline?”. The second reviews which airlines passed through the Carrasco Airport and stopped transiting to Uruguay.

Another piece is based on the government's commitment to supporting the airport infrastructure, with concessions and investments by a company in the airports in the interior of the country, and the authorization for the free import of jet fuel. The fourth note, titled “the VIP niche of private flights and a hotel holding company to hire charters”, seeks to delve into the market of the country's main tourist destination, Punta del Este.

The report closes with an article that talks about the 76 years of the First Uruguayan Air Navigation Lines (Pluna), in addition to collecting the history of the lesser-known national competitors that the airline had.

The team was made up of Gonzalo Charquero and Federico Pereira, with editing by Paula Barquet, editor in charge of Montevideo Portal. Data processing and analysis was carried out, to then study what trends they showed and what notes could be constructed based on them, and then conduct interviews that complemented the information.

The main challenge layed not only in obtaining and verifying the data, but also in the processing and searching for cohesion of the annual numbers, given that different state documents contained information that contradicted each other at various points or showed numerical differences on the same data, depending on the source. There were also challenges in how to construct the report in an attractive way, to bring readers closer to a topic that is off the agenda and not so attractive to the general public.

United States of America,"The Texas Tribune, ProPublica",Big,,,"The Texas Tribune, ProPublica","Our team was involved in the most important stories published by the Tribune last year. As editor of the team, I’m constantly juggling requests because we get so many of them. Reporters see the value in collaborating with us, and the impact it can make on their stories.

We are also a very small team, with only two full-time developers, plus Dan Keemahill who works with the jointly funded ProPublica-Texas Tribune investigative team. Yet despite our size, we were able to publish an incredible amount of in-depth, visually-impressive work in 2023 that was read by hundreds of thousands of readers.

We also covered a lot of different topics last year, largely because our team is small. You can see everybody helped report on a range of beats, including the budget, climate change, politics, education and much more. It’s difficult to cover so many different subjects but everybody does it routinely.

The range of skills on the team is also quite high. Everybody is a developer by trade and worked in several different newsrooms before joining the Tribune. They all have the ability to process hundreds of thousands of rows worth of data, which was required for the heat and Paxton’s influence stories, for instance. Additionally, they all have strong visual skills as well, which is an incredible combination that leads to really clean, groundbreaking work.

We are constantly inspired by the work of our peers and love sharing our favorite stories with each other. When we do this, we talk about what we like and what we could duplicate in Texas. We hope we’re also an inspiration for other data teams.

For these reasons, I think we should be considered for this award. While the team is small, we were a huge resource for all Texans last year.","The Texas Tribune’s data visuals team was responsible for a wide range of innovative work in 2023. The data journalists on my team collaborated with reporters and editors across the newsroom to tell important stories that impacted everyday Texans. Here’s some of our best work.

In recent years, Texas has seen record-breaking revenue growth, which has caused the state to amass a $32 billion budget surplus. We wanted to put that number into context for readers. Developer Yuriko Schumacher brainstormed ideas, gathered stats and narrowed down the questions. The final product included information on several complex topics, which took time to understand.

In the summer, we published an in-depth data story on the long-term impacts of climate change in Texas. After months of research, Schumacher decided to focus on showing temperatures over time, which is where we found the most substantial trends. It was challenging to decide which data to show, since all temperature data shows Texas is substantially warmer than before. But we decided to focus on the increase in record-breaking high temperatures because it’s a trend that scientists point to as particularly alarming. Also in the summer, our fellow Susie Webb collaborated closely with photo fellow Joe Timmerman on a story examining declining bat populations in Texas, which included a visit to a local cave to talk with experts.
In the fall, the team focused on the unprecedented impeachment of Attorney General Ken Paxton. As our newsroom’s campaign finance expert, senior developer Carla Astudillo was able to dig into expenditure data to show who was backing Paxton as he rose to prominence in Texas. This dataset was quite large as more than 30,000 people have donated to Paxton since 2002. In addition, Yuriko spent months putting together two ambitious visual explainers meant to help readers who wanted to know more about how the Paxton trial was going to operate. We decided we wanted to get the interactive components of the story into the CMS, which required a lot of hacking to get all the pieces working properly. 

The team also spent time in the fall covering education issues, including Dan Keemahill’s story that examined several charter networks that were allowed by the state to expand despite underperforming. The biggest hurdle was reconciling the data we received from the state with the data they posted online, which often didn’t match. This took months of analysis to figure out.

We ended the year off with another really strong story from Carla, looking at the lack of hate crime data being reported by police departments in the state. One of the biggest obstacles was determining if municipalities were participating in the federal hate crimes program or not, which caused confusion in the data. The final story includes several charts, including a lookup tool that readers can use to see if hate crimes are being reported in municipalities near them.",English,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/13/texas-budget-surplus/,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/06/27/texas-climate-change-heat/,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/08/14/texas-bats-white-nose-disease-wind-climate/,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/24/ken-paxton-impeachment-dunn-wilks/,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/09/01/ken-paxton-impeachment-witnesses-parties/,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/10/06/texas-education-vouchers-funding-special-session/,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/10/10/texas-mike-morath-underperforming-charter-schools-expand/,https://www.texastribune.org/2023/12/14/texas-hate-crimes-data/
Ukraine,"Редакція програми ""Схеми"", що є частиною української редакції Радіо Свобода (Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty)",Big,,,"Кирило Овсяний, програма ""Схеми"" (Радіо Свобода)","Я працюю журналістом 6 років. Останні три - у редакції журналістів розслідувачів з програми ""Схеми"" (Радіо Свобода) під керівництвом шеф-редакторки Наталки Седлецької та редакторки Кіри Толстякової. Хоча мене завжди цікавила робота саме над розслідуваннями корупції, з початком повномасштабного вторгнення я знайшов покликання і у роботі у сфері розслідувань, тісно пов'язанах з дата-журналістикою: бази даних, супутникові знімки, OSINT. 

Наразі мене, як і багатьох українців надихає боротьба України проти неспровокованого повномастабного вторгнення Росії на територію нашої держави, невід'ємну частину якої займають Збройні сили України. Тому розслідування та публікації журналістів, які зокрема висвітлюють цю боротьбу або змінюють хід подій всередині або зовні країни, на мою думку можуть заслуговувати на відзнаку.

З міжнародних нагород за час повномасштабного вторгнення мої роботи встигла відзначити компанія Planet Labs, яка звернула увагу на нашу роботу з супутниковими знімками під час розслідувань воєнних злочинів у Маріуполі.

У портфоліо тісно пов'язаних однією тематикою робіт, які були зроблені мною, як журналістом редакції програми ""Схеми"" (Радіо Свобода) у співавторстві з редакторкою Кірою Толстяковою, ми висвітлюємо не тільки злочені, які вчинила людина з величезним політичним впливом на державному рівні і статками, які дозволили їй придбати нерухомість і навіть острів у Європі, а й те як саме Україна відреагувала на ці злочини, як європейська країна.","Після початку повномасштабного вторгнення Росії в Україну 24 лютого 2022 року багато журналістів-розслідувачів перемикнулось з розслідувань корупційних схем на розслідування воєнних злочинів та злочинів, які призвели до почтаку повномасштабної війни, зокрема до яких причетні й впливові українські політики та топ-посадовці. У портфоліо з росзлідувань, які я подаю на цей конкурс, корупція та державна зрада з боку одного з найвпливовіших бізнесменів, політиків та українських олігархів - В'ячеслава Богуслаєва - переплилися разом.

На основі аналізу голосів всіх учасників розмов з ексочільником великого українського авіабудівного підприємства АТ “Мотор Січ” В’ячеславом Богуслаєвим, супутникових знімків Planet Labs, аналізу імпортно-експортних операцій, ексклюзивних документів з внутрішнього документообігу АТ ""Мотор Січ"" та роботи з українськими і російськими базами даних журналісти ""Схем"" зробили серію розслідувань, які показали роль Богуслаєва в оборудках і його вплив на обороноздатність України.

В розслідуваннях викриваються факти, які свідчили про тісні зв’язки Богуслаєва з військовою верхівкою РФ та операції по передачі їм деталей для гелікоптерів через Китай попри повномасштабну війну в Україні, а також протидію Богуслаєва українським військовим, яким той відмовлявся надавати гелікоптер. Викривається наявність російського паспорта у Богуслаєва, попри те, що протягом довгих років він зокрема був народним депутатом України і мав доступ до державної таємниці, а також його нерухомість у Москві та країнах Європи.

Крім цього окремим розслідуванням було викриття фактів співпраці В'ячеслава Богуслаєва з оборонними підприємствами Ірану, які крім літаків з українськими деталями від ""Мотор Січ"" займаються виготовленням бойових дронів типу ""Shahed"", що наразі використовуються армією Росії проти України.

Після виходу розслідувань «Схем» Богуслаєв залишається під вартою. Крім обвинувачень у державній зраді, Богуслаєву також було оголошено підозри і в інших злочинах, зокрема, про які було розказано у розслідуваннях «Схем». Внаслідок оприлюднення інформації про його прохання про обмін до РФ, це питання отримало широкий резонанс і хвилю обговорень. Наразі обмін Богуслаєва не відбувся.

Працівників АТ «Мотор Січ», пов’язаних з Богуслаєвим більше ніж робочими відносинами, було звільнено з підприємства, а контроль над ним взяло Міністерство оборони України.

Гелікоптери, які Богуслаєв ховав від українських військових, таки були передані в Збройні сили України.

Спроби постачання авіаційних двигунів для військових гелікоптерів до Росії з боку АТ «Мотор Січ» припинились.

Були викриті у лобізмі народні депутати України.

Лобістка Богуслаєва Наталія Ульяненко була звільнена з посади позаштатного радника Головнокомандувача Валерія Залужного.

Два відео цих розслідувань разом набрали майже 2 мільйони переглядів на YouTube.

Brazil,InfoAmazonia and Mongabay,Small,,,Fábio Bispo,"The four reports we are presenting show originality in their approach to environmental and human rights crimes in the Brazilian Amazon. They also show how investigative journalism can make an impact based on public data or data produced by reliable organizations, which leaves no doubt about the events being reported. The four pieces submitted here have been republished by other journalistic companies and have motivated authorities and organizations to denounce the cases covered.

With a career of just over 10 years - I've been a journalist since 2010 - this is the first time I've felt confident putting my data journalism work to the test of a jury, mainly because I believe that this work has made a significant impact and that it can help authorities, scholars and other sectors to make decisions based on well-documented evidence. 

I began my career as a journalist for a daily print newspaper, and over the years I have dedicated myself to deepening my reporting with a focus on investigative journalism, public transparency and human rights. Over the last five years I have dedicated myself to studying data journalism and, in particular, working with geospatial data. I even started a postgraduate course in data science, I was the only journalist in the class, and now I'm doing a specific postgraduate course in data journalism, which until then didn't exist in Brazil.


I couldn't fail to mention the encouragement I received from fellow journalists Gustavo Faleiros, who encouraged me to dive deep into the bowels of the Amazon to exhaust all possibilities in these investigations; Juliana Mori, my editor, who showed patience and resilience with each new discovery, both in data analysis and fieldwork, and Thays Lavor, my data mentor, who helped make the workflow more transparent and systematic.","Hello, I'm presenting four original pieces of work that I produced over the course of 2023 for InfoAmazonia, which required extensive data collection and fieldwork involving environmental crimes in the Brazilian Amazon. 

The first article shows that the French group Casino Guichard-Perrachon continued to buy meat from animals raised on Brazilian indigenous lands to supply its stores, even after a complaint was filed with the French courts under the so-called Vigilance Law. This law obliges large companies based in the country to ensure that ""both their subsidiaries and subcontractors"" do not cause ""serious violations against human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of people and the environment"". We analyzed around 500,000 cattle movements in the supply chain of two JBS slaughterhouses, which supply meat to Casino supermarkets, and were able to identify that meat from animals raised on illegal farms within the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous Land ended up on the shelves of the chain's supermarkets. This work required extensive data analysis to identify that there was a triangulation of illegal farms that sent the animals to legal farms outside the indigenous land to mask their origin. Faced with the report's evidence, JBS confirmed the existence of the illegalities and said that it had removed identified suppliers from its supplier base, something quite rare, since the company has repeatedly denied buying cattle raised on indigenous land.

The second paper I'm presenting (in Portuguese) follows in the same vein, but now we've analyzed land cover data in the Amazon to show how forest areas within indigenous lands have been converted into pastures for cattle ranching. We were also able to identify some of the cattle ranchers on these pastures and show how they traded animals with large meatpackers.

In the third paper in this series of analyses of the Brazilian Amazon (in Portuguese), we mapped the fires and burned areas and found that in 10 years more than 62 million hectares (Mha) were burned, an area equivalent to the size of France (55.1 million ha) and Ireland (7 million ha) combined. In addition to the damage to the environment, burning leaves more than 15 million Amazonians (63% of the population) exposed to air pollution above the maximum levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

The latest work, published in English and Portuguese, shows how a company appropriated the indigenous territory of the Apurinã people and started selling the areas as NFTs with the promise of preserving the Amazon. In this work, we created a python script to scrape the geographical coordinates of the NFTs to show that they are in the areas of use of the indigenous, who never knew that the areas were being sold on the internet, in addition to extensive fieldwork where we sailed for several days until we managed to find the indigenous people.

As a reporter, I carried out data collection and interviews, highlighting the methods and bases for the reports. In the Portuguese publications, there is a ""Transparency"" page detailing methods, codes and sources.",English and Portuguguese,https://infoamazonia.org/en/2023/06/29/despite-lawsuit-casino-group-still-sells-beef-from-an-amazonian-indigenous-land/,https://infoamazonia.org/2023/05/04/expansao-de-pastagens-em-terras-indigenas-triplica-em-4-anos-e-ameaca-povos-isolados-da-amazonia/,https://infoamazonia.org/2023/08/23/em-dez-anos-fogo-na-amazonia-consumiu-area-maior-que-a-franca/,https://infoamazonia.org/en/2023/11/09/company-sells-indigenous-land-in-amazonas-as-nfts-without-communitys-knowledge/,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17LGjFyoeVtTc5sxiocKI6PcFRlWobJ2CYggQ-7nl0NU/edit#gid=0,,,
Sweden,"Newsworthy (Jens Finnäs, Leo Wallentin, Martin Olsson)",Small,,,Newsworthy,"Newsworthy is a news agency that turns data into local news stories in Sweden. We collect statistics and data and write articles tailored to the community level. We serve primarily small and medium-sized editorial teams lacking the resources to engage in data journalism themselves.
2023 was a breakthrough year in many ways. We significantly increased our number of paying subscribers. By the end of the year, over 50 local editorial offices were subscribing to our service, and we were credited in over 2500 published articles.

What makes us unique as a news agency is our ability to produce local articles for every municipality. We are particularly proud to support many of the country's smallest editorial teams with local quality journalism.

We rely heavily on automation to produce articles cost-effectively for editorial teams with very tight budgets. Our news feed is a mix of ad hoc publications, where we conduct thorough independent research, and automated monitoring that delivers news when, for example, electricity prices or temperatures hit record highs.

The examples we list showcase thematic diversity and methodological innovation. We routinely work with data analysis and processing in Python and R, as well as GIS analysis in tools like QGIS. To write local texts, we have developed our own NLG engine for template-based texts - a necessity when working in a global minority language like Swedish.","# 1. Emission Rights Yield Billion Revenues

The cost of carbon emissions is higher than ever. For Swedish companies, this means both expenses and revenues of hundreds of millions of euros. In collaboration with Sveriges Natur, we mapped the winners and losers in the emissions rights trade.
We combined historical statistics on the Swedish industries' surplus and deficit of emission rights with price data on the same. In Sweden, the increased price of emission rights has mainly resulted in profits for heavy-emitting industries.
In local articles, we highlighted the facilities that earned the most regionally.

# 2. Wildlife Accidents Occur on Unprotected Roads - But Do Fences Help?

The number of traffic accidents involving wildlife has sharply increased in Sweden. Building wildlife fences is a commonly requested measure. But does it work?
We calculated the proportion of wildlife accidents that occur on protected and unprotected road sections for each municipality. We also produced maps showing the most accident-prone areas.

# 3. The Extensive 'På spåret' Database
Our most cited news in 2023 was a unique, alternative database project. Sweden's most popular TV quiz show is 'På spåret,' where participants guess travel destinations through clever clues. We built a database of all Swedish locations featured in the show's 30-year history. In local articles published nationwide, we revealed which places are favored by the program's creators and which are never featured. A huge talking point!

# 4. The Chance of a White Christmas in a Changing Climate
With climate changes, the number of snowy days in Sweden is significantly decreasing. What will be the likelihood of having a white Christmas by 2050?

France,ARTE,Big,,,Alexandra Jousset pour CAPA PRESSE,"What's the point of telling the world's hidden stories if nobody believes you anymore? As soon as a statement is made in a film, a thesis defended by a substantiated investigation, they are immediately tainted with the seal of falsehood; filmmakers who carried out the inquiry, immediately accused of truncating or manipulating the truth.

The crisis of confidence between the media and the public is deep and long-lasting. Only one in two French people trusts what they find in media.

Yet truth is at the heart of our profession. The 1971 Munich Convention, which lays down the ethical rules to be followed by journalists, states as its first principle: ""Respect the truth, whatever the consequences for oneself, because of the public's right to know the truth”.

Modestly, Sources aims to reconcile Europeans with the work of journalists.

The stakes are high: with the advent of AI and the ascendancy of influencers, how can we convince people?

Why apply for the Sigma awards? As a filmmaker, I've been investigating on the world for over 15 years. During my last film on the Russian Wagner militia, I met OSINT activists who helped us push our investigation further; I discovered revolutionary tools capable of transforming journalists into news forensic experts worthy of TV series. It's these same tools and this dramatic tension that I wanted to highlight in Sources. This collection inaugurates a new way of telling the world's story, because we've entered a new world: a connected world, where the Internet is now truly global. Thanks to open data, we can investigate everywhere. A world where information, produced by everyone from the most anonymous individual to the most recognized institution, is both a challenge and an opportunity for journalists. It offers us an unprecedented opportunity to explore new territories of information.","Sources is an audacious collection of entirely digital investigations. With a strong and original visual identity, Sources goes against the classic codes of investigation (black, dark) to underline another particularity of this collection: the use of data accessible to all. Actually, investigations are carried out mainly using open-source data, a new territory for investigation. Using social networks, freely accessible Internet databases, satellite imagery or even boat or aircraft tracking tools, Osint (Open Source Intelligence) is reclaiming an Internet too often exploited for misleading purposes.

Sources is a two-level story. On the one hand, the subject of the investigation (environmental scandal, conflict, human rights violation...). On the other, the story of the author's approach, the means employed, the sources and tools used. The viewer - but above all, the citizen - is taken on board by the author in his quest to solve the questions and issues raised by his investigation.

Sources is a collection of documentaries I am producing. My goal was to assemble a team of young, talented directors. As a producer I am here to give impetus to the subjects, help them construct the narrative and push them in their investigations. The teams is made of 4 people: Poline Tchoubar speaks fluent Russian and Ukrainian, masters tracking tools and is also a teacher of open-source investigative techniques; Valentin Petit has long worked on interloped subjects, immersing himself in parallel worlds and is very good at in coding; Maeva Poulet specializes in migration and environmental issues; she is also an Osint teacher and masterminds the satellites images; and finally, Manon Bachelot has long experience in investigating human rights issues. 

This team has had to overcome many challenges: being able to infiltrate chinese social networks from abroad; creating fake profiles and companies on the social networks; mapping all the different facilities where ukrainian children are held in Russia; facing the threat of a lawsuit by Danone etc; But the most important one has been telling about their methods to the audience, without giving up on their sources. Simultaneously, when one of our investigations is published, we post next to it our methodology. In this text, step by step, the directors explain their discoveries, show the reports they have based their conclusions on and justify the words they use and the discoveries they unveil to the public. This presentation requires a great deal of extra work on everyone's part. It also raises questions among viewers, but above all, it brings many positive comments and has been widely appreciated. The idea is to restore the trust between the viewers and the journalists. 

The documentary collection published on Arte's French and German Youtube channels, as well as on their platform, has totalled over 3.8 million views. 

It's been such a success that Arte has decided to broadcast future episodes on a monthly basis from March 2024.",Français,https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/113682-001-A/sources/,https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/113682-002-A/sources/,https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/113682-003-A/sources/,https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/113682-004-A/sources/,https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/113682-005-A/sources/,https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/113682-006-A/sources/,,
United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,,,Steven Bernard,"I am traditionally trained as a scientific illustrator, which gave me my artistic grounding, an eye for detail and the understanding of how to convey information in an unambiguous way. These skills I found were very transferable into the field of visual journalism.

Over my nearly 3 decades as a visual journalist at the Financial Times, my role has changed immeasurably. I have always been motivated by a strong desire to be constantly improving, whether it is diving into R, learning 3D skills in Blender or animation techniques in After Effects. Constantly pushing myself and experimenting enables me to approach projects from a different angle. 

Climate change has been on the news agenda for decades, much longer than my 27 years at the FT. But it is only in the past 5-10 years that it has become a key focus within our organisation.

I first worked on climate and environment stories in 2018, mainly dealing with the topic of pollution. This introduced me to the plethora of climate and atmospheric data that was available on Nasa, Noaa and Copernicus databases and the brilliant work of Joshua Stevens, esteemed lead data visualiser/cartographer at Nasa’s Earth Observatory. But it wasn't until the Climate Graphic of the Week was started in October 2020 and the subsequent launch of the Climate Capital hub that I really immersed myself in the subject.

Having a role to play in highlighting the key climate concerns through visual journalism has been the most rewarding aspect of my job in recent years.","Climate Graphic of the Week charts the global impact of climate change, covering its environmental, economic and human impact using sophisticated data analysis and visualisation techniques to consistently deliver powerful, insightful and concise stories that matter.

Since its launch in October 2020, visual journalists Steven Bernard and Chris Campbell have produced graphics that pull the latest environmental monitoring data from NASA, EU satellites and other real-time sources - often during extreme climate events. Their pieces have been so authoritative at conveying important information on climate change that secondary school teachers have regularly used them as part of the curriculum on climate change.

The Climate Graphic of the Week has been so successful that an accompanying newsletter -- The Climate Graphic: Explained was launched in July 2022 offering insight into how the visual journalists analysed the data and the design decisions that were made when producing the visualisations.",English,https://on.ft.com/3U1TR91,https://on.ft.com/48Yhe7Z,https://on.ft.com/48TklxY,https://on.ft.com/3tMx7iX,https://on.ft.com/3TWP3C1,https://on.ft.com/3tN3wWC,https://on.ft.com/48PIKUQ,https://on.ft.com/3vwFrnc

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,,,The Guardian Data Projects team,"If we had to define the Guardian Data Projects team with two words, we would choose “aggressively collaborative”. The three-person team works with all desks across the newsroom to combine our leading-edge data skills with the expertise of subject-area specialist reporters, visual journalists and technical departments to reveal unique stories that impact people’s lives. 

Our collaborative nature allows us to put together the best of every world. We work closely with the Graphic and Visuals desk to create strong visual and interactive pieces and to explore creative storytelling techniques to better serve our audience. We also work closely with newsroom developers to find innovative solutions to data gathering and analysis problems, even exploring a responsible use of AI. And we also collaborate with reporters from all desks across the newsroom to offer more impactful and meaningful stories.

This collaboration is also essential for another core tenet of the Guardian data projects team: being “ideas driven” and “story first”. Public interest journalism is our main focus, and the collaboration with correspondents and specialists is an essential source for us to be able to develop ideas with larger impacts on society.

A third core part of data journalism at the Guardian is our rigorous methodology. We have high standards when it comes to data analysis – often working with academics and subject matter experts to ensure accuracy and take our analysis and data collection to the next level.

These principles have been an essential part of the Guardian Data Projects team for years, but despite its long tradition, the current data projects team is relatively new. Having been reestablished in 2022 with two journalists and the appointment of a new editor, we are committed to keeping the Guardian’s tradition of high standards, impactful stories, and creative communication.","**[Private equity funds behind nurseries](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/04/childcare-sector-england-not-playground-private-equity-experts-say)**

This months-long investigation unpicked the complex company structure of childcare providers, showing the stark increase in private equity ownership, which could leave thousands of nurseries at the risk of closure.

The story – using data, investigative skills and AI techniques – was strengthened by collaborating with reporters, developers and designers to produce the most comprehensive analysis on the topic to date.

United States of America,Reuters,Big,,,Earthquakes in Turkey,"This coverage centers on the pivotal role of data. Through a combination of detailed graphics, interactive maps, and explanatory text, the narrative effectively conveys various facets, ranging from the seismic threat and historical earthquake patterns to the perilous release of toxins into the atmosphere. Visual elements significantly enhance audience comprehension across many dimensions of the story.

In the ""rupture"" segment, we visualized land movement, presenting a very detailed picture of how the earth actually moved in Southern Turkey, in a way that hadn't been seen from other news organisations. The ""Joining the dots"" map amalgamated three data sets on population density, fault rupture, and shaking, unveiling the precise alignment of impacted towns along fault lines. Subsequent data exploration delved into settlement reasons, incorporating factors like land fertility and water access. Additional data analysis revealed that the majority of people within 20km of the fault line lived less than 2km away, experiencing intense shaking.

While much had been reported on aftershocks post-quakes, our ""10,000 tremors"" piece employed granular data to extrapolate intriguing trends and aftershock dynamics over time. The case study of Antakya contrasts distribution pre and post the main quake. The aftershock anxiety diagram provides readers with insights into the disruptive nature of tremors during nighttime and over a 24-hour period.

""Turkey's toxic dust"" integrates on-the-ground investigative reporting with intricate data sets on rubble and building damage, detailed illustration, and satellite imagery analysis. This piece stands out as the most impactful story on the subject. Leveraging 3D modeling and sophisticated WebGL rendering, we brought extensive data sets to life in unprecedented ways, captivating readers with unique visualizations.","A series of data driven visually led stories on the aftermath of the earthquakes in Turkey, the efforts at recovery and the hazards of cleanup.

Two massive earthquakes struck southern Turkey and northwest Syria in early February, killing more than 54,000 people in one of the worst natural disasters of the century. Just hours apart, the quakes flattened cities and towns across the region.

Reuters published a series of in-depth reports in the days and weeks following the quakes.

After the breaking news of destruction, the focus quickly shifted to search and rescue operations. We showed how teams on the ground comb through debris for survivors. This is a methodical process, often conducted jointly by local emergency management authorities and international teams. We explained how the work is carried out in a way that maximises the number of lives saved.

We also visualised and explained exactly how the ground in Turkey and northern Syria was torn open and dragged in different directions after the massive 7.8 magnitude quake and its aftershocks on Feb. 6. This was some of the most detailed analysis published in the aftermath of the quake.

The team later documented and analysed more than 10,000 aftershocks that struck southern Turkey in the weeks after the main quakes. We were able to extract patterns and explain the dynamics of these smaller tremors and what to expect from earthquakes of this size. The piece also examines the frequency and timing of aftershocks and how this impacts the local populations psychologically.

Turkey’s deadliest quakes in modern times may have also unleashed a health catastrophe for generations to come. Asbestos, silica, mercury and lead are among thousands of toxins released by the huge earthquakes. Our investigative report on toxic dust illustrates the dangers and examines the government’s handling of the 200 million tons of quake rubble.",English,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TURKEY-QUAKE/TOXINS/znvnbmyrzvl/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TURKEY-QUAKE/AFTERSHOCKS/dwpkdzklevm/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TURKEY-QUAKE/SEARCH/klpygdjoapg/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TURKEY-QUAKE/RUPTURE/gdpzqdzwwvw/,,,,
Malaysia,Newsgraphy,Small,,,Dexter Chan,"I’m an award-winning Malaysian journalist since 2015, ranging from broadcast to digital platforms. My works appeared in national broadcasters of both countries, i.e. Radio &amp; Televisyen Malaysia (RTM) and Mediacorp.

My commitment in journalism has been acknowledged with multiple awards, both within newsrooms and international level. Notably, I received the Chinese Language Journalism Award for Overseas Media in 2021.

In response to the challenges of sensationalism and mis/disinformation in Malaysia's digital news landscape, I drew inspirations from foreign media like Reuters and The Straits Times. Their fusion of data, visualisations, and storytelling to create impactful narratives became a catalyst for my journey to produce data-driven stories that will educate, engage and enrich the readers.

After being selected to join CUNY’s Entrepreneurial Journalism Creators Program (EJCP), I founded Newsgraphy (图懂天下) in 2023 as the first Mandarin data journalism startup in Malaysia. It aims to unlock the potential of data insights which might be overlooked by mainstream media, thus helping readers to understand stories beyond numbers that matter, through simple and memorable visualisations, supported with credible evidence and good narratives.

To date, I’ve curated over 20 data stories in Newsgraphy. It might be a surprise to learn that Newsgraphy is currently a one-person business. From data mining to visualisation, copywriting to design, website to social media, I handle every aspect of the operation.

Over the past year, I have taken initiatives to develop diverse skills, including data journalism, infographic design, website development, and coding scrollytelling visualisations.

Given my commitment to journalistic excellence, innovative approach to storytelling, and dedication to advancing data journalism in Malaysia, I humbly plead to be considered for the Young Talent Prize.","**I would like to apply for Young Talent Prize**

All of the portfolio stories here are done by myself - from data mining to visualisation, copywriting to design, website to social media.

1. From Blanket to Targeted Subsidies:
Malaysia is moving towards targeted subsidies from the current blanket subsidies, in order to benefit only those who are eligible. This story reviews how much subsidies has given out in Malaysia over the past decade and why did the government have to revamp the subsidy policy.

2. Annual Selections of Malaysia Chinese Characters:
Since 2011, Malaysians have been invited to choose a Chinese Character that summarises and reflects the events of the year in Malaysia. This interactive story analyse 69 Chinese characters which had been chosen and shortlisted over the past 13 years, as well as the context behind those selections.

3. Eating Out ""Addiction""?:
A Minister claimed that Malaysia households are “addicted” in eating out and takeaway, resulting in the depletion of their tight disposable income. As his comment sparked debate in the country, this story looks at households’ spending trends on eating out over the years.

4. How much do Graduates Earn in Malaysia?:
Around 1.68 million graduates in Malaysia are facing skill-related underemployment, working in low-paid or low-skilled jobs that usually not requiring a degree or diploma. This story shows how much do graduates earn in recent years - from multiple perspectives such as states, gender and urban/rural.

5. Six States Elections: Gains and Losses:
This story uses interactive graphics to show the number of seats which have been gained or lost by the political parties, as welll as millions of absent voters who could affect the outcome.

6. Anwar's First Cabinet Reshuffle:
This interactive piece depicts the changes in Malaysia cabinet made by Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim - his first reshuffle since taking office. Besides looking at changes in terms of political parties and gender, the story also compares Anwar’s leadership team size with former prime ministers.

**Overall Challenge:** In a news ecosystem that is generally plagued by sensationalism and mis/disinformation, how to bring credible and relevant data to daily life? Newsgraphy prioritises on data-driven topics that resonate with readers, such as cost of living, salary and wages, elections, national budgets etc. It fills in an information gap by putting a data journalism perspective - something that is not frequently practiced in Malaysia.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,,,elDiario.es data team,"elDiario.es is a digital news site which has become a major reference in current affairs for a new generation of Spanish readers, and also a pioneer in high quality content and innovative business model worldwide.

Since its inception, elDiario.es has opted for data journalism as a way to create quality content for subscribers and also to reach new audiences in Spain. Since 2015, our data team has always been a small data unit with at least two journalists who have based their work on constant collaboration with the entire newsroom. In 2023, the data journalism team was formed by 3 team members.

This year, our small team (3 members) had to face more than 15 local, regional and general elections in Spain during the year, looking for stories for the run-up to elections, preparing and coding live results for election night and a detailed analysis of election results. 

Meanwhile we were working and publishing big investigations and visual stories about climate change, social inequalities, access to justice, mobility, health, biased perceptions and urbanism. Precisely, our work philosophy, focused on unveiling inequalities and publishing impact stories, has always been to visualize and explain things in the simplest way to the reader and collaborate with all the journalists in the newsroom to search stories and do better, accessible and understandable data journalism.

elDiario.es was launched in the middle of the financial crisis in 2012 with no big investors or corporates backing it – just a bunch of journalists and their savings – and it has developed a community-based journalism model reaching mainstream audiences with scarce resources. The key business innovation is the ‘membership program’ – more than 75.000 people (“socios”) already give financial support to elDiario.es in order to strengthen our editorial and economic independence.","In 2023, elDiario.es data team, formed by Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres and Ainhoa Díez (with Ana Ordaz till mid-year), delivered a comprehensive coverage spotlighting key societal issues. From elections to climate change, social inequalities to justice access, our team navigated the journalistic Spanish landscape with impactful investigations.

A significant part of our efforts were dedicated to cover over 15 local, regional and general elections. We published several stories in their run-up explaining how the electoral system benefits major parties, highlighting disparities of participation between rich and poor neighborhoods or exposing majors inflating census figures in small towns before election.

We also prepared and coded all live results maps and charts for all election nights, resulting in more than 40 pieces live updated during the year. The biggest challenge of the election-coverage was to inform our readers the results of a multi-party proportional representation system with only three journalists. We employed not only basic charts and maps but also cartograms, an automated contested seats tracker (link3), live granular data to profile voters and region-specific live results pages. 

This coverage wasn’t limited only to following the results as a public service role. We conducted in-depth analyses, such as using block-by-block voting data to reveal how right-wing votes skyrocketed in the wealthiest 5% (link4).

While election coverage and the inflation crisis conditioned our daily workflow, it did not prevent us from publishing in-depth investigations and visual reports. For example, our journalistic project ""Spain at Flood Risk"" (link1) meticulously cross-referenced flood risk zones with the footprints of more than 12 million buildings across the country, revealing that at least one million of Spanish homes face threat of river or sea flooding, with potential escalation due to climate change.

Our commitment to expose inequalities is present in projects like “The Wheel of Inequality” (link2), a journalistic investigation that exposes the intricate mechanisms perpetuating cycles of inequality in Spain that systematically limits the opportunities of families born in impoverished neighborhoods.

Precisely, investigating inequalities is our main journalistic objective. For example, shedding light on the stark inequalities faced by women seeking protection from gender-based violence (link6), where we uncover, with data from 500 specialized courts handling violence against women cases, that the likelihood of a judge granting protection varies dramatically based on the complaint location. 

We also made innovative experiments to play with reader’s preconceived notions. We published an interactive calculator (link5) that allows thousands of readers to discover their place on Spain’s salary scale and we analyzed reader responses.

Kenya,Citizen TV,Big,,,"Sam Gituku - Citizen TV, Kenya","Sam Gituku is a broadcast journalist who uses his training and experiences to tell technical but important stories in an easily understandable manner. He has done this since 2012 when he was hired as a Radio Correspondent for Radio Citizen, Kenya based in Machakos County.

For over nine years now (since November 2014), Sam has been working with Citizen TV as a reporter, host and interviewer. In his recent role as a television host, Sam has brought on board what he considers his most valuable skill - **data analysis** to the trade. Every Monday and Tuesday mornings, Sam appears on Day Break show, Citizen TV - the biggest channel in the East African region - with the latest in the field of politics, economy and current affairs. He speaks to policy formulators and implementers on various issues of public concern. Most of these are in the areas of governance, legislation, development and politics. 

Sam also hosts “Tonight”, the Citizen TV primetime show on Thursday 9.00 pm. During the show he showcases “**Data Point”**, a data driven segment that goes in-depth into the numbers ranging from economy, public finance, education, health and other socio-economic sectors. 

Sam believes that a society can be better led if its members have a wide understanding of public affairs. That citizens can better hold their leaders accountable if they know the facts about their situation. Guided by this, Sam strives to dig deep into the numbers and from time to time hold leaders to account on their actions.

Sam received his education at Moi University (BSc. Information Science) and a Masters Degree, Communication Studies - University of Nairobi. He is alsoa trained accountant - CPA(III). He has recently completed an Executive Masters in Media Leadership and Innovation (EMMLI) at the Aga Khan University.","Since the return to multiparty politics in Kenya, competing political formations have always used the Kenyan public stage to sell their manifestos with varying sets of information. This has been especially so since the coming to effect of the current Kenyan Constitution (2010). 

Consistently, political formations have parochial way of looking at facts and figures from economy, education, public finance and governance. 

It is for this reason that Data Point came to effect in May 2023. This is a weekly segment produced by **Sam Gituku** who also hosts the Thursday night prime time show - ""Tonight"" on Citizen TV (Since May 2023).

Data Point goes in-depth into the facts, figures and statistics surrounding important public concerns. Between May and December 2023, More than 25 Data Point segments were produced and presented every week, each garnering outstanding reception from viewers of Citizen TV and thousands of audiences on the social media platforms of the organisation - X, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube.

Some of the Data Point segments were on the state of the Kenyan economy, Kenyan Public Debt, trends in petroleum prices in Kenya, Expenditure patterns in the Kenyan national government and the 47 county governments; The Tax bill (Finance Bill) of 2023 and more.

Sam Gituku produces the segment throughout the research, collation of data and preparation of text for graphical slides. Citizen TV's Graphics design section prepares the slides for studio presentation.

One of the biggest challenges in producing Data Point is how to visualise complex numbers to a mass audience. To overcome this, The team is constantly seeking new ways to present the data in a simplified manner matched with the anchor's simplified and relatable explanation. Other challenges in preparing data point are the large volumes of documents to peruse in search for credible data and discomfort amongst the political class including flak from mentioned institutions.

To overcome these challenges, Sam has to project probable topics of study in advance and begin collating data. To ensure credibility of data and thus withstand flak when it comes, Data Point conducts multiple verification before publishing and where there is no sufficient data, projects are pushed forward until sufficient input has been found.

Citizen TV is the most watched FTA channel in Kenya with a daily viewership of 12.3 million. Data Point taps into this viewership during the prime time hour of 9.00 pm. It is complemented by organic consumption on the social media platforms that also generates immense viewer feedback.

Since the inception of Data Point, various stakeholders are embracing data backed explanations of news especially journalists. Show discussants are now alert when speaking on statistics on various shows hosted by Sam Gituku and other hosts on Citizen TV. Data Point has become an important cog in the fact-checking role of Citizen TV.",English,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc-8cRcA_cQ&amp;t=60s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7T0y0k_uNw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJNiCFQdZaE&amp;t=47s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hYuQ0WvWfo&amp;t=310s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yk_lGovMcro&amp;t=192s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmUWYCZ2oJY&amp;t=39s,https://twitter.com/i/status/1702445262696767615,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvg0cWURRTM&amp;list=PLLT21ES-Oho6FBtaMMOJ6OF1yz7XPpGrx
Ukraine,"Center for Collaborative Investigative Journalism, EU NEIGHBOURS east, Tagesspiegel",Big,,,Olga Konsevych,"Born and raised in Kyiv, my journey as a reporter has been characterized by a commitment to independent media and a deep involvement in fostering dialogue within the Eastern Partnership region.

In my pursuit of a career in journalism, I have accumulated valuable experience through my work on various news projects in Ukraine. Since 2012, I have been dedicated to the development of independent media in my home country. My academic journey includes the completion of a Ph.D., where I specialized in Ukraine-EU relations and civil society development. This academic background has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics that shape the region.

Notably, my role as the editor-in-chief at Ukraine's leading media outlet, 24 Channel, provided me with the opportunity to lead a large editorial board comprising more than 100 employees. In this capacity, I was entrusted with the responsibility of shaping the digital strategy and formats, contributing to the growth and influence of the media outlet.

The unforeseen challenges posed by Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine prompted a reassessment of the significance of my profession and mission. Following my evacuation to Germany and the subsequent reduction of the media market in Ukraine, Tagesspiegel extended an opportunity for me to continue my journalistic endeavors. 

In 2023. the Center for Collaborative Investigative Journalism introduced me to the world of data journalism, marking the beginning of my engagement with a professional data team. The project I spearheaded, 'Boundless Hate in Germany,' showcased my commitment to investigative reporting and data-driven narratives.

My exposure to data journalism has ignited a passion for collaborative projects, and I am eager to further explore this field. The Sigma Awards, renowned for celebrating excellence in data journalism, presents an exciting opportunity for me to contribute my skills and insights to the global conversation.","1. The 'Boundless Hate in Germany' project is part of research on hate speech in diaspora and refugee communities conducted by the Center for Collaborative Investigative Journalism. My main achievement so far has been providing an investigative perspective on the problem, utilizing data gathered from various stakeholders, ranging from public prosecutors in Germany to major platforms responsible for the demonization of refugees, such as Google, Telegram, and TikTok. The project will continue in 2024, with a focus on specific geographies: South Sudanese diaspora populations inciting ethnically-motivated violence, and Ukrainian and Russian diaspora populations posting hate speech around the current conflict. However, this project is part of a larger investigative series aimed at addressing cross-border and cross-jurisdictional patterns of hate speech and disinformation dissemination.

2. The 'Civil Society Challenges in Eastern Partnership Countries' project for EU NEIGHBOURS east has been my focus since 2022. I contribute primarily through solutions-oriented and explanatory journalism, addressing digital safety issues and writing articles on women's rights and civil society development. Notably, my opening article from this series was published even in countries such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, where women's rights and gender equality are in transition.

3. The 'Ukraine' series of articles for Tagesspiegel delves into the human rights situation of people in the occupied territories of Ukraine, with a particular focus on investigative journalism and the field of security. Among my main tasks are covering Russia's war against Ukraine, verifying information, and advising sources and contacts. A significant achievement of mine includes the shutdown of the Ruptly website, a Russian state media subsidiary of RT, following a collaborative publication within the investigative team.","English, German",https://veza.news/article/2023/11/22/boundless-hate-in-germany-why-its-difficult-to-stop-hate-speech-across-borders/,https://euneighbourseast.eu/news/stories/how-to-act-and-move-on-strategies-for-women-facing-discrimination-and-online-harassment/,https://www.tagesspiegel.de/autoren/olga-konsevych,,,,,
Poland,Belarusian Investigative Center (https://investigatebel.org/en),Small,,,Sviatlana Yatskova,"**Why I am a Suitable Candidate for this Award**

As a dedicated journalist from the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC), I have spent time honing my skills in investigative journalism. My career path has been driven by a deep-seated passion for uncovering the truth and bringing transparency to complex issues.

My work, particularly the investigative pieces on Alexander Shackutin's evasion of sanctions, has had significant impact, leading to policy changes at the international level. These articles are a testament to my commitment to rigorous research, meticulous fact-checking, and fearless reporting.

I draw inspiration from the belief that journalism plays a crucial role in holding power to account. My ideas stem from a desire to shed light on the mechanisms that allow individuals and corporations to exploit loopholes for personal gain. I have been fortunate to have mentors who have guided me in navigating the challenges of this field.

As the primary creator of my work, I can confirm that the portfolio I am submitting is a result of my individual efforts. I understand the importance of authenticity in journalism and ensure that my work maintains the highest standards of integrity.

I believe that my dedication, proven track record, and the impact of my work make me a strong contender for this award. I am committed to continuing my journey in investigative journalism, striving for truth, transparency, and accountability.","**Applicant:** Investigative Journalist from the Belarusian Investigative Center (BIC)

**Project 1: Bulldozing through sanctions. How Alexander Shackutin, owner of Amkodor, earns money despite embargo**

This investigative piece uncovers how Alexander Shackutin, owner of Amkodor, profits despite sanctions. The article reveals how Amkodor, a Belarusian company, is expanding into the Russian market under the guise of import phase-out, relying heavily on parts imported from other countries. The investigation suggests that the company uses prohibited components in Russia and represents the end product as produced in Belarus, a claim denied by both Shackutin and the producers of the banned components.

**Role:** Primary Investigator and Writer

**Impact:** This investigation has shed light on potential sanction violations, contributing to public discourse on the subject.

**Project 2: Shakutsin vs Sanctions Manufacturers left Belarus and Russia market, but the equipment remains**

This second investigation delves deeper into how Alexander Shakutin profits despite and thanks to sanctions. It explores how spare parts produced by Western companies end up in the workshops of Amkodor, and how businesses can profit by changing ownership schemes while keeping the business within the family. 

**Role:** Primary Investigator and Writer

**Impact:** Following the publication of this article, the U.S. imposed sanctions against Shakutin, using phrasing from the investigation. Shakutin, already sanctioned by numerous U.S. allies, continues to attempt to evade sanctions through front companies in Europe and the Middle East, and regularly violates machinery import bans into Belarus and Russia.

**Challenges and Overcoming Them:** Both investigations involved navigating complex business networks and facing potential backlash due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter. Rigorous fact-checking, collaboration with fellow journalists, and commitment to journalistic ethics were crucial in overcoming these challenges.

**Audience Metrics:** Detailed audience metrics are available upon request. Both articles have been widely read and shared, sparking discussions on social media and among policy makers.

**Additional Context:** Both investigations are available in Russian, Belarusian, and English on the website. The investigations highlight the resilience and resourcefulness of journalists in the face of adversity, and underscore the importance of investigative journalism in holding powerful figures accountable.","The projects I am submitting are available in Russian, Belarusian, and English.

Austria,Novaya Gazeta Europe,Big,,,Alesya Sokolova,"Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, I was a physicist in my first year of PhD, working on quantum computers. 

When the invasion happened, my priorities changed a lot. At this point, I realized that it is more important for humanity to finish the wars and authoritarianism than to build a quantum computer. I started to think about how to apply my analytical skills to increase the chances of it. I wanted to work on social topics, applying my technical expertise. 

These thoughts turned into my first data journalistic project - ""Net войне"" (at that point, a year ago, I didn't even know the term ""data journalism""). The idea was to develop a way to mitigate the effects of propaganda and decrease polarization in society through a better understanding of people who support the war in Ukraine through an analysis of Russian social media. With this project, I participated in the [hackathon](https://projector2023.te-st.org/) organized by Novaya Gazeta Europe and Teplitsa, where I won a special prize from Equalitie (many thanks to all the organizers and mentors of this event). 

The project was published in Novaya-Europe, and was a start of my data journalistic career. I couldn't stop thinking how much important information is hidden in social media, and how it can improve our understanding of what people really think about the war, and about the strategies of propaganda. The new ideas continued to appear, and I continued to publish new projects.

Now I quit PhD and joined Novaya Gazeta Europe (for that many thanks to my editor Arnold Khachaturov). I feel much more useful and recognized, and hope that data-driven insights can really move society in the right direction.

Here is a letter from a senior editor saying that the projects with multiple bylines were primarily done by me: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o4mLHJ4B84bc4z0ButnH7hv-I8tBUN3E/view?usp=sharing","The focus of my work (and my main professional interest) is the effect of social media on support of the war in Ukraine among Russians, as well as social media as an instrument for studies of propaganda and public opinion.

In ""Smoke and Mirrors"", I analysed the most popular Russian social media VK to investigate if the support of the war there is real or artificially built. I found that at least 45% (over 600 000) of the pro-war posts are copies of each other and were written by state sector employees following official guidelines.

I did all the data collection and analysis for this project, as well as wrote most of the text. My co-author Katya Orlova collected the insides from the state sector employees and some of the expert comments.

In ""Those who leave and those who stay"", I analysed social media profiles of the volunteer soldiers who died in Ukraine fighting on the Russian side, and compared them with average men in Russia. I tried to find out what drives them to go to the war. It turned out that they rarely have a high education, often look for temporary work and often have friends in eastern Ukraine. Additionally, as their sources of information, they prefer unofficial sources over official. 

I am the only author of this article. The data on Russian military casualties were provided by Mediazona and the BBC.

In ""Armchair peacekeepers"" I analysed narratives of the pro-war and anti-war posts on VK. I found that one of the most frequent arguments to justify the invasion was “striving for peace”, and with the help of experts tried to explain this paradox. I am the only author of this article. 

The article ""Net войне"" (in Russian) was the first journalist article in my life. It started from my interest in how we can use social media data to improve our understanding of Russian audiences, in particular, to help build the dialogue between pro-war and anti-war people. Analysing their profiles and subscriptions, I found that they have a lot in common, with some important differences, e.g. people who support the war tend to be less politically active.

With this project, I participated in a hackathon ""[Projector 2023: effects of the war](https://projector2023.te-st.org/)"", which I won. I did all the data collection and analysis for the project. My co-authors are the team from the hackathon: they helped to build the narrative of the text, collected expert comments and improved data visualisation.

The projects ""Armchair peacekeepers"" and ""Net войне"" were published before the ""Smoke and Mirrors"", so when I did them I didn't realize that many of the profiles may publish pro-war content following government guidelines. But I believe the results still have a social value since these profiles are led by real people, even if they follow some instructions. Furthermore, in this context, the project ""Armchair peacekeepers"" may be considered partially as a research on strategy of Russian propaganda, not only on public opinion.",Projects 1-3 were originally written in Russian and translated to English.

United States of America,Miami Herald/McClatchy DC Bureau,Small,,,"Miami Herald/McClatchy DC Bureau (Ben Wieder, Shirsho Dasgupta, Sheridan Wall, Amelia Winger)","The two-person data/investigative team of the Miami Herald/McClatchy DC Bureau is tasked with producing investigations of national interest for the readers of McClatchy’s local newspapers, especially in Florida. 

The small but mighty DC Bureau has distinguished itself over the years in reporting on national security, corporate accountability and legal issues. The bureau was famously among the few American outlets which questioned the presence of WMDs in Iraq in the years preceding the second Gulf War and reported on government efforts to hide the CIA’s use of torture on detainees. In 2017, the bureau shared a Pulitzer Prize with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists for the Panama Papers. 

In 2023, the bureau produced a year-long investigation, “The Foreclosure Franchise”, uncovering how one attorney influenced multiple local governments in Florida to turbocharge their foreclosure cases in primarily majority-Black neighborhoods, leaving owners homeless while enabling businesses to snap up the properties. 

The bureau also spent half a year exploring how illicit teak from Myanmar defies U.S. sanctions and enters supply chains, how its sale finances the military junta in Myanmar and how U.S. government agencies have failed to prioritize and tackle this issue. 

The two investigations from reporters Ben Wieder and Shirsho Dasgupta and data fellows Sheridan Wall and Amelia Winger combined data analysis and traditional reporting methods and continued the bureau’s tradition of producing impactful stories with limited resources. 

The U.S. Justice Department created a special task force to curb the trade in illicit wood in the wake of the Myanmar stories. In Florida, cities overhauled how they handle foreclosure cases and stopped filing new lawsuits after “The Foreclosure Franchise” series ran. A legal group has also brought a case which cites the reporting to the Florida Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of excessive property fines.","When the city of Clearwater, Florida took away Wade Clark’s home over unpaid property fines, the Black veteran became homeless. He isn’t alone.

In a year-long investigation — The Foreclosure Franchise — reporters Ben Wieder, Shirsho Dasgupta and Sheridan Wall found that cities across Florida ramped up foreclosures against some of their most vulnerable residents after hiring Matthew Weidner, a private attorney who sold them on the potential goldmine these cases represented.

They found the lawsuits targeted majority-Black neighborhoods, exacerbating the generational wealth gap between white and Black families.

The investigation has already had an impact across the state. 

The project was cited in a case filed with Florida’s Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the property fines leading to foreclosure; the city of Bradenton overhauled its foreclosure process; and St. Petersburg, where the plan originated, unveiled a new program to help families keep properties vulnerable to foreclosure.

Reporters reviewed thousands of pages of court records and built from scratch a database of the nearly 800 lawsuits Weidner has filed across the state. They spoke with numerous property owners and lawyers involved in the cases and filed nearly 50 records requests with local Florida governments.

The data analysis revealed that 70% of the owners didn’t have a defense attorney, with many unable to afford one. The foreclosures largely took homes from individuals and delivered them to speculators. 

An analysis of code violations scraped from a city database showed that the foreclosures hadn’t improved neighborhoods: Most foreclosed properties continued incurring new violations after changing hands.

Meanwhile, Weidner was paid $3 million in total by the cities that hired him. In St. Petersburg, where the foreclosure plan originated, officials who greenlit the program got promotions and Weidner later hired the mayor who signed off on it as his lobbyist. 

As part of another project (with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists), Shirsho Dasgupta explored how Burmese teak enters the U.S. despite sanctions against the entities that control Myanmar’s timber sector.

Dasgupta’s analysis of international trade data revealed that six million pounds of teak worth $25 million entered the U.S. post-sanctions. He also analyzed raw customs data collated by the Arizona-based data firm ImportGenius to identify companies involved in the trade. He used each shipment’s unique bills of lading number to manually verify exactly where and when each consignment was loaded.

Dasgupta spent half-a-year speaking with around three dozen sources, including some based in Myanmar who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of military retaliation, ex-U.S. ambassadors to Myanmar, former Treasury Department and FBI officials, European advisors to the pre-coup Myanmar government, Congressional staffers with knowledge of trade issues and ex-Justice Department prosecutors. 

The stories highlighted the failures of government oversight and how consumers finance a military junta when they buy teak products.

The Justice Department announced an FBI-led joint task force to curb the illicit trade in wood two months after the stories ran, with Dasgupta’s stories specifically cited at the initiative’s launch.",English,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article273093600.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article273093630.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article273093655.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article276644691.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/real-estate-news/article279887304.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/article272198338.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article272557908.html,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article275291346.html

In the works presented above, I worked solo, and faced some difficulties covering the Gaza war and communicating with Egyptians and Palestinians stuck in Gaza due to poor communications, also in the texts for the presidential elections I was detained by security forces and outlaws more than once, and I could not publish the filmed materials I obtained for threatening my security.

Therefore, I believe that these works, despite their simple potential, are real and deserve to be nominated due to the seriousness and difficulty that I faced during their preparation, even if we did not publish all the data that I obtained. Also for the importance of the subjects in the palm of the facts that the authority is trying to hide.

 Investigating: Unravelling How Sisi Achieved Record-Breaking Numbers in Egyptian Presidential Elections
Sisi’s 2024 votes surpass the total votes in post-January 2011 revolution elections, considered Egypt’s first democratic elections. This prompted me to investigate the accuracy of the reported figuresesidential Elections

I tried to communicate with the main company responsible for coordinating the entry of citizens from Gaza to Sinai, but they refrained from answering because they have a relationship with the Egyptian security services, which exposed me to a security risk and prevented me from trying to complete the investigation, but in the end I was able to communicate with various sources who confirmed my hypothesis

Education in Egypt: The Authority Tames its Citizens
President Abdel Fattah El-Sissi's educational policies have taken two different approaches. The first focuses on supporting the militarization of education, while the second aims to strengthen local and international investment partnerships to establish large-scale educational institutions. Unfortunately, this is unfolding at a time when the quality of free pre-university and university education provided by the July State is diminishing. The state of education in Egypt is marked by two discernable trends. The first trend reflects an upward trajectory, represented by the typically expensive private and international education. The second trend moves on a downward trajectory, represented by free education

Latvia,Novaya Gazeta Europe,Big,,,Daria Talanova,"In 2021, in my 4th year at university, I started working as a data journalist in the Russian independent media Novaya Gazeta. After the start of a full-scale war, my editorial office was forced to move to Latvia. For the last two years I have been writing mainly on war-related topics.
Over the years in my profession, I have written many programs for working with Russian data sources: government procurement, court decisions, social networks, state registers. In my studies, I also use NLP, fine-tuning models and other advanced tools for analyzing text data. This year I conducted several lectures at our Summer School and Free University, where I shared these skills.
One of my main areas of work, which I plan to develop in the future, is research into the militarization of Russian education.","1. School of war (https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/06/27/school-of-war-en)

This is my second study of militaristic education in Russian schools and kindergartens. For the second year now, I have been researching how military-patriotic education is becoming an integral part of education. In the latest study, we analyzed the activities of 45 thousand Russian educational institutions.

3. The great Russian brain drain (https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/08/19/the-great-russian-brain-drain-en)

This is the most comprehensive study of brain drain from Russian universities to date. Having studied the lists of scientific staff at leading universities before and after the start of the war, we found 270 scientists who left Russia. Most of them, as we managed to find out, also expressed their anti-war position.

4. No cure for war (https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/11/15/no-cure-for-war-en)

Having studied government procurement and the assortments of pharmacies, we found out that imported lifesaving medicines are disappearing from Russia.

6. Last chance saloon (https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2023/09/18/last-chance-saloon)

Information about defense orders is one of the most confidential in Russia, but we managed to get some of this data.

United States of America,STAT,Big,,,J. Emory Parker,"I became a professional journalist pretty much by accident. From 2006 to 2010 I did a lot of work at my college’s newspaper and TV station, but my career goals always focused on science, biological sciences specifically.

In late 2013, I was working at a federally funded research lab when a government shutdown forced me to seek temporary employment. Through a friend I took a job at the daily paper in Charleston, S.C., as a software developer. In 2014, I was brought on to a reporting team that was investigating South Carolina’s deadly epidemic of criminal domestic violence. I was in charge of data analysis as well as producing all of the digital version of the series. When this series went on to win the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, the newspaper decided to create a permanent editorial role for me, and I committed myself fully to a career in journalism.

Since 2021, I have been in charge of data projects at STAT, where I meld my background in biology with my data journalism and engineering skills. It’s been my privilege to work with some of the best and most knowledgeable journalists covering life sciences today.

I’ve had unique opportunities to work on complex reporting challenges involving novel topics like artificial intelligence and the analysis of massive public health datasets. I’ve developed internal tools for collaborative data entry and visualization. And I’ve overhauled how STAT visualizes and publishes data.

My goal has always been to bring transparency and accountability to complex topics with clear and innovative visualizations and presentations. I also believe strongly in the power and importance of liberating data: I’ve worked on several projects to build usable datasets from otherwise closed or difficult-to-access sources.","As the one-person data department in the STAT newsroom, I devoted 2023 to a variety of impactful projects, always seeking ways to tell stories through data that made for fresh and vital journalism.

I launched a project to collate hundreds of financial records from the largest companies in life sciences. Working with a small team of reporters, our goal was to shed light on the reality of executive compensation, which is often obscured by common accounting practices. Our goal was for a more accurate representation of compensation for top executives, one that would increase transparency and shed light on the growing issue of income inequality. Though the math is straightforward, figuring out a way for four reporters to collaboratively input hundreds of data points while maintaining data integrity would be a significant challenge.

I implemented a new internal tool based on heavily modified code from an open source Associated Press project that allowed our reporting team to divide and conquer. It made sure that reporters kept variables (like specific years) straight and also made sure that we kept entries linked to the correct executive and company. After several months of data entry, I created a series of visualizations as well as a searchable database for publication.

As wildfire smoke enveloped parts of the U.S. and Canada, I quickly pulled together research and visualizations on mask and air filter efficacy from my past work covering Covid-19 and published a quick guide to using resources people likely had laying around to mitigate the health effect of the smoke.

I continued to monitor the fallout of the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the changing patterns of abortion access in the U.S. In June, for the one-year anniversary after the Supreme Court decision, I used myriad data points to show the patchwork legal and medical landscape that has emerged.

Throughout 2023, STAT published a major series we called the “Obesity Revolution.” I made two particularly notable contributions. The first, a deep dive into public health data co-authored with Julia Belluz, offered a novel look at changing patterns of obesity in the U.S. and around the world. It required a great deal of work replicating and extending the work of various researchers. It even required pulling decades of Census body metric data in obscure and obsolete formats and writing a great deal of code in R to transform the data into something usable.

I also worked with Elaine Chen and Allison DeAngelis to publish a database of 70-plus novel drugs in development that aim to treat obesity. One U.S. Senate staffer who wrote to us described this database as “head and shoulders above every other resource.”

I closed out the year working with Katie Palmer and Casey Ross to publish another database of new generative AI products that are coming online in various health systems.",English,https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/17/health-ceo-salaries-compensation/,https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/07/air-quality-canadian-wildfires-protection/,https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/24/abortion-roe-v-wade-anniversary/,https://www.statnews.com/2023/06/08/bmi-slowdown-severe-obesity-global-rates/,https://www.statnews.com/2023/09/12/new-weight-loss-drug-tracker-novo-nordisk-eli-lilly/,https://www.statnews.com/feature/stat-plus/generative-ai-health-hospitals-tracker/,,
Uruguay,Montevideo Portal,Small,,,Federica Bordaberry - Montevideo Portal,"In Uruguay there is still little tradition of data journalism, although in the last year a few media outlets have developed sections on the subject. Montevideo Portal, being the most widely read media outlet in the country, did not have journalists specialized in the area until now. Having completed a master's degree in Data Journalism at Birmingham City University, UK, Federica Bordaberry focused her narrative investigative journalism on data. 
 
In this way, making one of the objectives to investigate different types of genres linked to data journalism, this portfolio demonstrates not only that data can also be qualitative, but also that they do not depend on big data collectors, such as public entities or companies that collect their own. In a country where most of the data exposed by journalists comes from FOIs, collecting data from the media outlet opens the door to questioning new methods of searching for independent data. 
 
Specialized in data collection and making use of a systematized procedure of discourse analysis, the articles took into account topics of cultural relevance for their readers in Uruguay. From what happened in the country itself, as is the example of the analysis of the marijuana law and the speeches of the Uruguayan parties regarding Hamas, to what happened in the neighboring country Argentina.","Uruguay still has little tradition of data in its most important media. Although 2023 was a year in which teams dedicated to data journalism were gradually incorporated, the Uruguayan public is not used to this type of press or to reading graphics. One of the formats incorporated by Montevideo Portal was the generation of data from discourses that have been relevant to public opinion. 
 
For that reason, in the last quarter of 2023, three discourse analyses were presented. The first concerns the public statements made by the various Uruguayan political parties following Hamas' attack on Israel. The second, on the speeches given by Sergio Massa and Javier Milei, the two candidates for president in the 2023 elections in Argentina, after Milei was victorious. The latter, with the excuse of the anniversary of the ten years since the legalization of recreational marijuana in Uruguay, analyzed what was said during the session in the Senate that approved the law. 
 
Federica Bordaberry, the journalist who was in charge of doing the data analysis, designed a word count system using Google Spreadsheets that allowed her to perform the analyses in a short time. The clearest example is the speed with which stories such as the speeches after the Hamas attack and the speeches of the presidential candidates arrived. The project was originally done in Spanish, but English translations are attached. 
 
The challenges of discourse analysis, in general, are to be able to process information with speed and eliminate words that have no relevance to the discourse. In this sense, the difficulties are usually related to technical issues of the chosen method. Although tools such as artificial intelligence could facilitate the process, after their use they have still proven to have shortcomings for counting. 
 
Within the three discourse analyses carried out in 2023 by the recent Montevideo Portal data team, the one that analyzes the speeches of senators in parliament, after legalizing the recreational use of cannabis, reached a maximum of 75 cumulative views, 42 unique visits and an engagement time of 7 seconds. On the other hand, the one that analyzes the statements after Hamas' attack on Israel, which was the first in the series and, perhaps, the most novel for Uruguayan readers, reached only two visitors, with two seconds of engagement time. The same happened with the speeches of Massa and Milei, the two candidates for president of the recent Argentine elections, being the second in the series.","Spanish, English",https://www.montevideo.com.uy/Especiales/El-debate-parlamentario-y-sus-connotaciones--que-palabras-usaron-los-partidos-politicos--uc873632,https://www.montevideo.com.uy/Noticias/Palabras-mas-palabras-menos-un-analisis-de-los-discursos-partidarios-sobre-Hamas-Israel-uc868108,https://www.montevideo.com.uy/Noticias/Analisis-de-los-discursos-de-Massa-y-Milei-responsabilidad-de-un-lado-y-libertad-del-otro-uc871651,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19OUqBH8uxcrZvJFwYTUG9uoP13cY-ln6?usp=drive_link,,,,
Uruguay,Montevideo Portal,Small,,,Federica Bordaberry - Montevideo Portal,"In Uruguay there is still little tradition of data journalism, although in the last year a few media outlets have developed sections on the subject. Montevideo Portal, being the most widely read media outlet in the country, did not have journalists specialized in the area until now. Having completed a master's degree in Data Journalism at Birmingham City University, UK, Federica Bordaberry focused her narrative investigative journalism on data. 
 
Thus, taking as an excuse the ten years since the legalization of marijuana, a law that made Uruguay an experiment in many ways, but especially in the fight against drugs, he summarized what happened with the protagonists of that time and with those of today. This was also his master's thesis that was guided by the journalist Paul Bradshaw in the UK and, in Uruguay, by the editor of Montevideo Portal, Paula Barquet. 
 
The long-running special also took readers into account when choosing its formats. Instead of doing a long investigation, he divided his topics into four areas, allowing them to be published on different dates and achieving more engagement with Uruguayan readers.","Uruguay was the first country in the world to legalize marijuana for recreational uses. 2023 marked ten years since the legalization of a law that, at the time, generated controversy and placed Uruguay, a small country in the south of the world, in the eye of all the media. With that excuse, Montevideo Portal published a journalistic special that analyzes what happened at that time and whether the law, ten years after its application, was successful. 
 
Federica Bordaberry was the journalist in charge of journalistic research, data collection and data visualization. The editor of the project was Paula Barquet, also editor of the Montevideo Portal newsroom. The project was originally done in Spanish, but English translations are attached.
 
The project presented several challenges, specifically in data collection. On the one hand, it is a drug-related issue, which makes it difficult to collect data on illegal products that escape the eyes of large data collectors, such as state data collectors. However, the journalist found a safe way to verify the existence of illegal marijuana in the country, through scraping Facebook Marketplace data (transforming the pages into PDFs, taking the data offline and collecting from there). 
 
Another of the great challenges was to combat the number of theories and false information presented by the testimonies of the investigation, to criticize the data presented by the Uruguayan government and to narrate from a position that integrates a multiple reality. 
 
The journalistic special has four separate articles. One, about the success of the law ten years after the legalization of marijuana. Another, a discourse analysis of what the various political parties said in parliament on the day the law was passed. A third on the world's marijuana use today and, finally, how the law turned out not to be equal for all Uruguayan populations. 
 
According to Marfeel, the website of the special, which contains the four articles, accumulated a maximum of 160 views, 123 unique visits and a time engagement of a maximum of 11 seconds. The main article, which considers the success of the law, had 94 maximum cumulative views, 56 unique visits, and an engagement time of 31 seconds. 
 
The article linked to inequality had a cumulative maximum of 337 views, 298 unique visits and an engagement time of 1 minute and 34 seconds, being the article with the most hits of the special. The one about global consumption has a maximum of 31 cumulative views, 18 unique visits and an engagement time of 6 seconds.

Nacimos en un momento crucial durante la crisis financiera de 2008. Inspirados por el lema ""Yes we can"" de Barack Obama, decidimos desafiar la corriente pesimista y apostar por un periodismo constructivo que contrarreste la ideología del malestar.

En medio de tensiones internacionales, crisis estatales y polarización política, En Positivo ha mantenido su compromiso de destacar soluciones y construir una narrativa esperanzadora.

En un panorama donde la ideología del malestar se propaga, creemos firmemente que los medios desempeñan un papel crucial. No solo se trata de informar con rigor y contexto, sino de ofrecer propuestas constructivas que empoderen a la sociedad para enfrentar los desafíos.

El portfolio que presentamos y que incluye tres propuestas, ejemplifica nuestra misión diaria. En Positivo ha demostrado que la realidad positiva existe y se respalda con datos y estadísticas.

A pesar de los desafíos actuales, vivimos en un mundo que está mejorando en muchos aspectos, desde la reducción de la mortalidad infantil hasta la disminución de la pobreza extrema. Mostrar estas evidencias no es solo un acto de optimismo, sino una necesidad para empoderar a la ciudadanía.

Nuestra cartera se sustenta en el periodismo de datos constructivo, destacando hechos respaldados por cifras que a menudo pasan desapercibidas. 

En Positivo agradece la oportunidad de participar en los Sigma Awards y espera que consideren nuestra cartera como una contribución valiosa al periodismo de datos constructivo. Celebramos quince años mostrando un mundo mejor y seguimos comprometidos con nuestra misión de ser una fuerza de cambio.","Nos complace presentar la cartera de proyectos de la **Asociación En Positivo de Periodismo Constructivo** para su consideración en los premios. Hemos liderado iniciativas durante el año 2023 que reflejan nuestro compromiso con el periodismo constructivo sustentado en los datos y su impacto positivo en la sociedad.

1. **Ponencia ""Cambiar los medios, cambiar el mundo""**: en el XXIX Congreso Internacional de la Sociedad Española de Periodística en Barcelona, presentamos una ponencia que abordó la redefinición de los periodistas y la urgencia de cambiar los medios de comunicación en un mundo digitalizado. Destacamos la importancia de la colaboración entre los medios y profesionales para mostrar una realidad más positiva. Presentamos un resumen del congreso en el artículo ""Periodistas en redeﬁnición: funciones clave y nuevos perﬁles profesionales"". 

2. **Editorial ""Uno de los mayores desafíos de este siglo es cambiar los medios de comunicación""**: el editor de En Positivo, Jorge Dobner, firmó un editorial que contextualiza la ponencia, explorando los desafíos actuales de la industria de los medios y la necesidad de transformación. Resaltamos la transformación urgente de los medios y abogamos por un periodismo más amable y terapéutico.

3. **Artículo especial ""Las 23 noticias más positivas del 2023""**: cerramos el año con un recuento de las noticias más positivas, respaldadas por periodismo de datos y estadísticas optimistas. Este artículo anual busca equilibrar la saturación de información negativa, recordando al público que el progreso y la esperanza existen en diversas áreas, desde la salud mundial hasta los derechos humanos.

Estos proyectos encapsulan nuestra misión de cambiar la narrativa mediática y fomentar un enfoque constructivo. Hemos enfrentado desafíos inherentes al cambio de paradigma en los medios, especialmente con la crisis económica y la pérdida de credibilidad del rol social de los medios. Sin embargo, hemos demostrado que es posible destacar lo positivo y atraer una audiencia que cada vez más busca las noticias positivas en el buscador de noticias. 

La audiencia valora la diversidad de logros presentados frente al agotamiento que genera una constante negatividad.

Kazakhstan,"""Медиа ""Байконур""",Small,,,Kseniia Godunova,"Мой путь в журналистику начался в 2018 году, тогда мне было 19 лет. Я пришла к главному редактору газеты ""Байконур"" (единственному печатному изданию в нашем небольшом городке Байконур) и сказала: ""Я хочу писать"". Он улыбнулся и сказала: ""Мне это нравится. Начинай!"" Так начался мой творческий путь.

Egypt,CNN Business Arabic,Big,,,Menna Abdelrazek,"Dear Sigma Awards Committee,
I am writing to express my sincere enthusiasm and belief that I am a strong contender for the Sigma Awards for Data Journalism. With over eight years of experience as an investigative and data reporter, my career path has been marked by a relentless pursuit of impactful storytelling through the lens of data.
My passion for data journalism deepened during my time at CNN Business Arabic, where I currently serve as a freelance Data Reporter since November 2022. In this role, I write spot reports, breaking stories, and data-driven investigations. My proficiency in tools such as Excel, SQL, and Python for data scraping and analysis has been instrumental in delivering insightful narratives.
The inspiration driving my work stems from the belief that data has the power to uncover truths, raise awareness, and foster transparency. My dedication to making complex economic analyses more accessible and making complex information accessible to a wider audience, espicially, that is related to climate change and environment. I find inspiration in the evolving landscape of journalism and the constant evolution of technology that empowers us to tell compelling stories.
Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to have mentors who guided and inspired me. Their wisdom has shaped my approach to data journalism, emphasizing the importance of accuracy, transparency, and the human impact behind the data.

,my work at CNN Business Arabic primarily involves simplifying complex economic analyses for the audience. However, challenges include data accessibility issues and the absence of a legal framework mandating public access to information. Furthermore, there's a risk of authorities not disclosing information to journalists, posing a potential threat to transparency and accountability. Despite these challenges, ourcommitment to making economic informatiomore transparent remains steadfast.",Arabic,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/sustainability/33675/%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%88-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AB,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/technology/41788/%D8%AD%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81%D9%87-%D8%AE%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%82%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%A9,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/sectors/45996/%D9%83%D9%85-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%BA-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%9F,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/sustainability/46665/%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D9%8E%D9%88%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A9%D8%9F,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/sustainability/35724/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AB-%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A3%D9%83%D8%A8%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/telecommunication-media/29564/%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%AD-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A2%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A3%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AB-%D8%A3%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%AC,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/companies/11053/%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A8-%D8%A7,https://cnnbusinessarabic.com/economy/34212/%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88

Spain,El Periódico,Big,,,"El Periódico (Barcelona, Spain)","El Periódico se imprime en papel desde 1978 (en 2023 hicimos [un despliegue especial multimedia](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/45-aniversario-periodico-cataluna/) para celebrar su 45 aniversario) y fue de los primeros diarios de España en contar con una [ página web](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/). Desde sus orígenes, el cuidado visual y la presentación de las noticias de forma directa y fácilmente comprensible han sido una seña de identidad de este diario, y así tratamos de trasladarlo en los reportajes multimedia incluso cuando estos incluyen multitud de datos.

Tenemos la suerte de contar en nuestro equipo con periodistas, infógrafos, diseñadores y fotógrafos que tienen décadas de experiencia y también con talentos jóvenes que aportan nuevas maneras de entender el periodismo. El resultado de esta combinación de perfiles son unos reportajes capaces de sorprender al lector y de mantenerlo informado con unos reportajes atractivos de leer y, al mismo tiempo, de alta calidad informativa.","Me llamo Rafael Julve y soy subdirector del área Multimedia de El Periódico, un diario de Barcelona (España) que en los últimos años ha redoblado la apuesta por las nuevas narrativas digitales. Todos los proyectos que presento en nombre del departamento que coordino han sido elaborados por periodistas, infógrafos, diseñadores y especialistas en foto y vídeo de nuestra redacción. Cada trabajo se le ha asignado a especialistas en la materia y ha sido revisado por los responsables de su sección y del equipo Multimedia.

Los reportajes se han elaborado desde una concepción meramente digital y pensando especialmente en el lector de la versión teléfono móvil, aunque sin menospreciar todas las posibilidades de la versión escritorio. No obstante, y dado que somos un diario que también se imprime en papel, en muchas ocasiones se ha aprovechado la información para, una vez convenientemente adaptada, ofrecerla también en ese formato. De esta manera, aunque priorizamos la concepción digital, se obtiene todo el rendimiento posible.

Hemos elegido temas de la más rabiosa actualidad pero también otros de máximo interés para nuestro perfil de lector aunque sean más atemporales. Para su confección, se han utilizado las habituales herramientas de edición de textos, fotografía e imagen, así como aplicaciones que permiten ofrecer los datos y los textos de la forma más atractiva y efectiva posible (con Shorthand como base pero también integrando Flourish, Genially...). 

En los últimos años, el diario ha remodelado su estructura organizativa e informativa para dar preponderancia a la edición digital. Prueba de ello ha sido la creación del área Multimedia (de la que tengo el honor de ser su subdirector) y la apuesta por perfiles digitales. Como resultado, tenemos el orgullo de poder afirmar que contenidos como los que presentamos a estos premios no solo han obtenido notables cotas de audiencia, sino que son los que consiguen captar mayores suscripciones.",Español,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/resultados-elecciones-generales-2023-2019-sh/index.html,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/sequia-cataluna-peores-momentos-sh/,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/internacional/israel-origen-historia-sh/index.html,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/orcas-ataques-barcos-sh/index.html,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/deportes/recorrido-etapa-barcelona-vuelta-espana-coche-bici-metro-sh/index.html,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/economia/precio-luz-gas-transporte-agua-hipoteca-salario-pension-cuesta-enero-2024-sh/index.html,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/sociedad/cronologia-informe-pisa-sh/index.html,https://www.elperiodico.com/es/internacional/resumen-guerra-ucrania-rusia-sh/index.html
Azerbaijan,"Mikroskop Media, OCCRP, iFact.ge",Small,,,Mikroskop Media,"Mikroskop Media was launched by Azerbaijani journalists Javid Abdullayev and Fatima Karimova, who both have more than ten years of experience in journalism. As co-founders of the media and authors of those stories which were presented to the jury, we have aimed to reveal and show the real situation in our country. Therefore we launched the independent media outlet while we were at the refugee camp and waiting for the residence permit decision. 

Mikroskop Media's mission is to explain the details of the topics and stories that we covered and share them as much as visualized and briefly. Since the pressure on independent media in Azerbaijan still going on, the Mikroskop Media team continues to do its best to cover investigative stories, fact checks and explanatory materials. 

Although Mikroskop has faced different types of challenges so far, like threats, insults, troll attacks on media's social media pages, hacking and even a lack of enough financial sources, we continue to cover updates from Azerbaijan not only in the local language but also in English. 

We consider that free media and sustainable independent media outlet work is vital for each country, especially countries like Azerbaijan, therefore our so far work deserves to be appreciated. We believe that the jury will take into consideration our journalistic content's importance and will award our media. 

Being a part of the free media and independent journalism is one of the main inspirations of us and the reason for us to be proud of our work. Since there are hundreds of pro-governmental media outlets in Azerbaijan, the ordinary Azerbaijani people are almost under the information blockade, however Mikroskop Media is like a window for our audience to escape from this blockade.","Mikroskop is an Azerbaijani exile media that is based in Berlin and operates in Azerbaijani and English languages. It has been almost six years since Mikroskop Media has been covering updates from Azerbaijan and publishing infographics, explanatory materials, fact checks and investigative stories.

Mikroskop also specialises in data visualization, and it is the media that publishes the most infographics in Azerbaijan's media environment. The activity of Mikroskop Media on data visualization encouraged other independent media outlets to focus on data visualization as well. As a result, it increased the number of infographics in the Azerbaijani media environment. 

Mikroskop aims to explain the story and details behind it through investigation and visualization of the topic. 

There are five projects that we want to present to the jury. Four out of them were produced only by Mikroskop Media, and one story was published based on the collaboration with OCCRP and iFact.ge. Since September 2023, Mikroskop Media became a Member Center of OCCRP, and initially, the collaboration had already started with the follow-up project on Talibov's. The story - Amid Political Purge, Sons of Longtime Azerbaijan Autocrat Talibov Offloaded Assets - Azerbaijan part was written by Mikroskop Media. https://www.occrp.org/en/suisse-secrets/amid-political-purge-sons-of-longtime-azerbaijan-autocrat-talibov-offloaded-assets

Covering the policy of the Azerbaijani government on Karabakh is vital, and at the same time challenging. Following the publishing of our story - https://mikroskopmedia.com/en/2023/01/19/how-much-grant-did-eco-activists-at-the-lachin-corridor-receive-from-azerbaijani-government/ How many grants did “eco-activists” at the Lachin corridor receive from the Azerbaijani government? - which covered the protests in the Lachin corridor, resulting in a wide range of discussion and pressure on us. Mikroskop Media's managers were threatened, insulted and accused of being traitors because of the media's unbiased and independent work. Additionally, because of the coverage on Karabakh Mikroskop Media's website was hacked in September 2023. 

Following the 44 days of the war, the conflict became a mostly discussed topic in Azerbaijan, and the number of manipulated or fake content by the pro-governmental media outlets increased. Even the speech of Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan at the Munich Security Conference was cut off by the state TV Broadcast. Our fact-checking and investigative story - Who interrupted the live streaming from the Munich Security Conference? - https://mikroskopmedia.com/en/2023/02/22/who-interrupted-the-live-streaming-from-munich-security-conference-we-explain/ revealed that it happened only in Azerbaijan and it was the biased behaviour of the local media. 

The story - How does the media make Pasha Holding's entry easier into the taxi market in Azerbaijan? - https://mikroskopmedia.com/2023/06/12/medialar-pasa-holdinqin-azerbaycanda-taksi-bazarina-girisini-nece-asanlasdirir-arasdirma/ was published only in Azerbaijani, and it covers instructions were sent to state and pro-government TV broadcasts by the government, to criticize the current taxi market in Azerbaijan. The main purpose of the instruction is to describe the situation as the lack of high-quality service in the market, and importance of the new taxi service, and the state regulations on price policy. 

The latest project is another investigative story which covers the Azerbaijan Culture Center in Berlin which operates under the embassy. https://mikroskopmedia.com/en/2023/11/14/azerbaijani-government-has-spent-19-mln-euros-for-the-cultural-center-in-berlin/ Although 19 million euros was spent on the building from the state budget, it wasn't disclosed to the public.

Spain,El Confidencial,Big,,,Elecciones Generales 2023: la cobertura en tiempo real y otros proyectos electorales,"El equipo de El Confidencial no ha dejado de innovar en la forma de hacer la cobertura de las elecciones en España. En los últimos años, ha habido comicios tanto a nivel autonómico como municipal. Pero la gran prueba de fuego llegó este año y de forma anticipada con las elecciones generales de 2023.

El trabajo previo realizado para la cobertura de elecciones anteriores fue imprescindible. La trayectoria del equipo, que ya había cubierto en conjunto más de cinco procesos electorales de diferentes características, permite ver una evolución en la innovación, los contenidos y el diseño de la información electoral.

Creemos que para estas elecciones se ha alcanzado un nivel de calidad y madurez editorial propio del más alto estándar periodístico. Todos los proyectos que presentamos en este portfolio, salvo el mapa de Mapbox, son desarrollos propios realizados en D3.js, diseñados exclusivamente para ser un producto editorial de El Confidencial, con el valor que eso conlleva.

Aunque otros medios de comunicación elaboran piezas similares para las elecciones, en El Confidencial no renunciamos a ningún producto y consideramos que damos una de las visiones más completas de la jornada electoral a partir de los datos. Además, proporcionadmos la mayor parte de la información en tiempo real y con mucha rapidez, en una jornada donde la actualidad es primordial.

Consideramos que los siete productos presentados, tanto de previa, como de jornada electoral como post electoral, son el pack muy completo y con mucho cuidado del diseño y la usabilidad, imprescidibles para que la información llegue a todos los dispositivos y sea comprensible para nuestra audiencia.

Los equipos implicados en la elaboración de estas informaciones son el de datos, diseño, desarrollo y el laboratorio de El Confidencial, implicando en total a cerca de veinte personas.","Presentamos al completo los productos editoriales para las elecciones generales de 2023 de la sección de datos y de diseño y desarrollo de El Confidencial.

En la cobertura previa a las elecciones, destacamos nuestro promedio de encuestas interactivo, que recopila cientos de sondeos desde hace cuatro años para permitir un seguimiento de las preferencias de los españoles de cara a las elecciones generales.

Ya en el día de las elecciones, contamos con hasta cuatro piezas con datos en tiempo real. La primera en publicarse es el mapa con los avances de participación, municipio a municipio, que se publica en primer lugar a las 13:00, cuando se dan a conocer las primeras cifras, y se actualiza posteriormente a las 18:00. El mapa, además, permite hacer comparativas con los datos de las elecciones previas y ver cuál está siendo la participación en las zonas donde ganó la derecha o donde ganó la izquierda, para poder ir considerando algunas de las posibles claves de la jornada electoral. En él, se puede consultar el avance del escrutinio, la composición del congreso y los datos en cada circunscripción electoral. Además, cuenta con una calculadora de pactos, imprescindible para conocer qué partido o partidos podrán gobernar el país.

También al cierre de las urnas, contamos con nuestro mapa de resultados municipales, que permite en tiempo real comprobar cómo avanza el escrutinio en cada zona. Además, el mapa permite filtrar quién ha quedado en segundo lugar, qué bloque (izquierda/derecha) tiene más votos, la participación definitiva y la distribución de voto de los principales partidos, además de la comparativa respecto a los años anteriores.

En estas elecciones, también hemos publicado en tiempo real cuáles eran los escaños más disputados. Aquellos que quedaban a pocos votos de alcanzar al partido que ganó el anterior, aparecían en movimiento para indicar que estaban ""bailando"", como se explica coloquialmente cuando un escaño puede cambiar de un partido a otro. De hecho, esto sucedió con el recuento oficial de votos en la circunscripción de Madrid, lo cual da cuenta de la relevancia y el interés de este producto informativo.

Con los escaños ya definidos en la noche electoral, publicamos una calculadora de pactos algo más compleja que la que ya teníamos en el widget. En este caso, se tiene en cuenta la lógica parlamentaria de las votaciones en el congreso para investir a un presidente: se tienen en cuenta votos a favor, en contra y abstenciones en hasta dos votaciones que exigen mayorías diferentes. Este es otro producto que resulta muy útil en los escenarios de igualdad entre bloques como el que dejó el 23-J.

What comes to mind at the mention of climate change? Floods? Rising water levels? Outbreak of diseases or invasion of strange pests? But do we know that without land, communities cannot build their resilience against climatic shocks. How can one shift from a mud house that collapses from soaking after heavy rains to a brick house if they don't own land? How can one farm and sell the surplus and save the profits to keep their families afloat during drought when there is little food or water? This is what this multimedia story is all about. It gives you all rounded intersection between land and climate change from the perspective of the Maasai, the pastoralist community in Tanzania and Ogiek, a minority forest dwelling community in Kenya that has been a victim of endless evictions by the government.",English,https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/landless-ogiek-women-recount-the-nightmare-of-living-outside-mau-4361644,https://nation.africa/kenya/news/gender/owning-land-has-offered-me-a-taste-of-good-life-4369128,https://afripods.africa/episode/landless-the-nightmare-of-living/aa0ae09b-2ebd-419b-8d90-130ad4b598fc,https://afripods.africa/episode/part-2-ogiek-women-recount-the-n/b7230928-402a-4091-9668-081a94f1ba12,https://youtu.be/o5ku3iMTAgc?si=Vsb0moVpDwmc_kHF,,,
India,Sage Publications,Small,,,Robin Banerjee - as an Individual,"Dear Award Committee Members

I humbly submit my application for the ESG Award. 

I have been part of the Corporate World for over 4 decades holding CXO positions, including being the CEO for the last ten years in Caprihans India Ltd. I have since started my own venture in April 2023 - a global clinical research organisation, attempting to make a difference to the world of diseases and illnesses. 

During my corporate life and as an individual, I have been working on ESG most diligently. 

The key differences I feel I have made to this world are as follows: 

1. BOOKS ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE: I am a proponent of anti-fraud activities in the business world. Have written two books (perhaps the only ones) on the subject. Through these best-selling non-fiction books, I have tried to promote good corporate behaviour. The books are now gold standard in the professional world. It is also a recommended book at the National Institute of Bank Management, a Govt of India Training Centre for Bankers. 

2. POLICE TRAINING ON ECONOMIC CRIMES: I am a regular trainer to the IPS and very senior Police Officers of India, in their National Police Academy in Hyderabad. Almost every senior police officer, working on economic crime, hopefully have been trained by me. I feel I have been able to reduce the size and number of economic crimes in the country. 

3 INDUSTRY ESG CHAMPIONING: Being at the helm of ESG Committee of CII (Immediate Past Chair and Vice Chair), I have been able to interact with thousands of business managers promoting the necessity of good governance and enhancing stakeholder value. I believe that I have been able to make some difference as the size and number of corporate economic crimes are on the decline.","ESG in my passion. As an indivdual I have worked on it for over a decade. 
My key contributions in this area are as follows:

1. ENVIRONMENT: I have been the immediate Past Chairman of CII - ESG Committee of Western India. As part of this, I have worked with various local bodies and State Governments to clean up dirty environments especially river beds and industrial zones. These efforts have been in the State of Maharashtra.

2. SOCIAL: Over the last 7 years, I have been working with 1000 destitute and extremely poor children in and around Nashik and Thane city, in Maharashtra State. These children are school going, belonging to the following categories:

a. Adivasy children: 500 adivasy children were looked after, by providing dilapidating infrastructure like toilet and girls' hostel building, books, and shoes. 

b. Nashik Municipal school children: While they were going to the municipal school, parents had no means to provide them with books, pads, school bags, and shoes. These were arranged. 

c. Thane Municipal School for Physically and Mentally Handicapped Children: The physically handicapped childtren required regular medical support for handicapped legs and hands. Plus, providing special teachers for speech and music therapy. Built a garden for handicapped children so they can feel the elements even if they are blind. 

3. GOVERNANCE: I have written 2 best selling non-fiction books for Corporate Governance (Publisher: Sage Publications). They are titled:

a."" Who Cheats and How? Fraud, Scams and Dark Side of the Corporate World"": Published in 2015 and is available in English, Hindi and Marathi. 

b. ""Corporate Fraud - Bigger, Broader, Bolder"": Published in 2021

Both the books are available world across, have sold in thousands, and form the basic literature for Corporate Governance for any university courses, group discussions for business management institutions or corporate debates. 

Being in the ESG Committee of the largest Industry body viz CII (Confederation of Indian Industries), I have arranged, chaired and spoken at hundreds of seminars and conferences, promoting the cause of good goverance in the corporate world.. 

Have been awarded by ROTARY INTERNATIONAL in February 2019 for the ""ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES for setting an example of Exemplary Corporate Governance and Social Responsibility"". This was due to the continuous efforts in the business world to promote good governance.",English in all cases,https://cfo.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/governance-risk-compliance/governance-tripod-accountants-professional-accountants-government/100691972,https://cfo.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/cfo-tech/the-battle-ai-chatgpt-vs-managers-accountants-auditors-who-could-win/101147969,,,,,,
