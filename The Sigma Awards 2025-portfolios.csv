Peru,Salud con lupa,Small,Winner,"This portfolio showcases investigations grounded in rigorous data analysis, public information requests, and in-depth field reporting, revealing key facts and amplifying the voices of those affected. Some stories also influenced public policy or incorporated an international benchmarking perspective. Salud con Lupa stands as a leading example of high-quality, meaningful data-driven journalism from a small newsroom in Peru, shedding light on urgent public health issues.",Salud con lupa,"En un contexto donde la desinformación en salud es una amenaza global, Salud con Lupa se ha convertido en un referente del periodismo de datos en América Latina. Su trabajo va más allá de la cobertura de salud tradicional, combinando metodologías rigurosas, acceso a bases de datos y el uso de la ley de transparencia para exponer fallas del Estado, abusos de poder corporativo y amenazas ambientales con impacto directo en la vida de las personas.  Desde su fundación en 2019, ha demostrado el valor del periodismo independiente en tiempos de crisis. Durante la pandemia de COVID-19, no solo informó con precisión a cientos de miles de personas, sino que llenó un vacío en el periodismo de salud en la región, contrastando información con evidencia científica y datos verificables.  Su periodismo ha logrado un impacto tangible. La serie “Un veneno oculto en mi plato” llevó a la creación de proyectos de ley para regular agroquímicos peligrosos en Perú. “Las pastillas y yo”, que expuso los problemas de acceso a medicinas de salud mental y la influencia de la industria farmacéutica en las recetas de los psiquiatras, aceleró la compra de psicofármacos esenciales para los centros de salud mental comunitaria.  Cada una de sus investigaciones se basa en análisis de datos, acceso a información pública y reportería en terreno, garantizando que las historias no solo revelen hechos, sino que también den voz a quienes viven sus consecuencias.  Por su rigurosidad metodológica, impacto en políticas públicas y compromiso con la transparencia, Salud con Lupa ilumina los temas más urgentes en salud pública. En un momento en que la información confiable es vital, su trabajo merece ser reconocido con el Sigma Awards 2025.","Presentamos cuatro investigaciones que cumplen con rigor, análisis de datos profundo y una narrativa visual efectiva.  1. Así aprovecha Syngenta un sistema de licencias indefinidas para vender pesticidas peligrosos Este reportaje revela cómo Syngenta vende en Perú 42 pesticidas prohibidos en la Unión Europea y Suiza gracias a un vacío regulatorio. La investigación utilizó la Ley de Transparencia para obtener datos de registros de agroquímicos, analizó políticas de otros países y expuso los efectos ambientales y de salud de estos químicos. Se destaca por: uso de bases de datos regulatorias para comparar legislaciones internacionales, análisis histórico del sistema de licencias en Perú para explicar cómo se perpetúa la venta de productos prohibidos y visualización de datos sobre importaciones de pesticidas.  2. Martina y las más de 1200 niñas madres que pierden cada año sus proyectos de vida Este reportaje combina análisis estadístico con historias humanas para visibilizar el embarazo infantil en Perú. Se analizaron registros de nacidos vivos del Ministerio de Salud entre 2014 y 2023, identificando un patrón alarmante en seis regiones del país donde la tasa de embarazo en niñas de 10 a 14 años es hasta tres veces mayor que el promedio nacional. El reportaje destaca por uso de bases de datos para mostrar el impacto del problema a lo largo del tiempo y visualización de datos regionales que permite identificar desigualdades geográficas.  3. Sanciones sin efecto y contratos millonarios: la familia Jiménez y su ascenso en Qali Warma Este reportaje expone cómo una red de 23 empresas evadió sanciones y obtuvo S/200 millones en contratos con Qali Warma, el programa de alimentación escolar en Perú. Salud con Lupa cruzó datos de registros de contrataciones públicas, resoluciones judiciales y compras del Estado para demostrar cómo empresas sancionadas por falsificar certificados de calidad lograron seguir contratando con medidas cautelares. Destaca por mapeo de una red de empresas mediante análisis de relaciones familiares y comerciales, uso de visualizaciones para mostrar el crecimiento de contratos irregulares, impacto social directo en la calidad de los alimentos de más de 600 mil estudiantes.  4. Si eres joven, vives en pobreza y abortas, el sistema te persigue hasta condenarte El acceso a 68 sentencias judiciales a través de solicitudes de información pública permitió acercarnos a patrones de criminalización del aborto en Perú. La recopilación y sistematización de datos judiciales revelaron que la mayoría de mujeres sentenciadas eran jóvenes, pobres y de regiones fuera de Lima. Se identificó que 42 de 68 mujeres se autoinculparon, lo que muestra cómo la falta de defensa legal y el hostigamiento judicial influyen en los fallos.   Los trabajos de Salud con Lupa generaron impacto no solo al influir en el debate público, sino también en la toma de decisiones. Por ejemplo, tras la investigación sobre las compras irregulares de alimentos en Qali Warma, el director ejecutivo del programa renunció a su cargo. Asimismo, el reportaje sobre sentencias por autoaborto en Perú motivó capacitaciones a jueces del Poder Judicial para reducir prejuicios en la administración de justicia.",Español,https://saludconlupa.com/noticias/asi-aprovecha-syngenta-un-sistema-de-licencias-indefinidas-para-vender-pesticidas-peligrosos/,https://saludconlupa.com/genero/martina-y-las-mas-de-1200-ninas-madres-que-pierden-cada-ano-sus-proyectos-de-vida/,https://saludconlupa.com/series/qali-warma/sanciones-familia-jimenez-contratos/,https://saludconlupa.com/genero/si-eres-joven-vives-en-pobreza-y-abortas-el-sistema-te-persigue-hasta-condenarte/,https://saludconlupa.com/genero/como-las-fuerzas-antiderechos-capturaron-la-agenda-legislativa-de-la-comision-de-la-mujer-del-congreso/,https://saludconlupa.com/series/el-dinero-o-la-salud/vivir-con-menos-insulina-hasta-que-la-entregue-el-hospital-o-pueda-pagarla/,https://saludconlupa.com/noticias/los-nexos-de-las-asociaciones-de-consumidores-de-vapeadores-con-una-tabacalera/,
West Bank and Gaza,منظمة آخر قصة- last story الإعلامية الفلسطينية المستقلة   www.laststory.net,Small,Winner,"""Last Story"" speaks straight to the heart - and being able to raise awareness is a quality that needs to be valued in Data-Driven Journalism.
More than that, production is well made by a courageous and fighting team, from within one of the most conflict-ridden places on Earth, the Gaza Strip. This ability of speaking from inside the territory - one of the capabilities from conventional journalism - is what breathes life to the productions of ""Last Story"".
The works speak to the local public and also show the world, through the lens of those who knows the reality.
But the materials are not only exciting and made _in loco_, they are technically excelent. Each story is unique, but there's a visual identity that unites them. The attention to aesthetics stands out, coupled with data and reports, a combination that creates very impacting results. ""Last Story"" still has an eye for choosing stories that have particuliarities and show aspects less approached by other media outlets. For all these reasons, ""Last Story"" deserves to be revered.",Last Story,نحن نرى أنا  مشاركتنا تشكل أمر بالغ الأهمية، على الصعيدي المهني، من حيث جودة الأداء الذي نزعم تقديمه على مستوى الصحافة المحلية في قطاع غزة والتي لم يسبقنا إليه أحد من حيث نوعية المعالجة والأسلوب المستخدم في السرد القصصي، رغم تعقيدات الظروف الأمنية القاهرة وتحديات الحرب.   وإلى حد كبير تشكل تغطياتنا كسرا للصورة النمطية التي تهتم بالتركيز على الأخبار بعيدا عن القصة والتي تعبر في جوهرها عن الإنسان وحقوقه المختلفة بخاصة الفئات المهمشة. لذا نعتقد أنه من الضروري أن تتكرم لجنة التحكيم وتأخذ مشاركتنا هذه بعين الاعتبار. فيما يخص مسارنا المهني، فنحن حديثي نشأة إلى حد ما، انطلقنا في ذروة جائحة كورونا 2020 كمبادرة فردية، ثم تحولنا إلى منظمة وحصلنا على التراخيص الرسمية عام 2022. ومنذ النشأة ونحن نتطلع إلى أن تشكل منظمة آخر قصة حاضنة إعلامية للفئات المجتمعية الهشة على المستوى الفلسطيني والإقليمي، حيث تعد شكلاً من أشكال الصحافة المتأنية والجادة والتي تأخذ على عاتقها مساءلة الجهات الحكومية تجاه انتقاص أي من حقوق تلك الفئات، وفي نفس الوقت تقدم جانب توعوي تثقيفي لتلك الفئات تجاه حقوقها. غير أن تدمير مقرنا خلال الحرب أثر بشكل سلبي في مواصلة العمل على نفس الوتيرة حيث شهد عملنا تذبذبا من حين لأخر. لكن بعد إعلان وقف إطلاق النار يواصل فريقنا العمل بجد وبمهنية عالية من أجل مواصلة رسالته. حيث يتنوع الفريق بخبراته وجدارته بإنتاج صحافة العمق.,مرحبا،،  أتقدم إليكم بطلب التقدم إلى الجائزة نيابة عن فريق الصحفيين العاملين في منظمة آخر قصة- last story  خصوصا الفريق المشارك بشكل فاعل في إنتاج صحافة البيانات داخل المنظمة.  نحن نعمل من قطاع غزة كمنظمة إعلامية مستقلة تغطي قضايا الصالح العام والفئات الهشة، بما في ذلك النساء والأطفال وكبار السن والأشخاص ذوي الإعاقة. وفي الحقيقة فإن اندلاع الحرب في غزة كان له بالغ الأثر على عملنا، حيث أنه في الوقت الذي كان من الممكن أن نغطي فيه الكثير من القضايا الهامة التي تخص الشرائح التي نعمل عليها، كنا نواجه تحدي أمني معقد وخطير للغاية في ظل التحديدات الأمنية والعسكرية الميدانية. ومع ذلك ورغم التحديات اللوجستية المتعلقة بفرص الوصول إلى الانترنت بشكل محدود جداً وكذلك الكهرباء، إلا أن فريقنا أثر أن ينتج ما يمكن إنتاجه من المحتوى بما في ذلك صحافة البيانات.  المشاريع التي عملنا عليها طيلة فترة الحرب وإن كانت محدودة لكنها شكلت موضع اهتمام بالنسبة للكثير من وسائل الإعلام والجمهور عموماً على اعتبار أن تبرز المعناة بلغة الأرقام وتقدم لغة تحقيقية في البحث والتقصي وراء القضايا الخفية المتعلقة بالفئات الهشة وتمثلها بالبيانات، وهذا في حقيقة جهد كبير ينطوي على تحدي أكبر في ظل الإمكانات المتاحة. ومع ذلك استطعنا أن نقدم مجموعة من القصص المميزة التي تهتم بالتركيز على مختلف الشرائح المجتمعية المهمشة والتي ازدادت رقعة اتساعها بفعل التداعيات الاقتصادية والصحية التي تسببت بها الحرب. حيث تضاعفت نسب الفقر والبطالة وزادت احتياجات فئات مختلفة أبرزها النساء وكبار السن والأطفال، كما ضاعفت من نسب الإعاقات.  فيما يلي أبرز القصص المدفوعة بالبيانات والتي عمل عليها فريقنا:  •كمائن الطحين: الجوع كسلاح ضد المدنيين •حرب غزة: أثار قاتلة على مرضى الفشل الكلوي •أطفال غزة يواجهون الفقد والعزلة •بلا علاج : مرضى ”الدم” يصارعون الموت •مريضات السرطان بغزة اجتمع عليهن الحرب والمرض •هكذا تأثرت نساء الحرب بالتجويع •الظل الأخير: كبار السن في معركة البقاء •ذوات الإعاقة يواجهن تحدي انعدام الخدمات,Arabic,https://www.laststory.net/post/1113/%D9%83%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%86:-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B9-%D9%83%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86,https://www.laststory.net/post/1116/%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9:-%D8%A3%D8%AB%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B6%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%84%D9%88%D9%8A,https://www.laststory.net/post/1117/%D8%A3%D8%B7%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%87%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%84%D8%A9,https://www.laststory.net/post/1118/%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AC-:-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B6%D9%89-%22%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%85%22-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA,https://www.laststory.net/post/1143/%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B6,https://www.laststory.net/post/1295/%D9%87%D9%83%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%AB%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8--%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B9,https://www.laststory.net/post/1311,https://www.laststory.net/post/1314

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Shortlist,,LA NACION DATA (Argentina),"In October 2010, we launched LA NACION DATA as a newsroom strategy facing two challenges: Argentina was a country without FOIA law and no open data. Today, we are publishing projects using Generative AI. A really long way.  We started making bonds with the incipient Hacks/Hackers, open data, open government and data science initiatives. To accelerate change we hosted 4 Datafest public events in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016 and strengthened  learnings on opening, analyzing and visualizing data of public interest generated by different stakeholders (government, multilateral organizations, academia, media, transparency CSOs, etc).  Collaboration is in our DNA. We started in 2012 for our news application on statement of assets working with NGOs including the launch of our Environmental Legislative Monitor in 2021. We also partner with other  newsrooms in national (Chequeado), latinamerican (Red Palta) and international (ICIJ, Journalism AI collab) areas.  We went massive with crowdsourcing developing our open source, online and collaborative platform Vozdata with the support of Knight Mozilla OpenNews and Civicus. Since 2014, we have used it to digitize and make databases from scratch including Senate expenses, phone interceptions’ audios and electoral documents with + 300 volunteers.  Our scope includes data driven investigations, data as a service and “data-teinment”.   We are a team of 14  journalists,  data scientists, developers and designers. We  usually work in  collaboration with the Graphics department for big projects.  Our main inspiration through the last 13 years came from  Propublica, The Guardian UK, Los Angeles Times, NYTimes, WaPo, Civio (Spain), The Economist, Reuters, Ojo Publico, Texty, and many more.  We usually got ideas from conferences like NICAR, ONA, GEN Summit, Abrelatam, Hacks/Hackers Argentina, WIDS and data journalism books.  Mentors: Knight Mozilla OpenNews, EJC, JSK at Stanford University, Prof. Rosental Alves and lately from, PolisLSE Journalism AI Collab.","LA NACION Data’s 2024 portfolio showcases a diverse range of projects that highlight our innovation effort with geospatial data and Generative AI.   We covered topics such as climate change, crime, Venezuela’s election fraud, presidential speeches, the National Congress, and the Olympics.  For the jury’s consideration, we have provided behind-the-scenes explanations in English. Please find them through the links provided below.  [Heat Islands] We conducted an in-depth investigation into urban heat islands, combining journalistic research, data analysis, technology, mapping, and immersive visualizations. Our coverage addressed different aspects of the issue, including:  What heat islands are and why they occur;  Their relationship with climate change; Health effects on communities; Solutions adopted by other cities to mitigate the phenomenon  [Crime Map] The Buenos Aires Crime Map is an interactive tool displaying geolocated data from over 127,500 recorded crimes.   Embedded within an explanatory report, the map offers deep insights into crime dynamics, expert opinions, and trends from recent years.  [Venezuela Elections Map] We mapped Venezuela’s highly controversial election results in collaboration with local newsrooms and through crowdsourced data.  Leveraging our expertise in Argentine election data, we helped geolocate, analyze, and visualize the results using information scraped from the opposition’s site.  Using tools such as QGIS, Google Maps API, and manual geolocation with the help of the Venezuelan community in Argentina, we matched voting centers with their precise locations.  [The President’s Speech]  In his first 365 days in office, President Javier Milei delivered 142 public speeches: 58 long-format media interviews and 84 official statements.  We processed 89 hours of audio and 23GB of data.  The findings were highly revealing—both qualitatively and quantitatively—in understanding his disruptive communication strategy.  [The President’s X] Sleepless nights, outbursts, and punishments—this is how Milei’s Twitter works, the machine gun of the new official narrative.  For this project, we downloaded all interaction data from Javier Milei’s Twitter/X account via the platform’s API, covering the period from December 10, 2023, to February 10, 2024.  The tweets were categorized using a generative AI model, followed by journalistic oversight.  [National Congress] Upon taking office, President Milei introduced an ambitious reform bill to Congress, proposing sweeping changes, including: An overhaul of the electoral system;  Tax reforms;  Stricter restrictions on public marches and protests.  The bill was enormous—more than 180 pages and 664 articles, structured across multiple chapters. With annexes included, the document exceeded 1,000 pages, making it difficult to analyze comprehensively.  To address this challenge, LA NACION developed a unique tool: A side-by-side comparison feature that allows users to quickly and clearly track how the bill evolved between the two legislative chambers.  [Olympics Chatbot] We developed a chatbot using Vertex AI Agent Builder, enabling our audience to interact with Olympic history.  Through this project, we gained key insights:  Generative AI still struggles with real-time events and arithmetic operations;  Interdisciplinary teamwork and open collaboration are crucial; Audience feedback played a fundamental role in shaping the chatbot",spanish,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1q9idm4I9B7gQ3ndQnPe8vU9ARB75O1-7pElqwsBgo84&titulo=LA+NACION+Data&bajada=&volanta=portfolio&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1nwdsnReOxn-2MR51FT60NeQNr-IwbBr-lMlT2OH_whw&titulo=Buenos+Aires+Crime+Map:+How+safe+is+your+block%3F&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1MXeFaTeGoKJa6OFda6X2r8oIgEOfJH2TvScwG4UF1qk&titulo=Urban+heat+islands%3Cspan%3EHow+to+explain+interactively+to+citizens+why+it%27s+hotter+in+their+neighbourhood+than+in+the+next+one%3C%2Fspan%3E&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1LrEs3XAuhHW6zar1QZSErrcLlVSFYUQMyPGTA3ffM5Y&titulo=Actas+Abiertas:+Fact-checking+the+results+behind+Venezuela%27s+2024+Election&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1htosAcDuxDcZcsjtD3788Z97G3kGxMXP1v1SVGAxxt8&titulo=Unpacking+right-wing+rhetoric:+what+data+reveals+about+Milei%E2%80%99s+discourse&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/desvelos-arrebatos-y-castigos-asi-funciona-el-twitter-de-javier-milei-la-ametralladora-del-nuevo-nid17022024/,https://especialess3.lanacion.com.ar/22/05/scrolly-aml-app-nuxt/?doc_id=1YD_XOFdmZ4Zmk_s1Di7Ti3g7mJc8bZb5GZuOauyG2ZA&titulo=Navigating+the+chaos:+how+Congress+reshaped+Milei%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98Make+Argentina+Great+Again%E2%80%99+%28MAGA%29+law&bajada=&volanta=LA+NACION&header_nota_theme=light&preview=1&estilos_apertura=&id_video_apertura=&url_foto_apertura=&id_video_apertura_mobile=&url_foto_apertura_mobile=#/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/deportes/juegos-olimpicos/pone-a-prueba-el-chatbot-creado-con-inteligencia-artificial-sobre-los-jjoo-nid07082024/

[**Fact-Checking Trump’s Immigration Claims**](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/21/fact-check-12000-trump-statements-immigrants): This project, led by Anna Flagg, analyzed over 350,000 lines of text by former President Donald Trump, identifying 13 recurrent false claims about immigration—some repeated over 500 times. The reporting team found all were false or highly exaggerated and debunked these myths, providing readers with accurate information to counteract misinformation. As of writing, these stories are consistently in the top five for The Marshall Project’s daily reach.  [**Survey of Incarcerated People**](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/17/election-voting-harris-trump-incarceration-poll): A groundbreaking survey of over 54,000 incarcerated individuals across 45 states revealed strong support for Donald Trump, even as Republicans seek to restrict voting rights for those with criminal convictions. We challenged preconceived notions about the political leanings of the incarcerated population and highlighted the complexities of voting rights restoration.  [**Cuyahoga County / Cleveland Judicial Election Guide**](https://www.themarshallproject.org/cleveland/judge-guide): Recognizing the often-overlooked impact of local judicial elections, where our research shows increasing voter participation, a team led by Andrew Rodriguez Calderón in partnership with Signal Cleveland developed an informative guide for voters in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. This resource provided detailed profiles of judicial candidates to make informed decisions in the 2024 primary and general elections. Led by organic search, the judge guide has by far the biggest reach of our efforts in Cleveland.  [**Investigate This!

Our focus on this series was to tell the human stories from Gaza using a variety of data visual techniques.  What these stories have in common is their use of data and personal accounts to instantly capture the audience’s attention and compel them to stop and focus.  These creative and unconventional storytelling techniques are especially important when news fatigue sets in, and the risk of someone being killed becomes just another statistic.  Each story is crafted to be natively consumed on social platforms, meeting audiences where they are and presenting information at a pace that’s easily digestible.","The Gaza Strip is a graveyard for thousands of children, the United Nations has said. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli attacks have killed at least 18,000 children in Gaza. That is one child killed every 30 minutes.  Each of these children had a name, from Ahmed, meaning ”greatly praised,” to Zain, meaning ”beautiful.”  In this illustrated guide series, Al Jazeera employed a range of thought-provoking visual techniques to highlight the individuals behind the statistics, including the number of children killed, the displaced populations, the challenges faced by doctors, stories of starvation and the journalists who were killed while reporting the story.",English,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2024/10/8/know-their-names-palestinian-families-killed-in-israeli-attacks-on-gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2024/11/20/an-a-z-of-the-children-israel-killed-in-gaza,https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2024/displacement-israel-war-on-gaza-no-safe-place/,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2024/1/23/how-doctors-in-gaza-persevere-amid-israel-attacks,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2024/3/26/they-scream-in-hunger-how-israel-is-starving-palestinians-in-gaza,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2024/12/31/know-their-names-the-palestinian-journalists-killed-by-israel-in-gaza,https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2024/gaza-before-after-satellite-images/,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2024/10/8/one-year-of-israels-war-on-gaza-by-the-numbers
Germany,ZEIT ONLINE,Big,Shortlist,,Team Data and Visualization ZEIT ONLINE,"Data journalism has emerged as a focal point of public attention. Data, maps, and key figures play a central role in decisions with far-reaching societal impacts. This newfound prominence fundamentally reshaped the work at ZEIT ONLINE, where the data-driven journalistic approach became an indispensable part of reporting. Today, the team excels not only in producing a variety of innovative projects but also in continuously evolving its methods and topics. Data journalism has become an essential tool for modern, insightful reporting, offering fresh perspectives and well-founded analyses.   ZEIT ONLINE’s approach to data journalism is defined by thematic diversity, technological innovation, and a focus on user-centricity. The team tackles pressing societal issues, including environmental and climate challenges, social inequality, and political developments. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and conducting in-depth analyses, ZEIT ONLINE simplifies complex topics and introduces innovative perspectives. Interactive formats and data-driven personalization not only provide readers with deeper insights into critical issues but also allow them to tailor data to their individual needs. This approach establishes ZEIT ONLINE’s data journalism as a pivotal tool that offers both orientation and added value.","Understanding the Impact of Noise Pollution  https://www.zeit.de/mobilitaet/2024-02/laerm-deutsche-staedte-schlafen-gesundheit-daten   This project quantified, for the first time, the effects of traffic noise on residents in the largest German cities. The data analysis drew on data from the EU Noise Directive, supplemented by population data. Factors such as asphalt quality, speed limits, and road gradients were incorporated to precisely map noise pollution. Using a formula from the German Federal Environment Agency, the project also estimated the proportion of individuals experiencing severe noise disturbance or sleep disorders.   Bürgergeld: Is it worth it for you to work more? https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/2024-02/sozialleistungen-buergergeld-wohngeld-arbeit-rechner  The interactive tool and accompanying article provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of Germany’s social benefits system, focusing on Bürgergeld. The tool enables users to calculate their potential entitlements based on personal circumstances, offering tailored insights into available support. The article explains eligibility criteria, application processes, and recent legislative changes, empowering individuals to navigate the welfare landscape effectively and make informed decisions regarding their benefits.  These are the millions who want to vote for the AfD https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2024-03/afd-waehler-profil-daten-statistik  Our data analysis challenges common assumptions about the voters of the far-right party AfD. The party is gaining support across social groups, not just among men, the elderly, or East Germans. Economic fears, dissatisfaction with democracy, and a desire for fewer migrants drive them. Most do not see themselves as right-wing. The AfD is increasingly a nationwide force, mobilizing discontent with the political establishment.  Preserving Germany’s Islands  https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2024-03/kuestenerosion-deutsche-inseln-schutzmassnahmen-klimawandel  This project explored changes in the coastlines of the North and East Frisian Islands since 1984, shedding light on the visible impacts of climate change on Germany’s coastal regions. Satellite data from the Landsat mission and algorithms for analyzing water and land areas were combined to create a detailed analysis of these transformations over time.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Shortlist,,elDiario.es Data Team,"elDiario.es is a digital news site which has become a major reference in current affairs for a new generation of Spanish readers, and also a pioneer in high quality content and innovative business model worldwide. Since its inception, elDiario.es has opted for data journalism as a way to create quality content for subscribers and also to reach new audiences in Spain. Since 2015, our data team has always been a small data unit with at least two journalists who have based their work on constant collaboration with the entire newsroom. In 2024, the data journalism team was formed by 3 team members. This year, our small team (3 members) had to cover multiple regional, European and international elections in Spain, as well as address the housing crisis, which caused rent prices to reach bubble levels and the traffic flood event in Valencia (DANA). Meanwhile we were working and publishing big investigations and visual stories about climate change, income inequalities, health, culture, biased perceptions and urbanism. Precisely, our work philosophy, focused on unveiling inequalities and publishing impact stories, has always been to visualize and explain things in the simplest way to the reader and collaborate with all the journalists in the newsroom to search stories and do better, accessible and understandable data journalism. elDiario.es was launched in the middle of the financial crisis in 2012 with no big investors or corporates backing it – just a bunch of journalists and their savings – and it has developed a community-based journalism model reaching mainstream audiences with scarce resources. The key business innovation is the ‘membership program’ – more than 100.000 people (“socios”) already give financial support to elDiario.es in order to strengthen our editorial and economic independence.","In 2024, the elDiario.es data team, composed of Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres, and Yuly Jara, produced impactful coverage on key societal issues, including elections, climate change, the housing crisis, the floods in Valencia, and social inequality. A significant part of our efforts was dedicated to covering multiple regional, European, and international elections. We meticulously prepared and coded all live results maps and charts for every election night, producing over 10 pieces of live updates throughout the year. The biggest challenge of our election coverage was providing our readers with results from different elections, each utilizing multiple electoral systems, with only three journalists on the team. We employed not only basic charts and maps but also cartograms, an automated contested seats tracker, live granular data to profile voters, and block-by-block map results. While election coverage shaped our daily workflow, it did not prevent us from publishing in-depth investigations and visual reports. A significant portion of our journalistic efforts was devoted to covering the housing crisis in Spain. For example, we revealed unpublished data showing that one million homes are owned by large landlords, showing how a large portion of the housing market is controlled by a few owners while prices soared. We developed a block-by-block interactive tool that allowed readers to identify areas where they could afford to rent a home across the country. Additionally, a scraping analysis of major listing platforms revealed how homeowners bypass the law designed to reduce rent prices. The team also covered the tragic floods in Valencia in 2024, using satellite images, maps, and detailed data to assess the DANA (a Spanish storm) impact. We also published a report demonstrating that personal losses and damages could have been mitigated by geolocating flood videos, most of which fell within the borders of our “Spain at Flood Risk” map, a journalistic project in which we meticulously cross-referenced flood-risk zones with the footprints of over 12 million buildings across the country. In line with climate change issues, we updated a tracker throughout the year to monitor the status of reservoirs in Spain, keeping track of the drought situation and water availability across the country. Visual storytelling has been a core focus of our work. For instance, we shed light on how labor reform reduced income inequality and increased wages for the most vulnerable workers, as well as fighting against disinformation regarding taxes paid by workers in Spain. Using the same data, we developed innovative experiments designed to challenge readers’ preconceived notions. We published an interactive calculator that allowed thousands of readers to discover their place on Spain’s salary scale. Our 2024 coverage also included impactful social stories such as the underrepresentation of women in Spain’s music festival line-ups or a story about Madrid’s train service deterioration revealing that no day has passed in a decade without serious incidents. Through our commitment to data-driven journalism, we continue to engage, inform and drive public conservation on pressing issues.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/espana-millon-viviendas-manos-grandes-propietarios_1_11844846.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/mapa-costa-mediterranea-inundable-dana-cebo-valencia-utiel-letur_1_11778161.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/calculadora-salarios-espana-2024_1_11696038.html,https://www.eldiario.es/internacional/resultados-elecciones-europeas-2024-pais-directo_1_11418725.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/mapa-alquileres-disparan-precio-ciudades-espana-calle-madrid-barcelona_1_11628723.html,https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/dia-incidencias-cercanias-madrid-retrasos-triplican-10-anos_1_11514111.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/mapa-reservas-agua-espana-datos-embalse-sequia_1_11243582.html,https://www.eldiario.es/cultura/cartel-no-hombre-problema-festivales-mujeres_1_11511466.html
United States of America,"CCIJ, RU, ICIJ, Investigate Europe, Urban Journalism Network",Big,Shortlist,,Sotiris Sideris,"Over the past decade, I’ve devoted myself to data-driven, collaborative journalism that confronts corruption and ensures transparency and independence. My path began in 2015, when the crisis in Greece propelled me to co-found AthensLive, a nonprofit collective dedicated to covering the country’s most important and underreported stories. Driven by experience of how misinformation distorts public debate, I realized the need for new tools and approaches to support democracy.   In 2017, this drive led me to build my coding skills through the Lede Program at Columbia, where I honed data methods and built networks to enrich the journalistic community back home. My aim was to help create a new model of independent media – free from the pervasive corruption and political influence that plagued traditional outlets. Since then, I’ve worked tirelessly to share this knowledge in the newsroom and the classroom, helping to foster a culture of critical thinking, rigor and innovation within the journalistic community in Greece and beyond.   In 2020, my fellowship with the Bertha Foundation afforded me the time to delve deep into investigating housing injustices, cultivating long-term collaborations with activists and journalists worldwide. And since 2021, my involvement with RU and CCIJ has further expanded my commitment to cross-border, collaborative journalism. I’ve led teams and investigations that transcend continental boundaries, addressing issues like fossil fuels, environmental degradation, corporate malpractices, disinformation, migration, and human rights. Over the past year, I’ve been utilizing AI technologies to pose systemic questions and uncover hidden patterns in data.  Looking ahead, my goal is to develop resources for journalists everywhere to harness technology responsibly. By building global networks and training the next generation of reporters, I believe we can empower communities to hold power to account. Ultimately, my work is anchored in the belief that bold, independent investigative journalism remains vital to safeguarding democracy.","I serve as the lead data journalist and editor for these investigations, guiding data collection, analysis, and visualization in partnership with local reporters and editors at the **Center for Collaborative Investigative Journalism (CCIJ)** and **Reporters United (RU)**. While I design the data architecture and workflows, on-the-ground teams contribute the interviews, fieldwork, and editorial input that lend depth and urgency to each story. We move from raw evidence and personal stories to tightly verified facts, ensuring our work stands up to scrutiny and drives tangible impact.  In the [_Democracy Deferred_](https://veza.news/investigative-series/democracy-deferred/) series on the 2023 Nigerian elections, I, along with my colleague **Yuxi Wang**, spearheaded an investigation into official election results that were withheld, altered, or never uploaded to the [Independent National Electoral Commission portal](https://www.inecelectionresults.ng/elections/types). We compiled over 170,000 polling-unit documents and used OCR paired with computer vision modeling and crowdsourced verification to pinpoint missing or blurred forms. Despite facing server blocks and official “technical hitches,” we created a unified dataset exposing clear gaps in the electoral record. Fellow journalists on the ground in Nigeria leveraged these findings to highlight voter suppression, canceled results, and other serious irregularities.  For our gender-based violence investigations in Eswatini and Zimbabwe, I applied a similarly data-driven approach. By scraping and OCRing more than 4,600 High Court judgments – and using ChatGPT4 prompts to classify them – we uncovered systemic shortfalls in legal proceedings for rape, sexual assault, domestic violence, and police harassment. The resulting reports, [_Without Justice_](https://veza.news/article/2024/10/24/without-justice-how-eswatinis-system-is-failing-victims-of-gender-based-violence/) and [_It’s Haunting Me_](https://veza.news/article/2024/10/31/its-haunting-me-how-alleged-police-persecution-of-sex-workers-is-crippling-their-way-of-life/), sparked renewed advocacy for legal reforms. Lawyers, NGOs, and survivors have cited our findings to push for institutional accountability and stronger protection policies. Meanwhile, [GIJN interviewed our team](https://gijn.org/stories/10-steps-data-expose-gender-violence-eswatini/) and showcased our 10-step guide for identifying key data, refining our methodology, and exposing a systemic failure of justice.  Turning to Greece and Europe, I investigated how financial power intersects with public governance. In [_Μαξίμου: Στην υπηρεσία των Ελλήνων εφοπλιστών και της Ρωσίας_](https://www.reportersunited.gr/14816/maximou-stin-ypiresia-ton-efopliston/), part of [ICIJ’s _Caspian Cabals_](https://www.icij.org/investigations/caspian-cabals/about-caspian-cabals-investigation/), we revealed how top officials – including those in the Prime Minister’s office – paved the way for shipping tycoons and Russian-linked enterprises. Meanwhile, [_Mέγας χορηγός των ελληνικών ενώσεων ασθενών η φαρμακοβιομηχανία_](https://www.reportersunited.gr/13971/farmakoviomichania-enoseis-asthenon/), produced alongside [Investigate Europe](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/themes/investigations/deadly-prices-europe-big-pharma-medicines), shed light on how pharmaceutical firms influence drug pricing by forging strategic ties with patient associations. Finally, [_Minotaur Captured_](https://www.reportersunited.gr/en/14444/minotaur-captured-eurobank/) (part of the [Urban Journalism Network’s _Ghost Debts_ series](https://urbanjournalism.org/ghost-debts/)) exposed who profits from real-estate auctions in a climate of limited public records. We navigated incomplete data in the Greek Cadaster, tapped professional-only portals, and verified sale details one transaction at a time, producing a step-by-step methodology that promotes oversight in a system often cloaked in opacity.  Across these projects, I transform scattered or guarded datasets into accessible, verifiable records. By openly sharing methodology and partnering with global teams, I make it possible for others to replicate or expand on our work, furthering policy debates and strengthening civil society. This fusion of advanced data analysis and ground-level reporting allows our journalism to expose systemic failings, enrich public discourse, and demand change where it’s most urgently needed.","English, Greek",https://veza.news/investigative-series/democracy-deferred/,https://veza.news/article/2024/10/24/without-justice-how-eswatinis-system-is-failing-victims-of-gender-based-violence/,https://veza.news/article/2024/10/31/its-haunting-me-how-alleged-police-persecution-of-sex-workers-is-crippling-their-way-of-life/,https://www.reportersunited.gr/14816/maximou-stin-ypiresia-ton-efopliston/,https://www.reportersunited.gr/13971/farmakoviomichania-enoseis-asthenon/,https://www.reportersunited.gr/en/14444/minotaur-captured-eurobank/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1faWjQW5-OI5L3mV4y4pwfuTAGXBz6NXr/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YGPuY4dW2cznfD2395wFb-v66hfbpune/view?usp=sharing
Germany,Der SPIEGEL,Big,Shortlist,,Der SPIEGEL - Department Daten & Visualisierungen (= Data & Visuals),"I’m excited to share what our team at Der SPIEGEL has been up to for the SIGMA Awards. The past couple of years have been quite a journey for us. For much too long print and online graphics, data journalism, and front-end design had been separate teams at Der SPIEGEL. In March 2023 we finally succeeded in joining all of them into a unified, dynamic group. Our aim was to join forces and to break down the existing boundaries between the disciplines. This integration has allowed us to leverage diverse expertise to tell stories in the most compelling ways.  Our transformation from a service-oriented team to an independent journalistic powerhouse has enabled us to fully embrace digital storytelling, significantly reducing our focus on print graphics. This strategy already pays off, since our online stories successfully grab the spotlight and are regularly featured as opener on the spiegel.de landing page. We’ve also been shaking things up on the tech side, diving into state-of-the-art tools and frameworks like Svelte 5, Web components, and WebSockets. Working in modules and components enabled us to reuse patterns on many occasions. These innovations have supercharged our storytelling and widened our toolbox.  As a team lead, I’m immensely proud of the strides we’ve made in just a year and a half. In all modesty, I would claim that our team now is a powerhouse of visual and data journalism in Germany and at the forefront of data journalism, with an extremely wide portfolio of skills and topics.  We’re excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in data journalism and to share our journey with the SIGMA Awards community.","Our team’s portfolio showcases a wide range of innovative projects that highlight our expertise in data and visual journalism. The submitted projects are representative of: * **3D visualizations** that allow us to transport our readers to places that are difficult to access. We show what it looks like in the tunnels in the Gaza Strip, but also what the scenery was like during the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. * We use **visual investigations and OSINT** technologies to reconstruct events in photos, social media material or with satellite images. For the Trump assassination, we reconstructed the course of events second by second. When researching North Korean weapons, we were able to trace and visually narrate the path of North Korean missile parts from production to cross-border transport through Russia to deployment in the war in Ukraine. * We employ **visual storytelling** to present abstract data relationships in a playful and comprehensible manner. In our article on the LAION-5B data set, we illustrate the workings of an AI trained on word-image pairs of an unimaginable scale. They would fill 58 large libraries. Our storytelling on student housing in Germany is representative of stories in which abstract data is conveyed using maps and graphics with transitions to form a narrative. * We use **data-driven trackers** to add context to our reporting and keep it constantly up to date. Leading up to the general elections, we replaced individual poll reports with a continuously updated tracker averaging data from multiple institutes. (first published in 2024, updated until February 2025). Alongside the article we’ve published widgets that have been embedded in many article as well as directly on our front page in the weeks leading to the election date. * Last year, we rebuilt our **election reporting** from the ground up. We now present live results using visualizations designed with mobile app usability in mind. We focus on readability at the first glance, but with many opportunities to explore the data in detail. The visualizations are built in Svelte 5 and use WebSockets for live updates (see cover letter on tech) * We create **user-centered interactives**, such as exploring possible parliamentary constellations amidst the rising influence of the AfD-party. This and similar formats were among our most successful forms of journalism when it comes to audience engagement and allow our readers to delve into data-driven contexts by themselves. * Finally, the craft of **data journalism** remains central to our projects. Getting access to and sometimes scraping data, processing, modelling and visualizing data is part of our team’s everyday work.

United Kingdom,"The Financial Times Visual Investigations team Sam Joiner, Editor Alison Killing, Senior Reporter Peter Andringa, Graphics Journalist Chris Campbell, Digital Designer",Big,Shortlist,,The Financial Times Visual Investigations team,"The FT visual investigation team is an interdisciplinary group of journalists using computational tools and traditional reporting to produce investigations in visual formats.  A new reporting function in the FT newsroom, the team is doing something novel: consistently publishing deeply reported articles that blend visual evidence with digital storytelling techniques.   The team also works closely with our network of foreign correspondents to ensure readers understand local perspectives and the human impact of events.  Through our focus on Ukraine over the past year, we have been able to showcase the very best of this work and our reporting has had a lasting and profound impact.   Following the publication of the Mariupol investigation, repair work resumed for some residents, providing a rare moment of respite for those living in truly dire conditions. The findings were widely shared, sparking discussions about Russia’s occupation. The story has become a key reference for countering Kremlin propaganda.  The investigation into abducted Ukrainian children led to immediate international condemnation. The White House called the findings “despicable and appalling,” while UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy labeled it a “shocking violation” of human rights.   Most importantly, locating the missing children has allowed the Ukrainian authorities to open discussions with Russia to secure their return home.  FT readers were so moved by the suffering of residents in Kherson that several funded medical treatment for Tetyana, a woman who lost her legs in a Russian drone attack.   The revelations in these widely-read investigations contributed to mounting evidence of war crimes. They have shaped global discourse, influenced policy responses and made a tangible difference to the lives of those affected by conflict.  They stand as a testament to what can be achieved when you combine forensic reporting with first-class visual storytelling.","As Putin’s full-scale invasion enters a fourth year and Trump attempts to recast the conflict, exposing Russian war crimes and profiteering has never been more important. In a series of powerful reports, the FT visual investigations team revealed the relentless aggression endured by Ukrainians and the layers of Moscow’s war machine.  In a groundbreaking investigation, facial recognition software and public records were used to identify abducted Ukrainian children who had been given false Russian identities and listed for adoption, revealing this practice for the first time.  By comparing two datasets — 4,300 missing Ukrainian children and 41,000 Russian adoption profiles — the team uncovered cases previously unknown to the Ukrainian authorities. Amazon’s Rekognition software allowed us to process 182mn image comparisons, with high-probability matches manually reviewed with custom-built tools.   To ensure accuracy and help safeguard the children and families affected, the team worked with Ukrainian authorities to verify identities before officials began the process of returning the children. The story not only provides irrefutable evidence of Russia’s efforts to erase the identity of Ukrainians, but represents a novel use of AI within data journalism.  Since the fall of Mariupol to Russian forces, Putin has sought to present the city’s reconstruction as a symbol of post-war renewal. Russian media reports show grand redevelopment plans and modern apartment blocks. Yet behind this facade, the city’s occupants are dealing with a very different reality.   Local testimonies and extensive on-the-ground footage sourced via local Telegram groups dismantle Putin’s new ‘Potemkin village’ and reveal the appalling conditions endured by residents. Many live in leaking, bombed-out structures, open to the elements through harsh Ukrainian winters. At the time of publication, some had lived like this for more than two years.   Forensic financial reporting exposed the profiteering of Russian oligarchs capitalising on the sham rebuild. Through tracing the work of a major construction firm operating in the city we revealed the businessmen behind these lucrative contracts.   The investigation provides a chilling counterpoint to Russian disinformation and stands as a landmark piece of conflict reporting.  A harrowing report on life in Kherson exposed an unprecedented Russian military strategy: the systematic use of drones to terrorise and depopulate a city. Deeply reported, the story gives voice to civilians who have become targets of a relentless aerial assault. Through firsthand testimonies and verified footage, the investigation revealed how Russian forces are using Kherson as a testing ground for advanced drone warfare, chasing people through the streets and striking markets, homes and even ambulances.   The piece captures the psychological devastation of living under constant bombardment, detailing the desperate survival strategies of the residents who remain in the city. With powerful on-the-ground reporting and striking photography of those who have been maimed by the drones, this story is a testament to the resilience of Kherson’s population and a chilling warning about the direction of warfare. The article showcases investigative reporting, public service journalism, and narrative storytelling at its finest.",English,https://ig.ft.com/mariupol/,https://on.ft.com/41eZX81,https://on.ft.com/41vw9pk,,https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTNPXs2LoQeAz_8VqLkQ_mpo4fqVx2STGd3x2IyluyYwkBpGQ1lhrwMRhWpT6ErzE_QZ0JFu4hypPQ4/pub,,,
United States of America,The Pudding,Small,Shortlist,,The Pudding,"We’re a small group that operates as a collective rather than hierarchical team.  Much of our work is done autonomously, with individuals choosing their essays and owning the whole story, from research to code. Each team member can do every step: research and reporting, data analysis, design, writing, and code.  One luxury that separates us from traditional newsrooms is our approach to publishing urgency. There are no deadlines because we are not tied to news events. With breaking news, it’s difficult to gamble on weird, ambitious ideas if they must be published. No one will take on risky, creative projects when they’re staring at a deadline.  So we experiment, a lot. The creative process feels more like workshopping a movie script than critiquing a bar chart. Consequently, many of our ideas are killed during production, but we wouldn’t have it any other way! It means we’re trying unproven, never-done-before things.  We’re also trying to advance the craft. Visual journalism is still in its infancy. We don’t have an established pattern language found in traditional reporting. Sometimes we’ll attempt an unfamiliar visual approach—not because it’s guaranteed to work, but because we won’t know until we try. Rarely do organizations have the liberty to take such risks, yet we’re small enough to experiment in the pursuit of quality.","The Pudding explains ideas debated in culture with visual essays. We’re not chasing current events or clickbait. We choose topics where visuals inform and entertain.

Já foi premiada com a terceira colocação na categoria on-line do Prêmio de Direitos Humanos em Jornalismo, oferecido pelo Movimento de Justiça e Direitos Humanos, e foi finalista 2023 do Prêmio ABMES de Jornaismo, na área de Educação.","Para este prêmio, eu, Paula Pimenta, repórter da Agência Senado de Notícias (Brasil) inscrevo duas reportagens de relevantes valores sociais. A primeira, na área ambiental, trata das reais ameaças das  mudanças climáticas sobre a Caatinga, bioma exclusivamente brasileiro. A reportagem demonstra por estudos, números e entrevistas os perigos iminentes de desertificação e perda de espécies como resultado das alterações climáticas em todo o mundo. Dados oficiais demontram que 42,6% dos 844,4 mil quilômetros quadrados do bioma já foram convertidos para outra destinação. E do que ainda resta, muito já está fragmentado, o que prejudica a capacidade de adaptação e dispersão das espécies, assim como atrapalha os serviços ecossistêmicos. Projeta-se para 2060 perda de espécies vegetais e animais em pelo menos 90% do território desse ecossistema. A reportagem é composta de números oficiais e amplos dados sobre desmatamento e quantidade de espécies em risco na fauna da Caatinga.  O outro projeto a ser inscrito mostra como o analfabetismo ainda é uma realidade a ser combatida no Brasil. A reportagem aponta que após 20 anos como meta de duas edições do do Plano Nacional de Educação, ainda há 11,4 milhões de brasileiros que não sabem ler e/ou escrever. A reportagem aprofunda-se nessa realidade, não apenas com a apresentação de números que traduzem a problemática, mas ouvindo especialistas e responsáveis oficiais pela área de educação no país. Mostra ainda que as discrepâncias de raça/cor e socioeconômicas também afetam a alfabetização. Enquanto entre as pessoas de raça branca e amarela os índices de analfabetismo são de 4,3% e 2,5%, respectivamente, as de raça preta e parda amargam percentuais mais do que duas vezes maiores: 10,1% e 8,8%. Entre os indígenas, são 16,1%, ou seja, quase quatro vezes mais do que entre brancos. Também compõe a matéria a apresentação de programas extraoficiais que têm como meta superar o analfabetismo.

Philippines,"Generative AI in the Newsroom blog, Reuters Institute",Small,,,Jaemark Tordecilla,"I am honored to submit my portfolio for the Sigma Awards, representing a pioneering voice in AI-driven journalism from the Global South. In an era where much of the conversation around AI in newsrooms remains speculative, I have been at the forefront of building real, functional AI tools that empower journalists in their reporting.  For over a decade, I have worked at the intersection of journalism, technology, and public-interest reporting, leading digital innovation in newsrooms. In the past year and a half, I have been one of the most influential voices in AI for journalism, not just as a commentator but as a tool builder, someone who develops practical, accessible, and high-impact AI solutions for investigative work. My projects, including Budget Bot and the COA Beat Assistant, have demonstrated how AI can be leveraged to transform the way journalists analyze financial records, audit reports, and government budgets. These are not theoretical experiments; they are widely used, working tools that actively support newsrooms in holding power to account.  What sets my work apart is that I did this not from an AI research hub or a large, well-funded media organization with an engineering team. Instead, I have shown how journalists, especially those from the Global South, can take the lead in developing their own AI tools, designing solutions based on firsthand experience covering governance, corruption, and public accountability. Beyond my own work, my tools have also served as blueprints for other newsrooms looking to integrate AI into their reporting processes, proving that AI-driven investigative journalism is not just for elite, well-resourced institutions but can be adopted and replicated in diverse media environments.  I am excited about the opportunity to continue to showcase how AI, when applied with purpose and practicality, can be a force multiplier for journalists worldwide.","My work focuses on leveraging AI and data journalism to enhance investigative reporting, improve access to complex government records, and empower journalists with tools that automate and streamline data analysis. Through AI-powered applications, I have built solutions that make large datasets more accessible and actionable for journalists and the public.    One of my key projects is the Budget Bot, an AI-powered tool that allows journalists, researchers, and citizens to navigate the Philippine National Budget efficiently. The country’s budget is a vast dataset that contains over 730,000 line items in a complex data file. Budget Bot enables users to query this information in plain language, surfacing allocations, trends, and spending priorities that would otherwise be buried in spreadsheets. The primary challenge was structuring this immense dataset so that AI could process it accurately while maintaining the integrity of budget data. Through prompt engineering and natural language processing, Budget Bot now serves as a user-friendly interface for public fiscal information, helping journalists uncover spending patterns and potential misallocations.    Another major project, the COA Beat Assistant, enhances investigative journalism by helping reporters analyze thousands of pages of Commission on Audit (COA) reports. Journalists often face challenges navigating the dense and technical language of these reports, which contain crucial findings on government spending. Initially, attempts to automate the summarization process produced vague and unhelpful results, as the AI struggled to distinguish between routine audit language and truly significant findings. The breakthrough came when I refined the workflow design, focusing on extracting and structuring insights from the most critical sections of these reports. This tool enables journalists to quickly pinpoint potential issues like overpriced procurements and questionable budget allocations, helping them prioritize which areas require deeper investigation. Instead of replacing investigative work, COA Beat Assistant accelerates the discovery process, ensuring that journalists spend less time sorting through documents and more time uncovering accountability stories.    These projects exemplify how AI can augment investigative journalism rather than replace it. Instead of merely automating reporting, these tools help journalists work more efficiently, extract insights from complex datasets, and hold public officials accountable. Their impact has been seen in faster turnaround times for investigative stories and greater public engagement with open government data.    Unlike many AI-driven newsroom initiatives that rely on large engineering teams, I developed these tools completely alone, demonstrating how individual journalists with technical expertise can harness AI to address investigative challenges. This highlights the potential of AI to democratize investigative journalism, enabling reporters to create tailored solutions without the need for extensive institutional resources. Journalists, especially from the Global South, can leverage their firsthand experience covering governance and corruption to design AI tools that meet their specific reporting needs, ensuring that technological advancements are driven by those who understand the problems best.  These innovations serve as practical models for integrating AI into journalism, ensuring that technology supports—not supplants—the role of journalists in uncovering the truth.",English,https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/teaching-a-customgpt-to-help-inspect-the-philippine-national-budget-2acadd25a172,https://github.com/tordecilla/budget-bot,https://www.instagram.com/budgetbotph/,https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/i-created-ai-chatbot-speak-my-countrys-budget-heres-how-i-did-it,https://generative-ai-newsroom.com/teaching-a-custom-gpt-to-read-audit-reports-and-support-watchdog-journalism-1e124196ca15,https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/i-created-ai-tool-help-investigative-journalists-find-stories-audit-reports-heres-how-i-did-it,,
India,Rest of World,Small,,,Srishti Jaswal,"I am a 29-year-old freelance investigative journalist in India. Throughout my six years of journalistic career, I have tried to quench my curiosity as a journalist by combining rigorous research and reporting. I have been awarded multiple awards and fellowships including the Digital Witness Fellowship at Princeton University in 2024, the Ochberg Fellowship at Columbia Journalism School in 2023, as well as the Lorenzo Natali Best Emerging Journalist Award in 2021.   The story was a collaboration between Rest Of World, the Pulitzer Center, and the Digital Witness Lab at Princeton University. The story is a good example of how a collaboration can elevate a story at multiple levels. While I had access to data and sources within the BJP, Digital Witness Lab provided me tools to extract and analyze the data, whereas Pulitzer Center helped me to train myself in technology reporting and cover costs as a freelance journalist.  This investigative reporting as Pulitzer Centre’s AI Accountability fellow under the mentorship of Marina Walker Guevara, the center’s executive editor, and award-winning journalist Surya Mattu gives a rare inside ride to international readers about a small Indian town and how it is influenced by WhatsApp. The story shows political parties leverage the platform without transparency and accountability to spread their message and influence public opinion, raising concerns about misinformation and fake news. As a journalist based in India, I am very proud of this project, as amid the alarming fall in press freedom in India I know how challenging yet crucial this investigation is. I would be glad if Sigma Awards commitee considers this project worthy of recognition.","With more than 400 million users, almost everyone in India uses WhatsApp, a 15-year-old application for chatting and calling. It’s no surprise that election money has flowed in the direction of WhatsApp, which has become a battlefield for contemporary Indian elections with thousands of WhatsApp admins sending propaganda messages to every voter. But who creates these messages? How does a propaganda message travel in a country like India—a land with high digital penetration despite low digital literacy?   For this investigation, I analyzed activity across BJP-affiliated WhatsApp groups in a small Indian town to understand its role in the BJP’s election campaign. The findings show how the BJP sets the narrative on WhatsApp about what gets discussed in the elections, and how. We also documented how the closed nature of WhatsApp and the ease with which messages can travel from group to group results in a blurring of lines between political and personal speech, making it hard for voters to know which messages have come directly from the BJP and which have emerged organically. BJP workers appear to take advantage of this ambiguity to push the party’s far-right messaging. The meticulous operation shows how the party has built a distribution mechanism on WhatsApp that is so large in scale, that it creates a clear imbalance as the elections approach. Based on our findings, the Mozzila Foundation wrote a letter to Meta pushing them to acknowledge political actors on its platforms. Meta in response addressed the findings and said it will look into surrogate political activities on its platforms.  In another part of the series, my reporting shows the extent to which the BJP uses a mobile application called Saral to collect detailed data about Indian Citizens, which it can use to analyze voter engagement down to the level of individual booths. The story raised concerns about the scale and detail of this data collection exercise as it could give the BJP an electoral advantage by allowing them to target voters at a granular level. It is concerning, mostly because a booth is a very small entity — it’s only 800, 700 people at a booth. At that scale, it is easy for a political party to know who supports them and who does not. Data of this kind could be used to target voters based on certain characteristics, such as by shaping campaign messaging and organizing events aimed at specific communities including micro-targeting based on caste and religion.   These stories were daunting investigations, especially because they focused on far-right BJP’s internal communication channels. I faced increased online harassment and doxxing on social media after the story was published.   However, I was flabbergasted when on June 3, 2024, the Disinfo Lab, a propaganda research outlet formed by members of India’s spy agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) discredited my work as Pulitzer Center’s AI accountability fellow with Rest Of World as ’foreign interference in Indian elections,’ placing me at a significant risk while working in India.",English,https://restofworld.org/2024/bjp-whatsapp-modi/,https://restofworld.org/2024/bjp-saral-app-data-gathering/,,,,,,
Indonesia,Narasi,Small,,,Narasi,"We are submitting this portfolio on behalf of our newsroom, a small, independent investigative outlet based in Indonesia that focuses on producing data-driven, visually engaging investigative journalism designed for young audiences across social media platforms.  Founded with the belief that investigative journalism must evolve to meet younger, digital-first audiences, our team combines traditional field reporting with advanced data collection and innovative analytical methods, making complex issues like disinformation, environmental destruction, and political influence accessible through short-form video, interactive visuals, and creative social media storytelling.  We have been active in investigative journalism and visual storytelling for over 7 years, but our transformation into a data-driven newsroom accelerated in the past 5 years, driven by the urgent need to expose corporate and political wrongdoing tied to environmental and human rights issues.  We are particularly inspired by international leaders in investigative data journalism, such as ProPublica, ICIJ, OCCRP etc, who show how collaboration, data science, and bold storytelling can create real impact. Locally, we have also been mentored and supported by senior investigative journalists in Indonesia’s Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) and collaborated with data experts at institutions like Monash Data Futures Institute and Greenpeace Indonesia, helping us build the technical capacity to carry out ambitious, data-heavy investigations.  We are proud of our evolution from a small, scrappy team producing short documentaries into a newsroom capable of fusing investigative rigor with creative visual storytelling — and making complex data work accessible and understandable to millions of young Indonesians.  We hope this portfolio demonstrates the potential for innovation and impact from small, independent investigative teams, and we are honored to be considered for this award.","Our newsroom presents this data-driven investigative portfolio, showcasing how a small, video-based newsroom in Southeast Asia can innovate and produce impactful investigations despite limited resources, legal risks, and restricted data access. In 2023-2024, we combined big data processing, AI tools, spatial analysis, and creative storytelling to investigate disinformation campaigns, environmental destruction, and political hypocrisy.  Project 1: Tracking the Digital Hate Campaign Against Rohingya Refugees  This project uncovered how organized digital hate campaigns fueled disinformation against Rohingya refugees in Indonesia, escalating into real-world violence. Using custom web crawlers, social media scraping, bot detection algorithms, and sentiment analysis, we processed over 1.08 million data points from TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter/X. Combining this with political network analysis and field reporting in Aceh, the investigation exposed a coordinated disinformation ecosystem, driven by bot farms, influencers, and political actors. The work became a reference for civil society groups monitoring online hate.  Project 2: Presidential Campaign Jet Tracking and Carbon Footprint Analysis  This project tracked the private jet usage of Indonesia’s presidential candidates, calculating their carbon emissions and linking their luxury flights to sponsors with ties to corruptors and mining oligarchs. Using real-time flight tracking, ownership tracing, and cross-referencing flight IDs with corporate records, we revealed how candidates’ environmental promises contradicted their private air travel practices. The findings — including one candidate’s chartered flights emitting the equivalent CO2 of 58,000 trees’ absorption capacity — triggered public conversations on environmental hypocrisy in Indonesian politics.  Project 3: Nickel Downstreaming’s Environmental and Social Cost in Weda Bay  In collaboration with Greenpeace Indonesia and Khairun University, this project combined scientific water testing, 20 years of satellite imagery analysis, and spatial mapping to document how nickel mining in Central Halmahera polluted rivers, triggered deforestation, and displaced local communities. Using Mapbiomas, Nusantara Atlas, QGIS, and Google MyMaps, we mapped 230,796 hectares of nickel concessions and traced severe flood risks linked to deforestation. The work merged scientific data, human-centered stories, and visual analysis, making it both accessible to youth and impactful for policymakers.  Regards method and techniques, Our disinformation investigation used time-based clustering, and heatmap visualizations to identify bot networks amplifying anti-Rohingya hate speech across platforms.  In Weda Bay, we combined 20 years of satellite imagery analysis with water quality testing to link deforestation, pollution, and flooding directly to Indonesia’s nickel mining boom.  Collectively, the three key investigations in this portfolio — Rohingya digital hate campaigns, presidential campaign carbon footprints, and nickel-driven environmental damage in Weda Bay — reached over 8 million views across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms.  The Rohingya investigation was cited by fact-checking organizations and civil society groups, becoming part of a broader push for platform accountability regarding hate speech and refugee protection. The presidential jet tracking project triggered national conversations around green hypocrisy, elite privilege, and corporate-political collusion, especially regarding campaign funding from mining oligarchs.

Since the start of the full-scale invasion in Ukraine, covering the war, military losses, and war crimes has also become our key objective. Russian authorities do everything to conceal information about the war and dissent: they don’t reveal the losses numbers, hide political cases deep inside the court system, prosecute those who dare to speak out. But our data team is constantly working on breaching this wall of secrecy. By harvesting open, but chaotic and elusive official data, by compiling it into workable databases and efficient monitoring tools, we are trying to stay ahead of the state machine of repression and propaganda.  Since 2020, when Mediazona’s data team emerged, we’ve released dozens of exclusive investigations, research, and interactive features. This work was quoted by prominent international media (e.g., The New York Times, The Associated Press, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal) and won prestigious journalistic awards, including the European Press Prize. Although we constantly collaborate with other media outlets (see our “Price of Bakhmut” submission), the work we are presenting in this portfolio was done by our journalists alone. Due to safety reasons and military censorship in Russia, we cannot disclose the names of all members of our data team. Please, contact us if this portfolio will be mentioned, so we could provide you with information on how to credit the authors in a safe and appropriate manner.","This portfolio showcases the investigative journalism of Mediazona’s data team, focusing on three long-term projects that have significantly contributed to public understanding—both in Russia and globally—political repression and the Ukraine war’s toll on Russia. **Monitoring Russia’s wanted list.** Russia’s Interior Ministry maintains a publicly accessible but cumbersome online wanted list. Searching for names requires a full name and year of birth, plus solving a CAPTCHA—and a 5-minute cooldown before another try. Given the scale of political repression, this has become a daily concern for many, an everyday necessity. Mediazona’s data team had been monitoring the list for years, but in [February 2024](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/13/wanted-trl), we automated the process, downloading the entire database (by solving CAPTCHAs algorithmically) and creating a user-friendly, searchable copy on our website. This revealed dozens of cases of political persecution by Russian law enforcement. Since its release, the list has been updated twice (in [May](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/05/15/wanted-may-trl) and in [November](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/11/26/wanted-trl?p=1&t=all&s=statusAll&q=)), with continued planned updates for 2025. With nearly 300,000 website views and millions reached via social media, 20% of users were English speakers. Major international media have [cited](https://apnews.com/article/russia-estonia-kallas-wanted-list-4ca301df09eace6643be66a9a4a93fe8) our data on foreigners wanted by Russia. **Monitoring Russia’s court system.** For years, we’ve been monitoring Russia’s court system, particularly cases related to political charges such as “terrorism” and “fake news about the army.” The database we compiled, containing over 100 million court records spanning a decade, is constantly being updated. This dataset has enabled us to publish hundreds of news articles and in-depth investigations into state repression. Key investigations include the [Baimak protests](https://zona.media/article/2024/07/11/76) (sadly, only available in Russian), where 76 Bashkortostan residents faced charges for protesting the conviction of an environmental activist, and “Fine after fine”, which exposed how the state pushes [“foreign agents”](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/05/17/foreign-agents-trl) (anti-Putin activists and journalists) towards criminal prosecution. By combining real-time monitoring with archival research, we’ve been able to reveal both individual cases of repression and broader oppressive patterns. Another major topic within the court database is [AWOL](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/04/12/record-trl) cases in the Russian army, which spiked in 2024. **Monitoring losses of the Russian military in the war with Ukraine.** Russian authorities are hiding the death toll of the Ukraine war. Mediazona, in collaboration with BBC News Russian and volunteers, [tracks Russian losses](https://en.zona.media/article/2022/05/20/casualties_eng-trl) in Ukraine using open-source data. Over three years, we’ve verified almost 100 thousand names. The database aids reporting, like when a small fine arts museum had its collection published online. We [discovered](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/08/13/artsalsk-trl) 41 paintings of men who died in the war, and by cross-referencing them with our database (which contained over 60,000 names at the time), we were able to identify five previously unknown KIA soldiers. **The last article in the portfolio**, “[Cover me](https://en.zona.media/article/2024/06/06/blankets-trl),” has a unique background. By analyzing data from the Russian Post, we uncovered how a military initiative allowing civilians to send packages to soldiers went terribly wrong. A single medical lieutenant became a recipient of 180 tonnes of old blankets and warm items from across Russia. Despite appeals to stop, donations continued; what became of the blankets and where they are now remains unclear.","English, Russian",https://en.zona.media/article/2024/02/13/wanted-trl,https://en.zona.media/article/2024/11/26/wanted-trl,https://en.zona.media/article/2024/06/06/blankets-trl,https://en.zona.media/article/2024/08/13/artsalsk-trl,https://zona.media/article/2024/07/11/76,https://en.zona.media/article/2024/04/12/record-trl,https://en.zona.media/article/2024/05/17/foreign-agents-trl,

Kyrgyzstan,T-Media [https://t-media.kg/](https://),Small,,,"Nargiiza Anarbay kyzy, T-Media Organization","(This text was translated with the help of ChatGPT)  This is the portfolio of three beginner data journalists.  Kenzhebu Mamazydykova has worked in journalism for over 10 years. Zyyagul Bolot kyzy has been in the field for more than 5 years, and both have experience in investigative journalism. I, Nargiza Anarbay kyzy, have also worked in journalism for over 5 years. However, none of us had ever tried data analysis before.  Every time I looked at statistics from the National Statistical Committee, I wanted to tell a compelling story using those numbers in simple terms. But I struggled—either spending too much time manually calculating and comparing data or not knowing where to start.  Yet, I always felt that the data held important insights.  That’s why, for three years in a row, I applied to a data journalism school. And now, this is the result of our learning.  We believe that data journalism needs to be developed more actively in our region, as it allows us to highlight critical issues with factual evidence.  All three of us worked on these materials while being part of T-Media, an independent media organization based in southern Kyrgyzstan, which remains one of the few independent outlets in the region.","(This text was translated with the help of ChatGPT)  In this project, I was responsible for data collection, calculations, and the design of visuals. We are a team of beginners who attempted to prepare a data-driven report for the first time after training with Internews.  1. Recipients of the Highest State Awards in Kyrgyzstan In our first material, we analyzed who received the highest state awards of Kyrgyzstan during the years of independence. We examined which president awarded the most and to whom, how often these awards were given to women, and which professional fields were most frequently recognized.  For example, we discovered that leaders and high-ranking officials were most often the recipients. Out of 1,952 awardees, only 17% were women.    2. Accessibility of Public Buildings in Osh For our second project, we independently created a database and examined whether the city of Osh—often referred to as the second capital of Kyrgyzstan—had wheelchair ramps that met official standards.  To do this, we visited 80 government and municipal buildings, measured each ramp, recorded the data, and took photographs. The results were alarming: only 2 out of 80 ramps complied with accessibility standards.  We also conducted an experiment, filming a social media video based on our findings.  The project gained traction on Facebook, where local activists shared the material, acknowledging the problem and expressing gratitude for the data.   3. Maternal Mortality in Kyrgyzstan The issue of maternal mortality sparked major discussions in Kyrgyz society, especially after a 25-year-old woman died in childbirth, leaving behind two small children. That summer, four women died in childbirth in a short period.  Families of the deceased blamed doctors for negligence, while medical professionals insisted they had done their best.  We analyzed ten years of data on maternal mortality and identified the main causes behind these tragic cases.  4. Fires and Their Causes in Kyrgyzstan This material examined where fires occur most frequently and what causes them.  We found that the highest number of fires happened in the capital city, and residential buildings were most often affected. The leading cause of fires was electrical issues.  5. Obtaining a Driver’s License in Kyrgyzstan For this project, we collected five years’ worth of data from government institutions on driver’s license exams. We analyzed trends and compared private and public driving schools.  We discovered that students from public driving schools had a lower chance of passing the exam, yet more people still enrolled in them.  To investigate whether corruption played a role in this, we conducted an online survey.  6. International School Olympiads This material was presented in card format and contained insights into Kyrgyzstan’s participation and victories in international academic Olympiads.  The topic was relevant because the education sector faces critical but often overlooked issues, such as:  Lack of funding for participation and preparation Inadequate teaching methods The material gained attention on Facebook, especially from trainers of the national team and educators. They confirmed the challenges we highlighted and emphasized the importance of finding solutions.","Basic materials in Kyrgyz, translation into English.",https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BVI_HNsOPf8rvkgzgochqQt9S4D7_9AcuOuvz8aEVBI/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XaS68BSBd_CX4hZdG6tGMZ5HT-z5LJFF2bNi3K-TWjU/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZrzJOauZgZ6s8RmyLZfpEr9s1Ax_DmMihzam-9DHvPQ/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a6mQrwFAapTfpthE7SnB5uR6am5b4p6McSSSZ9YIfII/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ELGjluJsFLR8w-ycv_Ha9CByXc6zw4k4UEsGukao00k/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x_cX8dmanc_Aa7vcD7501rb6AWNGRTYdDmaIVoFOl_c/edit?usp=sharing,,
United Kingdom,Reach PLC,Big,,,Annie Gouk,"Having worked as a data journalist at Reach for nearly a decade, Annie Gouk is currently the Data Investigations Editor. She leads data-driven investigative journalism across Reach’s regional and national titles, with a particular focus on high impact special projects. As part of her role, Annie explores innovative storytelling formats, particularly with her use of long-form “scrollytelling”. Her work involves collaboration with other journalists, designers and coders to produce deep-dive visual investigations and campaigns, with Annie acting as project manager as well as data journalist, to ensure these pieces are delivered to brief and on time.  Typically months in the making, Annie’s data-led investigations involve tracking down and analysing scores of complex datasets, using her advanced skills in Excel and Google Sheets to mine exclusive stories from official sources. This is then combined with her more traditional journalism skills, including her ability to write with flair and accuracy for a non-specialist audience.  Annie’s focus is on regional inequality and social injustice, finding original ideas that particularly resonate with local audiences. As a result, as well as driving pageviews, engagement, and newsletter signups, Annie’s work often also has a more tangible impact. In most of her projects, animated graphs, illustrations and photographs were used as the basis for striking “scrollytelling” stories, folded in with the text so that they would complement and reinforce each other. This format makes these investigations much more dynamic and engaging, allowing the reader to become immersed in the information, guiding them through the narrative and allowing them to easily navigate complex data.","For the _Liverpool: Austerity City_ project, Annie analysed multiple datasets - amalgamating them at a local level for the first time - to scrutinise the impact of austerity measures in four key areas, which were council cuts, poverty, health and homelessness.  This extensive research showed exactly how the decisions made in government have affected people’s lives in Liverpool, revealing a city that has had its public services torn apart, has seen life expectancy go into retreat and where a growing number of children are growing up in poverty.  Released a fortnight before the general election, this exclusive investigation was instrumental in helping local voters make an informed decision, holding those in power accountable and amplifying voices within the community. It garnered hundreds of thousands of views and shares nationwide, with notable figures like James O’Brien and Alistair Campbell, as well as politicians and others, hailing it as a crucial piece of journalism. Meanwhile, Annie’s data analysis for BirminghamLive’s _Child Poverty Emergency_ exposed the shocking scale of deprivation in the city, exploring the factors behind this growing problem and their impact on everything from health and housing, to youth services and crime. The campaign achieved significant impact, with the Mayor of the West Midlands committed to providing 30,000 more free school meals in response. Progress is now being made toward establishing a multibank, with support from a major international retailer, and Birmingham City Council is considering a motion addressing all campaign points, including the appointment of a child poverty tsar. One of the main goals for the campaign was driving change, and it resulted in over 1,200 letters to MPs calling for action using the bespoke widget Annie developed with coders.  Meanwhile, _ROUGH: The stories behind London’s homelessness crisis_ combined stark data analysis with striking photography and unique voices to expose the scandal of rising rough sleeping in the capital to a wider audience, and has received a strong, emotive response from readers.  Annie pulled together statistics on the shocking increase in rough sleeping and deaths while homeless in London with associated figures on households in temporary accommodation and the city’s rental crisis, to provide context and add authority to the strong case studies found by the other journalists working on the piece.  The project has been effective at holding power to account, with the findings from Annie’s research being put to the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan to ask why homelessness has continued to become worse under his watch.  While there are multiple contributors to each of these projects, Annie did all the data analysis and also acted as project manager to bring them to fruition.",English,https://austeritycity.liverpoolecho.co.uk/,https://childpoverty.birminghamlive.co.uk/,https://homelessoflondon.mylondon.news/,,,,,

Latvia,Novaya Gazeta Europe,Big,,,Novaya Gazeta Europe,"Novaya Gazeta Europe was founded in April 2022 by journalists from Novaya Gazeta after its Moscow office was forced to shut down under state pressure. Shortly after, we were designated an ”undesirable organization”, and our editor-in-chief faced criminal charges—all because of our commitment to investigative journalism and fact-based reporting on the war in Ukraine, political repression, and human rights violations.  Despite working in exile from Latvia, we have established ourselves as a leading independent media outlet, using data journalism, investigative reporting, and multimedia storytelling to counter Russian-state propaganda, expose corruption, and document the realities of war. Our data-driven investigations uncover critical issues, including inflation cover-ups, military legal privileges, pharmaceutical shortages, and digital repression. Through web scraping, AI analysis, and manual data collection, we produce evidence-based reports that challenge official narratives.  Our work has had a tangible impact. Investigations like ”Control Purchase” exposed real inflation rates, forcing major retailers to respond publicly. Our reports on preferential legal treatment for war veterans highlighted the collapse of Russia’s judicial system, while our work on online surveillance and political imprisonment has helped document state repression.  We believe that we deserve consideration for this award because our journalism is more than reporting—it is resistance. In an environment where independent media is criminalized and information is erased, we continue to uncover hidden truths. Inspired by the legacy of Novaya Gazeta and our Nobel Peace Prize-winning editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov, we remain committed to holding power accountable and ensuring that independent journalism survives, despite the risks.","Novaya Gazeta Europe is committed to data-driven investigative journalism that provides fact-based insights into Russia’s internal policies, the war in Ukraine, and the impact of state decisions on its citizens. Operating from exile in Latvia, we lack direct access to sources and physical reporting spaces, making data journalism a critical tool in uncovering hidden realities. Russian authorities delete data, restrict statistics, and censor information, so we have adapted by developing our own datasets through web scraping, AI-powered analysis, and manual data collection to ensure accuracy and transparency.  One of our key investigations, ”Control Purchase,” examines how inflation in Russia far exceeds official statistics. While the government claims rising wages offset inflation, our research—based on real-time price tracking—proved otherwise. Conducting this analysis required extracting grocery chain catalog data using computer vision models and AI processing, as official inflation data from Rosstat is unreliable. The report sparked a public debate, forcing X5 Retail Group (owner of Pyaterochka) to issue an official denial, demonstrating the power of data-driven journalism in shaping discourse.  Another investigation exposed preferential treatment of Russian soldiers in the legal system. Since the war in Ukraine began, courts have reduced or dismissed charges against military personnel, even for murder and rape. We manually compiled a database of over 1,130 criminal cases, proving that judges consistently use war participation to mitigate sentences—a reality the government had denied. This report required us to scrape court records, as no unified dataset exists on convicted war veterans.  We also investigated the black market for pharmaceuticals, revealing that sanctions and import restrictions have led to widespread shortages. By analyzing Telegram marketplace data, we found that people were searching for over 1,000 unavailable medications, particularly oncology drugs. This required navigating encrypted chat networks, where illegal sales are actively coordinated.  Our report on digital repression revealed that over 30,000 cases have been initiated against Russian citizens for online activity, from memes to social media comments. Individuals have been fined or imprisoned simply for saving LGBTQ+ symbols on their VKontakte accounts. We analyzed law enforcement practices, exposing how authorities rely on denunciations, airport searches, and leaked databases to target online dissent.  We also uncovered how Russia indoctrinates children into militarized patriotism. By analyzing 10,000+ VKontakte kindergarten groups, we exposed a state-driven effort to promote pro-war ideology in early childhood education.  Economic control is another major theme. In collaboration with Transparency International-Russia, we analyzed state-led nationalizations, revealing that Russian authorities have seized over 1 trillion rubles in assets since 2023. These expropriations target businesses linked to military production and ”unpatriotic” entrepreneurs, with the FSB playing a key role.  Our work is increasingly difficult as Russian authorities delete, restrict, and manipulate data. We overcome this through: - Web scraping & AI-driven analysis to collect data from grocery chains, pharmacies, courts, and social media. - Hand-collected datasets, such as our database of military veterans convicted of crimes. - Monitoring regional publications for censorship, human rights abuses, and economic trends.",Russian,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/10/31/kontrolnaia-zakupka,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/04/11/nepodsudnye,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/01/23/perekupshchiki-zdorovia,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/12/02/laik-sher-srok,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/10/15/kolybel-voiny,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/03/05/iziato-dlia-svoikh,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/11/28/v-rossii-vynuzhdeny-idti-na-kompromiss-s-kachestvom-detalei,
Ecuador,"Mongabay Latam, La Barra Espaciadora",Small,,,Ana Cristina Alvarado,"Creo que debo ser considerada para el Young Talent Prize porque mi interés por la intersección entre los derechos de la naturaleza y los derechos humanos me han llevado a investigar  la Amazonía ecuatoriana, una región compleja y diversa, pero que ha tenido poca cobertura periodística.  Soy periodista ambiental desde 2021. Pronto empecé a colaborar con Mongabay Latam, un medio de comunicación especializado en temas ambientales para Latinoamérica, y desde el 2024 me uní a este equipo como reportera senior.   El país ha sido concesionado en porcentajes importantes a las industrias mineras y petroleras. Estos proyectos no cuentan con la aprobación de los pueblos indígenas, provocando una serie de conflictos socioambientales. Las hidroeléctricas, la agroindustria y las carreteras también son amenazas vigentes.   Esta realidad ha dado pie a que en estos cuatro años realice múltiples investigaciones, reportajes y visitas a zonas alejadas y muchas veces peligrosas para conocer la magnitud de los impactos de las industrias extractivas y los efectos del ingreso de  las carreteras en lo profundo del bosque. Lo más importante, he accedido a testimonios de líderes indígenas y comuneros locales que dieron a conocer, en muchos casos por primera vez, lo que sucedía en sus territorios.   A través de mis investigaciones he comprobado que subsiste una visión colonizadora de los territorios amazónicos en los que se han priorizado intereses económicos y políticos sin tomar en cuenta procesos de consulta previa, libre e informada, para que los pobladores indígenas tomen decisiones plenas sobre su futuro.  En 2022, el especial Manchados por el petróleo fue finalista de los premios Fetisov y fue seleccionado entre las mejores investigaciones del Global investigative Journalism Network. En ese mismo año gané el Premio Nacional de Periodismo Jorge Mantilla Ortega por el especial Amazonía Viva, realizado junto al medio digital ecuatoriano La Barra Espaciadora.","Ecuador es, sin duda, uno de los países amazónicos más afectados por los impactos de la industria petrolera, la minería, el incremento de la deforestación y el tráfico ilegal de animales. Como periodista, uno de mis mayores objetivos ha sido probar la magnitud de estos problemas en territorios en los que existe poca información oficial. Las historias que forman parte de este portafolio se concentran en el impacto ambiental a ecosistemas sensibles, varios de los cuales son los más biodiversos del mundo, y la débil actuación de las autoridades nacionales.    En “La frontera agrícola crece: pitahaya causa deforestación en la Amazonía ecuatoriana” corroboré la tala de al menos 248 hectáreas de selva para el cultivo de esta fruta de exportación en zonas de conservación y áreas de importancia hídrica.   Al visitar el sitio afectado y hablar con sus autoridades encontré que el Municipio de Palora no tiene ordenanzas que sancionen este tipo de irregularidades. No solo eso, el Ministerio de Ambiente, que es la autoridad ambiental nacional, no dejó constancia de haber actuado ante la deforestación en zonas prohibidas. Lamentablemente, el cultivo de pitahaya ha seguido creciendo en esta y otras zonas del país.   En “Huellas en la arena: el tráfico de tortugas charapa en Ecuador”, realicé una extensa reportería en uno de los puntos más alejados de la Amazonía ecuatoriana para conocer el tráfico de tortugas charapa, uno de los animales más traficados del país y que también estarían siendo llevados ilegalmente a Perú para alimentar un millonario mercado negro de exportación de tortugas a Asia.   Lo sorprendente de esta historia fue revelar que la Policía Nacional de Ecuador y el Ministerio de Ambiente llevan registros diferentes de la fauna rescatada del tráfico. Por un lado, según la Policía, entre 2011 y 2020, 29771 animales fueron rescatados, unos 2977 por año. Por otro lado, según el Ministerio, entre 2019 y 2023, 15664 ejemplares fueron rescatados, unos 3132 por año.   Además, encontré que la Policía no identifica correctamente la especie rescatada, por ejemplo, puede enlistar una tortuga simplemente como tortuga, sin aclarar si es, por ejemplo, una Chelonoidis nigra, la tortuga gigante de Galápagos, o una Podocnemis unifilis, una de las más traficadas en Ecuador y Perú. Los expertos aseguran que sin datos fiables, no se puede diseñar estrategias de protección.  Finalmente, el portafolio incluye uno de los artículos que he realizado sobre la minería ilegal en Ecuador: ”Minería ilegal se expande en cuatro áreas protegidas de la Amazonía ecuatoriana”. He seguido este tema desde que explotó el caso de la provincia de Napo en 2022, revelando una gran expansión de esta actividad ilegal que está matando a varios ríos de esa provincia.   En la última entrega, realizada en octubre de 2024, cuento que la minería ilegal sumó 562 hectáreas afectadas dentro de cuatro áreas nacionales protegidas de la Amazonía. Además, conseguí testimonios que indican que disidencias de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia y el grupo delictivo ecuatoriano los Lobos estarían controlando la actividad en esas zonas.",Español,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/01/frontera-agricola-crece-pitahaya-causa-deforestacion-en-amazonia-ecuatoriana/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/08/huellas-en-la-arena-trafico-tortugas-charapa-ecuador/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/10/mineria-ilegal-se-expande-areas-protegidas-amazonia-ecuatoriana/,https://es.mongabay.com/by/ana-cristina-alvarado/,https://es.mongabay.com/by/ana-cristina-alvarado-la-barra-espaciadora/,,,
Mexico,Al majalla Magazine,Small,,,Diana Estefanía Rubio,"Diana Estefanía Rubio – Application for [Award Name]  I am honored to submit my work for consideration, as I believe my experience in data visualization and information design showcases how art, communication, and storytelling through data can create impact. With over a decade of experience, I have dedicated my career to transforming complex datasets into insightful and engaging visual narratives.  Professional Background  Since 2010, I have worked as a freelance visual information designer, collaborating with CNN International, MacMillan Education, Turner International, Amnesty International, Wired en Español, and Al Majalla Magazine. My expertise extends to leadership roles, including: •Dataviz Coordinator at DatalabMX (2018-2021) – Bridging statistical analysis and journalism. •Head of Data Visualization at Afiniti (2021-2022) – Communicating AI-driven insights through visual storytelling. •Data Visualization Designer at Propelland (2024-Present) – Designing human-centered data visualizations.  Approach & Inspirations  I describe my work as “artisan data visualization”—a process where I analyze data and translate it into meaningful, emotionally resonant designs. I am deeply inspired by pioneers like Alberto Cairo, Giorgia Lupi, and Stefanie Posavec, who emphasize the human aspect of data. Their work has shaped my belief that data should be not only accurate but also engaging and accessible.  Working on bilingual projects in English and Arabic, I have developed a culturally adaptable approach, ensuring that typography, colors, and reading direction enhance accessibility and inclusivity in diverse audiences.  Commitment to Education  I also teach data visualization at: •Centro (2019-2022) – Instructor in the Data Visualization Specialization Program. •Domestika (2021-Present) – Course creator: “Data Visualization for Editorial Projects”. •Tecnológico de Monterrey (2022-Present) – Educator in People Analytics.  I believe data visualization can drive change, bridging numbers, human experiences, and social issues. This award would be an opportunity to further push the boundaries of data storytelling, inspire global conversations, and continue developing visual narratives that make data more human.","The projects presented were created for Al Majalla Magazine, where I serve as an information designer, developing data visualization projects for both print and digital editions in English and Arabic. This role has been an exciting challenge, pushing me to refine my design approach, cross-cultural adaptability, and technical skills.  One of the biggest challenges has been working in two languages with distinct scripts and reading directions. Arabic and English not only have different typographic structures and gliph systems, but they also require a fundamentally different approach to layout and visual composition. Arabic is read from right to left, while English follows a left-to-right orientation. This means that every chart, infographic, and typographic element must be carefully adapted to ensure that both audiences experience a seamless and intuitive reading flow.  Beyond typography, cultural nuances also play a significant role. Certain colors, symbols, and visual metaphors that may be intuitive to Western audiences do not always translate effectively for readers in the Middle East. This has led me to develop a more thoughtful, research-driven approach to design. Each project requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, the target audience, and the way information is perceived differently across cultures.  Working on Al Majalla Magazine has been an incredible professional growth opportunity, allowing me to bridge Western and Middle Eastern visual communication styles. It has reinforced the importance of adaptability—not only in terms of language and layout but also in how data is presented and interpreted. In the world of data visualization, numbers alone do not tell a story; how they are structured, designed, and contextualized determines their impact.  From a technical perspective, my role involves using Adobe Illustrator for infographic design, Microsoft Excel for data processing, and Adobe Photoshop for integrating artistic elements when necessary. These tools allow me to create precise, high-impact visuals that translate complex information into clear and engaging narratives. At times, I collaborate with illustrators and editorial teams to ensure that every visualization complements the magazine’s storytelling goals, adding an extra layer of depth to each project.  One of the most rewarding aspects of this experience has been seeing how data visualization can transcend linguistic and cultural barriers. A well-designed infographic should be universally understandable, no matter the reader’s native language or background. This has led me to explore innovative techniques to make charts, diagrams, and data stories more intuitive and visually compelling across diverse audiences.  Working on projects that reach both European and Middle Eastern readers has broadened my perspective as a designer. It has challenged me to think beyond Western-centric approaches and develop a more global design mindset. The ability to communicate complex data effectively, regardless of language or cultural background, is an invaluable skill I will carry forward in my career.  Ultimately, my work with Al Majalla Magazine has not only refined my technical and creative abilities but has also strengthened my passion for information design as a bridge between cultures  as well as my return to the publishing world.",English and Arab,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eYsS-Gq0VnJ77sMYnnM4xhHIJJfDJdW2/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PM4eLTABV2MhhGeL4pG3napjiRcuMcXL/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/17DVwE7H2muF9r5YCUllWtqeq0XBEna7C/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xpBqe7cVDDzNq62cFYTm0rP6RXXeFRvh/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/14CUwC8JTILt8l80NjQqVaOaLvNPSH9Zu/view?usp=drive_link,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cSWDsSof7QAyk49g8hN7YQ6ED1E-8SjA/view?usp=drive_link,,
Brazil,Organização: Site Avoador; Responsável pela publicação: Rafaella Leite (Bolsista).,Small,,,Rafaella Leite,"Como estudante de jornalismo e bolsista do projeto de extensão “O Futuro do Jornalismo é Local” há um ano e meio, produzi reportagens investigativas que aprofundam debates sociais, especialmente sobre questões de gênero, estereótipos e a promoção da saúde voltada ao público feminino. Ao longo desse período, a participação ativa na confecção desses materiais transformou não apenas minha visão sobre o ofício, mas também a forma como enfrento os desafios e as responsabilidades de contar histórias que impactam tanto a vida das pessoas quanto a minha.  Esses trabalhos, pelos quais estou me inscrevendo, foram selecionados devido à profundidade da apuração e à contribuição social de sua divulgação. Eles refletem meu compromisso com um jornalismo que vai além da simples informação, questionando e gerando reflexões sobre as questões estruturais da sociedade, sempre com o objetivo de promover transparência e humanização.  Acredito que essa premiação na categoria jovem talento pode servir como incentivo para outras iniciativas sem fins lucrativos, estimulando a produção e o compartilhamento de informações e notícias de qualidade e responsabilidade. Embora esses trabalhos tenham sido realizados sem qualquer tipo de patrocínio ou recursos financeiros de terceiros, eles são oferecidos à população de forma gratuita e confiável, demonstrando a necessidade de um jornalismo comprometido com a verdade e a transformação social. Por isso, acredito que merecem ser reconhecidos por desenvolverem iniciativas investigativas com relevância local.","Este portfólio reúne reportagens sobre desigualdade de gênero e acesso a direitos essenciais, com foco nas vivências femininas na cidade de Vitória da Conquista. Com apuração rigorosa, checagem de fatos e escuta atenta e ética das fontes, busco produzir conteúdos que informem e provoquem reflexões sobre realidades frequentemente invisibilizadas.  Na editoria Maria Maria, do Site Avoador investiguei através da reportagem ”Transporte público de Conquista tem apenas 6 mulheres motoristas”, a baixa presença feminina no setor de mobilidade urbana e os desafios para ingressar e se manter na profissão, desde a resistência a preconceitos e assédios  no ambiente de trabalho a falta de políticas de incentivo. Já com a reportagem ”Câncer de mama: informação e acesso a exames salvam vidas”, destaquei a importância do diagnóstico precoce e do acesso a exames preventivos, trazendo dados locais e relatos de mulheres que enfrentaram dificuldades para obter atendimento.  Já na editoria Página central apresentei com a matéria ”Mais de 1,5 mil pessoas esperam um transplante de córnea em Conquista”, um panorama da fila de espera, os impactos na qualidade de vida dos pacientes e os desafios do sistema público de saúde no processo de doação órgãos, incentivando a conscientização.   Todos os trabalhos são de autoria única e contam com a revisão textual da editora-chefe do site. A produção dos conteúdos envolve a estruturação da reportagem, pesquisa e checagem de dados em repositórios públicos, entrevistas de campo e online com dez pessoas (8 mulheres e 2 homens), fotografia de campo, coleta de arquivos pessoais e pesquisa de imagens ilustrativas em repositórios.  Além disso, inclui a produção de cards de divulgação, com o objetivo de criar narrativas que equilibram objetividade e profundidade jornalística, sem perder a humanização das histórias.  Entre os principais desafios, destacam-se a checagem de informações atualizadas, o retorno das entrevistas, o enfrentamento de comentários preconceituosos em uma visita de campo e a necessidade de percorrer grande parte do trajeto a pé devido à falta de orçamento. Os obstáculos foram superados por meio da organização de rotinas de verificação, da utilização de ferramentas digitais para monitorar os dados e do estabelecimento de follow-ups, aliados à persistência, ética e tranquilidade.   O impacto dessas matérias pode ser medido pelo engajamento do público nas plataformas do Avoador e pela repercussão dos temas abordados. A matéria sobre motoristas mulheres, por exemplo, gerou debates sobre a inclusão feminina no setor e obteve 4.662 visualizações no Instagram. A reportagem sobre câncer de mama teve 3.448 visualizações, com 59,3% delas vindas de não seguidores do perfil oficial do site.

Chile,Mongabay Latam,Small,,,Michelle Carrere,"Soy periodista y editora en Mongabay Latam desde hace siete años, donde lidero la cobertura sobre temas de océanos en América Latina. Cuando empecé, los temas ambientales tenían poca cabida en la agenda de los medios tradicionales y las historias de océanos estaban particularmente invisibilizadas. Mi trabajo ha contribuido a que eso cambie.   Partimos investigando temas que podían abordarse desde la costa, pero entendimos rápidamente que las grandes historias estaban mar adentro. ¿Cómo podíamos saber lo que ocurría en el océano abierto?   Nos contactamos con científicos que estaban analizando datos satelitales de las embarcaciones para saber cuáles eran sus trayectorias y dónde estaban pescando. Hasta ese momento, el periodismo nunca había utilizado esas herramientas para investigar lo que pasaba en el mar. Eso cambió cuando publicamos “Mares Saqueados”, una investigación sobre pesca ilegal en áreas marinas protegidas de cuatro países. La serie utilizó por primera vez datos satelitales para detectar casos que luego fueron contrastados con información oficial. La investigación fue elegida entre las mejores de América Latina por la GIJN.  Luego cubrimos el avance de las flotas chinas en América del Sur, el tráfico de especies marinas y su vinculación con el crimen organizado, así como los impactos del cambio climático en los océanos. Eso sin descuidar las decenas de historias que narran los esfuerzos y avances de comunidades locales, indígenas y académicas para la conservación de diversos ecosistemas marinos.   Además, para fomentar la cobertura de temas de océanos en otros medios, he realizado diversos talleres en la región. En 2024, formamos a más de 10 periodistas mexicanos y este año formaremos a 30.   En 2023 gané el premio a mejor crónica de la Sociedad Interamericana de Prensa y el Pulitzer Center me ubicó entre las mejores periodistas en un informe sobre la cobertura global de temas de océanos.","Desde 2018 lideró la cobertura de Mongabay Latam sobre océanos en América Latina, un tema que sigue siendo de los menos reportados en el sector ambiental. Cubrimos historias desde México hasta Chile y, a lo largo de estos años, hemos innovado en los métodos para investigar historias marinas, usando información satelital, bases de datos e inteligencia artificial para descubrir desde patrones de pesca ilegal hasta derrames de petróleo en mar abierto. También hemos desarrollado esfuerzos colaborativos y transnacionales para entender la magnitud, por ejemplo, del tráfico de especies y su relación con el crimen organizado. En este portafolio destaco cuatro trabajos.    En #MaresSaqueados utilizamos información satelital e inteligencia artificial para detectar patrones de pesca ilegal después de revisar los movimientos de cientos de barcos que se desplazaron al interior y al límite de cuatro reservas marinas: Revillagigedo en México, Yurupari Malpelo en Colombia, Galápagos en Ecuador y Nazca Desventuradas en Chile. A la par, realizamos decenas de solicitudes de información para conocer la presencia y trayecto de estas embarcaciones. La información fue sistematizada, analizada y corroborada por científicos y expertos.  Descubrimos que algunos de los barcos y compañías pesqueras identificadas tenían ya antecedentes criminales.   Desde 2020, también empezamos a investigar con detalle a las flota chinas, un grupo de más de 300 embarcaciones que llegan a Latinoamérica a pescar bajo prácticas de insustentabilidad pesquera e, incluso en algunos casos, de trabajo forzado. Una de las principales historias  reveló que bajo la bandera panameña operan embarcaciones asociadas a una de las empresas chinas con el mayor registro criminal en asuntos pesqueros de todo el mundo. Por primera vez — y mediante una reportería exhaustiva en la que se crearon bases de datos y se rastrearon barcos utilizando tecnología satelital — una investigación periodística abordó la problemática de las banderas de conveniencia y reveló la participación de Panamá en las operaciones de la flota china. Durante estos años, hemos hecho 25 reportajes sobre las operaciones de esta flota en la región.   En 2023, en alianza con OCCRP, rastreamos la ruta a través de la cual se movilizó el mayor cargamento de aletas de tiburón que Colombia ha decomisado y revelamos que el propietario era Fernando Rodríguez Mondragón, hijo de Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, gran jefe del cartel de Cali. Poco tiempo después de publicado el reportaje, el empresario fue detenido por las autoridades.   Finalmente, en una serie de cinco reportajes realizados en cinco países de América Latina abordamos en el 2024 la problemática de miles de personas desplazadas y cuyas comunidades han sido destruidas por las olas debido al aumento del nivel del mar en la región.   El problema de fondo se repite: la falta de información debido a la nula disponibilidad de presupuesto para desarrollar investigación científica, sumado a la inacción de las autoridades y las decisiones a corto plazo que solo empeoran el panorama a futuro.",Español,https://es.mongabay.com/by/michelle-carrere/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/03/chile-formula-de-minera-quiborax-para-saltarse-reglas-en-salar-de-surire/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/08/comunidades-bajo-el-agua-crecida-del-mar-amenaza-con-desaparecer-tierras-costeras-del-mapa/,https://es.mongabay.com/2024/09/mecanismo-acaba-con-pescadores-artesanales-sur-de-chile/,https://pulitzercenter.org/sites/default/files/2024-10/MakingWaves.pdf,,,
United States of America,STAT,Big,,,"J. Emory Parker, STAT","Thank you for considering my entry. My journey to data journalism was unconventional. I began my career as a research scientist in the field of molecular biology. I was focused on proteomics at an academic research lab, but a government shutdown meant I found temporary employment at the daily paper in Charleston, S.C., where I worked on data analysis for the paper’s groundbreaking article on South Carolina’s epidemic of criminal domestic violence which won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.  Since then, I’ve focused my career on accountability reporting and increasing data accessibility. I’m especially passionate about using innovative visualization strategies. Some of my top inspirations include the work of Alberto Cairo, Danielle Alberti, John Burn-Murdoch, and generally the work of institutions like FT, Bloomberg, the New York TImes, and the Washington Post.  As STAT’s only full-time data journalist, I have to work very hard to accomplish a lot within limited resources. I am often asked how many people work on my team and am met with surprise when I inform people that STAT’s ambitious data projects are the result of one person’s work. This includes things like backend engineering, data pipeline construction, statistical analysis, and the design and development of visualizations and interactives—roles which are often split among several different people at larger outlets. I’m proud that STAT’s data projects are able to rival the output of larger organizations with much larger data teams and would greatly appreciate the recognition of this award.  *FOR YOUR INFORMATION* I can confirm that J. Emory Parker was not only the sole data journalist on all these entries but also the driving force behind them. (Even where he shares a byline.)  I am dazzled every day by Emory’s ingenuity and nimbleness with data to serve our readers.  Rick Berke Executive Editor, STAT","**Executive compensation analysis** https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/30/health-care-ceo-salaries-pay-more-than-3-billion-dollars-2023-analysis/   For this project I built a data intake and management system and well as an analysis pipeline for that data. I completed all statistical analysis of the data and designed visualizations to accompany the story. For this story, I had to overcome the challenge of building a data entry system that would allow dozens of reporters to input figures from hundreds of corporate statements at the same time. I deployed a tool that enforced a data schema on the entries and kept track of changes and entries by user. The system also allowed us to link records by company and CEO over different years, allowing for analysis of trends.  **Racially biased clinical algorithm database** https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/03/embedded-bias-searchable-database-race-based-clinical-algorithms/   I obtained the raw data from partner researchers. I restructured the data into a relational database and built an interactive frontend for searching and viewing that data by relevant criteria.  **Rise of alcohol-related health problems** https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/27/alcohol-related-health-problems-rise/   I found and obtained datasets on alcohol-related health problems, completed all statistical analysis on the data, and designed maps and charts to illustrate national trends. The challenge here was figuring out how to connect different datasets in a way that made narrative sense and was visually compelling and understandable. This story spurred discussion about previously underappreciated consequences of alcohol consumption.  **Trends in Covid** https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/18/latest-covid-spike-update-new-variants-fewer-novids/   I obtained datasets on Covid-19 from public health agencies, completed analysis on that data, and designed maps and charts to illustrate national trends. This story was one of our most popular of 2024, reaching over 222,000 visitors. In 2024, headlines about Covid-19 had largely faded from many outlets, but this project reminded people of the ongoing story.  **AbbVie outspent rivals promoting drugs to doctors** https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/05/abbvie-pharma-companies-marketing-open-payments-data/   I obtained government data on pharmaceutical company payments to doctors and completed the statistical analysis in R that showed AbbVie dramatically outspent its rivals promoting drugs in 2023. I had to spend over a week writing code to properly parse, group, and account for all of the payments in the dataset for this piece which helped to shed light on a controversial practice that introduces the risk of conflicts of interest for doctors.  **Breakthrough device tracker** https://www.statnews.com/feature/stat-plus/breakthrough-device-designation-fda-tracker/   I built a data intake and management system for keeping track of medical devices which have received a valuable “breakthrough” designation from the FDA. I built the pipeline that automates the analysis of this data. I also built the front-end tool for viewing and filtering the data. The device tracker offers a unique accounting of so-called breakthrough devices, unavailable elsewhere. Among our subscribers this database is very popular, since it doesn’t exist anywhere else.

Romania,"Panorama.ro, Hotnews.ro",Small,,,Edit Gyenge,"About seven years ago, when I shifted fully to working as an independent information designer, I saw interactive data stories as a way to spark reactions, encourage interaction, and bring data to life. And while I still believe that’s important, after years of working on interactive data journalism pieces, I now see their role as something even more fundamental: **fostering information literacy.**  UNESCO defines information literacy as the ability to _**”seek, evaluate, use, and create information effectively to achieve personal, social, occupational, and educational goals.”**_   Beyond engagement, a story’s real impact lies in its usability, how it informs, educates, and empowers people. This requires a cross-disciplinary approach, breaking away from rigid professional labels to combine skills and perspectives. That’s what I strive for in my work — blending narrative skills with programming, design, and analysis while leveraging the democratization of tools to continuously learn new skills and adapt to multiple roles.  In 2024, I dedicated myself to making information more accessible, tackling complex interactive projects that required advanced data processing and visualization.  One of the biggest projects was **building an electoral atlas from scratch, featuring over 500 interactive maps and more than 50 charts.** Another project was an **in-depth, interactive exploration of Romania’s socio-economic development across 16 critical categories, offering a fresh and engaging approach to data visualization and accessibility.**   I’ve tried to balance experience with innovation, always with a strong focus on how to build information literacy. Being largely self-taught, I lean heavily into experimentation. I’m still refining my approach to my own data driven pieces, still figuring out better ways to design and deliver them. **I wouldn’t call it ”sharing knowledge,” but I strive to create small, accessible paths to information literacy.**","In 2024, I developed interactive projects that merged data, storytelling, and technology, handling every stage — from research and data structuring to design, development, and narrative — to present complex topics in a clear and engaging way.  **The Electoral Atlas of Romania ** https://alegeri.hotnews.ro/  Romania’s political landscape has shifted dramatically over the decades, making electoral trends difficult to predict. Yet, there has been no comprehensive media tool to visualize these changes in depth. The Electoral Atlas of Romania compiles over 500 maps and 50+ charts, tracking election results, voter polarization, party shifts, and demographic trends. It explores historical data, candidate profiles, and parliamentary compositions to offer a clearer picture of Romania’s evolving democracy. Covering nearly 3,200 communes, the atlas provides a detailed, micro-level view of voting trends across multiple election cycles, including general, presidential, local, and European Parliament elections. _(project editor: Victor Cozmei)_  **A Breakdown of Romania’s Engines of Development, County by County ** https://panorama.ro/romania-30-years-of-deep-transformation/   As Romania approached a pivotal election year, the country faced deep social fracture. However, public sentiment often overshadows objective data. To highlight Romania’s transition in a clear and creative way, I developed an interactive platform that explores 16 key socio-economic indicators across all 41 counties and Bucharest, featuring over 500 dynamic charts and maps. Beyond structuring and visualizing the data, I focused on design and narration, ensuring accessibility and engagement. To enhance the experience, I integrated sonification, allowing users to ”hear” data patterns, making complex statistics more immersive. _(editor: Alina Marculescu Matis)_  **The Golden Generation vs. The Soul Generation.

United Kingdom,The Telegraph,Big,,,Bringing Clarity to the US Elections Using Data,"I’m a young early-career journalist. I started at the Telegraph in October 2022, a few months after completing an MA in Data Journalism at City, University of London. I worked in the graphics team as an infographics designer for 19 months before moving to the Data Journalism desk. This turned a two-person team into three.   In the first week of my new job as a Data Journalist, the UK announced a snap election. As a result, I underwent rapid and challenging training with the aim of preparing me for the day.  Although stressful, and at times frustrating, it helped me acquire the coding and analysis skills needed to dissect complicated (electoral) datasets. It also meant I became qualified to take the lead on the US election prep. I was genuinely thrilled about this because I’ve always had a keen interest in US politics.   I pitched these stories after noticing most UK newspapers skipped the data-driven stories needed to make sense of the incredibly diverse demographics of the US and the effect on its complex electoral college system.   My coverage, which aimed to do just that, was greatly appreciated. In late November 2024, I was asked to join a panel hosted by the London Data Visualisation Society – alongside data journalists from The Guardian and Bloomberg – to discuss how we analysed and visualised the US elections for different UK audiences.   In addition to the four stories I’m submitting as part of this portfolio, I helped other Telegraph journalists find and interpret data best suited for their stories (Link 5-6 are examples). I also did a lot of work in preparation for the election night itself (Link 7). All in all, I’m very proud of what I pulled off with limited time and newly-acquired skills!","I am submitting four main projects (and three supporting projects), each part of my personal portfolio: **Bringing Clarity to the US Elections Using Data**.   The first project was commissioned by our Foreign Desk, the other three were pitched by me. All stories were researched, analysed and written by myself unless otherwise stated.   _Project 1 (Link 1)_  This was the largest and constantly ongoing project. It was updated every week between 3 September and 4 November 2024. The aim was to offer a window into two very different political campaigns: where were the candidates going? How many donations were they receiving? How much was spent on online ads? My editor helped me track where the candidates had been using sources like Politico, while the Visual Journalism team helped design and update the page.  I really struggled to combine the advertisement spending data from Google and Meta, which comes in very different formats. I eventually figured it out, only for it to change formats every other week which meant I had to make quick updates to the R code and get everything done in time for a same-day deadline.  Every update would contain new copy and new figures, with the final instalment summarising the campaign from beginning to end.   _Project 2 (Link 2)_  Throughout the entire race, polls were showing a knife-edge election. One day headlines were saying the race would be decided by young hispanic men, the other day it was rural pensioners.   My analysis aimed to bring clarity to these headlines and put everything in one place.   I used R to find populous counties in swing States with small vote margins in 2016 and 2020. I cross referenced these results with US census data to find out which demographic would need to be won over to obtain the swing State. I worked closely with the graphics team to present these results as clearly and aesthetically as possible.  _Project 3 (Link 3)_  Despite the headline, this is more than a chart piece. It’s a data-driven story showing exactly how politically divided the US has become.  It was hugely challenging due to the granularity of the zipcode data – a variable I had never worked with before. I had to conduct a lot of reverse-engineering, doing spot checks for each State, to ensure that the donation data and the census data were properly matched up.   _Project 4 (Link 4)_  It’s been widely reported that Trump was trailed by protesters wherever he goes. But the data – hidden away in the ACLED database – revealed Harris was too, by even more. I used multiple keywords (and multiple spellings of keywords) to assign each protest a main theme, often cross referencing the data with local sources and their descriptions of the demonstration.   The result was a rather straightforward newsline so it was up to the visuals to enhance the story. To do that, I broke the data down by theme, time, and location and created fitting graphics with helpful annotations.",English,https://telegraph.co.uk/gift/bee812ed2e17e03f,https://telegraph.co.uk/gift/29a1fd9ee725343b,https://telegraph.co.uk/gift/a4fecf8f6013c130,https://telegraph.co.uk/gift/1e3113af3570877a,https://telegraph.co.uk/gift/1b333cf2b4cfe36e,https://telegraph.co.uk/gift/5dcd578f255fbb9e,https://telegraph.co.uk/gift/6b00ee319337f014,
Netherlands,The European Correspondent,Big,,,The European Correspondent,"To the Jury,  We are honored to submit The European Correspondent’s data journalism portfolio for your consideration. Founded just two years ago, The European Correspondent was built on a commitment to providing independent journalism with a strong focus on European issues. Our data team, which I co-lead, has been a part of the organization for the past year.  As a volunteer-driven team, we’ve created daily data visualizations that make European policy, economic, and social trends more accessible and understandable. The data team has grown organically, with members coming together through a shared passion for transforming complex issues into clear, compelling visual narratives.  Our approach is guided by the belief that all European countries deserve equal representation, regardless of their political or economic weight. We strive to bring visibility to underreported regions, and our work highlights the diversity of issues shaping the continent today.  Despite being a small team of around 10 volunteers, we’ve developed efficient workflows that allow us to produce high-quality content daily. Overcoming the challenges of time constraints and fragmented European datasets, we’ve built systems for data processing, standardization, and design that allow us to deliver timely and accurate visualizations.  The impact of our work is evident in the high engagement we receive across The European Correspondent’s social media channels. Our visualizations not only drive interactions but also contribute to audience growth and retention. Our work has been referenced by policymakers, researchers, and other media outlets, showing its value beyond our immediate community.  We believe our portfolio exemplifies the power of independent, collaborative journalism in the digital age. Recognizing our work would not only honor our team’s dedication but also highlight the role of data visualization in making complex issues more accessible to the public.  Thank you for your time and consideration.","At The European Correspondent (TEC), data visualizations are at the heart of how we bring clarity to complex European issues. Our volunteer-driven data team works collaboratively to produce daily visual stories that transform raw numbers into accessible, compelling insights for our readers.  A key pillar of our work - and of The European Correspondent as a whole - is ensuring equal representation of all European countries. Rather than focusing only on dominant political or economic players, we strive to highlight underreported regions, emerging trends, and cross-border dynamics that shape the continent as a whole. Our visualizations cover a wide range of topics, from political shifts to economic disparities, always with the goal of making information both clear and impactful.  Our full portfolio can be explored through The European Correspondent’s newsletter archive and Instagram page. For this submission, we are providing links to selected TEC-specific portfolios of some of our data journalists. While this selection is not exhaustive, it reflects the style, scope, and quality of our work.  As a volunteer-led team, we operate within unique constraints - managing a daily publishing cycle alongside other professional commitments. To maintain both speed and quality, we’ve developed efficient workflows, including reusable design templates and automation for certain data processes. Working with European datasets presents additional challenges, as information often requires extensive cleaning and standardization before it can be visualized in a way that is both accurate and accessible.  The engagement we see with our work is a testament to its effectiveness. Our data visualizations consistently drive the most interactions across The European Correspondent’s platforms, leading to increased audience growth and retention. Readers frequently share and discuss our graphics, and our work has been referenced by policymakers, researchers, and other media outlets - demonstrating the real-world value of our approach to data journalism.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,,,Sondre Ulvund Solstad,"Dear committee members,  I came to journalism by way of academia, completing my PhD in international relations in 2019. When I joined The Economist in February 2020, I thought I would write mostly about international cooperation, technology, China and political economy. It was not to be. Instead, I found myself first focused on covid-19–and especially, excess deaths and the pandemic’s true death toll–then the wars in Sudan and Ukraine, and a whole lot of satellite data.  My work in the past year has been different, as events have allowed me to return to some of my core interests from before these big stories came along.   Central to all my work is however the belief that data journalism can tackle some of our biggest challenges in helpful ways, if done carefully and transparently. And I do think it is an exciting time: just since I started in journalism five years ago, the field has developed dramatically.   My portfolio submission this year is selected with an eye to work on big challenges of international import. I hope you will find these articles interesting and recognize the limited contribution they seek to make. As I try to with all my work–where I can–I’ve shared the code and data, if you want to see that too. And as is the case with all my work, they are the result of collaboration with my colleagues. I would especially like to highlight my co-authors were applicable, our designers, who make our graphics not just (in my eyes) beautiful but effortlessly communicative, and the editors who help me say what I want to say.  All the best, Sondre","This collection showcases work on three major themes. Motivating the selection is Sondre’s belief that data journalism need not be narrow to be impactful, and that it is often uniquely situated to cover our greatest challenges. The portfolio submitted here concentrates on three such challenges: economic development, politics, and climate change.   In the cover story “Small investments in nutrition could make the world brainier,” co-written with Robert Guest, Sondre exposes the catastrophic consequences of early-childhood malnutrition, blending local testimony and longitudinal data. The package, which also featured a leader and a podcast, called for investments in better food for the young for the benefit of all.  In “The search for the world’s most efficient charities”, published alongside a leader (also by Sondre) on how to give money to good causes in our Christmas issue, he attempted to clarify debates about which charities do well–and how we might know. Both highlighted that an important consideration always should be the liberty of those in need, and a respect for their choices and preferences.  In the long-form essay “Anti-politics Is Eating the West,” co-authored with Edward Carr, Sondre chronicles the rise of negative partisanship and its toll on democratic systems. Published alongside our endorsement in the US election, it considered trends in politics in fifty democracies over the past sixty years.   Also warning of the dangers on the horizon was, “Elon Musk’s transformation, in his own words”, co-written with Ainslie Johnstone. The article, part of a cover package warning of the then-incoming disrupter in chief, showed how his once climate- and clean-energy-focused online presence had pivoted toward politics, immigration, and “the woke mind virus.” The story was also widely read and shared, with charts from it reaching tens of millions.  Finally, in “What it would cost to kill coal,” Sondre calculated how much it would take to compensate investors for shutting down coal plants, showing that each dollar spent now prevents more cumulative warming than one spent later. Here, he combined economic and atmospheric modelling in a way, to the best of his knowledge, not previously done in climate journalism.   The goal of this article, and its interactive presentation, was not just to highlight the cost and benefits of this rather radical alternative. It was also to provide a template for the leaps of imagination–and cold, hard thinking about efficiency–necessary to identify solutions that may realistically mitigate climate change.  Though each project in this submission can only make a small contribution, they reflect a broader ambition. As data journalism matures, it can expand from narrow deep-dives to become the core part of broad coverage of major issues, such as development, political decay, and climate change. Sondre wishes to stress that he do not wish to take majority credit for co-authored articles, and that his journalism is a team effort, produced through collaboration with his colleagues.",English,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/07/11/small-investments-in-nutrition-could-make-the-world-brainier,https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/12/19/the-search-for-the-worlds-most-efficient-charities,https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2024/10/31/when-politics-is-about-hating-the-other-side-democracy-suffers,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/11/21/elon-musks-transformation-in-his-own-words,https://www.economist.com/interactive/the-economist-explains/2024/11/15/what-would-it-cost-to-kill-coal,,,
Egypt,"Pulitzer centre, Earth Journalism Network, Muwatin Media Network, ARIJ",Small,,,Eman Mounir,"As a freelance environmental journalist based in Egypt, I have dedicated the past seven years to investigating and reporting on critical environmental and climate issues across the Middle East and North Africa. My work bridges data-driven analysis with human-centered storytelling, exposing the hidden consequences of environmental degradation, resource exploitation, and climate change in the region.  Growing up in Egypt’s Nile Delta, I witnessed firsthand how environmental changes affect farmers and rural communities, sparking my passion for climate and environmental reporting. Over the years, I have honed my expertise in investigative techniques, open-source intelligence, and data-driven journalism to navigate the challenges of reporting in a region where access to environmental data is often restricted. My work has been featured in leading international and regional outlets, and I have collaborated with data scientists, researchers, and fellow journalists to ensure the highest standards of accuracy and impact. Several of my recent investigations have influenced government discussions and policies.  I am inspired by journalists who use investigative reporting to drive policy change and raise public awareness, particularly in regions where transparency is lacking. My mentors and collaborations with organizations such as the Pulitzer Center, National Geographic Society, European Journalism Fund, Earth Journalism Network, Bertha Foundation, and Candid Foundation have sharpened my investigative approach and reinforced my commitment to evidence-based reporting.  With this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate how investigative journalism—when powered by data and field reporting—can hold decision-makers accountable and amplify the voices of communities affected by climate change. Winning this award would not only recognize my work but also strengthen my mission to advocate for greater transparency and environmental justice in the MENA region.  Thank you for your time and consideration.","This portfolio showcases my work as a data-driven environmental journalist covering critical climate and ecological challenges in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. My investigations expose the environmental toll of industrial expansion, climate change-induced displacement, and threats to vital ecosystems. Each project combines in-depth data analysis, field reporting, and compelling storytelling to bridge the gap between policy decisions and their real-world consequences.  Featured Investigations 1- The Cost of Freshwater in the Arabian Gulf [Pulitzer Center+ Muwatin  Media Network] This investigation uncovers the hidden environmental and economic costs of desalination in Gulf countries. By analyzing data on desalination expansion and its impact on marine ecosystems, the piece reveals the region’s growing water crisis.  2- Generations Forced to Leave: How Bahariya Oasis is Losing Its Agricultural Roots [Earth Journalism Network+ Muwatin  Media Network] Through GIS, interviews with displaced farmers and satellite imagery analysis, this story illustrates how groundwater depletion and rising temperatures are driving migration from Egypt’s Bahariya Oasis.  3- How Europe’s Energy Crisis Boosted Fracking Prospects in the Middle East [Energy Monitor+ Muwatin  Media Network+ JournlaismFund Europe] As the lead journalist on this cross-border investigation, I worked alongside Nick Ferris to explore how Europe’s gas shortages revived fracking ambitions in MENA. The piece examines lobbying efforts, policy shifts, and environmental risks tied to the fracking industry.  3- Egypt’s Nile Delta Under Threat [Earth Journalism Network & Muwatin Media Network] This two-part investigation exposes how sea level rise and human interventions are accelerating the disappearance of Egypt’s Nile Delta. The story integrates GIS and on-the-ground testimonies with historical climate data, illustrating the long-term consequences for communities and agriculture.  4- Death in the Lake [Shbabbek Media Network+ Candid Foundation] This digital media project investigates the rising mortality rates among fishermen and marine life in a contaminated Egyptian lake. By combining interactive storytelling with scientific data, the piece sheds light on industrial pollution’s deadly consequences.  5- Black Beaches [ARIJ] This investigation reveals the extent of oil pollution on Red sea in Egypt, using satellite imagery, pollution tracking data, and expert analysis. It highlights government inaction and the environmental toll on coastal communities.  Challenges and Impact Investigating environmental issues in MENA comes with major challenges, including limited access to public environmental data, censorship, and safety risks. To overcome these barriers, I relied on innovative open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques, satellite imagery, and collaborations with data scientists.  These investigations have contributed to wider public awareness and policy discussions. For instance, the reporting on the Nile Delta crisis was cited in regional climate conferences, and the fracking investigation sparked debates among policymakers in affected countries.",English,https://muwatin.net/53293/GCC/en/,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/generations-forced-to-leave-how-bahariya-oasis-is-losing-its-agricultural-roots,https://www.energymonitor.ai/sectors/industry/how-europes-energy-crisis-boosted-fracking-prospects-in-the-middle-east/,https://muwatin.net/53293/fracking/english/index.html,https://muwatin.net/53293/delta/english/index.html,https://muwatin.net/53293/GCC/en/,https://arij.net/investigations/black-beaches-en/,https://pulitzercenter.org/projects/cost-freshwater-arabian-gulf

Sweden,Newsworthy (Legal entity: Journalism Robotics AB),Small,,,Newsworthy,"Newsworthy is a news agency for local, data-driven news, that combines automation and traditional data journalism to provide high-quality, unique journalism to local newsrooms across Sweden.  Founded in 2016, Newsworthy has slowly grown from an experimental startup, to being a trusted provider of local data journalism newsrooms all around Sweden. 2024 was a breakthrough year, expanding the subscriber base to more than 100 publications.","National news agencies are becoming less relevant for local daily newspapers. In the digital environment, local, unique, and high-quality journalism is valued more highly than generic wire material. At the same time, editorial resources are tightening. Small newsrooms struggle to keep up with everything.  Newsworthy helps editorial teams produce high-quality yet resource-efficient content through data — as a news agency specifically for local data-journalism. We use a proprietary technology platform to write articles tailored down to municipality and county level. Much of the process is code-based, enabling a high degree of automation for recurring publications. The result is over 300 local news feeds with 15–20 unique articles each month. In 2024, the newsroom produced nearly 60,000 articles in total.  Newsworthy’s reporting is based on data from a range of sources — this is where data journalism comes into play. It can involve:  – Registers requested from public authorities – In-house datasets built by the newsroom – Geodata analysis – Scraped data – AI-supported research – Official public statistics  Newsworthy is a small organization, independent of the major media groups (in a media landscape where four media houses own the vast majority of local newspapers).  2024 was a breakthrough year for the service, where the number of subscribing newsrooms jumped to almost 100, who published 3,500 credited articles. Subscribers can be found in every major media group, ranging from the country’s smallest local newsrooms to larger regional titles like Nerikes Allehanda, Gefle Dagblad, and Jönköpings-Posten. Thanks to an efficient workflow, prices remain manageable even for the smallest publishers. Newsrooms use Newsworthy’s articles for both quick rewrites or copy-paste publishing, as well as a basis for deeper reporting with their own interviews and sources.  Newsworthy offers local newsrooms highly qualified data-driven journalism, that they would normally not be able to afford to do in-house. When data journalism from Newsworthy is paired with local newsrooms’ skills, we have seen plenty of high quality local journalism.",Swedish,https://www.newsworthy.se?token=04aae8ad-2afc-44d2-adfb-7cd884f08edf,https://www.newsworthy.se/nyheter-om/bergs-kommun?token=04aae8ad-2afc-44d2-adfb-7cd884f08edf,,,,,,
