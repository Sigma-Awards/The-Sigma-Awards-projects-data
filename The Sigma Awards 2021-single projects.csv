El Salvador,"elsalvador.com, El Diario de Hoy",Small,Shortlist,Rostros y voces del conflicto,16/09/20,"Investigation, Documentary, Database, Video, Map, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","     Faces and voices of the conflict is a digital memorial that, after the creation of two own databases on war crimes and serious human rights violations that occurred in the eighties, presents them on an interactive map together with videos of testimonies of victims and survivors.   The ""victims"" and ""events"" databases were constructed after consulting the editions of four newspapers published between 1972 and 1992 and include crimes against humanity and war crimes attributed to the army and the guerrillas.    Publications from organizations related to the victims, guerrilla and the army were also consulted.  "," Faces and voices of the conflict is a living project, constantly updated. After its launch, dozens of users wrote to us to share more information or to make small corrections to the published information. This has not served to contact new sources and publish new stories.  Another impact has been that, by being published by a media outlet that had a very right-wing position during the armed conflict, it has attracted the attention of readers and users who generally do not read and do not think about the human rights violated during the war of the 80's.  Politicians, relatives of victims of the army or the guerrillas, academics and human rights defenders have welcomed this data project.  From its launch on September 16th to Janyary 16th, the site had 155,542 page views and amassed 104,879 users.  After a general amnesty law was declared unconstitutional and the door was opened for war crimes committed in the 1980s to be brought to trial, the issue of restorative justice and historical memory has risen to prominence on the national agenda. Faces and Voices of Conflict has brought information never before collected in one place to that debate."," A team of five people reviewed four different print newspapers from 1972 to 1992. The information we found on human rights violations and possible crimes against humanity and war crimes, we aggregated into Google spreadsheets. To this information was added the one that was in a monument in honor of the victims of the war in the Cuscatlán park in San Salvador.   In Cuscatlan Park there is a monument which contains a list of 30,000 names of those who died in El Salvador's Civil War between 1980 and 1992. A El Diario de Hoy photographer took a high resolution photo of every element of the monument.   After that, using the OpenCV library we applied a a threshold treatment to every image and then used a tool named Tesseract to recognize the names.   Them, using a Python programming language library named Pillow, every picture was cutted and the results systematized in CSV files, which were united for storing.    We also use Flourish Studio to present the data from the ""victims"" database in a table where users can search for their relatives by typing their name."," The hardest part of the job was turning that data into history. It was very difficult to contact relatives of the victims or survivors of massacres willing to give their testimonies before a video camera. For our part, we prepare to address the victims and to accept when they identify some part of the story that they do not want to share.  The pandemic and the 80-day quarantine in El Salvador made this job even more difficult."," What other journalists can learn from this project is how the planning and work of a multidisciplinary team with a different vision of an event can enrich and carry out a journalistically ambitious task. Building a database with the serious human rights violations, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by the State or by the guerrillas between 1972 and 1992 seemed an impossible task. But as a team it was decided what information needed to be collected and where to look for it. The editor sought the support of interns whom she trained to collaborate in the review of hundreds of pages of newspapers from which the information that was added to the databases was extracted.  The work could not have been carried out without this help. It was vital and important to have a methodology for external partners to join in the data collection task. The project started in June 2019 with planning; Data collection started in November 2019 and concluded in March 2020. Then came reviewing, cleaning and data analysis. For each task there was a team leader. Simultaneously, based on the data, relatives of victims were contacted to collect their testimonies and present them in videos and podcasts that are presented and added to the site as they occur.Finally, what other journalists can learn from this project is the need to have at least one person who knows a programming language like Python for data extraction and cleaning.",https://rostrosyvocesdelconflicto.elsalvador.com/,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=648892162732791,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1715078788668696,,,,,,"Lilian Martínez, Karla Arévalo, Xenia González Oliva, Carlos Palomo, Vladimir Bonilla, Claudia Zaldaña"," Lilian Martínez (47) is a journalist with more than 20 years of experience.

These books were digitalized recently. Pointer researched more than 7.000 transactions of disowned and sold Jewish property. We're telling the stories of persons who came back from the war and found their homes occupied by the new owners. A lot of people ea We found that a lot of municipalities never researched their own shady past. More than 7.000 transactions of disowned and sold property could be researched. We also want to submit De Straat Die Niet Meer Bestaat as a separate"," Because of our research, municipalities are starting to research their own role in the real estate theft. Before our research, just 3 had concluded their research. Thanks to our publications, we're at 33 (of the possible 226) municipalities. These researches will conclude somewhere in 2021, and more municipalities are ready to follow their example. These investigations can lead to excuses by city councils, and monetary compensations to Jewish organisations and individuals.   We're telling these stories in the 75th year of the Dutch liberation. The second world war seems a thing far in the past, but we've made these stories relevant by looking at the current consequences of this theft. A lot of Jewish people are still looking for closure of their family past. A lot of companies made a lot of money from these transactions. And municipalities still aren't recognizing their own role in these transactions. In some cases, they asked the Jews coming back from concentration camps of hiding for overdue taxes on their homes. Municipalities sometimes bought stolen property, and afterwards frustrated the recovery of the property to the rightful owners.   We made the data sets public for anyone to look into. This led to a lot of tips from relatives, people living in these houses and historians. Our research led to at least 77 other publications, because we gave them the data to do their own investigations. We made 2 tv episodes, made somewhere near 20 publications, 1 interactive map and 1 interactive longread De Straat Die Niet Meer Bestaat (translated: The Street That No Longer Exists), which is now submitted to be archived by the Washington Holocaust Museum. We've provided translations of the key publications in the url's (Google Drive with Google Translated texts). "," We started with the data set in Google Spreadsheets and Excel. The stories we found, we're researched with several national, local and online archives. We searched through old newspaper articles to find personal information, and we got access to archives which are hard to get into (because of sensitive information on war criminals). We also used old city maps of Amsterdam from around the war.   We made our interactive map with OpenStreetMap and a DMS in Google Spreadsheets. When one of the adresses has been located (because not all adresses still exist), we can change this location in Google Spreadsheets, which automatically updates our map.   Our interactive longread was made mobile-first, and combines video, animation, illustrations, photos a poem and text to tell the story about the Joden Houttuinen. It was developed in Vue, a JavaScript framework. The video was edited in After Effects, and the design made in Illustrator. The back-end is a Google Docs document where the journalists inserted content. In combination of ArchieML and a custom script, the reporters were able to update the project in production. For the exact locations and factchecking of photos, we used a lot of geolocation tricks (OSINT). "," When we started our investigation, the hardest part was to make an 75 year old database relevant in 2020. What stories haven't been told in the past decades? This required a lot of preliminary investigation, and we decided to depart from the municipalities. They can still be held accountable for not researching their own past. We could tell a lot of stories around that premise.   After that, we had to find out where the interesting stories can be found in a database of more than 7.000 transactions. Our preliminary research helped a lot, and eventually every row in this spreadsheet is an interesting story to tell. We always tried to find key persons in our stories which could be a symbol for a larger group: victims, buyers, notaries, real estate agents, companies, etc. It's hard to make a good story from just one row of data.   We used all sorts of archives to make substantial stories. It's really important to factcheck every column in the spreadsheet, because the original documents were handwritten. So finding more evidence who the real buyer is, for what price is was sold, etc. was a key part in our investigations. We all wrote up our main lessons in a making-of article, so other people can do their own research with our tips. "," What we learned, was that even the second world war (a part of our history that caused countless books, articles and movies) can be fuel for journalistic stories that are still relevant and important. Our combination of data journalism, archival research and classic journalism created an extensive investigation that was featured online in articles, an interactive map and our interactive longread, and two tv episodes. We gave the data personality and emotion.   Sharing the data and activating other journalists was important for our impact. Other regional and local journalists could go to work with our data. And because they made beautiful stories with the data, more municipalities felt the pressure of doing their own research. We also collaborated with our colleagues of De Monitor (KRO-NCRV) and Follow The Money on several parts during this investigation. Journalists working together on a data journalism project: that's just awesome, and more newsrooms should consider opening up their shop to make information even more relevant.

France,"Disclose, Mediapart, Le Poulpe, Brut, France Culture, France 2",Small,Shortlist,Inside Lactalis,18/10/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Database, Open data, OSINT, Podcast/radio, Infographics, Satellite images, Environment, Agriculture","Animation, Drone, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," Disclose has spent a year investigating the Lactalis ‘system’, involving numerous interviews and the study of hundreds of administrative and legal documents. This lengthy research reveals for the first time the extent of the group’s questionable practices, and also a certain sentiment of impunity that appears to be present within the multinational; failings in the field of food safety, massive pollution of rivers, the dissimulation of information, failings in control mechanisms, large-scale tax evasion and the hunting of whistleblowers. "," The project have a hudge impact in France, first because Disclose published with 5 partners media on radio (3 podcast broadcast on public radio France Culture ), online, and on TV ( a documentary broadcast on public channel France 2). The publication raised an audience of more thant 3 millions people in France. To further the public’s right to information, Disclose has published online all of the documents obtained, and which are listed under the plants concerned. We also created an interactive map who was use by several local media to continue our work. Two environmental NGO use the data provide online by Disclose to initiate legal prosecution for pollution against Lactalis. One NGO who fight against tax evasion used the financial documents published by Disclose to initiate prosecution against Lactalis. And one of the main farmers' unions held Lactalis to account following our revelations. The fishing and river protection association wrote to the Minister of Environment to denounce the serious environmental damage caused by Lactalis. One month after our revelation, the Ministry of Environment announced the creation of a new criminal offense on ecocides for private companies responsible for pollution and damage to the biotope. Last impact, parliamentarians demanded that Lactalis repay the public subsidies received by the State. Regional councils decide not to pay subsidies to Lactalis in regions where factories were accused of polluting rivers.                                             "," Disclose use several tool to map the factoris of Lactalis, who were hidden because not register like Lactalis factories. For this we use data of the registry of commerce to find the sharholder of the factory, we were able to find 60 factories in France own by Lactalis. After find these factories, we use satellite imagery to map the coordinate GPS and discover that all factories were based close to a river. Then, we send FOIA's request for each factories to the state authority responsible for environmental control and the authority responsible for sanitary control of factories to obtained documents that was documents that had to be public but were not disclosed by the State. We received hundred of documents from 2010 to 2020 : environmental and sanitary reports, the non-compliance orders of factories on environmental and health laws taken by the State authorities. We created our own data to analyze and categorize the information obtained on each factories. We read all the documents and put the result in a excel document, which allowed us to create data on the number of river pollution by 37 Lactalis factories over 10 years, the number of non-compliance with requests for compliance by the environmental protection authority, the impacts on the aquatic environment. We also ask the administration to obtained the analyzes carried out by the factories themselves on the pollutants discharged into the rivers. We cross-appraised the data obtained on the level of pollutants released, which enabled us to know what type of pollutants were released, in what quantity and if above the threshold authorized by environmental laws.Finally, we examined 113 documents which concerned the yearly accounts of companies owned by Lactalis and which appear to indicate a system of tax evasion to Luxembourg.                                                 "," The group Lactalis do not published documents about environmental issue, it's a very secret company and it was really hard to find information about these factory. We therefore decide to use the FOIA request on the documents that Lactalis is legally obliged to send to the State. But in France, public documents are ofen not disclose by administration at all level. On the state's Opendata website, the data is mostly very old and not up to date. Public administrations in France regularly oppose FOIA requests from citizens and journalists, or simply do not respond. So it was really difficulte to obtained this document, and Disclose was help by a pro-bono lawyer. When they finally send documents, they are often unorganized, or in very heavy excel form with thousands of data mixed up.Basing ourselves on <a href=""https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGIARTI000006832922/2013-12-10/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Article L124-3  of France’s environmental law code, and Article 1 of the July 17th 1978 law regarding access to administrative documents, we addressed a total of 66 requests for public information concerning Lactalis production plants, which were submitted to 34 prefectures (local state administration centres) across France. Following the refusals by administrations to communicate the requested information, Disclose appealed against their non-cooperation on 22 occasions before the French mediating body for access to administrative documents, the  Commission d’accès aux documents administratifs  (CADA) - the FOIA authoritiy. This resulted in 16 rulings by FOIA authoritiy  in favour of Disclose. Disclose addressed requests to five regional councils, four regional agencies of the food, agriculture and forestry administration (Draaf), and six regional public water management agencies, for details of subsidies granted to the group’s production plants. Resulting from an exchange of around 350 emails with public administrative services. "," This investigative show how you can investigate on a company who hidden informations about is environmental impact with public data. This investigative shows how you can investigate a company that is hiding information about its environmental impact only with public data. It helps to understand how the use of public data such as business registers, environmental reports, public administration controls, can be sufficient to demonstrate the negative impact of industrial activities. That also show how FOIA's request can be use to have a lot informations. Disclose obtained and studied several thousand documents that included prefectural decrees, sanitary inspection reports, and data concerning products evacuated into watercourses by Lactalis plants.     ",https://lactalistoxique.disclose.ngo/en,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/19/french-dairy-giant-accused-of-polluting-countrys-famous-rivers-for-years,https://lequotidien.lu/economie/lactalis-aurait-echappe-au-fisc-via-le-luxembourg/,https://vimeo.com/471680608,https://www.franceculture.fr/emissions/series/enquete-lait-toxique,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=682411136029881,https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/10/22/le-groupe-laitier-lactalis-accuse-de-ne-pas-respecter-le-code-de-l-environnement_6056932_3244.html,,"Marianne Kerfriden, Mathias Destal, Inès Léraud, Geoffrey Livolsi"," Marianne Kerfriden, is an investigative journalist and film documentary who ofen work on agricultural topics, living in Nantes.    Inès Léraud, is an investigative journalist on radio, who has doing long-term stories on environmental and social impact of agribusiness in France.

With the data, it was possible to reveal that less than half of the respirators purchased by the states of the country were delivered at the time of peak disease.   The report exposed irregularities, unnecessary and unaudited spending of public money, as well as evidence of corruption. "," The work also became a story in Jornal Nacional, the main one on TV in the country. Its content gained national repercussion. The report shed light on a latent problem, giving a panorama hitherto unexplored. With this, new investigations were carried out on the purchase of equipments in the country.   The survey shows that:   1. states purchased 6,998 pulmonary respirators during the Covid-19 pandemic, but only 3,088 were delivered - less than half the equipment (44%)   2. the average amount paid for a respirator ranged from R$ 40,000 to R$ 226,000 in the country. That is, a respirator cost up to five times more than another "," The data were collected from the health departments of the 26 states and the Federal District. Requests were made to the press offices and through the Access to Information Law. Requests were also made to all Public Prosecution Offices in each state, via advisory and via AIL, to learn about the investigations in progress.

Brazil,"Agência Lupa, Google News Initiative",Small,Winner,No Epicentro (At the epicenter),24/07/20,"Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, News application, Map, Health",Python,"   No epicentro  is a data visualization tool created with the aim of alerting to the amazing numbers of Covid-19 deaths in Brazil. Up until 2021 January 5th, over 196,000 people had died due to Covid‑19 in the country. But it can be difficult to visualize it so we thought: what if all these deaths had happened near you? Since major Covid‑19 outbreaks happened in metropolitan areas, many Brazilians don’t see the effects of the disease in their daily lives. This simulation was created to make the dimension of our losses easier to understand. It was replicated by ""The Washington Post"". "," The project was published on July 24th. One week after its launch, it had more than 210,000 page views. Among those, 178,000 were unique users. But the most remarkable indicator is that these people spent, on average, 10 minutes and 54 seconds browsing the website. This is way above market average. Also, people really dove into the story: for every 100 people who began the narrative experience, 71 reached the end of the narrative. Also, by publishing ""No Epicentro"", Agência Lupa added a new ​​activity - data visualization projects - in its business portfolio.   One of the biggest TV celebrities in Brazil, Luciano Huck, tweeted about the awareness the tool was able to bring and invited all his 13,1 million followers to experience ""No epicentro"". The tool was reported in the biggest brazilian national daily, ""Folha de S,. Paulo"" (<a href=""https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/07/plataforma-mostra-o-que-ocorreria-se-a-pandemia-de-covid-19-estivesse-concentrada-na-sua-vizinhanca.shtml"">https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/07/plataforma-mostra-o-que-ocorreria-se-a-pandemia-de-covid-19-estivesse-concentrada-na-sua-vizinhanca.shtml ).   The tool was also reported on prime time TV show Fantastico, biggest audience on Sunday television in the country: <a href=""https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2020/08/09/brasil-chega-aos-100-mil-mortos-por-covid-aplicativo-dimensiona-devastacao-da-doenca.ghtml"">https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2020/08/09/brasil-chega-aos-100-mil-mortos-por-covid-aplicativo-dimensiona-devastacao-da-doenca.ghtml .

Finally, ""No epicentro"" was also awarded ""Best Visualization Tool"" at WANIFRA LATAM DiGITAL AWARDS 2020 (https://events.wan-ifra.org/events/2020-latam-digital-media-awards/content/4667) and will compete with other visualizaton tool created all around the world this year.  "," Regarding the nerdier aspects of the project, we used Python to develop the project's backend. Most computations use the geo-spatial analysis package GeoPandas and other related libraries, such as Shapely. For the front-end, we use Mapbox and a Javascript library called turf.js.   But an important point was the issues we faced while choosing the best dataset for the job. The most critical database would be the representation of Brazil's population distribution. All calculations would be made from that and there were two options, both from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The most detailed of those is the statistical grid, a division of the Brazilian territory in a series of 200m² rectangles in urban areas and 1km² in rural areas. The other alternative were the census tracts. They are usually smaller in very populated areas and larger in areas with less population density. At first, it seemed that the better choice was to use the most detailed data possible, but the first tests with the statistical grid already showed performance problems, so we opted for the census tracts.    The second database was the number of deaths by Covid-19 in Brazil. However, the disclosure of these figures by public authorities has been confusing since the beginning of the pandemic. In the first weeks, it was erratic and not very granular. Then, it underwent methodological changes that undermined confidence in official information. To circumvent this, independent entities started to collect and publish these statistics. We chose the survey of Brasil.io, a team of about 40 volunteers who compiled daily cases and deaths in each city in the country since March 2020.    The project was under GNU and Creative Commons licenses, which allowed the content to be reproduced. ""No epicentro"" is also open source. "," The whole awareness/perception task was hard. On March 16, 2020, the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, said that the country would not ""overate"" the new coronavirus and that there was ""hysteria"" regarding Covid-19. On that day, the country registered 34 cases of contamination by SARS-Cov-2, the virus that causes the disease. The following day, March 17, Brazil saw its first death by Covid-19 – a retired doorman, Manoel Messias Freitas Filho, 62, who lived in São Paulo. From then on, the numbers of deaths and registered cases of contamination by the new coronavirus became routine for the Brazilians, occupying a good part of national Journalism. As the days passed, those numbers grew in geometric progression, so that the words ""oversize"" and ""hysteria"", from May on, lost their meaning completely. In September, more than 1000 Brazilians were dying each day.  In addition, with misinformation spread and social isolation measures being partially adhered to, it became more difficult to see, in fact, what the new coronavirus was causing. Was it a real pandemic or a hoax? It seemed that ""other people"" were dying, not me. The numbers were faceless. How to show the human cost of the disease beyond misinformation, hours of boredom and sidewalks half empty? With this in mind, the team at ""No epicentro"" started to work on references that could bring familiarity to the theme and could place the user at the center of this experience. For that, is there anything more familiar than the place where we live? Although this data did not reflect the reality as a whole, placing all the victims of the new coronavirus ""at the side"" of the user was a way of bringing the tragedy closer to the perception of each one. "," The most important lesson we learned - and other journalists can learn from the process by reading ""the making of No epicentro"", published in Medium (https://medium.com/datavizbr/como-fizemos-o-mapa-interativo-que-te-coloca-no-epicentro-da-epidemia-de-covid-19-no-brasil-4ce949a9183b) and in GitHub (https://github.com/noepicentro/) - was how valuable a multidisciplinary team is when we talk about digital journalism. Three professionals specialized in data journalism and visual narratives were responsible for the development of the project: the designer Vinicius Sueiro, the journalist-programmer Rodrigo Menegat and the developer Tiago Maranhão. Gilberto Scofield Jr., Director of Strategy and Business at Agência Lupa, Natalia Leal, Content Director at Lupa, and Marco Túlio Pires, Google News Lab Lead in Brazil, were also part of the team, everybody coordinated by one of the best data-visualization professionals in the world, Alberto Cairo, from University of Miami.   We also learned that good communication and openness to constructive criticism is key for achieving positive outcomes. When the team was set up, it seemed like all the development tasks were very compartmentalized and could be performed individually: to us, it was really possible that everyone involved sat at their computers, did their parts and just talked to each other when assembling the parts.    Luckily, the routine was different. The development team itself talked almost non-stop in a WhatsApp group chat which was particularly active late at night, with conversations about all dimensions of the content. The extended team, with professionals from Lupa and Google, met weekly on video conferences to discuss the product. Even though each professional had specific demands, everyone's fingerprints are on every piece of the material.    In the end, the team worked under a strict division of labor, but with freedom to make suggestions on topics distant from each person's responsibilities. The first half of the equation ensured productivity and efficiency. The second ensured creativity and critical sense.  ",https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/lupa/epicentro/,https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-deaths-neighborhood/,https://events.wan-ifra.org/events/2020-latam-digital-media-awards/content/4667,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PMj8A9lDvI&t=2s,https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/tecnologia/2020/07/24/plataforma-dimensiona-mortes-por-covid-19-no-pais-a-partir-de-dados-locais,https://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2020/08/09/brasil-chega-aos-100-mil-mortos-por-covid-aplicativo-dimensiona-devastacao-da-doenca.ghtml,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/07/plataforma-mostra-o-que-ocorreria-se-a-pandemia-de-covid-19-estivesse-concentrada-na-sua-vizinhanca.shtml,,"Gilberto Scofield Junior, Natalia Leal, Vinicius Sueiro, Tiago Maranhão, Rodrigo Menegat, Marco Tulio Pires, Alberto Cairo"," GILBERTO SCOFIELD JR.  is a communication executive and Business and Strategy Director at Agência Lupa.

South Africa,News24,Small,Shortlist,Targeting AGU Team C: How Zane Kilian tracked anti-gang cop Charl Kinnear and his team. An investigation by News24.,13/12/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Video, Map, Corruption, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights",Microsoft Excel," A policeman leading a gang task-force was assassinated and, in the weeks that followed, our investigation uncovered evidence that an underworld figure had used illegal cellphone technology to track his movements for months.   A dataset revealed how a pliant PI became an assassin’s hidden hand, his illegal surveillance tied to other attempted murders. Our project unearthed evidence that hundreds of people, including high ranking police officials, politicians, and rival gangsters were spied on.   What may be South Africa’s most extensive private surveillance scandal – with network operators surreptitiously selling access to their systems – was exposed by a murder.       "," The project – in long form and using data visualizations showing the real locations of hundreds of people who were surveilled – followed a narrative of how a failed sports star turned to the criminal underworld and became a spy.   Our investigation put paid to Zane Kilian’s public denials that he didn’t know who he was tracking, and uncovered evidence of a vast history of illegal surveillance, monitoring the movements of more than 600 people.   Access to the tracking technology – meant to be the preserve of law enforcement – had quietly been sold on the open market to hundreds of people, with our project showing the scale of privacy breach, which in some cases had deadly consequences.   Our investigative reporting revealed how mobile networks reactively shut access to their systems, which were effectively hijacked for this shadowy espionage for years without detection. Operators have launched high level investigations into the breach, and News24 is using freedom of information legislation to gain access.   Anti-surveillance experts have called for network operators, the legal custodian of their customers’ data, to face a parliamentary inquiry. The country’s Information Regulator has launched their own investigation into potential breaches of privacy laws.    Police top brass have also instituted an investigation into how this system had been infiltrated by criminal operators, and effectively used a life-saving technology to plan an assassination and other attacks. "," The team utilised free cellphone directory application TrueCaller to identify a vast majority of the 5 000 plus records of cell phones that were tracked, and used other databases to further verify identifies. The visualisaitons were built using the 3D Map function on Microsoft Excel, and the website was built using Shorthand.     The visualisations were made possible with the GPS coordinates already contained in the database provided to us, but it required the use of Power Queries and numerous format edits to make the data usable for the 3D Map function. More sophisticated software was considered but ultimately, we chose to use tools that were readily available on a majority of personal and work computers around the world.  "," This project was not without its challenges, and likely the most significant hurdle to overcome was processing the raw data and putting a name and face to each of the thousands of cell phone numbers, with two reporters to do this.    We obtained an Excel spreadsheet which had been populated by owners of the illegal software platform, which had been handed over the police. The dataset provided key insight into every cell phone PI Zane Kilian illegally surveilled over a period of 17 months, and the corresponding GPS coordinates of the precise moment their phones were “pinged”, but they were still just faceless numbers.   We turned to call identification app Truecaller, which uses end-user agreements to generate a global bank of contacts on their servers and allows a user to input a number in a search, the result returning the user’s crowdsourced name [as it had been stored in the contact books of others]. There were two obstacles to surmount, firstly one is only allowed 20 number searches per day and the second is that results, because of crowdsourcing, lacked accuracy.   For six weeks, our team of two waded through the dataset, using Truecaller as an online divining rod. When numbers were matched to names, publicly available document searches and interviews were used to confirm the personal details of the survielled.     Once 5308 numbers had been identified to the best possible extent, freely available mapping software was used to develop patterns and networks, identifying key people who were being tracked by nefarious forces.     A not uncommon yet inherent hinderance is the personal danger when engaging criminal actors, who in this instance, have tentacles which have a considerable reach, even into the ranks of the police. "," Our project was compiled a small investigative team consisting of just two journalists, who between them divided ours spent in the field, processing data, and conducting interviews, all while covering other investigative beats.   Operating within the media landscape in South Africa requires prudential management of resources, and to ameliorate this, we turned to solutions which were free. Using credit traces to identify thousands of individual cell numbers would have notched up massive costs, thus TrueCaller became our code book.      The data visualisations for the story were created using tools readily available on nearly all computers in the world. It’s not difficult, once you have the information, to experiment and create similar maps.   We were industrious in producing this project, a valuable tenet in African newsrooms which are often small and underfunded. This concept, one which is open to adaption for use in other projects, would be advantageous for African newsrooms to produce world-class data investigations.

South Africa,"Oxpeckers Investigative Environmental Journalism, Internews' Earth Journalism Network, The Third Pole, The Frontier Manipur, Haluan and Ekuatorial",Small,Shortlist,#WildEye Asia: Mapping wildlife crime,04/03/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Map, Environment, Corruption, Crime","Personalisation, Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Python"," #WildEye Asia is a pioneering geo-journalism tool that provides access to data on wildlife trafficking. It maps information on seizures, arrests, court cases and convictions. The platform also hosts a dossier of investigative reporting. #WildEye Asia was created out of a sense of urgency when Covid-19 hit, and the question of what law enforcement and legal systems are doing about illegal wildlife trade became a concern for everyone. Until now, there has been no single place to access information on efforts to crack down on wildlife crime. #WildEye addresses this gap by tracking and sharing data on justice in action. "," We have seen significant success in making wildlife trafficking data publicly accessible. By shining a light on the scale of illegal wildlife trade taking place, we have sparked the interest of other journalists, law enforcement, and organisations monitoring and investigating wildlife crime. We have mapped over 900 incidents of seizures, arrests, court cases and convictions on the #WildEye Asia map. These span the entire continent and record information on more than 100 different endangered species.    We have also contributed to the narrative around Covid-19 and its links to illegal wildlife trade. When the urgent need to tackle wildlife trade that is illegal, unsustainable and poses threats to human health and biodiversity conservation became apparent, resources like #WildEye highlighted the need for urgent action.    We have formed ongoing relationships with organisations across the globe, including wildlife monitoring agency Traffic, the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, USAID, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Environmental Investigation Agency, the Freeland Foundation and Investigate Earth, among others. We have also interacted with law enforcement agencies, including Interpol, the Wildlife Justice Commission and local law enforcement.    A total of 16 in-depth, data-driven investigations have been published in China, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia and Vietnam. These have been viewed and shared, along with the #WildEye map, hundreds of thousands of times. Topics include Chinese courts' leniency towards pangolin offenders; insurgents linked to India's rhino poaching syndicates; traditional Chinese medicine in wildlife; and using new Indonesian law to nab wildlife smugglers.    We have also hosted eight webinars between May and December 2020, with a total of 416 participants from all over the world. These included training on how and why to use #WildEye; investigating wildlife trafficking and conservation reporting; digitisation for anti-corruption and Covid-19 and the environmental crisis. These webinars are available on #WildEye. "," #WildEye Asia was built by developers using an open-source platform called Mapbox. This was customised to fit in with Oxpeckers' style, and to suit our needs as data journalists.    #WildEye Asia's main feature is a map of the continent showing where law enforcement agencies and legal systems have been involved in action against wildlife trafficking. Each case is identified by an icon that signifies either a seizure, an arrest, a court case or a conviction.    The tool includes a search function to help users filter information and find topics of interest. If you want to learn about the illegal trade of pangolin scales, for instance, simply type ""pangolin"" or ""scales"" in the search box and you will get a host of results covering incidents involving pangolin scale smuggling.    We also have an alert system, which allows users to subscribe to receive updates on either an area or a specific case. Each time the data is updated, you will receive an email with this information. Use the buttons to subscribe and unsubscribe on the map. This way, you do not need to search manually for updated information, and can rely on #WildEye to do this for you.    Data is uploaded on Mapbox via a Google spreadsheet that is updated on a weekly basis, sometimes more frequently. Methods of data collection range from scraping social media and news sites to working with reports and datasets provided by monitoring organisations. We convert bulky reports and complex datasets into spreadsheets that can be analysed and added to #WildEye. By engaging with organisations such as Traffic, the Wildlife Justice Commission, the Environmental Investigation Agency, the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime, the Environmental Reporting Collective and the Indonesian Data Journalism Network, we have been able to access some of this data more easily. "," Our biggest challenge has always been accessing data, mainly because #WildEye is the first platform to collect, collate, analyse and make public data on legal processes relating to illicit wildlife trade in Asia.    We always knew that we were creating a tool that maps and makes the data public, but quickly came to understand why we were doing this when we hit multiple roadblocks and had to fight to get that information - in some cases, the fight isn't even nearly over.    This is what led us to working so closely with local journalists and locally-based monitoring organisations. These people and the work they do are crucial to our understanding, involvement and accessing of often sensitive information. We have worked with over a dozen locally-based journalists to produce data-driven investigations that highlight issues related to wildlife trafficking in China, Indonesia, India, Nepal and Vietnam.  "," #WildEye is a fantastic customisation of open-source technology, which we hope encourages others – especially journalists – to test similar methods of creating, collating and visualizing large datasets of their own. We have been vocal about the challenges we faced throughout the creation of this tool during in-person interactions, on panels and in webinars, and hope that others learn from our experiences. Making important data sets look good and easily accessible does not have to be difficult, and #WildEye is a prime example of this, within the context of data journalism. We have also shown how to turn data into a compelling and important environmental story. By training journalists how to work the tool, we have published numerous investigations that use #WildEye data to tell their stories, lending our voice to issues around the law, health, safety, corruption and illicit financial flow. We see these stories as demonstrating what newsworthy and good quality data journalism looks like.

United States,CBS Chicago,Big,Shortlist,Left in the Dark,15/11/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Chart, Video, Map, Crime",Python," Published about five years after the Chicago Police Department first began issuing body cameras to its officers,  Left in the Dark  explores how the policies surrounding those cameras have broken down at nearly every level, and how those breakdowns have exacerbated the trauma inflicted by police misconduct. "," In response to our reporting, the Chicago Inspector General’s office said they would take steps to ensure the body cameras are seen as “more than high-tech vest ornaments,” and would focus on body camera usage in a follow-up inquiry to a 2019 report it published, which, in part, discussed issues with CPD’s body camera policy, including misuse of cameras.   We asked Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and CPD Superintendent David Brown what steps they’d take following our reporting. Neither responded directly to our questions, and numerous interview requests to both officials were ignored.   A spokesperson for Mayor Lightfoot did say the city would “create a strengthened plan to ensure compliance among all officers with bodyworn [sic] cameras, including more detailed aspects of compliance such as the extent to which officers properly record interactions with the City’s residents.” The spokesperson didn’t provide specifics, so we will continue to report on those purported changes in the future.   In addition, during the summer of 2020, while we were reporting this story, two CPD officers who weren’t wearing body cameras shot a man in the back. In response, CPD announced officers on its specialized “community safety team” would finally be equipped with body cameras. Our focus now is to investigate how those changes play out. "," The data analysis was done in Python, particularly using geospatial tools like Geopandas and the Folium mapping library to visually examine geographic disparities in the data we obtained.    To help piece together how often officers do activate their cameras when required, we used data on more than 340,000 routine investigatory stops beginning in 2018, after every patrol officer was equipped with a camera. At the time we reported the story, hundreds of officers on specialized tactical teams still weren’t required to wear cameras, so we used daily officer assignment data to rule out officers assigned to one of those teams, and found one in ten stops weren’t recorded. When factoring in officers who are on those teams, the number jumps to one in five.   We mapped that data down to the police beat — a small geographic subdivision, typically less than a square mile — used by CPD. It shows stark disparities in the use of body cameras, particularly when including stops made by officers assigned to tactical teams, who primarily work in predominantly Black and brown communities. While almost 100 percent of stops in the predominantly white North Side were recorded, less than 60 percent of stops were recorded in some parts of the South and West sides. "," The biggest challenge with the data was determining if an officer had been given a camera at the time of the stop. While officers not equipped with cameras are part of the problem, our focus was on investigatory stops by officers who had cameras but didn’t use them properly.   We knew all patrol officers had cameras, but those on specialized teams didn’t, so we sought to determine if an officer was on one of those teams at the time of each stop. We obtained data showing the unit assignments of every CPD officer every day and cross-cross-referenced the officer’s identities and dates of the stops to determine if they were on one of those teams at the time of the stop.   In addition, we faced significant issues obtaining records in nearly every FOIA request we filed for this story.   In our requests to CPD's accountability organization, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), for video of the one particular stop of a man we featured heavily in the story, COPA initially failed to release the dashcam video, and improperly redacted multiple portions of the body camera video. They only corrected the redactions when we realized they accidentally left one portion unredacted which was redacted in another officer’s camera.   CPD vigorously fought the release of internal audit reports on its body camera program that we requested. After we initially requested them in June 2019, police denied the request, saying they were exempt from release because they were materials gathered in the course of an audit. We refiled the request, and, after nearly four months, CPD denied the request again. We then appealed the request to the Illinois Attorney General, who agreed the records were in fact subject to release. "," The takeaway from our experience reporting this story is the value combining records reporting and data reporting can bring.   On its own, the data we uncovered revealed significant disparities between communities in the likelihood an incident will be recorded — a finding that would have been significant even without the records we obtained. Likewise, the internal audit reports we fought so hard to get revealed not only that there was a problem, but that CPD knew about it for years, often documenting the same problem month after month.   Like our data, that would have been a story on its own. But the conjunction of the two yielded an even more powerful narrative: CPD knew there were problems with officers misusing cameras, and with the accountability systems set up to ensure officers use cameras properly. Yet, as far as we can tell (and as far as CPD has told us), they've made little meaningful progress. The consequences of that lack of accountability are the disparities we saw in our data.  ",https://chicago.cbslocal.com/leftinthedark,,,,,,,,"Samah Assad, Christopher Hacker, Dave Savini"," Samah Assad is an investigative journalist with WBBM/CBS Chicago.

READr analyzes more than 5,000 fact-checking reports and gain insights into the status and trends of the infodemic.  "," This is the first complete investigative report in the world that analyzed the disinformation about COVID-19. We analyzed more than 5,000 fact-checking reports written by fact-checking organizations in the world to find out the characteristics of disinformation spread in different countries. Not only data analysis, we also interviewed fact checkers from various countries, and they shared the actual harm caused by these disinformation. We also verified the influence of these fake messages in tens of millions of tweets from Twitter, and found that disinformation in the ""good news"" category is more likely to spread, which was different from the sensational one. "," In the part of data analysis, we used web-crawlers to get the fact-checking reports of IFCN(The International Fact-Checking Network), and used R to analyze the data. Manual classification of disinformation was the most time-consuming part of this project. We used TF-IDF word segmentation to help reporter find the same type of disinformation. Also, we used some functions of Google Spreadsheet, like translation, to minimize the time spent on manual classification.   For the data visualization, we use Adobe Illustrator to design graphs and use Flourish to build interactive charts. We use Vue.js and vue-i18n to implement multi-language web page. "," When the reporter analyzed more than 5,000 fact-checking reports, we found out that these disinformations were sometimes so ridiculious, and even rearrangement the combination of the terms will be a new disinformation, but some people still believe them. We wanted to convey this feeling to users, because the users may only received one or two disinformation, but the whole world was facing the impact of huge number of disinformation at the same time. With the help of web designers and engineers, we used ""slot machines"" to convey this feeling. Users could simply ""create a disinformation"" through click the bottom on the slot machine. Users could experienced that in the process of playing, even if the disinformations you create were absurd, they may be actual disinformations. And you only need to change the combination of terms to generate a new disinformation.   While the epidemic was still developing, that is, when there was hardly any academic resrearch (only a few weeks before our report published, a report contains 225 disinformation sample studies released by the Reuters Institute fot the Study of Journalism). To do this, the newsroom had to assume the responsibility of research, and this is exactly what data journalism should do.

Taiwan,READr,Small,Shortlist,How China use Twitter as a weapon of COVID-19 propaganda,03/06/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Open data, Chart, Politics","R, RStudio, Python"," COVID-19 epidemic first broke out in China in early 2020.   In order to maintain its international image, the Chinese diplomatic group began to publish positive posts on Twitter, from optimistic and active anti-epidemic experience to donating materials to other countries.  We analyze the posts of the embassies' accounts, which is in the list monitored by the American think tank ""German Marshall Foundation"".We found that the diplomatic team uses the official accounts of Spokespersons as the main combat force to actively respond to external critics; other members, including embassies and ambassadors abroad, strengthen the influence on public opinion by retweeting. "," This report is the first one to analyze the original data which the Chinese diplomatic group has published since the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic released from Twitter. Almost all the media in Taiwan only quoted from Twitter’s press release, while ignoring the batch of data they released. After further analysis, we found more interesting facts. For example, with the control of the domestic epidemic, the strategy of propaganda has changed several times, from the beginning of the fight against the epidemic with grateful and positive attitude, to emphasize China’s positive contribution to the world to fight against the epidemic. However, China rarely announced how the medical system was out of control.  Moreover, they spent a lot of effort arguing with the U.S. where the epidemic started to spread and which country should be responsible for it. "," We have a Python script to fetch the Twitter data by calling the Twitter API. And make the segments by Jieba, a Python library for CJK segmentation. After that, we have the term frequency analytics by TF/IDF to identify the keywords of each article. "," During operation, we processed hundreds of thousands of tweets. To visualize the huge amount of data, and uncover the meaning behind them is difficult, but very interesting. Compared with almost all the media only quoting Twitter's released news, we are the first media to analyze their data. "," To people who are interested in public opinion analysis, the report shows how to analyze data from a number of social networking sites quickly and find their interaction patterns and associate with each other. To people who are concerned about how the Chinese government handles the epidemic crisis, the report attempts to provide an image about how China defended the legitimacy of the regime by using the influence of public opinion in its diplomatic group.

That allow users to simulate which political figures you as anadvertising target by setting conditions of different ages, genders, and regions. "," In response to Taiwan’s presidential election, Facebook opened its advertising database in Taiwan in August 2019, collecting and disclosing all users’ advertisements on Facebook, and later actively required ""political advertisements"" to disclose the target and amount of advertisements. We analyzed the data of advertising database that began in October 2019, and further analyzed the target of the official fanpage of legislator candidates in 2020. From thousands of data, we found that ""middle-aged"" and ""male"" were the main target of this election. But there were also special candidates whose main target was female or who were not in their election districts.   Although the amount of advertising on Facebook is already considerable, Facebook advertising is not yet the main battlefield of election.

South Korea,The Kyunghyang Shinmun (daily newspaper),Big,Shortlist,Three workers a day are never back from work for good,15/01/20,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Infographics, Chart, Map, Employment, Human rights","Scraping, D3.js, JQuery, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python"," In Korea, three workers die in an accident at an industrial site a day. In order to effectively inform this horrible reality to the people, we decided to investigate how many people are dying for a certain period and show all of the death. we investigated and analyzed 1,305 accident reports. And then we reported articles that 1,748 workers were dead during a year and 10 months. We made an archive of how each person died into website, so readers could check it out. And we filled the front page of the newspaper only with over 1,000 dead workers' name. "," Since the report, many experts and civic groups have mentioned our reports in newspaper columns, statements, and social media. Kim Hoon, a famous Korean novelist who has usually spoken out about brutality of industrial accidents, sent a special contribution to our newspaper and we published it as a part of our article series. Political sphere and labor groups have also issued statements after our reports. At the time, the Democratic Party of Korea, the Bareunmirae Party, and the Justice Party mentioned the report and said they felt responsibility. They urged the government and the National Assembly and companies to take action to reduce accident. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, the two largest trade union organizations in Korea, also commented on our reports.   In the wake of our reports, many press have released similar reports that show the seriousness of industrial accidents. Like us, more articles have been written by analyzing accident reports. Interest in the deaths of workers has increased in journalism of Korea.   The punishment of industrial accidents in Korea was very weak. After the report, Minister of Labor Lee Jae-gap said in an interview with our paper that he would ask the Supreme court to raise the sentencing guidelines for punishment of industrial accidents . As mentioned in the interview, Minister Lee met with Kim Young-ran, chairman of the Supreme Court's Sentencing Committee, in June last year and asked for adjustment of sentencing guidelines. A month later, the Supreme Court's Sentencing Committee began revising the sentencing guidelines, and in January this year, it announced the sentencing guidelines to drastically increase the sentences of crimes violating the Industrial Safety and Health Act. "," We inputed all data into the Google Spread Sheet by hand. And then analyzed using the pivot table. We used Python for more detailed analysis. For example, to find out which conglomerates the industrial accidents are affiliated with, we created a program using Python that contrasts the workplace where industrial accident occurs with name of the affiliates. Python also were used analyzing what causes disasters and how many disasters have similar patterns.   We made an archive of how each person died into website as interactive news, which acts as an archive. It was created using html5/css3 and jquery and javascript. Using the D3.js library, 2,000 dead workers were visualized as small icon of human figures. The colors and forms of icon's shapes were expressed differently depending on the type of cause of the accident so that users could see that 50% of the death were caused by falls at a glance. Users also can categorize dead workers by age, proficiency, industry, size of business, accident type.   We visualized the distribution of daily deaths by heat map based on D3.js. death place. we marked the place of death on the map using Leaflet library.     "," The hardest part was collecting and organizing data. In order to understand the current status of industrial accidents, we requested information disclosure to the Ministry of Labor and obtained a list of accident reports from 2016 to September 2019. And we received 1,305 accident investigation reports that written form last year to September this year with the help of the Democratic Party of Korea's lawmaker Han Jung-ae's office. Because reports were in PDF file format, so we manually inputted them all into the spreadsheet. It took about a month and a half to complete data input. Refining data also wasn't easy because the list received from information disclosure, the list received through the lawmaker's office, and the list extracted from accident report were different. Until the day before the report, we had been revised the number of deaths.   It was the first time in Korea that an article compiled and analyzed all industrial accidents that occurred during a certain period of time. we also published the newspaper that filled front page with the dead worker's name, age, and cause of the accident. It was evaluated as an unconventional attempt. It was rough, but it had a great effect as an infographic.   Three people a day, more than 1,000 a year, die, but people don't know this very well. Our reports reminded many people of such a terrible reality once again.     "," The Old media is in crisis in these days amid the distrust of the media and the emergence of new media. Out report showed the possibility of what role traditional media can play by revealing structural problems and providing insights through extensive data collection and analysis in industrial accidents, a traditional field of reporting.   The combination of paper infographic and digital interactive news was first attempt in Korea. The subscription rate for newspapers is decreasing day by day. Many people think that newspaper pages are already old. However, newspapers are 'the biggest media' you can carry around with your hands. I think the experiencing of the properties of this medium deeply would impressed on current readers. We published the entire front page filled with a list of deaths, using the properties of this media. It delivered effectively messages to readers. On the other side of paper work, we created interactive news in digital space. It is archive of the dead workers on the web in the form of digital interactive news and deliver it to more people.   I think we presented one option to the media pursuing orthodox journalism.     ",http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_storytelling/2019/labordeath/,http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201911210600155&code=940702,http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201911210600145&code=940702,http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201911210600115&code=940100,http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201911250600025&code=940702,http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?art_id=201911280600055,http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201911280600015&code=990105,,"Kyungsang Hwang, Jihwan Kim, Minjee Choi, Areum Lee, Yoojin Kim"," Our team was organized for this report.

Known as the Defense Language Institute, it is an important but opaque part of our local community. I filed a data request for the number of students enrolled in each language at the institute going back to the school’s founding in the 1960s. The data eventually arrived—but in an arcane format. I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the data, mapping out how the curriculum and enrollment levels changed over time in response to the shifting priorities of U.S. foreign policy.      "," The Defense Language Institute looms large in our town but the community knows little about it. I was completing my story just as the U.S. assassinated top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani. With the help of the data, and sources like former U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta showed that alumni of the institute had possibly been involved in the operation.    The story became the talk of the town, and is still referred to by readers even a year later. We are always being asked to apply the same data journalism techniques from that story to new topics. "," I filed a request with the U.S. Army for data on the enrollment levels for each language taught at the Defense Language Institute going back to its founding. After a few months, I received hundreds of pages compiled into one PDF. The pages were computer printouts that had been scanned and digitized.    They showed tables of numbers, but since they were manually scanned, the tables were all slightly crooked or morphed. I tried using various OCR and extraction tools to scrape the tables and converted them into CSV files but nothing worked well enough. Eventually, I tried Abbyy FineReader and I managed to do it.    Once I had a master CSV file, I used Google Spreadsheets and Excel to clean the data. I sorted and filtered and created pivot tables to study the data. I quickly obtained facts that even the language institute didn’t and couldn’t know, such as the top language for each year, the top language overall and even just the list of all languages ever taught at the school.   From there, I used Google Flourish to visualize the data. My visualizations included various interactive charts including a bar chart race. I also created a searchable database with information on each language taught. The story also includes a link allowing the public to download the data and use it as they see fit.  "," The hardest part of this project was working on it alone. I am part of a very small newsroom with no history of data journalism and no one else with data skills. I had to pitch the idea and convince my editor it was worth the effort. Then I had to figure navigate the U.S. Army FOIA process which includes writing to lovely addresses such as ""usarmy.belvoir.hqda-oaa-ahs.mbx.rmda-foia@mail.mil."" I also had to do the data analysis and visualization on my own, figuring out whcih skills and tools I am missing and acquiring them as I went. "," One of the most important takeaways is probably the potential to blur the divide between local stories and national/global ones. In virtually every community, there are institutions or people who play a part in some international saga. Local readers want to know to just about their own communities' affairs but also about how their community fits into the larger world. And because data reporting is still in its infancy in local journalism, there are a million unique data sets like the one I found waiting to be requested.      ",https://www.montereycountyweekly.com/news/cover/exclusive-data-from-the-pentagon-s-language-school-offers-insight-into-america-s-shifting-foreign/article_3e1cf8fa-37de-11ea-8637-f3432fc92073.html,,,,,,,,Asaf Shalev," Originally from Los Angeles, I am a staff writer with Monterey County Weekly.

The project was inspired by the certainty that not It is a project that believes in the importance of quality and free information to transform the reality of citizens. ," Territorial control is one of the historical and distinctive characteristics of the dynamics of armed groups in Rio de Janeiro since the 1970s, and an unavoidable variable not only for public security, but also important for other urban public policies, from transportation and housing to education and health. Over the years, groups have emerged, fragmented and grown. But despite it's failure, the state's response over the past 40 years has remained the same: confronting these groups through direct confrontation operated by the police, aligned with the international policy called War on Drugs. As a consequence, beyond its natural beauties, Rio has become known for violence and stray bullets. Here, control over space is disputed by guns, both by organized crime and by the state itself. This situation exposes the population at any time to the crossfire, and affects the supply of any and all public and private services, especially in the peripheries where armed groups are mostly concentrated. The most tragic effect of this scenario can be understand by the fact that a 6-year-old boy from a favela in Rio has a better chance of being shot than obtaining a college degree. For this reason, it is surprising that the mapping of armed territorial domain has not been carried out to date or that, when done, it has not become of public knowledge and access. The lack of a reliable historical map of territorial control of these groups - and the disputes between them - not only hinders the elaboration and implementation of public policies in Rio, but also hinders the economic development led by private initiative, since any investment made without this information incurs a high level of blind risk. The project lauched in last october adresses exactly this missing information, and envisions to use the prototype to build. "," The project was carried out by 5 organizations with recognized experience in the area of public security (Fogo Cruzado, Pista News, Disque Denúncia, Geni/UFF and Nev/USP). The Disque Denúncia database was chosen as the primary source to classify the presence and control of armed groups over certain areas, due to its richness of details and territorial and temporal coverage. For the 2019 prototype, 37.883 anonymous denunciations were analyzed, which mentioned militias or drug trafficking, using natural processing language techniques. Of these, 10.206 were considered valid after a process of recognition of the groups mentioned and the type of activity mentioned. The valid denunciations were georeferenced, plotted on the map and processed from polygon maps, following statistical/mathematical criteria, to identify whether or not each polygon was controlled by the groups studied. The maps of polygons were constructed from the expertise of Pista News in mapping, slums and housing estates (informal geographic units, smaller than the official neighborhoods recognized by the city halls). The process resulted in a map that exposes the classification of each polygon identified according to the dominant group (ADA, CV, TCP or Militia) or as an area in dispute, according to data from 2019.   The same analysis was also done to evaluate the distribution of groups by neighborhoods (official classification provided by the Rio de Janeiro Public Prosecutor's Office). In 2019, 92% of the neighborhoods in the city of Rio, where almost 98% of its population lives, were partially or wholly under the control or in dispute for armed groups. The group with the greatest prominence were the militias, paramilitary groups formed by state security agents, who controlled partially or wholly 25.5% of the neighborhoods in the capital of Rio de Janeiro, where 33% of its population lives. "," The construction of the 2019 map of armed groups presented 3 major challenges. The first of them was to read and process thousands of anonymous denunciations (which deal with various types of crime), choosing only those that in fact present convincing indications of territorial control by a certain armed group. To solve this challenge, researchers with PhDs in areas related to public security defined objective criteria for determining territorial control and, based on the reading of a sample of the material, built dictionaries for subsequent automatic classification of text by machine, using natural language processing techniques. At the same time, a team of data and statistical scientists, sought to georeference the complaints of the Whistleblower. This task proved to be a challenge not only because of the amount of records, but also because of the low quality of the address information available due to spelling mistakes and standardization not corrected in the original database, but also because of the high level of urban informality of Brazilian cities, which makes it difficult to locate the addresses accurately. The solutions found were organized in an R package to facilitate new georeferencing rounds. Finally, the last challenge was the construction of maps that reflect the reality of urban informality in Rio. The official neighborhood map, made available by the MPRJ, is interesting for analysis of the coverage of militias (that generally operate in entire neighborhoods), but it is not granular enough to understand the reach of drug factions (usually restricted to favelas or housing estates). The solution was to build 2 complementary analyses. The partnership of Pista News, an organization that maps the control of armed groups in Rio's favelas and housing complexes in real time (but not with historical perspicacity) in a collaborative manner, was essential for the construction. "," The project is a tool for journalism in 2 main directions. Directly, by making the map available for free, becoming a tool for journalistic analysis to reveal trends, from corruption relations between some of these groups and local police units, to relations between politicians, through the direct impact of these groups' disputes on the access of population to services.   As the map's shapefile is open, the journalist can cross-check this information with any other data (health, education, sanitation) that have geolocation and produce diagrams that until then were not produced by the government. Such investigations can reveal the impact of the control of armed groups on the daily lives of the local population in various instances.   The project also encourages journalists to look for non-governmental sources of information to report reality and not to get stuck in the political narrative of the facts. In Rio de Janeiro, most newspapers and TV programs do not name factions and militias so that, according to some journalists, they do not value these groups. But that decision proved innocuous. With the map, we show that the action of these groups has grown and that it is important to give names to everyone, ponting who rules where, what is their progress and representativeness.   In other words, the Map of the Armed Groups of Rio de Janeiro is a journalistic opportunity to question the government in a multiciplinary, didactic and transparent way - and claim for better policies.     ",https://erickgn.github.io/mapafc/,https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2020-10-19/milicias-ja-dominam-um-quarto-dos-bairros-do-rio-de-janeiro-com-quase-60-do-territorio-da-cidade.html,https://www.time24.news/2020/10/rio-has-3-7-million-inhabitants-in-areas-dominated-by-organized-crime-militia-controls-57-of-the-city-area-says-study-rio-de-janeiro.html,https://www.clarin.com/mundo/milicias-paramilitares-poderosas-narcotrafico-rio-janeiro_0_G4elMpnvx.html,https://atualprodutora.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/apresentacao-16.10.2020.pdf,,,,"Maria Isabel MacDowell, Cecilia Olliveira, Daniel Hirata, Bruno Paes Manso, Diogo Lyra, Erick Gomes Nieto, Renan de Sousa e Silva, Natália Maciel Block, Maria Eduarda Barroso, Walkir Brito"," A network of academics, researchers and journalists that translated into numbers the expansion of the power of gangs and militias in Rio de Janeiro.  ",

When flicking through the thirty characteristics users discover interesting, some serious and some funny distribution patterns (from income to ), and learn about regional and cultural differences in Germany in a playful way. The maps show how different social, political and economic factors still divide Germany into two parts today - along differing geographical lines. Readers can also use the tooltip to find out how their home town is positioned in"," The project was surprisingly well-received by an international audience interested in exploring regional varieties in Germany and learning about the country in its nuances. Some readers used the tool to try and draw connections between certain regions of Germany and regions of other countries they knew. Inside Germany, the application was widely shared, including by the federal statistics office whose data the application was largely but not exclusively based on. Although the time of publication was shortly before the day of German Unity, which is a holiday in Germany, and data visualizations on this topic are no surprise, the special take of being able to divide Germany itself, even into North and South or completely different, was something new that appealed to readers. Despite the pandemic dominating the news, the project met with immense interest, more than 100,000 visits on the first day. "," In the research process we used Python as well as different APIs to gather data on characteristics where there was no official data available. RStudio/R was used for wrangling and then visualizing the different datasets on a map of Germany's 401 administrative districts. These preliminary plots were used to choose datasets with interesting distribution patterns, while the final visualizations are rendered by the web application using D3.js based on csv files we generated with R. "," Some of the data was challenging to convert into administrative districts, as was the case for raster-files of average annual sunshine duration or for data based on postal codes. During the web development process the idea of ""cutting"" the map into two by drawing a line was a difficult function to implement. While many organisations were publishing maps showing different socio-political, geographical etc divides, the project managed to find or create unconventional datasets to add, and developing the functionality that allows to compare the average of two parts and individual districts turned it into a unique, engaging user experience. "," Users from an international audience asked for similar projects to be implemented for other countries. We learned that there is specific added value in a story that is not only focussed on one or a few connected metrics, but lets users explore and compare regions across different dimensions. It communicates a more faceted and complex story and history of different places than a story focussing on one aspect can do.  It was also a good example for finding stories in data, as we set out to find datasets that show interesting patterns and based on that found and told stories of different aspects. Some of these stories were new to us as well as most others and wouldn't have been told if it wasn't for the process- (rather than result-)oriented approach we took with this project.    ",https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/deutschland-teilen-deutsche-einheit-wiedervereinigung/,,,,,,,,"Marie-Louise Timcke, André Pätzold, Angelo Zehr, Ida Flik, Christopher Möller"," Funke Mediengruppe's Interactive team develops interactive applications and data-driven stories for the Group's various news brands.

The project involves researching, analyzing, and formatting a database with more than 22,000 news items, in addition to developing web crawlers to search for content and computational intelligence for analyzing and looking for patterns. One of the winning projects for the Google News Initiative Innovation Challenge in Latin America, Confere.ai, also produces educational content to teach the public to identify false or misleading content. "," The first initiative to automate fact-checking in communication vehicles in Northeast Brazil, Confere.ai, was selected by the Google News Initiative Innovation Challenge in Latin America. The tool received about 4 thousand contents to check automatically during the first three months of operation. One of the tool's main impacts is the assertiveness in an uncontrolled environment, which was around 92% for texts and 75% for links. Confere.ai generated more than 70 editorial contents about reach, including articles on disinformation, fact checks, and videos with guidance to the public. The work also generated partnerships with the Universidade Católica de Pernambuco - Unicap. It was mentioned in dozens of local media outlets, and journalism course completion works, promoting knowledge about the automation of fact-checking in communication sciences. The articles produced by Confere.ai had 286 thousand hits over six months, while the tool reached an average of 500 hits per day. Confere.ai also managed to identify the waves of disinformation growing in the local media and debunking some rumors. Finally, the tool became part of the National Network to Combat Disinformation (RNCD). "," The creation and development of Confere.ai were carried out in stages. In the first, a hybrid database was set up: manual collection and storage of news links and texts previously checked by checking agencies; use of the corpus Fake.BR, from USP; and development of web crawlers to extract content from four different sites. The material was distributed in a database - with 21,956 news items, distributed in 9,011 texts and 12,945 links - on google sheets, cleaned with Open Refine. Part of this bank was analyzed manually to identify criteria. Creations were made using filters and a dynamic table for data extraction. From that, 15 criteria were defined for text evaluation and 20 criteria for link analysis. In the final analysis, the behavior of the values ​​obtained in each test performed in the database was observed to determine each criterion's relevance, and patterns were found that separated the real news from the misinformation. Part of the database was used for the development and training of computational intelligence. The following were used: the supervised technique (Random Forest -> uses a set of decision trees to form the fine answer) and input data BoW (Bag of Words) (a way of representing information in a text through the quantity or frequency of the words contained in it + linguistic characteristics of the text - extracted through natural language processing techniques). We built The Confere.ai web platform with python and angular. A dashboard was built from it, which facilitates the visualization of the data patterns entered in the tool. We carried out hundreds of data crossings to validate the previously defined criteria and measure assertiveness - which was 75% for links and 92% for texts. "," The creation and development of Confere.ai faced several challenges. The first was not to have similar reference projects in Portuguese, which could guide which technique is the most assertive to find disinformation patterns. Likewise, academic studies on fact-checking automation were lacking to create the criteria for identifying misinformation on the internet automatically. Due to this limitation, the team needed to seek English studies and try to adapt the results achieved to the Brazilian reality.There are also not many Portuguese corpora of disinformation data ready in Portuguese; there was only one database from the University of São Paulo. This, in turn, was out of date, with a series of links from 2016 and 2017 that had already been taken down, further limiting the analysis to identify patterns of disinformation. Likewise, there is a lack of free natural language processing APIs in Portuguese, which limited the identification of grammatical classes, emotional intentionality of words, grammatical errors, etc. This reduced the possibility of using many of the criteria for identifying misinformation applicable to English-language projects.To overcome these difficulties, the team used two actions. He performed the manual collection of previously classified misinformation, based on the analysis of three years of checks carried out by Brazilian checking agencies. The team also developed web crawlers to extract uninformative texts found on the Boatos.org website and informative texts found on the JC Online, Diario de Pernambuco, and G1 sites. This, however, presented different programming standards, which generated the need to study how each site was created and a dozen tests by the crawlers. In the end, we still face the challenge of convincing people to access a platform to check disinformation independently. "," The Confere.ai project offers a great contribution to the field of automation of fact-checking in Brazil. One of the pioneers in offering a solution that breaks the intermediaries between the uninformative piece and the readers' doubt. It is a project that contributes to thinking about using technology to combat disinformation in Brazil, which has proven to be a powerful engine for the destruction of public debate in the last two years.The originality of the project lies in, precisely, trying to propose a solution that shortens the distance between the content to be checked, the audience that receives it, and the final result of the check. Although it does not indicate whether something is true or false, it proposes to create a 'flea behind the ear' and a critical census in public.The project also innovates by developing a series of technologies capable of searching content on specific pages to form a database with more than 22 thousand contents; something is never before done in Northeast Brazil. This not only makes it possible to improve the tool, but it can also serve as an instrument for consolidating other fact-checking projects in the country's journalism.The differentials of Confere.ai are the creation of a list of criteria, based on the study of patterns of disinformation in text content and news links, which can be made available to other interested journalists and researchers in the communication area; It is also innovative in the application of artificial intelligence techniques in communication vehicles in Northeast Brazil and can serve as a reference for studies on AI in journalism.

The article zooms out over millions of years to explain why we’re living in a geologically unprecedented time. This piece grew out of an article in my climate newsletter The Rate of Change [2]. It was published in Parametric Press [3], an experimental online publication for interactive explanatory journalism, with feedback and input from their editors.

", I used Idyll and React for interactivity. I used the javascript library p5.js for canvas animations and plotly.js for graphing. ," There are a few aspects that were particularly challenging:   1. My goal was to create an interactive narrative that personalizes the history (and prehistory) of carbon dioxide around the life of the reader. As most interactive frameworks are designed for creating modular interactive elements rather than a customizable narrative, this was a technically complex project that required me to push the envelope in what was possible with these tools.   2. I went through many unsucessful iterations of visualizing the (somewhat abstract and technical) unit of 'parts per million', before arriving at the starfield visualization in the article. This interactive visualization uses motion and depth to convey how minute levels of a greenhouse gas can add up to a large effect.   3. As part of the customizable narrative, I wanted to annotate graphs with events that are specific and relevant to the reader's life. This was a considerable technical challenge, requiring a significant amount of custom code to adapt the plotly library to my needs.   4. Another challenging aspect was presenting this article in a responsive way that scaled and was interpretable on multiple screen sizes, which required a fair amount of custom typography scaling code and visual tweaks. "," Other journalists can learn how to present a large, technical dataset in a manner that is personal, relatable, and customized to the reader's life.

"," The dashboard and information website was the first to be produced in Malaysia providing a bird’s eye view of the pandemic in the country as well as key information about lockdowns and how to stay safe at this time. Since its launch, it has received 30.1 million page views and counting.   Unlike the official releases which are only in Bahasa Malaysia, the tracker publishes in six languages, including three used by blue-collar migrant workers communities who have limited literacy in English and Bahasa Malaysia and are unable to access such information otherwise.   When the pandemic started, much of the data was not provided to the public. To fill this gap, Malaysiakini reporters pressed the authorities for the data on a daily basis, forcing them to finally provide such information to the public every day.   One key information which the government continues to withhold are footprints of those infected. In other countries, like Singapore or Thailand, this is routinely shared as part of contact tracing so those who visited those locations at the same time could monitor themselves for symptoms and seek testing.   To date, the tracker is the only place where Malaysians can find such verified information nationwide. To this day, we receive daily alerts from communities about localised outbreaks in their area, which are not announced by the government.   The format in which the data is collected has also helped academic researchers in this field. We have provided the data to several universities upon request.   State government agencies are also using the tracker as a resource. The Selangor state government, for example, uses the data collated on locations affected by Covid-19 daily in their monitoring of local outbreaks and roll out prevention and containment strategies, including free community testing. "," The daily numbers are recorded on a Google spreadsheet. We then exported it into several JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files.   We use JavaScript to write several scripts to parse the files to obtain the data we needed to visualise the numbers with different charts and tables on the tracker page.   The charts and tables were created with Highcharts JS API and react-table respectively.   The structure and layout of the game were built with JavaScript, JavaScript library React and React framework Next.js.   We also used a user interface framework Material-UI and CSS framework UIKit for the game’s user interface.   The graphic was done with Adobe Photoshop.    "," Collating the data and navigating the various releases to make sense of it, has been and continues to be the hardest part. Some of the information was not provided initially and had to be requested on a daily basis.   The data releases were also inconsistent, with some data released for a few weeks and then never again, or the information patchy.   Because state health departments can decide how, when and what data to release, the information is to this day, inconsistent across the states. One term would be used to refer to different things according to the state or some information is released by these states and not the other.   Unlike in many countries, the data is not provided in any form of API or even a machine-readable format, but through Facebook albums of <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kementeriankesihatanmalaysia/posts/10157672322256237?__tn__=%2CO*F"">photos of charts .   This has forced us to spend up to four hours daily to input the information manually. (Various attempts at automating the data were unsuccessful - it took longer prepping the .jpg charts for conversion that it did to manually input the data)   Collating and verifying the information on locations affected too is very challenging and continues to be a labour intensive endeavour.   As we are the only organisation to do this, there is high expectation from the audience for the information to be clean, up to date and timely.   Managing these expectations on a daily basis is one of the greatest challenges, especially as the very small team working on the tracker became smaller as part of the team had to move on to other projects, leaving only one person to work on the tracker full time.   This has been especially challenging this year, when we decided to retire <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20201011000305if_/https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/covid-19/en/state/selangor"">part of the tracker,  due to a lack of resources. "," While information may be publicly accessible it doesn’t mean it is in fact accessible to many. It may be convoluted, in a language they don’t understand, in platforms they can’t access or just simply difficult to keep track of. Data journalists can play a role to sort, clean and present that information in a way that is easier to consume.   On a project management side of things, a key learning for us is how to manage monsters which we create. By this, we mean when rolling out a project like a tracker dashboard - especially one which somehow becomes an essential resource for many - it is important to plan and try to anticipate the trajectory of the project.   This will help in planning resources to allocate and how to manage expectations by readers on the project.

Malaysia,Malaysiakini,Big,Shortlist,Spend Like an MP,25/11/20,"Explainer, Long-form, Quiz/game, Illustration, Elections, Politics","Personalisation, Json, Ink.js"," The “Spend Like an MP” project comprises a special report and a dedicated game.   Built based on interviews in the special report, the game helps readers simulate the role of an MP in Malaysia.   They have to carry out their duties while maintaining their finances and popularity with constituents.   It aims to highlight what MPs do and how they juggle between their constituents, their salary and allocations as well as their personal lives.   The special report discusses the problems with the current lopsided allocation system in Malaysia, what the MPs think about their responsibilities and the way forward.    "," The project was well-received, particularly among younger readers who were previously not interested or aware of this policy problem.   The game was played more than 70 thousand times since launch day and was virally shared on social media platforms.   The project also successfully boosted our subscription revenue between 26 and 41 percent for three consecutive days since its launch day. It shows that the Malaysian public is willing to support good content.    "," We used Ink, a scripting language, to write and test the game script on Inky, the Ink editor. The script was exported as a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file.   We then used JavaScript to write a script to parse the JSON file to obtain the data we needed to present the game on web pages.   The structure and layout of the game were built with JavaScript, JavaScript library React and React framework Next.js.   We also used a user interface framework Material-UI and motion library framer-motion for the game’s user interface and animation.   The graphic was done with Adobe Photoshop.    "," In Malaysia, the public expects a lot from MPs beyond their actual job scope - to debate and enact laws in Parliament.   The government and opposition MPs receive an unequal amount of allocation for their constituencies.   The Malaysian public tends to react with outrage when MPs get a salary hike but many are not aware of various issues, including having to spend out-of-pocket for requests by constituents, especially for the opposition MPs who are discriminated against in terms of allocations.   The gamification of a lawmaker’s role is a novel approach to educating readers in Malaysia.   Presenting the issues through a special report with a tailored-made game from the MPs’ perspective helps us to better convey the message in a unique, innovative and engaging way.   The most challenging part of creating the game was to strike a balance between user experience and the key information we want to present.    We wanted to find the best length that can effectively deliver the message without risking fatigue while at the same time is sufficient to help users appreciate the MP’s financial dilemmas and challenges.   We comprise a small team with one graphic designer, one UX designer, one journalist and one journalist/developer. None of us had experienced in a project like this. The final product went through several iterations. We kept testing until we thought it was ready. It was a painstaking process.   Another challenge is data collection. Our MPs are not required to make their spending public. As such, we interviewed many MPs to get insights on how they spend their money.    The process, which was hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic, took up to two months. We were unable to independently verify all the interview information through official sources but gained a good idea by comparing what the various MPs told us. "," We think that gamification of special reports is one of the ways forward for news organisations to cope with changing audiences.    Instead of presenting a wall of text to the readers, news-based games enable journalists to explain complex policies and systems in an interactive and engaging way.   This can be helped by journalists with programming skills and knowledge. They can implement the logic flow of their script and build the site/pages for the game.   In the absence of programming or developer experience, a newsroom can still initiate collaborations. Talents can be found in game design schools in your local colleges or universities where they encourage students to take part in real-work projects.   Another aspect we would like to share is the “freemium” strategy we implemented to boost subscription.   The game can be played for free and provides the core information but if they would like to learn more, they are given an excerpt of the full article.

Countless satellites from world powers such as the United States, Russia, China and Japan orbit the airspace above the peninsula, owing to the region's strategic importance. Hankook Ilbo analyzed some 40,000 pieces of space surveillance data to map and simulate in 3D satellites that cannot be seen by the naked eye, revealing the importance of satellites for national defense, the state of Korean satellite development and military tensions in the unseen ‘satellite"," Following our reporting, previously undisclosed information about future plans and the current state of satellite development — such as new launch vehicles, surveillance and GPS satellites — has now been released to the public.   The tools we developed for this project won praise from government agencies, such as the Korea Aerospace Research Institute and the Korea Coast Guard, and experts in the field. We also received numerous inquiries about our tools and development.   We hope that the project and the tools and software used to report the project, which analyzes satellite data in real time and presents them in Korean, will raise interest in the field of artificial satellites and find use in the classroom as well as the newsroom.    "," We sourced our satellite monitoring data from Space-track.org, operated by the United States Strategic Command, and SpaceBook, developed by the firm Analytical Graphics. We analyzed the data using Excel, transforming Cartesian coordinates into latitude, longitude and altitude.  We incorporated the following tools and techniques:  •    3D interactive web-based presentation of satellites and their orbits around the Earth using Three.js  •    Bulk data processing and organization through the D3.js library  •    Chart rendering with chart.js  •    Augmented reality using the reader’s smartphone camera, GPS and gyroscope  •    Real-time tracking of satellite locations with Web APIs  •    3D rendering and real-time search of orbiting satellites with WebGL  •    Transitions and animation using CSS3  •    Real-time satellite location visualization using the open-source Stuff in Space code    ", Optimizing data presentation and storytelling for both desktop and mobile environments proved to be our biggest challenge.

France,Contexte,Small,Shortlist,"Oldies but goodies? We looked at 40 years of ""anomalies"" in French nuclear plants",21/02/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Infographics, Map, Politics, Environment","QGIS, Google Sheets, Python"," For the first time, journalists were granted access to detailed information about 30.000+ so-called “significant security events” that took place in French nuclear power plants since 1977. We explored this huge and very technical dataset to answer a highly sensitive question: are older reactors really more dangerous?   Working closely with independent experts from the Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute, we established that even if the number of incidents is not rising as a plant gets older on average, a growing share of the reported anomalies are caused by / related to the aging of the facilities. "," The results of this months-long investigation fueled a long debate about the future of existing power plants. France relies heavily on civic nuclear power to produce the electricity it needs (70%, a world record), and 20+ of the 58 nuclear reactors built in the country are nearing the age of 40. Decisions are to be made about a possible life extension, that would require costly and time-consuming renovation processes.   “Pro-nukes” and “anti-nukes” spend a lot of energy promoting their views, and the climate crisis has raised the stakes even more: despite all his flaws, nuclear energy is a low-carbon mean to generate electricity, Therefore, some experts consider that keeping the current power plants up and running offers a favorable risk-reward ratio. Others warn that the probability of an accident is getting higher by the day, and that a nuclear-free production mix is a possible goal to reach by 2050, even in France, if the country shifts its focus towards renewable energy.     Yet until the release of our story, the actual publicly available data about what really happen in French power plants was scarce. Occasionally, journalists ran stories about a particular incident, based on press releases from official agencies or environmental NGOs. But they could not put it in a broader context and therefore attempt to draw a conclusion.   Even if Contexte is a B2B independent news outlet relying on subscription, we decided to remove the paywall for such a public-interest story. Our work was praised by the most skilled experts in the field, and heavily commented on social media by stakeholders from all sides. It's by far the most read content of our website in 2020. "," We used Python and specifically the Pandas module to parse, clean and explore the 30 MB of Excel files that were provided by the Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety Institute (RNSI). We produced 60+ summary tables to be imported and studied in Google Sheets. We came up with 25+ charts created with Datawrapper and embedded the most relevant of them in the main story.   We also released an <a href=""https://www.contexte.com/article/energie/entretien-aux-sources-de-notre-enquete-sur-40-ans-danomalies-de-surete-nucleaire_111654.html"">additional interview  with two experts from the RNSI, to give more information about the database itself and how they used it today. Called “Sapide”, it was created in the 1970s by the RNSI. Its first iteration was a collection of paper sheets stored in wooden drawers.   Sapide was digitized and beefed up throughout the years, but the core structure remained the same: each “significant security event”, even minor, must be declared by the plant workers and registered in it, triggering rapide response as well as long term investigations from the regulator. "," While exploring the dataset, we soon came to realize that its content was as difficult to comprehend as a nuclear reactor itself. Even the basic description of the event (a plain text field) does not make sense to the profane reader – at first glance, they all look like the beginning of the Chernobyl TV series, but that's about it.   We therefore had to familiarize with the taxonomy used for each field by going through hundreds of documentation pages. They go from the pieces of equipment impacted by the event to its causes and consequences on the power plant.   Understanding and scoring the severity of a particular event was even more challenging. We has to evaluate the numerous indicators available, understand how they are computed and what they tell us about the safety status of the reactor.   Lastly, to answer our initial question, we had to figure out if the age of the reactor had something to do with the recorded incident – even a brand new reactor can run into a problem, in fact, younger installations experience more issues than mature ones. We decided to base our conclusions on two criteria: was aging listed as one of the causes of the incident in the related field? Is aging mentioned in the description of the incident in some way?     "," Here are some takeaways:     you can work on a dataset even if you don't understand every tiny bit of it.   you probably need help from specialists to understand the bits that matter to you (and they will happyly do so).   there is no subject so complex that you can not make sense of it for you and your reader. It will just take more time and more energy.   Excel is not the best tool to work on Excel files if they are too big.   a journalistic work can be deemed worthy of interest by the most skilled experts – not because it's better, just because we offer a different perspective on things.    ",https://www.contexte.com/article/energie/vieux-et-donc-dangereux-on-a-explore-40-ans-devenements-dans-les-reacteurs-nucleaires-francais_109480.html,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://www.contexte.com/article/energie/vieux-et-donc-dangereux-on-a-explore-40-ans-devenements-dans-les-reacteurs-nucleaires-francais_109480.html,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&u=https://www.contexte.com/article/energie/entretien-aux-sources-de-notre-enquete-sur-40-ans-danomalies-de-surete-nucleaire_111654.html,https://twitter.com/ContexteEnergie/status/1230747636010864642,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&u=https://www.franceinter.fr/societe/surete-nucleaire-40-ans-de-donnees-dissequees,https://twitter.com/suretenucleaire/status/1230856421367013376,,,"Yann Guégan,Victor Roux-Goeken","   Yann Guégan  is a journalist in charge of editorial innovation inside Contexte’s newsroom in Paris.

United Kingdom,"The Guardian, Forensic Architecture",Big,Shortlist,The Guardian / Mark Duggan police shooting: can forensic tech cast doubt on official report,10/06/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Fact-checking, Infographics, Video, Crime, Gun violence","Animation, 3D modelling, Canvas, Json, Google Sheets, Node.js"," The 2011 police shooting of Mark Duggan triggered the biggest riots in modern English history. The official findings on the circumstances of his death were challenged by Forensic Architecture, a human rights research organisation in 2020. It reviewed hundreds of publicly available documents, including witness statements, diagrams, photographs, videos and expert reports, as well as recreating what went on using 3D technology.    The Guardian visuals team worked in collaboration with Forensic Architecture to report on their investigation, using innovative storytelling techniques to visually communicate and report on the spatial inconsistencies of the official findings. "," Forensic Architecture claimed they had found inconsistencies in both the inquest verdict and the IPCC ruling on Duggan’s death, and this project was able to articulate these in an engaging and original way to a mass audience. In the wake of the publication of the findings the Duggan family called for a reopening of the investigation. The police watchdog responded by saying it would review the findings in line with its reopening policy and new statutory power to reopen investigations if there are compelling reasons to do so.   The case of Mark Duggan is one that has been widely cited by supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK and was prominently mentioned during protests that took place in the summer of 2020. Bringing the independent investigation to a wide audience at this time, in an immersive 3D format, helped generate renewed public interest in the case.   The interactive received over 100,000 page views in the first 24 hours and had a median attention time of 1m36s. "," We digested the investigation and pulled out the key findings that told the story in a way that could be communicated to a wide audience, and worked on a visual narrative that worked alongside reporting on the findings.   We used Figma to create mockups and prototypes until we settled on a style that referenced forensic investigations. The design and interactive elements of the project were built in parallel. We used Mustache for templating our HTML and Google Docs to generate our JSON (so that editors could work in parallel). We used Javascript and HTML canvas to build the scrollable 3D animations and CSS animation for the header and static image transitions. We also used Adobe Illustrator and After Effects to modify the assets provided by Forensic Architecture to reflect the Guardian’s style guidelines and to make sure they integrate seamlessly with the reading experience. "," The enormity of the project — both in terms of its significance and the amount of information we were given. The findings by Forensic Architecture had a huge range of complexity, multiple animations and were made up of hundreds of pieces of evidence (including photographs, videos, diagrams, expert reports and witness statements) that we needed to present in an accessible, innovative — and most importantly, accurate — way. Working in collaboration with them enabled their unique investigative and reconstructive abilities, which are dedicated to highlighting human rights abuses across the globe, to be brought to a wide audience and hold to account governing bodies in a way that would be impossible to do with textual reporting alone.     "," This project was all about collaboration. Our visuals team worked with the experts at Forensic Architecture, our in-house video editing team and the news team. We believe this demonstrates that collaboration with outside specialists and across a range of disciplines can be enormously beneficial for a newsroom, and can result in outstanding and powerful journalism. In addition, it shows that interactive journalism can be a highly effective tool for holding public bodies to account and giving a voice to local communities.

Indonesia,"Earth Journalism Network, Oxpeckers.org, Haluan.co",Small,Shortlist,New Indonesian law on wildlife crime,11/09/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Map, Environment, Crime","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV","This project was looking into dozen of court verdicts to see how the wildlife criminal suspects punished for their crime. Due to the outdated the conservation Act 1990, I found that the verdict was too lenient and failed to give a deterrent effect. However, the was a case that given a high verdict of up to four years in jail and fined Rp1 billion (US$68,000). The verdict, which became the highest punishment of wildlife crime ever in Indonesia, was given by the Pekanbaru Court given to four members of the tiger cubs syndicate operating between Malaysia and Indonesia. The main"," The impact of the project had various impacts on the stakeholders. The use of the Quarantine Act 2019 by the Pekanbaru Court inspired other prosecutors to sue wildlife criminals with the same act. In July 2020 for example, Tanjung Karang Court sentenced two smugglers of a hundred exotic birds with the Quarantine Act. Along the year, the use of the new act became more common in the fight against wildlife crime.   Moreover, this project also added more pressure to the government and the House of Representatives to consider The Conservation Act 1990 revision. Although had been included in the 2015-2019 National Legislation Programme, the subtitle bill continuously hampered and finally withdrew in May 2019. Some experts said that reform of The Conservation Act 1990 urgently needed to provide a deterrent effect to the wildlife crime in the country. The lenient verdicts, due to the outdated law, which uncovered by this project became a reminder to the stakeholders to prioritize the reform of the Act.    Moreover,  "," The main data resources of this project are the court verdicts which can be accessed by the public. To collect the data, I have to scrape the website of the Supreme Court and transfer them into a spreadsheet. I made a long-list of the verdicts court by and categorized them into proper and clean data.    After making the details of each case, I look into the sentence section and begin to analyze the data. This technique helped me to find out the case of the Irawan Shia syndicate which was given the highest sentence by the panel of the judges. Finally I am able to find the main reason why the four members of syndicate were fined 10 times higher than the other similar cases. In addition, I also transfer the spreadsheet data into a visual graphic with Flourish Studio.    To enrich the story, I also utilize the StoryJS Map to provide a better understanding of Irawan Shia’s syndicate. The scrolling-telling map traced the journey of the syndicate from its origin in Malaysia across to Rupat Island before finally being arrested by the Police in Pekanbaru.      "," The main obstacle of the project was due to the access of the data. Although the data was available at the Supreme Court website, the data was uncategorized and not very user-friendly.  To do this I have to put a keyword and select the case related to the wildlife crime. I found this very exhausting since I have to eliminate thousands of other cases which are not related but kept appearing when I type the keyword.   When I finally found the wildlife case, I had to download the record of the trial in PDF format. The next step was to deduce an important information based on the PDF which contains a dozen pages and put it into a spreadsheet. Finally, I have to repeat the process of collecting data with the other dozens of cases. Actually, there are hundreds of wildlife cases that can be found at the Supreme Court website. However, due to the deadline and limited human resources, I was only able to collect 50 of them.      "," As long as I know, I was the first journalist in the country who scraped into the Supreme Court website, collecting dozens of trial records, and produced stories based on the data. Some journalists might download a single specific case document from the website. However, to do it on this scale of the project and make my own database in the spreadsheet was not very common in the practice of journalistic work in the country.    Actually, this technique has been done by some non-profit organizations in their research. However, the NGO usually only publishes the result of the research which sometimes is not compatible with the journalistic needs.    By doing this on my own, I have raw data that helped me to build the specific angle of my stories. The journalist can apply this technique for different kinds of issues. One of my colleagues, for example, doing a similar approach to uncover the corruption case verdict. I believe, by gathering and building our own database, the journalists will have a better understanding of every issue.     ",https://earthjournalism.net/stories/new-indonesian-law-used-to-crack-down-on-wildlife-smuggling,https://oxpeckers.org/2020/09/new-indonesian-law/,https://haluan.co/article/harapan-baru-pemberantasan-kejahatan-satwa,https://app.flourish.studio/visualisation/3566283/,,,,,"Rezza Aji Pratama (writer and researcher), Wan Ulfa Nur Zuhra (data visualization), Fiona Macleod"," Rezza Aji Pratama has worked as a journalist for eight years, with a focus on business reporting, science, public health, and environmental issues.

United States,VirginiaMercury.com,Small,Shortlist,‘The bedrock of wealth inequality': Data shows big racial disparities in mortgage loans and homeownership,21/07/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Business, Economy","Scraping, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," This project showed that African Americans in Virginia are far more likely than Whites to be denied a loan to purchase a home. As a result, Black homeownership rates are far below White homeownership rates. Those disparities help explain the wealth gap between Blacks and Whites because owning a home is key to building wealth. The project used extensive data analysis and expert interviews to document the disparities while also putting a human face to the issue. "," The project triggered a community discussion in Richmond and other areas of Virginia about how to address disparities in home loans and homeownership. The National Association of Real Estate Brokers, Virginia Bankers Association, Richmond Metropolitan Habitat for Humanity and other organizations circulated the story among their members. Virginia REALTORS, an association of 35,000 real estate agents across the state, created a Presidential Advisory Group dedicated to expanding opportunities for diversity and inclusion. In its materials, the group <a href=""https://virginiarealtors.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2020/11/Briefing-Book-draft-November-2-2020.pdf"" target=""_blank"">highlighted the project  as a driving force. The article also was a focus of the <a href=""https://housingforwardva.org/event/2020-virginia-governors-housing-conference/"" target=""_blank"">2020 Virginia Governor’s Housing Conference,  which included a session titled, ""Making it Right: How Housers Can Address Racial Inequalities and Close the Homeownership Gap."" "," I downloaded data collected by the U.S. government under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The <a href=""https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/data-browser/data/2019?category=states&items=VA"" target=""_blank"">HMDA data for Virginia for 2019  contained 505,456 records -- one for each loan application handled by each financial institution that year. Using Microsoft Access, I joined the data file with other tables to translate codes and include the names of lending institutions.   I then filtered the data for home-purchase loans that had been approved or denied, giving me a final data set of 127,860 records. I ran a succession of group-by and crosstab queries in Access to calculate how often applicants from each racial or ethnic group were denied home loans, and why. I calculated the statistics statewide, for each metro area and by locality (city and county). I also computed the denial rates by ethnicity-race for applicants with similar incomes ($40,000-$49,999, $50,000-$59,999, $60,000-$69,999 and so forth).   For comparison, I conducted similar analyses of HMDA data for Virginia as far back as 2007 (<a href=""https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/historic-data/"" target=""_blank"">available from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ).   I performed most of the analysis with Microsoft Access and refined the results with Microsoft Excel.   I also downloaded homeownership data from the <a href=""https://data.census.gov/"" target=""_blank"">Census Bureau's data portal,  using the <a href=""https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=renters&g=0400000US42&tid=ACSST1Y2018.S2502&hidePreview=false"" target=""_blank"">American Community Survey  estimates. Using Excel, I computed homeownership rates overall and by ethnicity and race for the nation, for Virginia, for each Virginia metro area and for each city and county in the state. I worked initially with the most recent data (2018) and then compared the results with previous years.   I created the online graphics with Datawrapper, the data visualization tool preferred by Virginia Mercury. For the tooltips for the maps, this required extensively manipulating the HTML coding.   Finally, for transparency and trust, I publicly shared <a href=""https://bit.ly/hmda19_va"" target=""_blank"">all of the data  on the project's Google Drive. "," The hardest part of the project was finding people to humanize the data -- to put a human face to statistics. This was complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which shut down in-person services at organizations that help prospective homeowners and thus undercut what would have been my strategy for finding people to interview. However, working through social media and with experts I had contacted online and by telephone, I managed to connect with people who represented the story's key data points (i.e., African Americans who had been denied home loans).   The data analysis was critical to forging those personal connections. The national and local experts I had contacted trusted me -- and helped me find ""real people"" sources -- because they knew I had done my homework. I had crunched more than 10 years of HMDA data, sifting through as many as a half-million records for each year. Moreover, I followed a time-tested methodology used by other journalists -- most notably Bill Dedman, who won a <a href=""https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/bill-dedman"" target=""_blank"">Pulitzer in 1989  for his analysis of such data. The data analysis enabled me to approach experts with information they were eager to know.   A crucial component of this project was to look at the big picture -- not just at racial discrimination in home loans but also at American history, from slavery to redlining. I didn't shy away from discussing racist mortgage brokers, but I explained that institutional racism and other factors also contribute to the higher loan denial rates for Black applicants. Moreover, I connected homeownership patterns to the wealth gap and described the vicious circle underpinned by data: Because they are less likely to own a home, African Americans have less wealth; and because they have less wealth, African Americans are less likely to own a home.     "," My project's biggest lesson for other journalists is the value of open data -- especially massive sets of microdata (like HMDA) that are updated regularly by government agencies. I focused on Virginia, of course, because I was writing for a Virginia-focused news outlet. But this story could be replicated in any state.   It was crucial to jump on the issue quickly. The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council <a href=""https://ffiec.cfpb.gov/"">released the 2019 HMDA data  on June 24, 2020; I published my article in less than a month.   The project involved a lot of numbers, and that can intimidate readers. But I was judicious about which numbers to weave into the text of the story, I offloaded most statistics to data visualizations and tables, and I used narratives, quotes and telling details (""She lives in the three-bedroom, two-bath home — ‘white with red shutters’ — with her special-needs son"") to keep readers engaged.   A final lesson for journalists would be to examine solutions as well as the problems highlighted in the story. I devoted a section of my article to strategies to boost Black homeownership. After the project was published, those strategies helped foster discussion among government officials, business leaders and fair-housing advocates.

Canada,The Globe and Mail,Big,Shortlist,Bias Behind Bars,24/10/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Women, Crime, Human rights","Animation, AI/Machine learning, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio"," In late October, The Globe and Mail published Bias Behind Bars, an investigation into systemic racism in Canadian federal prisons.   Through a database of more than 50,000 inmates obtained via freedom of information request, we examined the structural biases inherent in the tools used to assess prisoners. Risk assessments are meant to be an impartial guide of who can be rehabilitated, and are steeped in decades of research. But, as The Globe discovered, these tools are fundamentally, powerfully biased against Indigenous and Black inmates, placing them in higher security classifications and assigning them worse odds of successfully re-entering society. "," The response to The Globe’s story was immediate. Within 48 hours, a member of the House of Commons’ public safety committee had pledged to conduct a parliamentary study of systemic racism in federal prison risk assessments. “This needs action,” he told The Globe. A day later, the study was officially announced with all-party support. Then, a day later, in a rare political acknowledgment of the challenges faced by Canada’s usually invisible prison population, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau himself said more had to be done by the federal government to fight systemic racism in prisons.   The investigative series' impact has also extended beyond Parliament. Lawyers have used our findings at parole hearings, professors are using our stories as teaching material, and both senators and Canada’s correctional watchdog have referred to the series in recent statements. In early January, a civil rights lawyer filed a class-action lawsuit against the government on behalf of tens of thousands of inmates, arguing the use of these risk scores amounts to a deliberate discriminatory practice.   The strongest words, however, likely came from Jack Harris, the legislator who first proposed the parliamentary study. “It’s something that the government has to respond to,” he said. “The fact this has been done by somebody outside the system as opposed to the system itself is a condemnation of the effort that should’ve been done sooner and more effectively.”   Testimonials from those personally affected by correctional risk scores have driven home the importance of this form of data-driven investigative reporting. “Thank you for publishing a very important issue in The Globe and Mail newspaper,” a former inmate wrote. “I was held for an additional 10 years in high- and medium-security prisons by this biased manipulative system. … Thank you for telling our country the other side of the story; the truth.” "," The genesis of Bias Behind Bars was a freedom of information request, filed to the federal government, asking for years of data on federal inmates. Data-driven freedom of information requests of this sort are unusual in Canada – but after seven months of negotiation, the government eventually delivered a 750,000-row file documenting the lives of 50,000 people over a seven-year period.   We used a statistical programming language called R, combined with a data journalism analysis framework – <a href=""https://github.com/globeandmail/startr"">startr,  built and open-sourced by The Globe two years ago – to unpack and analyze the file.   After weeks of analysis, it became clear that simple descriptive statistics such as tallies, percentages and rates of change wouldn't be enough to isolate the impact of race on someone's risk assessments. Variables like age, gender, the severity of an inmate's offence and their criminal history were all interconnected; combined, they led to an inmate's score.   Instead, The Globe turned to statistical modelling. Over several months, and with the assistance of statisticians, criminologists and data scientists, we built a series of multivariate logistic regressions that controlled for all those variables and explained the impact of race on both men and women's most important risk scores.   Finally, the insights gleaned from these models and the overall trends identified in the data were fed back into the reporting process, inflluencing the kinds of documents we sourced, the people we interviewed and the direction of the ultimate reported story. Those findings were also shared with The Globe's design and graphics teams, who distilled the information into visual explanatory content, like the animated dots which guided readers through how inmates' risk scores broke down by race. "," For decades, federal watchdogs and prisoner advocacy groups have suspected race plays a role in determining an inmate’s risk scores. But, in report after report, analyses of risk levels only scratched the surface, looking simply at, for instance, the rate at which Indigenous inmates were classified to maximum security, or how frequently women were deemed to have a low potential for reintegration.   The Globe’s statistical investigation cut through this noise by doing something that had never been done: accounting for the myriad factors – age, offence severity, criminal history and so on – that play into a final score, effectively isolating the impact of race. The process of developing and fine-tuning a methodology for that analysis was by far the most complex part of the investigation.   It was also an analysis that likely wouldn’t have occurred without The Globe. During early conversations ahead of filing a freedom of information request for inmate data, several sources warned us the information we sought would never be released by Correctional Service Canada, the country’s federal prison agency. In fact, the agency itself had never undertaken an analysis of race and risk scores on the scale of what The Globe intended.   When the analysis revealed the biases in these critical prison tools, a second question emerged: How could the prison agency have missed the massive impact of race on inmates' scores?   The answer, we suspected, was that they hadn’t.   In January, 2021, after months of reporting, we confirmed what had been an open secret within the agency for decades: An internal federal government document from 2004, obtained by The Globe, showed unequivocally that senior Correctional Service leadership had been warned of serious flaws in its security risk tool for 16 years – and yet the scale remains in use, unchanged, to this day. "," Above all else, Bias Behind Bars reveals what’s possible when filing ambitious, data-driven freedom of information requests. Moonshots like these don’t always pan out, but when they do, they often lead to incredible stories. We’ve since begun filing more of these – even if they could take years to bear fruit.   As so often happens during large investigations, we pivoted several times early in the reporting process. Our original intent was to look at the diversity of Canadian juries – but that data didn’t exist. Instead, we began looking at sentencing patterns, but our freedom of information requests didn’t net enough data for that, either. Instead, they pointed to our ultimate topic: risk scores.   Experimentation was also essential to the project. This was the first time The Globe had built a statistical model for a story, and while I was already comfortable analyzing data, I’d never modelled a dataset. The process was intense and required a countless conversations with statisticians and academics, but resulted in a skill I’ll rely on in for future stories.   Finally, Bias Behind Bars shows the importance of using compelling characters and narrative journalism to pull readers through a story that would have otherwise been too dry, data- and policy-heavy.   While data-driven findings suffused all our reporting, those were carefully balanced against the story of Nick Nootchtai, an Indigenous man who spent his entire 12-year manslaughter sentence behind bars, the majority of it in maximum security. Instead of simply running readers through our findings and telling them how Mr. Nootchtai’s scores affected his prison life, we showed it, detailing the few prison jobs open to him, how his wife could never join him for conjugal visits and the fact that his high security score even denied him access to pencil crayons for arts and crafts.

United States,High Country News in collaboration with grants from The Pulitzer Center for Crisis Reporting and The Fund for Investigative Journalism,Small,Winner,Land-Grab Universities: How expropriated Indigenous land became the foundation of the land-grant university system,30/03/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Culture, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap"," Nearly 11 million acres of Indigenous land, over 160 violence-backed treaties and land seizures, approximately 250 tribes, bands and communities, and fifty-two universities: Our investigation reveals how expropriated Indigenous land financed the land-grant university system, and how many institutions continue to profit. "," Within months of publication several major initiatives took shape in response to our reporting. At Cornell, the largest Morrill Act beneficiary, faculty launched a project to document the university’s financial windfall. Similar internal reviews are ramping up at MIT and the University of Connecticut, which is developing an exhibition based on the data as part of a push for a new Cultural Center for Native & Indigenous Students. At Ohio State researchers have partnered with the First Nations Development Institute to draft a <a href=""https://u.osu.edu/landgranttruth/"">reconciliation plan  that will benefit the tribal communities whose land seeded the school’s founding. Washington State University has taken the lead in actually rewriting its land acknowledgment to incorporate the report’s findings, and pledged to commission a team to determine reconciliation plans. Working groups at Colorado State, Arizona State, the University of Minnesota, and others are likewise laying the groundwork for reforms tying their land-grant legacies to the needs of their Indigenous students.   This year, thousands of undergraduate and graduate students at scores of universities are reading the report in journalism, education, and liberal arts courses. The University of Missouri even made it required reading university-wide through its freshman composition program. At the University of Florida, Yale University, and Cornell University, student governments and advocacy groups demanded investigations, protested for racial justice, and petitioned for increased recruitment and funding for students from tribal nations disadvantaged by the Morrill Act. The response is reminiscent of the reaction to Brown University’s Report on Slavery and Justice (2006), which sparked a reckoning with higher education’s connections to the slave trade. Only it appears to be moving at a more accelerated pace.  ","      This investigation relied on a unique combination of large-scale spatial analysis and historical research. To tell the story, we had to uncover ties between contemporary universities and Indigenous land redistributed by the federal government more than a century ago. To accomplish this, we built a geodatabase of nearly 80,000 land parcels. This database recreates the complete footprint of a major US land law for the first time.   To populate our geodatabase, we constructed parcels in ArcGIS using data digitally extracted and hand-transcribed from fifty different sources. We linked these parcels to Indigenous land cessions from nine publicly available spatial datasets and maps, several of which required original georeferencing. We incorporated data on past payments for Indigenous land, acreage distributed, and principal raised for universities from 28 other sources, primarily court cases for broken treaties and government reports. Our sources ranged from crumbling archival manuscripts from the 1860s to state disclosures posted online in the past few years. To visualize and analyze this data, we processed it with a dozen different software programs. The database enabled our photographer to visit parcels and our cartographer to produce maps and graphics. It generated statistics that punctuate the story. And it revealed long hidden connections between prosperous universities and dispossessed tribal nations that structured our narrative. Because we developed the methodology for this story from scratch, we also published an essay detailing our process and sources. These materials both document our findings and illustrate an approach future investigators can adapt to examine other sites of state and institutional wealth building through the expropriation of Indigenous resources.

There was no guide to tell us exactly how much material we were looking for. We had to construct that from research, too.

Brazil,Nexo Jornal,Small,Citation,"A tragedy, calculated",08/08/20,"Illustration, Politics, Health","Google Sheets, CSV, R","  The publication opens a series of five special articles that address the impacts of covid-19 in Brazil, at the moment when the pandemic reached the mark of 100 thousand deaths. The publication aimed to show the size of the loss of life that occurred in the country.","  The coronavirus pandemic is the biggest health crisis the world has faced in recent years and its effects in Brazil are still priceless. Five months after the first registration of a covid-19 case in Brazil, the country reached the mark of 100 thousand deaths. At the time of publication, it was the second country in number of deaths from the disease and was among those with the highest relative number, weighted by the population. This material aimed to give a closer view to the numbers represented in the statistics of the Ministry of Health.","      There were some team meetings until we got to know how to tell such a sensitive story, within a set of materials that the entire Nexo newsroom would participate in, until we reached a consensus to combine data on deaths from covid-19 in the country with images with a more direct relationship to the lives lost.    To approximate the numbers of people, we use means of transport with emphasis on the image of a train crowded with dead people every two days from June to August. Both the visual refinement of the graphic and the illustrations were drawn in Adobe Illustrator, thinking mainly on how this set would work on mobile devices, and only then produce the same version of it on the desktop."," The hardest part was to represent with empathy the tragedy. For this reason, we put two visual languages ​​together in this narrative. The visualization of data, where each point symbolizes a life lost in five months of pandemic and the image of the train and other means of getting around that are powerful figures when it comes to imagining how many people we have lost these days.

For a period of three months, our cross-border team investigated everything related to the biomass trade, from subsidies, to certifications, to the European lobby, after learning from a colleague in Tallinn that Estonia was exporting almost all of its pellets overseas, with increasing impact on the country’s forests. The result: a cross-border story about the effect of European subsidies on Estonia's forest, plus a series of radio, print and online publications in partner media. "," Our team reporters worked together for three months to create a 10,000 word interactive feature on the biomass trade, including interactive timelines and graphics on how pellets are made, a certifications ""game"" and using 360 degree imagery and Google Street View to take the reader to the site of environmental devastation. An extended team of 16 reporters across 11 newsrooms worked on a suite of stories in national press, including the Guardian in the UK, Zeit Online in Germany, Publico in Spain, and De Groene Amsterdammer and Investico in the Netherlands and across national press and television in Estonia.    Our investigation has been cited in the Estonian and Dutch parliament. Since it was published, the new Estonian Government has promised to review cutting rates in state-owned forests. Our Dutch radio broadcasts were picked up across national Dutch media. Our interactive investigation was cited by scientists and campaigners at a European Commission meeting to discuss a revision to the Renewable Energy Directive. The Guardian version was cited by Greta Thunberg as an ""essential read"" on Twitter and cited by the US magazine the New Yorker, which covered the subject a week later. "," To investigate the subsidised European pellet trade and its impact on Baltic forests, we uploaded boundary files for Estonia’s Natura 2000 zones to Global Forest Watch, an online platform for monitoring forests, and found that per-hectare tree cover loss (the removal of the tree canopy rather than outright deforestation) in these areas accelerated after 2015, when Estonian changed the rules around clear-cutting in some of its nature parks. We uploaded the KLM file to Google Earth Engine to identify areas where we could test for changes in forest cover. We used Google Timelaps to test for changes, then singled out Hanja Nature Park using open source GQIS, which allowed us to test one area for tree cover and some related statistics. In order to verify the Global Forest Watch data, which has its critics, we built an overlay in Goggle Earth Engine and checked the patches using Google Earth Pro's time-slider. We used photoshop to create different overlay images for our story, including GIFs and a slider, to allow the reader to explore differences in tree cover over time for themselves. For the 10,000 word feature, we travelled to Estonia and worked with local designers to custom-build graphics, including a certifications ""game"" and drop down features and timelines to add depth and context to our story. We worked with a local photographer to capture drone imagery of the forests and nearby pellet milles. We used Google Street View technology and 360 degree imagery to take the reader to the site of the environmental devastation so they could explore the differences in forest cover over time. Our investigation relied heavily on open-source, encrypted, collaborative tools including Next Cloud for file sharing, a DocuWiki to organise the mammoth amount of research we accrued over three months, Rocket Chat as a Slack alternative "," Conducting a cross-border investigation in a pandemic comes with no small amount of challenges. We had always planned to report the findings of our sateliite work on the ground, but as the summer waned and another round of lockdowns took hold across Europe, we had to make the call about whether or not it was safe to travel to Estonia. Four made it from Germany, the Netherlands and the UK but travel restrictions and the depleted number of flights made it impossible for others to travel.   At this moment, our well-established collaborative tools came into their own. Using RocketChat, Signal and video calls, we were in daily contact with the team working remotely. During trips to clear-cut areas, reporters sent us their location co-ordinates and we were able to corroborate their photos, videos and other reporting with satellite images in real time.   Because we only had a few days on the ground in Estonia, we adapted the Google Sprint model of iterating startups to our story. In this way we went from concept to product – an interactive feature of 10,000 words – within a week, iterating the story as we gathered evidence on the ground.      ","Cross-border investigative work is still a relatively new field. We are indebted to Investigative Journalism for Europe for funding and Arena for Journalism in Europe for supporting our project with technical and professional expertise. We feel there is enormous value in sharing what we learned during our investigation, from the technology and the systems that allowed us t share data and communicate safely, to the OSINT tools that enabled us to identify areas of interest to the investigation and explore changes in tree cover over time. Journalists might learn from the way we organised our investigation: both over time and practically how we kept track of our reporting. We set out to map the trade in biomass across European borders for the first time, in order to shed light on the major actors in the industry and their practises in three phases: a month on the trade in our own countries, a month on the trade across borders and a final month bringing all the pieces together to create our stories. We met once a week and spoke almost constantly on messaging channels in between. We established a DocuWiki, a kind of investigative wikipedia, which allowed us to navigate through our extensive reporting and find files and references. This was invaluable in helping us to identify who we had spoken to and what we already knew in the reporting phase, and as a reference point when we came to write up our work. Journalists might also learn from the way we used the Google Design Sprint to iterate our story over the course of a week on the ground in Estonia. The methodology meant that we were able to respond and adapt our plans based on what we found locally and in collaboration with local developers, videographers, designers and photographers",https://www.vpro.nl/argos/lees/onderwerpen/money-to-burn/en.html,https://www.vpro.nl/argos/lees/onderwerpen/money-to-burn/interactive.html,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/14/carbon-neutrality-is-a-fairy-tale-how-the-race-for-renewables-is-burning-europes-forests,https://www.publico.es/sociedad/residuos-forestales-fuente-energia-renovable.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=publico,https://vimeo.com/486021454,https://www.platform-investico.nl/artikel/hout-uit-kaalkap-beschermde-bossen-voor-biomassa-europese-centrales/,https://www.err.ee/1193797/pealtnagija-puidumassi-maaramine-taastuvaks-kutuseks-soodustab-lageraiet,,"Piret Reiljan, Sophie Blok, Ties Gijzel, Hazel Sheffield, Catherine Joie, Silvia Nortes, Paul Toetzke", Piret Reiljan is a freelance journalist in Estonia.

We required states to make data available publicly if they wanted it included in our datasets. We wanted states to report tests in units capturing repeat testing; initially, only 19 states did so, and now all but three jurisdictions report repeat testing. When we began tracking race and ethnicity data, fewer than half of the jurisdictions reported those numbers. Now, nearly every single one does. Our work led to more than two dozen changes to data points on state websites, from correcting errors to clarifying definitions to releasing new data points. And we were instrumental in securing the release—<a href=""https://covidtracking.com/data/hospital-facilities"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> and demonstrating the utility  —of new data from the federal government. "," The COVID Tracking Project used a unique approach to gather data, relying on a network of hundreds of trained volunteers. The radically transparent project made all of its data and analyses publicly available so that anyone could use it, including an <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/data/api"">API,  <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/data/download"">downloadable data,  dashboards, and highly detailed <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/analysis-updates"">explanations  of the data. We also developed an entire suite of charts that we made available for public use that have been used and replicated by broadcast, digital, and traditional print outlets.        Since its inception, the CTP has built out new and unprecedented processes in order to collect the most complete and accurate data possible. Many other groups tried to ""scrape"" COVID-19 data automatically, but that method proved unreliable. We deployed human labor in the form of hundreds of trained volunteers to fact-check every single one of the data points, and we built automated systems that run in the background of the data collection process to help those people. We also created a data quality team that engaged in deep research to provide the metadata that was necessary to understand how states were reporting. We relied on a complex workflow combining Slack, Google Sheets, Airtable, and our own databases.       Because the data was so complex, we built out a reporting operation that made hundreds of contacts with state and federal officials to understand their numbers. We were instrumental in shaking more and better data out of states. Working with local reporters, we were also able to apply pressure to states to release more <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/race/dashboard"">race and ethnicity data,  improve the quality of their reporting, and provide details on <a href=""https://covidtracking.com/data/long-term-care"">long-term-care facilities,  where a significant portion of COVID-19 deaths have occurred.  "," The data that the CTP deals with is extremely messy and heterogeneous. It is produced by 56 jurisdictions, each of which has its own data pipelines and reporting quirks. Our team must stitch together this data to create valuable statistics. This requires in-depth knowledge not only of the data that a state provides, but its dashboards, data definitions, and caveats.        State data is imperfect and sometimes erroneous, so our teams throw themselves at the walls of government opacity day after day, trying to shine a light on each of the metrics we track. States themselves don’t always understand what’s happening and we’re often the very first to point out problems. Officials have told us that the federal government used our data to help the Coronavirus Task Force understand its own data.        As a brand-new endeavor, we had to establish relationships with every state, the federal government, public health officials, and others. We built a star-studded advisory board composed of public health experts, epidemiologists, technologists, and experts on racial inequities. We raised $1.5 million from top foundations (Rockefeller, Robert Woods Johnson, Chan Zuckerberg, Emerson Collective) to support the managers of our volunteers and build out our technical infrastructure. We did it with infrastructural support from  The Atlantic,  but raised the funds ourselves.        The biggest obstacle is the sheer amount of work required to do what the CTP does. This is thousands of hours of work a week that require precision, knowledge, and dedication. We had to build a culture that would bring people in and keep them coming back, despite the ghastly nature of our work. Our data entry team leads have made the CTP a welcoming place that supports those who do the work. "," CTP is a testament to the power of collaborative journalism. We were able to spin up the project quickly and do urgent work by building a coalition of not just journalists, but academics, data scientists, epidemiologists, technologists, and public health experts. It took shape in the crucible of the U.S. pandemic, but could be applied to beats that require cross-disciplinary expertise.       We've also shown the ability to work  with  the public to  do  journalism. We recruited and trained hundreds of volunteers from all over the country and all walks of life—some of whom had no previous experience with data. We used simple, distributed tools to do this: a Google form, Zoom training sessions, Slack, and Google Sheets. We proved that it's possible to build an all-remote journalism endeavor from scratch in the midst of a pandemic, creating a culture that kept volunteers engaged.       We've built a series of workflows to find, calculate, check, and double-check the data. We plan to share these processes publicly, so that newsrooms that work with messy datasets can learn from our experience.       We also showed just how important it is to analyze how governments are collecting and defining data. Our data quality team and journalists not only worked to come up with definitions and analyses to help the public understand what data is available, but they also held officials accountable for the data they published.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Shortlist,How LA NACION built a unique platform to monitor the Covid-19 pandemic in real time,25/01/20,"Explainer, Database, Open data, News application, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Map","Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R, PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js",   The news application website  is fed with daily information that LA NACION team manually collects from the reports published by the Ministry of Health and from automatic processes of data that the National Government publishes as well on the national open data portal. The dedicated website presents one-a-kind analysis made with health specialists.         ,"    The development of the platform gave citizens and Health specialists a tool to monitor decisions that were made by the Government following the figures of our country. Since LA NACION´s newsroom actively reuse the data that was feeding the special website, inconsistencies in numbers were found and also reported by citizens. The articles published to make visible contradictions and problems in data promoted changes in the definition of coronavirus cases and adjustments and led to the release of a daily dataset containing detailed figures of what was happening in every corner of the country. The publication increased the use of data by activists, scientists, academics and specialists in diverse fields in Argentina. In this sense, the development of the platform led to the emergence of a group of watchdogs that are in permanent contact through a Telegram group and, as LA NACION, file for FOI requests to fix inconsistencies or problems in data.  ","   Because data about coronavirus cases in Argentina is reported in PDF documents and also datasets, the development of the platform involved a combination of different software, tools and technologies to support the uploading of information in diverse formats (manual and automatic procedures).Frontend development was made in JavaScript using vue.js as main framework. To obtain data from international sources, open source repositories of the websites dedicated to the data registration were used. After obtained those data, Python was used as backend language for data parsing according to the needs of LA NACION development. For the local site, an ad hoc administrator in Django.js was developed and this was used by the team of journalists to manually upload the data from Argentina, several times a day.      As even data which is uploaded through automated processes contain errors, the team also deploy technical validations over the system to guarantee the quality of the information that LA NACION opens to the public. In this sense, our team used SNS (Simple Notifications Service), S3, CloudWatch, Lambdas, E2, Tableau, Vue.js and Big Query.  ","   The most difficult part of the project is the constant monitoring that it requires due to problems in data reported by the Government in official documents and datasets. This situation involves permanent shifts of more than 8 people at different times to check that the quality of data that we receive is consistent with the historical information of cases and also within each specific dataset or PDF document. In fact, this is one of the reasons we established human and automatic validations at specific stages of processes. We also had to train ourselves to acquire the necessary skills in order to understand and analyse Health data related to the pandemic. This expertise took time but also requires flexibility to translate the complexity that arises from national figures into relevant stories for our readers.  ","   One of the most important lessons learned is that interdisciplinary work and the expertise of journalists, developers, data scientists and activists is key to activate the demand of data in countries such as Argentina, where the Government open public information but not in a way to facilitate its consumption. In this regard, the coronavirus website shows the relevance of the power of collaboration. Alliances between our newsroom, university students and Health specialists are always stronger than a set of bureaucratic barriers that aim to discourage the visibility of the Coronavirus pandemic in Argentina. Furthermore, LA NACION, could not have developed a dashboard with more than 150 interactive visualizations without key specialists working in different disciplines.            ",https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/how-la-nacion-built-unique-platform-to-nid2571851,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/en-detalle-infectados-fallecidos-coronavirus-argentina-nid2350330/#/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/el-mundo/coronavirus-asi-se-propaga-virus-mundo-nid2351138,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/vacunas-covid-19-cuales-llegaran-argentina-que-resultados-nid2526910/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/vacunas-nid2568125/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/coronavirus-monitor-contagios-nid2396526/#/,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/reuniones-nid2571833/#/,,"G.

Brazil,"Revista AzMina, Internet Lab, Volt Data Lab",Big,Shortlist,MonitorA,05/11/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Politics, Women","Google Sheets, CSV, R, Python"," MonitorA is an observatory of political violence against female candidates on social networks, a project by Revista AzMina and InternetLab. Throughout the election campaign, from September to November 2020, we collected hundreds of thousands of comments directed at candidates from all political spectrum on different social networks (Twitter, Instagram and YouTube). With automated linguistic filters and also with human analysis, we analyze these publications to understand the dynamics of violence during the elections and we show that political violence against women in networks is sexist and misogynistic. "," MonitorA's main objective was to prove with data what we already empirically predicted: that women are provoked by sexist political violence in political environments. With a partnership with InternetLab, an independent research center in the areas of law and technology, we were able to analyze how sexist hate speech takes place within social platforms, and by partnering with five local vehicles from five Brazilian states, we also managed cover local contexts of political violence, including offline.   MonitorA's first survey revealed that 123 monitored candidates in 7 states in municipal events received more than 40 curses a day on Twitter alone. In the second survey, in the second round of updates, we showed that other female political figures who supported women's candidacies were also attacked. The insults were mostly focused on the physical, intellectual and moral characteristics of these women, and not for their political performance, as we have shown that it happened with men.   This survey was released by the candidates themselves, who, caused by the violence in the networks, reported this harassment. Manuela D'Ávila, a former candidate for the country's vice presidency in 2018, investigates MonitorA's monitoring data in a television debate. Other candidates, such as Joice Hasseman, from PSL, candidate for the mayor of São Paulo, mentioned the surveys on social networks. A candidate for councilor in São Paulo, Erika Hilton, decided to sue more than 50 people who harassed her on the networks and talked to our team.   Our data was also reported and republished by more than 50 media outlets, including television channels such as CNN Brasil and TV Cultura, CBN radio, as well as appearing in reports by UOL, Estadão, etc. It was the first time that Political Violence became a debate in the press. "," We created Python scripts that captured publications that cited nearly 200 applications from around the country for two months on Twitter, Youtube and Instagram. On Twitter on Youtube the APIs of the respective social networks were used. Data collection for Instagram was performed using web scraping techniques. In all, 2.3 million publications on social networks were captured for analysis. The data was cleaned up and organized to address some inconsistencies, such as name changes on social networks, standardization of columns and types of data and formatting of dates. All messages were categorized as offensive or non-offensive, based on regular expressions identified by a linguist. She created dictionaries of offensive terms that covered all profiles of monitored candidacies: for white and non-white women, cis and trans, LGBTs and straight, from different political spectrum, etc. The dashboard that allowed the analysis and visualization of these data by our content team was developed in R with shiny and golem, packages used for the creation of dynamic applications. The application's filters and functionalities were improved throughout the project. With the filters and features we were able to make queries and create databases in CSV for smaller and more specific analyzes, using mostly Google Sheets. "," The hardest part was dealing with this large amount of data for journalistic analysis. We captured 2.3 million publications on social media for analysis. Of these, at least 155,000 contained offensive terms, were potentially violent and could be analyzed. Even with the automated linguistic filters created by our linguist, it still took a great deal of human analysis of these tweets: checking if they were cursing directed at the candidates, how the terms were used in different speeches, etc. Each published content required the human checking of at least 1,000 tweets in a few days, as we follow the electoral campaign calendar, which lasts only two months. All this work brought together a very diverse team: developers, data journalists, linguists, anthropologists, specialists in digital law, etc. In this way, we were able to gather different points of view on the data to make powerful analyzes of the dynamics of political violence in the networks. And it must be remembered that this is an especially sensitive content to be worked on by a mostly female team, which had to focus on misogynistic strategies of violence and attack. "," MonitorA is a project that combines technology, linguistics, journalism, law and advocacy to combat political gender violence. It is, therefore, a collaborative project: we brought together AzMina, InternetLab, an independent research center in the areas of law and technology, and five other local media outlets in five states in the country, which together produced content on political violence on the networks. With that, we were able to make cuts of territory, legal and technology cuts, and journalistic cuts on the subject.   In the technology area, it is also a major text mining and sentiment analysis project: we use linguistic filters to determine whether publications were potentially violent. This can be very useful and inspiring for other journalists and media who want to investigate hate speech on the internet: not just the terms used, but how these speeches are spread, what are the strategies used, the actors involved, the difference in speech in attacks to different profiles of people, etc. It is also possible to learn from the flows and processes used by our team to deal with this large amount of data and transform them into not only quantitative, but qualitative analyzes.

China,澎湃新闻 The Paper,Big,Shortlist,What 11699 Cases Tell Us About COVID-19?,23/12/20,"Explainer, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Three.js, Canvas, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, Python"," Using epidemiological survey data collected over the past year, we review the spread and development of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in China through a 3D visualization.   The first chapter is a starry sky symbolizing every individual in the prevention and containment of the virus. The second is a forest illustrating the intricate complexities of human-to-human virus transmissions. Readers are free to explore the details of each patient in the virus transmission chain. The third chapter regroups the dataset into a bar chart demonstrating the variety of disease symptoms at the time of diagnosis. "," The data for the 11699 surveyed cases were made public for further research and usage. Readers can apply for the data at the end of the interactive project. After one week of the publication, near one thousand readers apply for the data. They come from various industries, like universities, media, pharmaceutical companies, consulting companies, freelancers, and more. We encourage them to discover more stories, findings, and patterns of the dataset. After all, humans forget easily. Data shall keep the memory of the special year of 2020 for us. "," Python: Clean and analyze the dataset. Convert the data into the format for the visualization. Merge the words for interactive displaying.    Three.js: Creating and rendering visualizations. Building up animations and transformations among the scenes, like a starry sky, forests, bar charts, and more.   Shader: Data binding for background colors and icons of the circle, and group and regroup of the 3D circles. "," Collecting and cleaning data for our first version dataset was very complicated and time-consuming because the data of local health commissions are spreading out over multiple websites and platforms, and they are all written in different formats. Therefore, we need to clean the data both by hand and by python scripts.   It is also very challenging to use three.js for loading a dataset of over ten thousand rows, converting every row into a 3D bubble, transforming all the bubbles into different shapes and scenes, grouping and regrouping all the bubbles smoothly.    Calculating and visualizing the transmission chain is difficult too. The dataset for the network only contains two columns: ""from"" and ""to."" Therefore, we need to code in three.js to find multiple lines that connect to each other. "," Being a data journalist in China is hard because it is rare to run into a well-formatted public dataset, especially during the pandemic when public departments are swamped with virus controls. For this project, we try to overcome this obstacle by cleaning and organizing data ourselves and cooperating with university researchers. Special thanks to Liu Xiaofan, Xu Xiaoke and Wu Ye for sharing the full dataset with us. In contrary to us, university researchers have more time and resources to conduct long-term data cleaning with machine learning and Natural Language Processing. Therefore, the cooperation between media and university researchers can produce interesting news stories while guaranteeing the high quality of large-scale manual collecting data. This project is a great tryout for the cooperation like this. I think in the future, data journalists in China would reach out to the universities for meaningful story ideas and research datasets.  ",http://h5.thepaper.cn/html/zt/2020/12/liudiao/index.html,,,,,,,,"Zou Manyun, Kong Jiaxing, Du Haiyan, Wang Yasai, Lu Yan"," The Paper data news team features data journalism and explanatory reporting, in all forms including infographic, interactive visualization, animation video and 3D animation.   ",

"," The team, consisting of several reporters, a data journalist and a researcher, observed the right-wing scene on Instagram for more than eight months. It developed several tools to collect and analyze large amounts of data on the platform (it had its approach peer-reviewed by two researchers).     The used tools reached from „Exponential Discriminative Snowball Sampling“ to one where we could see how strong connections between accounts on instagram are (based on follows) called „instaball“, to classical network analysis and text data mining. The process went through mulitple iterations including security and bias checks (the full process is explained here: https://correctiv.org/top-stories/2020/10/06/kein-filter-fuer-rechts-instagram-rechtsextremismus-daten-so-sind-wir-vorgegangen/#daten-daten-daten-so-sind-wir-vorgegangen)    Through the database, the team was able to map a network of Instagram accounts for the first time (4,500 accounts) and understand how right-wingers to far-right extremists communicate there and draw young people into their ideology. It turned out that Instagram's algorithmic vulnerabilities are being exploited for this purpose. "," One of the key challenges: The corporate philosophy of Facebook subsidiary Instagram prevents third parties from gaining access to the data stored on the platform. Only the online service itself and the users should be allowed to dispose of it.    For us, this meant that Instagram does not offer any way to collect data from accounts. We therefore had to get creative and find a solution ourselves in order to be able to answer our research questions. Which we did, because we believe that the public has a right to know about right-wing strategies on one the most-used social media platform these days. "," Aside from the combinational usage of different tools in order to show a network on instagram, the way we presented to story deserves attention.     So, what was special about #KeinFilterFürRechts was not only the combination of several research paths, but also in particular the narrative format: The research was published in four parts over the course of a week, with the headlines of the individual stories and their publication date being teased on the website in advance. Interested readers were able to subscribe to e-mail reminders - which they also actively used. In addition, the team used #KeinFilterFürRechts (the research title, which sounds like a slogan but describes the research result very precisely), a highly frequented hashtag, under which thousands of people exchanged views on the topic in social media.

Germany,Zeit Online,Big,Shortlist,Why Is the Risk of Coronavirus Transmission so High Indoors?,26/11/20,"Explainer, News application, Illustration, Health",Animation," Let's assume you meet with another household and spend four hours together indoors. Later, it turns out that one person was carrying the new coronavirus. How high is the risk that someone has become infected – and how high is the risk for you personally?    Aerosols can carry Sars-CoV-2 from one person to another. Our interactive calculator allows for readers to design a room and determine how many people will be in, under what conditions. To visualize the risk of infection for various scenarios we have used data from the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Germany.     "," The tool was used several million times and is even shared today daily on Social Media. It helped millions of people to be more aware of the high risk of Coronavirus transmission indoors and even served policy makers to illustrate the risk of transmission indoors. While there was a discussion in Germany on the importance of FFP2 masks, our tool showed what huge difference those masks make.

United States,BuzzFeed News,Big,Winner,Inside China's Vast Infrastructure To Detain Muslims,27/08/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Breaking news, Human rights","Animation, 3D modelling, Google Sheets"," Combining unprecedented satellite and architectural analysis with the voices of dozens of former prisoners, BuzzFeed News exposed China’s vast new infrastructure that the government has built for the mass detention of Muslims.  "," American politicians from both sides of the aisle took notice of the series, including Sens. <a href=""https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1299155590065934336?s=21"">Marco Rubio,  <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jeffmerkley/posts/10157477910411546"">Jeff Merkley,  and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/senatortoomey/posts/4623282704350341"">Pat Toomey . The first two articles in the series came at a crucial moment, when Congress was debating a bill to ban imports from Xinjiang made with forced detainee labor. The legislation easily passed the House in September and is awaiting approval from the Senate.   In February, Rajagopalan wrote about the plight of Tursunay Ziyawudun, a Uighur woman who had been detained for 10 months at internment camps. Ziyawudun escaped to Kazakhstan — but was told she would have to return to China to apply for a new visa, Rajagopalan reported. Returning to the country would likely have meant that she would be detained again. In September, Ziyawudun arrived safely in the United States, ending the threat of forcible repatriation. Ziyawudun’s lawyer said that she believed the press coverage helped her case. "," Killing discovered that Baidu Maps, run by China’s state-owned Google equivalent, had blanked out many satellite images that appeared uncensored on regular Google Earth — a clue that China wanted to hide these locations from the outside world.    There were 5 million of these tiles to wade through, however, which was far too many for individual human beings to process. Camps usually need to be near towns and infrastructure, so the team narrowed their search, yielding a still-enormous dataset of 50,000 locations.    Buschek built a custom web tool to sort through the images systematically. Soon the pool of possible detention sites was much more manageable. Still, the team had to go through thousands of images one by one, verifying many of the sites against other available evidence.    Killing is a licensed architect, a skill set she deployed to analyze the sites in detail. She developed sources at satellite imaging firms and obtained high-resolution images of key locations. These images enabled her to estimate the capacity of some of the compounds. Some could hold more than 10,000 people.   Rajagopalan and Killing homed in on the camp in Mongolküre. Pairing the images with survivor accounts, they provided as complete a picture as possible of how a camp functioned from the inside: the barbed wire pens in the courtyard where detainees were occasionally brought to exercise, the passage leading from the guardhouse to the main accommodation building, the colors of the outside walls.    Using specialized software, Killing developed a 3D architectural model of the camp — which she and BuzzFeed News’ art director, Ben King, deployed to tell the story. They created a scrolling interactive that blended the model seamlessly with the written text, allowing readers to see renderings of the cell blocks and classrooms at key points throughout the piece. "," Soon after China began to round up and detain thousands of Muslims in Xinjiang, Megha Rajagopalan was the first reporter to <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/the-police-state-of-the-future-is-already-here"">document the rise  of <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/china-uighur-spies-surveillance"">mass surveillance  in the region and the first to visit an internment camp — at a time when China denied that such camps existed.   In response, the government tried to silence her, revoking her visa and ejecting her from the country. It would go on to cut off access to the entire region for most Westerners and stymie journalists.   Undeterred, Rajagopalan kept digging. She started with a simple question: Where were people being held? With the estimated number of detainees running as high as 1 million, the Chinese government couldn’t just lock everyone up in its existing prisons. But in a region bigger than Alaska, it was immensely difficult for anyone to find evidence of new detention camps.   Rajagopalan teamed up with architect Alison Killing and programmer Christo Buschek to analyze satellite images. They analyzed thousands of satellite images censored by the Chinese government, which they compared with images on uncensored mapping software. Months of painstaking work later, they discovered more than 260 sites with the hallmarks of fortified detention compounds. Many also contained factories where detainees are forced to labor. These were built to be permanent, high-security facilities, signaling that the government aimed to imprison people for years.   Rajagopalan then traveled to Kazakhstan and persuaded more than two dozen former detainees to recount beatings and humiliations in harrowing detail, as well as provide more information on specific camps. Their accounts offered essential insights into life inside, from the ubiquitous cameras to the hierarchy of prisoners. They described being taken away from their homes, the horrors of life inside the camps, and the trauma that remains with them even after fleeing China. "," Other journalists can learn from this project the value of persistence in reporting.   Expelling Rajagopalan was only one way that China tried to stop her. The government also banned people in Xinjiang from speaking to reporters.    In-person door knocking was out of the question, but so was any other form of communication, given China’s highly sophisticated and draconian mass surveillance system. The very few ex-detainees who have managed to flee China live in terror of reprisals against family members back home.    So in order to speak to people who had been locked up, Rajagopalan needed to get creative. It soon became clear that her best bet was Kazakhstan, a landing point for most of the escapees. In a country known for its own authoritarian impulses, Rajagopalan not only had to find survivors but also had to earn their trust.    It would have been a journalistic success to interview just three or four ex-detainees. Rajagopalan spoke to dozens and, as a result, gathered essential details that had never been reported.   Throughout her reporting, Rajagopalan had to endure harassment from the Chinese government, which had persisted beyond forcing her to pack up her apartment in Beijing on short notice. Its representatives repeatedly pressured her to write more-positive stories about the country. State security agents asked her to divulge her contacts.

United States,FiveThirtyEight,Big,Shortlist,2020 Election Forecast,12/08/20,"Illustration, Chart, Elections, Politics","D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js"," The FiveThirtyEight 2020 election forecast combines sophisicated statistical modeling of election results with innovative data visualization techniques. For this year's version we prioritized accessibility for a wide range of audiences, usability of our data visualizations, and strong integration with our other editorial content. The result is a project that makes a complicated and commonly misunderstood subject easy to understand without skimping on detail. "," This project informed a vast audience about the range of possible electoral outcomes in a critical election year. It sparked interest in the poltiical process amongst our readership, informed our reporting and was widely cited by other digital and broadcast media. By any quantitative measure it was the most successful project FiveThirtyEight has ever created.   But perhaps it's greatest success is in what it did not do. Our focus on accessibility this year led to numerous design tweaks that demystified and simplified the forecasting process, heading off confusion and misinpretation. In particular, we used user experience research and reader feedback to ensure the uncertain nature of the forecast was well-understood by a wide variety of readers, including those with limited statistical literacy. We innovated new data visualization forms (the highly-regarded ""ballswarm"") and added a carefully designed mascot (""Fivey Fox"") to guide readers through statistical concepts and on to our other elections coverage.   This project also provided the raw materials for other projects, including <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-election-map/"">the interactive version of the forecast  we published in October. ", The forecast uses FiveThirtyEight's standard technical stack which involves a Node based build system on the backend and a lot of vanilla javascript on the frontend. We used D3 for charting. The forecast model itself is written in STATA. Some automation was written in Ruby. ," The hardest part of this project was finding the right ways to communicate the level of detail our existing readers expect, while not overwhelming or confusing new readers or those who's first exposure to FiveThirtyEight is the forecast. This a delicate balancing act which entailed extensive user research, endless rounds of design mocking, and hours of debate amongst the team. We further invested a great deal of time into careful choice of words, integration of other explanatory reporting, and accessible design components, such as screenreader summaries for data visualizations. "," Every fresh project is an opportunity to improve on what's come before. As a team we are proud of the intentions we brought to this project. We were aware of the public critiques that had been leveled against previous version of the forecast. Rather than react defensively we engaged in a comprehensive effort to build a forecast that not only engaged all readers, but truly informed them. The use of complicated statistical techniques need not create a black box. A first time reader to the forecast can walk away just as well-informed as someone who understands monte carlo simulations and the nitty gritty of details of the electoral college.

United States,"FiveThirtyEight, ABC",Big,Shortlist,Testing Access,22/07/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Fact-checking, Podcast/radio, Chart, Video, Map, Health","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets"," To our knowledge, this was the first nationwide review of COVID-19 testing site access. The analysis, by FiveThirtyEight, ABC News and ABC-owned television stations, found that testing sites in communities of color in many major cities faced higher demand than sites in whiter or wealthier areas in those same cities. The result of this disparity was clear: Black and Hispanic people were more likely to experience longer wait times and understaffed testing centers.   In addition to a feature-length story, this analysis led to further reporting by ABC-owned television stations, a video explainer and an episode of FiveThirtyEight's coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19. "," This project — featured on Good Morning America, Nightline, 20/20 and elsewhere — helped bring light to a racial disparity in the COVID-19 pandemic (access to tests) that had been receiving far less media attention than other disparities (morbidity, for example). This reporting and analysis helped show how and why those disparities in outcomes happen. As a result of increased attention on the gap in access to testing, many states and cities launched and/or strengthened programs aimed specifically at adding testing access capacity in Black and Hispanic communities and neighborhoods. "," In addition to the testing site data from Castlight Health, we used the 2014-18 ACS to obtain demographic data on American cities. We then used the statistical software R to develop an algorithm which calculated how many people would be projected to use each testing site, based on the number of people, the sites’ proximity and the number of available sites. We compared block groups that were majority-white, majority-Hispanic and majority-Black within urbanized areas over 1 million people to see how accessible different testing sites were in different cities. In LA, we also used an over-time approach to compare racial disparities in access before and after the city made a concerted effort to expand to lower-income areas. We showed that this expansion helped, but that racial disparities in access remained.   The visual representation of these findings relied heavily on combining aspects of the data analysis with cartography. We used GIS analysis in R to generate maps that allowed us to compare testing site demand by census tract and demographics. We then used Adobe Illustrator to finalize the presentation of these maps to accompany the feature-length story, including the integration of map elements drawn by hand in Illustrator that added a personal identity to the graphics.   We complemented this data-driven approach with traditional reporting in the cities our data analysis highlighted, interviewing people and politicians to understand why this had happened, what was being done to remedy the situation, and what the consequences were both for individuals’ lives and for containing the pandemic at the neighborhood or city level. "," The hardest part of the project was trying to understand how to take population density into account when assessing disparities in access to testing sites. There are obviously going to be more testing sites where there are more people -- but denser places also have a different racial composition than sparsely populated places. We considered calculating something like the number of people per testing site in each county, but county borders are porous, and people can get tested in nearby counties. The algorithm we came up with was based on the assumption that people would go to closer sites, and looked at how many people each site would have to serve based on the number of people and other sites nearby. It let us compare racial disparities in access while accounting for density in a way that made it part of the story, rather than a pesky confounding variable.   The other big challenge was how to visualize these disparities. We felt good about the metric we had developed, but it wasn’t obvious how best to visualize it. Mapping two separate variables simultaneously -- in our case, race and ease of access -- is not easy, but we wanted to show the geographic component of the analysis as well as the raw stats. We did it by dividing each city into the majority-white and majority-Black or Hispanic areas, and showing ease of access for each. "," The power of combining different types of journalistic evidence. This story would have been good with only the data analysis. It would have been good with only the reporting chronicling everyday Americans’ efforts to get tests. It would have been good with only the reporting on what people in power were doing regarding COVID-19 testing access in Black and Hispanic communities. But all that evidence combined, woven together, built a credibility, power and impact that was, to use the cliche, greater than the sum of its parts.     More specifically: Our reporting provided anecdotal evidence that Black and Hispanic communities had less access to COVID-19 testing. Our data-based measure of testing access was smart, but it was also built on a few assumptions -- informed assumptions, but assumptions nonetheless. But the fact that the reporting and data analysis pointed in the same directions was key. The reporting gave us confidence in the analysis, and the analysis gave us a comprehensiveness and level of detail in finding and showing disparities that we never would have been able to do with reporting alone. The result was a reliable, national picture of access to COVID-19 testing by race and income -- a picture that showed a level inequity that demanded action.

Peru,Convoca.pe,Small,Winner,Convoca Deep Data: The most complete data analysis platform on extractive industries in Peru,23/09/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, Chart, Map, Environment, Health, Employment, Human rights","Scraping, JQuery, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Node.js"," Convoca Deep Data is the most ambitious digital platform that Convoca.pe has ever developed. This platform gathers relevant information on the extractive industries of the mining and hydrocarbons industries in Peru.    In order to develop this platform we processed 2.4 million data, and analyzed information that dated back a hundred years and indicators that measure, for instance, the level of non-compliance with environmental and labor regulations in the last 15 years.    Additionally, we processed a 16-year-period of information that contains over 200 open files on environmental matters and a registry of penalties and sanctions imposed between 2014-2019. "," Given the quality, quantity, and access of the information, non-government institutions and organizations of the civil society in Peru have contacted Convoca seeking to establish alliances and partnerships. These dynamics are essential to both secure the sustainability of the project in the long term and apply our methodology to other business sectors that register too serious infractions violating labor and environmental protection norms affecting indigenous people.    In order to develop DeepData, our team had to process highly sensitive data that contains information on the mining industry, one of the most powerful economic activities that has brought up several conflicts and disputes over natural resources in Peru.    For developing this platform our team created a traffic light that identifies large oil and mining companies based on the severity of environmental law violations (highly,frequently, moderately, or little infringing). In order to do so, we established a weighted value using statistical methods to indicate the number of environmental violations and the level of severity.   Researchers, scholars, reporters, and specialized organizations are now able, for the first time, to find in an integrated way information about the laboral-environment behavior at mining sites operating in Peru. In our country, open digital platforms containing this kind of processed data are not available; hence, projects like Convoca Deep Data show that it’s possible to provide citizens with integrated and processed data related to the mining and oil industries. To this date near 350 people have subscribed to the platform.     Thanks to this platform our reporters published 10 exclusive investigations between September and December of last year. This investigation also made it possible to disclose relevant information including the number of mining workers with Covid-19 and the mining companies that benefited from government programs like Reactiva Peru that offered economic incentives to companies from different business sectors.    "," For cleaning, organization and analysis of the data we used different programs: from dynamic tables of Excel, through the statistical processing software R to generate the calculations of the default indicator and SQL for the crossing of the information from the various tables .    The processed information was complemented with the data of the coordinates of the location of the operations of the companies at the national level to georeference them and visualize them in interactive maps generated with the MapBox tool.   In some cases in order to obtain more information we had to scrap government websites, and cleaned  and processed the information using R. For data analysis, we used different techniques including dynamic Excel tables, software used for R programming to calculate key indicators, and SQL for crossing information with different tables.    We also used geographical coordinates to georeference and visualize mining companies’ operations across the country using interactive maps developed with MapBox. The platform was developed using the version 9 of Angular in order to have more control over the information. The backend was developed using Nodejs/Express.  "," Our biggest challenge was the construction of the severity indicator that was built as a traffic light for alerts to measure the degree of non-compliance by companies. We were able to do so based on the number of violations and the level of severity. This traffic light identifies a large company in the extractive industries as highly infringing (in red), frequently infringing (orange), moderately infringing (yellow) and little infringing (green).   To reach that traffic light, as a first step we organized, cleaned and analyzed more than 2,000 files for environmental violations opened from 2004 to January 2020 to mining and oil companies, as well as sanctioning processes for labor rights.   Then we established an indicator taking into account the number of infractions confirmed by government entities in Peru that overview environmental and labor matters, as well as the level of severity for each sanction (mild, serious and very serious).   Subsequently, we established a weighted value using statistical methods that summarize the number of violations and the level of severity. Finally, the list of more than 200 offending companies was grouped into four percentiles (25% each) to establish a ranking by level, which is expressed in the traffic light indicator that Convoca Deep Data shows. "," Journalists can learn that data can not only be used as a source for immediate publications, but also that data can be integrated with other databases to generate open data platforms such as Convoca Deep Data.   At Convoca Deep Data, Convoca.pe has reflected the vast experience of the organization exercising data journalism in the public interest. In order to build different databases our team filed 50 public information requests from government entities, scraped government websites, used tools like OCR to convert PDFs, and analyzed hundreds of documents.    Our work is best characterized for establishing a methodology to develop and codify the traffic light indicator, which accurately describes the degree of behavior of each of the more than 200 extractive companies analyzed as part of the development of the platform.    Establishing a strong section of methodology and understanding data involves interviewing human sources and experts from different fields, and going over hundreds of official documents.    Hence, data-driven projects need to be collaborative and interdisciplinary. To build Convoca Deep Data, a team of 14 people including reporters, analysts and data scientists, technology developers, graphic designers, and audience editors, made possible the development of the platform.

Just how extensive were the changes over the years? The Straits Times’ election data team ran an analysis and found that every area of Singapore has seen at least one change.    To create Singapore’s first digital archive of electoral boundary maps, the team spent months retracing all boundary changes since 1968, when the country’s first election after independence was held. "," We were able to prepare this in advance and publish on the day elections were announced on June 23 which meant we had hit peak interest on the topic. Some quotes from readers:    “Sharing this because the content presentation should be the new standard of how we consume big media; interactive, concise and visually captivating.”    “Not bad, ST coming up with a NYT style piece complete with graphics and animation.

"," The interactive uncovered topics and stories in their respective years through data analysis methods that could have been difficult to discover using manual curation. It also allows readers to explore and recall the past using interesting insights.    For example, under “epidemics”, users will learn that while Covid-19 might be dominating the headlines today, Singapore has survived previous outbreaks of deadly diseases, such as smallpox in the 1950s. In 1959, ST reported that a 49-year-old was the first person to die of smallpox here. "," The team grouped the headlines into five major topics: epidemics, foreign affairs, local towns, vices and crimes, and war and peace. Each category then allows the reader to browse through 5 to 7 topics highlighted by the respective headline images and click to find a description or story behind the trend or event.    The project uses an algorithm to help in the analysis. The algorithm gives weight to how important subjects were in their respective years. The charts help visualise how heavily each topic was mentioned in the headlines. "," Surprisingly, gathering the headlines data. It is an old newspaper and it's digital archives are not accessible to the publication through a machine-readable format. The team had to build a scraper that could pull first page content as far back as possible. Also, the front pages were typically used as classfieds or ads in the beginning, so we had to manually identify at which point The Straits Times changed editorial priorities for the front page.

"," When coronavirus began spreading in California, public health officials told people who fell ill to isolate themselves in their homes for two weeks. However, Cimini and Botts had been covering the California Divide for nearly a year and were well aware that many California families simply can’t do that. Forced by the high cost of living, parents squeeze into rooms with their children, cousins sleep on couches, grandparents convert living rooms into bedrooms and farmworkers pile into barracks-style bunk beds.   As the shutdown dragged on into the summer, various state and county hotel programs began offering shelter to essential workers as part of the government's response to slow the spread. In July, Gov. Newsom announced Housing for the Harvest, a hotel program to provide quarantine and isolation rooms for farmworkers who live in crowded housing. It’s clear the team’s reporting helped raise awareness about the link between essential workers and the overcrowded places to which they return home. "," In early April, Botts began pulling data from a handful of county dashboards that were starting to publish case counts by ZIP code. She compared these to Census Bureau data. A clear correlation between crowding and COVID-19 emerged. She consulted an NYU researcher, who had found a <a href=""https://calmatters.org/projects/california-coronavirus-overcrowded-housing-data-analysis/?"">similar pattern  in hard-hit New York City. Over the following month, she requested and analyzed the number of coronavirus cases in each ZIP code for 10 California counties with the highest case counts.

In its current phase it already has 70 million data, from all companies in Brazil and Brazilian politicians since 2014. It is a project created by Abraji (Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism) and Brasil.IO (a Brazilian open data hub). Our intention is to transform these huge and difficult-to-access databases into visualizations of power relationships that can be seen by non-data science experts. "," It is a work of more than a year carried out by the teams of Abraji and the programmer and transparency activist Álvaro Justen, from Brasil.IO, with the support of the Google News Initiative.   The authors of the project understand that knowledge and understanding of large public databases is one of the ways to improve investigative journalism, especially the data have cross-relationships, context and check.   Many of the databases used originate from the work of Claudio Weber Abramo, an activist for transparency and a pioneer of data journalism in Brazil, who died in August 2018 - who founded the non-profit organization Dados.org together with the journalist and ex President of Abraji José Roberto de Toledo. Abramo's family kindly gave up the bases he built for Abraji to continue some of his work.   Thus with this experience of Abramo and Toledo, the teams of Abraji and Brasi.IO created a project to explore large Brazilian databases and the graph solution to facilitate access to information.   With this initiative, last year we conducted a pilot course in data journalism and compliance techniques using CruzaGrafos and other databases of public interest, for 80 journalists from all regions of the country.   This year we created an investigative journalism newsletter derived from the project (Investigadora), which already had more than 700 subscribers at the end of January, and has the proposal to show investigative journalism techniques weekly using CruzaGrafos and show recent cases of journalistic investigation Brazil based on evidence. An online training program was also created in January for newsrooms, freelancers, students and third sector organizations focused on open data and transparency - the intention is to show the potential of CruzaGrafos and the possibilities of data journalism to improve the journalistic work. "," The technical team used programming languages such as Python, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Shell and PLpgSQL. All the steps described in obtaining the data, checks and the source code of the platform will also be made available on Github this year.   Technology actions were taken, such as:   - Data processing (partners of Brazilian companies, Brazilian CNPJs - unique company identification code in Brazil -, corporate activities by CNPJ, political candidacies, political donations, health contracts, among other main bases to be selected for launch and over the course of 2021)   - Expanded neighboring nodes and Expanded neighboring nodes by up to 2 degrees have been implemented, allowing you to quickly expand the visualization of the graphs of connections between people and companies - shows the degrees of connection nearby   - The ""Save graph"" feature was made, which will be very useful during the tests - not only to make life easier for the person testing, but also to help us debug in case of errors   - We built a solution to calculate the “path between objects”, which calculates the shortest path between two people/companies and shows in the graph   - We added a functionality that was not initially planned, but that will help a lot in usability, after tests that we did internally: browse the history of the objects (people and companies) searched   It was also very important all the previous work of scraping the databases and exploratory data analysis with Python, SQL and Metabase to understand the information, clean and prepare it for use in production. "," The enormous size of some databases, with tens of millions of rows, required creating alternatives to make the tool both fast and interactive. And we also deal with data with names of people and companies and IDs - they are sensitive data that require a lot of checking controls and to avoid homonyms.   Because of these difficulties, innovations in the project code were necessary. The main innovations in code technology at CruzaGrafos were:  - (1) Entity centralizer: it provides the search for names, companies, municipalities, hospitals, contracts, etc., and gives us the unique universal identifier (UUID). Entities can be: companies, people, applications etc. The lack of a UUID brings problems such as the need to filter through several fields at the same time (which change from dataset to dataset), difficulty in searching in more than one dataset, difficulty in generating the offline ID for external queries, among others  - (2) Graph backend: this is the ""heart"" of the system, which connects to the previous system for searching and manages queries in the graph bank, API etc.  - (3) CruzaGrafos: here we have the ""glue"" of everything and it is the most specific part that only matters to Abraji: it is where we have the integration with the authentication of the Abraji associate system, where we have the scripts that feed the two systems above and the interface the user accesses.   The project is open freely to Abraji associates and anyone who signs up as a user.         "," This project wants to take advantage of the potential of open data and transparency. In the Global Open Data Index, Brazil is in ninth place, so there is a lot of relevant information for society, but most of the time these files are not machine readable, or very large, or without technical details. This makes the work of data journalism more difficult or restricted to people already familiar with data science.   This way, all the work with the data done by the team will allow thousands of journalists and researchers to have access to this information ready for use. And with graph visualization, it is possible to research power relations among millions of people, companies and politicians.   CruzaGrafos has all Brazilian companies registered with the IRS - 43.9 million companies. Also information on political candidacies, a total of 1.1 million people, according to the Superior Electoral Court (TSE). Thus considering companies, their partners and electoral candidacies, the project now has 70.7 million data.   This creates many possibilities for investigation, such as: Search for all companies linked to a politician/candidate for public office in which he or she is a partner or administrator; In these companies see who are the other partners; Also check the proximity network of these partners, that is, of which other companies they are partners and the other respective partners, in different degrees of proximity; and many others.   Also, throughout 2021, the project will continue to update the IRS and TSE databases and include others of public interest on the environment, public contracts, electoral campaign donations and health. Always with the proposal of allowing crossings with identification keys that can be seen in graphs. As well as our newsletter and training throughout the year, they also intend to spread the Project, its information and research techniques.

For Ethiopia, a new mega-dam known as the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) holds the promise of much-needed electricity. For Egypt, this translates into the fear of a devastating water crisis. “Saving the Nile” is a science-led data visualization explainer measuring the impact Africa's largest hydro-dam could have on the precious water and agricultural resources of downstream countries. Working in partnership with NASA scientists this story helps Al Jazeera's global audience – in English and Arabic – understand the normally complex scientific concepts affecting an entire region. "," The Renaissance Dam dispute remains one of the African continent’s biggest stories.   As a result, the project was the most viewed and shared content explainer on the subject in 2020 with more than half a million page views and an average time on page of 5 minutes.   The web-based scientific report and models have been cited by various academic papers and research institutes and the sharable social media graphics continue to be shared across various digital platforms today.      "," The core experience was built using Mapbox Scrollytelling built in React.js   Data models, based on peer reviewed research, were calculated and interpreted using the R programming language. Designs were then rendered as artists' impressions using the Adobe Suite of tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate and Premiere). "," Academic papers are often complex and difficult to understand. ""Saving the Nile"", interprets and visualizes complex earth and space concepts without compromising scientific accuracy.    This was particularly important given the polarizing political positions on the GERD project.   Throughout the interactive experience we present readers with animations, quizzes, data visualizations, maps and infographics. Each visualization was carefully crafted to improve readers’ understanding of the sensitive biodiversity along the world’s oldest and longest river. To reach the largest possible audience the story was produced in English and Arabic across digital platforms including Mobile, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. This, to our knowledge,  makes ""Saving the Nile"" one of the most comprehensive resources on the River Nile by a news organization. "," At the time of this writing, Egypt and Ethiopia have still not reached an agreement on the filling of the GERD reservoir.    While this topic will likely remain heavily debated, the environmental data and models provided (and subsequently published) in this story provides readers and policy makers with a scientific perspective on a real-world issue that could impact over 280 million people.

Bosnia and Herzegovina,"Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Kloop, RFE/RL Radio Azattyk, and Bellingcat",Big,Shortlist,The Matraimov Kingdom,02/10/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Corruption, Money-laundering, Lifestyle, Crime","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap"," “The Matraimov Kingdom” exposes the corruption, illicit riches, and political influence of a powerful Kyrgyz clan headed by Raimbek Matraimov, a former top customs official.   During his years in customs, Raimbek enabled and profited from a massive smuggling empire worth over a billion dollars.    But though Matraimov was later fired, his stranglehold over Kyrgyzstan’s customs service has only grown. Our stories showcase his family’s extravagant lifestyle; unveil his connection to an infamous underground criminal boss; and explain how the Matraimovs converted their wealth into political clout. "," On October 5, 2020, just days after publication, a mass protest took place in Bishkek. Citizens were outraged at the corruption the stories revealed — and at the fact that the Matraimovs’ political party, which benefited from their illicit wealth, had done so well in the parliamentary election through vote buying and other illegal tactics.   The protests quickly grew into a popular uprising and a revolution that led to the ouster of the president and the cancellation of the <a href=""https://www.occrp.org/en/the-matraimov-kingdom/pro-government-election-victory-sparks-overnight-revolution-in-kyrgyzstan"">election results .   Kyrgyzstan’s new government has promised to pursue corruption with a new focus. On October 19, the State Committee of National Security (GKNB) <a href=""https://kloop.kg/blog/2020/10/19/gknb-vyyavleno-40-chelovek-iz-okruzheniya-matraimova-kotorye-mogut-byt-prichastny-k-korruptsii-na-tamozhne/"">announced  that it was investigating Raimbek Matraimov’s corrupt customs schemes, which had been revealed in the investigation. They said they had already identified 40 customs employees tied to Matraimov.   On the next day, Matraimov was <a href=""https://rus.azattyk.org/a/30903519.html"">arrested  (but later released under a pledge not to leave Kyrgyzstan). The new government reached an agreement that he would pay about $24 million into the treasury as compensation for the stolen funds. He is now on trial for corruption.   On October 22, Kamchybek Kolbaev, the criminal boss our investigation links to Matraimov, was <a href=""https://kloop.kg/blog/2020/10/22/gknb-v-bishkeke-zaderzhan-kriminalnyj-avtoritet-kamchy-kolbaev/"">arrested  under charges of “establishing organized criminal groups.”   Kyrgyzstan’s new post-revolutionary acting Prime Minister has <a href=""https://kloop.kg/blog/2020/12/07/naladit-uchet-i-uprostit-protsedury-kak-novikov-pytaetsya-navesti-poryadok-na-tamozhne/"">pledged  to eliminate corruption in the customs service and introduce a number of anti-corruption measures.   One of our sources, who was both a witness and a victim of Matraimov’s corrupt schemes, was released from custody after the uprising. He had been imprisoned after speaking with reporters.   On December 9, the United States <a href=""https://kloop.kg/blog/2020/12/09/ssha-vnesli-rajymbeka-matraimova-v-sanktsionnyj-spisok-magnitskogo/"">sanctioned  Raimbek Matraimov and his spouse under the Global Magnitsky Act.   On December 24, the GKNB head told the press that Matraimov had <a href=""https://rus.azattyk.org/a/31020231.html"">confessed  to having established corrupt schemes in the customs service.     "," Using open-source investigative techniques, reporters were able to expose the extravagant lifestyle the Matraimovs enjoyed despite Raimbek’s modest official salary.    As it turns out, Raimbek’s wife was an enthusiastic social media poster. Reporters gained access to her account and found hundreds of images that showed her, her children, and her friends cruising on private jets, enjoying yacht outings, and staying in deluxe hotels. Her posts were used to make an interactive timeline that shows the family travelling the world in luxury even as Raimbek worked in government.   Reporters also used his wife’s social media posts to catalogue her purchases of luxury watches, clothes, shoes, bags, and jewelry. These were listed in a spreadsheet, and web tools such as Yandex Reverse Image Search helped reporters identify the items and establish their value: Over $400,000 in total.   The photos also led reporters to a previously unknown acquisition: A penthouse apartment in Dubai. Google Earth Pro, Street View, and corroborating photos posted on social media were used to identify the exact location of the Matraimovs’ new apartment.    Turning to more traditional investigative methods, reporters used the Kyrgyz land registry to find two dozen properties — from elite apartments to busy places of commerce — owned by the Matraimov family. Analyzing the associated corporate records showed that many were acquired in a dubious way. An interactive map published with the project details these possessions and explains their backstories.    Corporate and tax records enabled reporters to build a database of Matraimov companies and use a tool called Maltego to visualize the links between them. A public list of Kyrgyz voters helped locate more relatives and connections. On-the-ground reporting then uncovered how the family used its network of proxies to obscure the virtual monopoly it had built over major international trade routes.     "," The first problem was security. Covering the Matraimov family means covering criminal groups, from Raimbek’s street-tough “sportsmen” to organized criminal bosses.    Many Kyrgyz reporters have been attacked for reporting on the family. While working on this investigation, an RFE/RL reporter was warned by a former Matraimov associate that the shadowy operator wanted him “dead or alive.” He provided proof showing that the reporter had been followed by a private detective. Moreover, one of the key sources for a related investigation was murdered.   Extreme measures of secrecy and security were undertaken at all steps of the reporting, especially for journalists working on the ground in Kyrgyzstan.   Reaching sources was difficult because the Matraimov family is so powerful and influential that few were willing to discuss them. Lots of time and dedication was required to build trust. One source, contacted because his business had been seized by Matraimov associates, was arrested and jailed.   Reporters faced an ethical dilemma when a source asked for a delay in publication because she feared her husband, who was involved in one of the stories, could come to harm. We made the difficult decision to move forward because the stories were in the public interest and our judgement was that the safety risks were minimal. Later, she understood our position and took no offense.    A regional office of one of the publication partners was surveilled by unknown people every time the Matraimov family was sent requests for comment. There were also constant online attacks by trolls and bots working in support of the Matraimov family.   Another difficulty was obtaining corporate documents. At one point, the Kyrgyz Ministry of Justice refused to provide company information in violation of the freedom of information act. Kloop has sued the ministry and the case is now before the Supreme Court.     "," This project shows the value of approaching an investigation from multiple angles, covering the political, economic, and even social aspects of corruption. Instead of limiting the stories to examinations of individual instances of corruption, the stories set these criminal acts in the context of Kyrgyzstan’s fragile political system and struggling economy.   This holistic element is precisely what was missing from previous reporting about the Matraimov family. Some of their suspicious acquisitions and actions had been reported, but no outlet has ever published a comprehensive look at this family, explaining not only what they had done but how they had done it — and how Kyrgyzstan’s brand of crony politics enabled them to get away with it.   In order to maximize the impact of these investigative stories, the project was intended from the ground-up to be a compelling narrative experience. Capturing the human element was prioritized in reporting, writing, and editing.    Multiple interactive features, as well as charts and explanatory boxes, ensure that readers understand the complex criminal schemes being described and appreciate their impact. The reporting is backed by two explainers that prove, step-by-step, how some of the most important findings were established. In a region known for sensational journalism and widespread rumor, these materials establish the investigation as a trustworthy standard and model for future reporting on crime and mass corruption.   Such a sprawling investigation, with multiple partners and reporters working in multiple languages, would not have been possible without intentional project management and a systematic way of storing and sharing data. Databases, calendars, shared drives, encrypted group communication, and other tools were employed to manage the project — and maintain security in a dangerous environment.

United Kingdom,Sky News,Big,Shortlist,Sky News: Automation in the newsroom to cover the COVID-19 pandemic story,01/03/20,"Explainer, Breaking news, Database","AI/Machine learning, Personalisation, Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js"," Sky News has developed a system to automate part of the data process to improve the management and communication of the COVID-19 story.   It automatically checked for updates and gathered new data from a dozen sources every 15 minutes. It also cleaned and re-structured it before storing it in a database.   This database became the starting point of multiple analyses, as well as the source of more than 50 automated visualisations.   This system saved the data team many hours, as well as helped our readers to keep track of the numbers, putting them into context and providing local information. "," In a year in which data teams have exceeded their healthy capacity, this system has been crucial for the team at Sky News.   Data sources routinely used for analyses were integrated into this automation process. As soon as a new source became relevant on an ongoing basis, we incorporated it to the in-house database, automating the process of gathering, cleaning and restructuring the data.   Because of this, the most essential and widely used data was “ready to be used” at any time in analyses and visualisations that updated in real-time.  That saved the data journalists hours of repetitive work and made the story-telling more visual, creative and efficient.   Automation has enabled us to respond to the high demand for stories and improve the quality of our journalism. The time saved has been invested in researching, collecting more specific data to complement official sources, and facilitate explainers and investigations. This has expanded our knowledge, allowing us to give our audience more comprehensive information about coronavirus and its impact, covering angles not included in official data.    This system has also been hugely beneficial to the wider newsroom, laying the foundations to explore automation and Artificial Intelligence at Sky News. These vital technologies for the future of journalism make newsrooms more efficient, enrich our coverage and help us to personalize stories relevant for people’s lives.      The impact can also be seen in the response of our audience.  Millions of users have engaged in data-rich stories and explainers created through this automation project.   The range of what we offered has been extensive, from analyses of the evolution of the pandemic to the impact of the virus in several sectors. And we have presented it at all levels (national, regional, local and postcode) to make the information as personal as possible for our audience. "," Data gathered from all the sources required reformatting. But datasets were scattered around and consisted of text published within static pages, CSVs, Excel, Google sheets, PDFs, JSON, XML feeds, and various dashboards that didn’t provide exporting methods.   We built a cloud-based solution using FaaS (Function-as-a-Service) microservice architecture, where each atomic service handled specific tasks to detect changes in the source and extract, format, clean-up and store the data.   Vision and Document artificial intelligence services managed data extraction in places where it couldn’t be exported: public dashboards, images, and unstructured files.   The extracted data was stored in Big Query tables and automatically updated multiple data feeds which were load-balanced across global content delivery network.   Flourish Live API with JavaScript was used across visualisations to consume live data feeds and dynamically edit content to keep the graphs up to date. For some visualisations, postcode API was also required to allow the user to look for their local information.   As some of the information wasn’t published in a machine-readable format, but given in press conferences or government documents, we created spreadsheets in Google Sheet and Microsoft Excel in which journalists – even without technical knowledge - could easily import the information that was linked to our in-house database.   Using R programming language, the data journalists could then easily query the database for stories. As the data kept the same format, we wrote several scripts that have been used and re-adapted multiple times to speed up the process, allowing more time for research and to improve the presentation and the design of our stories.  "," Consistent data was a key challenge since the beginning of this project. Sources have changed the structure of the data and their sharing methods multiple times, as well as backdating the changes without notification. To ensure accuracy, this system has been in constant revision.   Access to some data has proved difficult on multiple occasions. Some institutions did not allow data to be downloaded, but just explored it in their dashboards. We reached an agreement with some of them for a downloadable file, but we also had to develop complex scrapers to get daily numbers for some of the most basic variables.   The lack of a common body or place which united all the relevant information, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, increased the time required to identify the sources and the relevant data in each of them. And, as there isn’t a common standard for how the information is published, the cleaning and formatting process was quite laborious.   All these data challenges could have been better handled with time, but the urgency of the story, together with the relevance of breaking news at Sky News, increased the pressure on the project and the need to complete each stage quickly, without affecting the quality of the product.   The fast-moving and changing nature of the COVID-19 story has also contributed to the pressure.  We have been constantly revising, adapting and incorporating new sources and variables to the process.   It should also be noted that the two people involved in this project could not work on it exclusively but had to combine it with other responsibilities. Prior to the start of the project, there was also no proper data structure and architecture in the newsroom, and no established data team.  This was created months later.   "," Investing time and resources in automating processes and reducing repetitive tasks greatly improves the efficiency, efficacy and quality of the product. The benefits are particularly relevant to small teams, which could not otherwise compete with larger ones.  It also helps them to react to the pressure and needs of the newsroom in a demanding and fast-changing context.   Although big and multidisciplinary teams can build complex systems, small teams can benefit hugely from automation, identifying time-consuming repetitive tasks which would have an important impact on journalists’ efficiency and their stories if done automatically.   The lack of technical resources is usually the main inconvenience, especially in small teams. Working on this project, we have learned that identifying the right people within the company and collaboration are the keys.   Editorial teams normally lack technical professionals, but they are embedded in bigger groups, teams or companies. Building synergies with other departments within the newsroom or within the company can be a solution to that shortage of technical knowledge.   Data journalists are usually a bridge between the editorial and the technical teams. They have more technical skills and, although they are not at the same level as the developers, they have more knowledge and understanding of the requirements than the editorial team.  This contributes to more fluent communication and smooths the delivery of the project.   This has been an innovative project for Sky News, something the organisation has never done before. Developing it within the company instead of externally has also been crucial. It has given Sky employees the opportunity to expand their knowledge and skills and it has created the know-how within the company. Now these skills exist in the team, they are being re-used on other projects and even expanded as we continue to explore automation and AI in the newsroom.

United States,"Independent; formerly WBEZ, The Chicago Reporter",Small,Shortlist,Tracking COVID-19 in Illinois,20/03/20,"Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, News application, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health, Human rights","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python, Node.js"," Far from the noise and spectacle of 2020, massive audiences were hungry for reliable information on their communities and Tracking COVID-19 in Illinois delivered it.   Our series of graphics and tools tracking Illinois’ COVID-19 numbers and policies made the information accessible for journalists, academics and Illinoisans making everyday choices in a pandemic. Our work is available for anyone to embed on their own platforms. Our focus on reporting-driven design met people where they were, served fundamental information needs and offered easy access to the underlying data we collected, some of which is the only public, stable record of its kind. "," Tracking COVID-19 in Illinois reached a mass audience more efficiently and effectively than either government or legacy news outlets. It generated investigations, academic research, and community engagement.    We powered journalism. After we published our ZIP code map, WBEZ reporter Maria Zamudio reached out to obtain the case and testing data. We added a download button for anyone to use. Zamudio’s <a href=""https://www.wbez.org/stories/testing-lags-in-latino-communities-hit-hardest-by-covid-19-in-chicago/50613d3b-8770-45a3-ba6b-76f97bc6e1d0"">investigation of testing rates  revealed systemic disparities and led to expanded testing in Latinx neighborhoods.    We reached the experts. Suburban civil servants used our historical data in their planning and in community meetings. The data has been used in at least four academic research projects that we know about.   ""We were really happy to find the Illinois data set that you made available, and to be able to use it as an example of what could be possible if more local and state health departments would be willing to release their data with that degree of detail,"" Jarvis Chen, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health who used our data for a <a href=""https://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1266/2020/04/HCPDS_Volume-19_No_1_20_covid19_RevealingUnequalBurden_HCPDSWorkingPaper_04212020-1.pdf"">national analysis of the unequal racial and socio-economic burden of COVID-19,  told us.   Most of all, the project was a hit — and in a global pandemic, reach matters. Our project has reached roughly 1.2 million users via our embeds on more than sixteen sites and native apps. The embeds have been viewed almost 2 million times. We suspect many more because our work is used in newsletters like Block Club Chicago and shared on social platforms.   The spread of the disease is a numbers game. If 1 in 100 of the people who saw our work decided to wear a mask or avoided an unnecessary trip even once, then our project helped avoid a few unnecessary deaths and many more hospitalizations. "," This project represents the cutting edge of local journalism. The technology is sophisticated, reliable, and represents a great value. In almost a year, we’ve spent well under $200,000 to reach other a million people in multiple languages. Our competition did less with more resources.         Translation    Almost 14 percent of people in Illinois are native Spanish speakers. To cover the pandemic in Illinois, our work needed to be in both English and Spanish. But translation is often expensive, time-consuming, and technically challenging. We approached the challenge by prioritizing information design over traditional newswriting and with sophisticated use of accessible technology like Airtable.         Collaborative coding    Our Observable notebooks lowered the barrier to entry for collaboration and helped make translation possible. Because of our innovative use of this technology, reporters and editors without hard technical skills could make significant contributions.   The project was successful in the Observable ecosystem; our historical data notebook was one of the top ten most <a href=""https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/2020-viral-notebooks"">viral  and <a href=""https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/2020-most-viewed-notebooks"">viewed  notebooks on the platform, and we <a href=""https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/may-2020-virtual-community-meetup-archived"">presented our work to the community  in May 2020.         Embedding    Observable notebooks also meant we could easily share our data graphics with their powerful embedding system. Pasting a simple snippet of code worked for over 16 websites and native apps.          Geolocation    We use geolocation to effectively personalize the experience and meet our audience where they are. The unobtrusive, internet address-based location service makes our graphics more friendly and inviting.         Data management     We employed clever hacks like using a content delivery network to mirror the state’s data and avoid expensive servers early in the project. Now we use a “serverless” GraphQL database that grows and shrinks based on our traffic. Because of our work with these technologies, we’ve been <a href=""https://hasura.io/events/hasura-con-2020/talks/hasuras-role-in-data-journalism/"">advocates for data journalism  in the broader tech world. "," Like any project, we had issues with dirty and incorrect data, like funky ZIP codes. The state kept moving the data and changing the format. We used plenty of shoe leather to confirm and understand the data.  But that’s why local organizations should invest in data reporters. We made the reporting calls and wrote the code.    The organizational backdrop of this project was stark and challenging. Like many others, we had to contend with the steadily deteriorating conditions faced in local news in the past year.   All three of the project’s originators have moved on to new jobs, and neither WBEZ or The Chicago Reporter (effectively closed since Sept. 2020) currently support it. Despite the troubles these venerable organizations are facing, they deserve recognition for launching and sustaining this project during a critical period.    Our continued persistence in spite of these conditions shows that our project is one of the best value propositions in journalism.   About 80% of our 1.2 million web users came from Illinois; we estimate that about 1 in 10 people in Illinois have seen our work. Hundreds of thousands in Spanish. Our donation campaigns did better when we talked about our commitment to meeting our audience where they are and open data. Our newsletters and social posts had better engagement when they included strong data visuals about the pandemic. Our work powered investigations, academic research, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/belmontcraginunited/posts/1483824208486790"">community discourse . ","The lessons from this project are systemic and organizational. Design matters In the internet world, journalists can skip writing multiple, disconnected stories about updates delivered at press conferences and instead consistently updated and accurate editorial products.That requires an investment in design, as different policies and numbers often require bespoke approaches. Our editorial products were built to be low-word (easily translatable) and fundamentally visual (easily shareable). Reach people where they are Our competition makes the user do a lot of work; we automatically locate you. In turn, we reached the most affected parts of the state. The highest traffic to our ZIP code map came from the ZIP codes most affected by COVID-19 and ZIP codes with the largest numbers of workers. Be there every day Our rock-solid technology and low operating costs means even now, thousands of people get clear, accurate information about COVID-19 in their community. And we created a real feedback loop with our community, including concerned citizens, health care experts, and local policymakers. Complement national news We offer a viable, local alternative to national coverage. As Amy Cesal said, ""National news and counts are overwhelming. I just want to know what's going on immediately near me. And the local news [sources] I read also use this one."" Practice radical generosity Over 16 publications used our data products.

Portugal,Público,Big,Shortlist,School success. These four municipalities row against the tide,27/07/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Illustration, Infographics, Chart","Animation, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio"," Using the data from the national exams and the percentage of poor students by municipality, I calculated the euclidean distance to a hypothetical place where all students were poor and yet had 20 out 20 on their national exams. That led us to four municipalities that contradicted the trend of a poorer environment meaning worse marks at school and talked with schools and local authorities to try to understand what was being done differently in those places. "," Every time the national exam results get published, it’s always the schools from richer areas that get highlighted by the media. Using this statistical approach - a bit more statistically complex than simply ordering columns in Excel - I was able to give a voice to schools that don't often get highlighted for their good work in very precarious conditions.  That also led to good critics of my piece, especially because every time this data is turned publically, the major criticism made to the media is that they always ignore socio-economic factors. "," The national exams database is a huge .mdb file that the Ministry of Education provides to the journalists under embargo. I’ve used R to read that database and build the excel file for other non-data savvy reporters that were working on other stories about this issue, highlighting possible stories.   Since the data on the database gives us the results for all students in the country, I’ve started to filter out the results for the eight exams with more students and grouping by municipality calculating the mean value for every municipality. Then, using the data about the percentage of students that the government provides some kind of aid because of their parents' income, I’ve created a scatter plot with that data and calculated, for every point, the distance to the point where 100% of the students were poor and had an average of 20 out of 20 on the national exams. That led us to the four municipalities that were the outliers (I’ve done the same for the previous year's data just to check if those municipalities were the outliers only by chance this year).  Then, and while I’ve talked with school directors and the mayors of those cities, I’ve used scrollama.js to build a scrollytelling piece where I could explain visually what led us to those schools and, as we presented the data from those places, the piece makes a social demographic explanation about the place and tells us about what is being done differently there. "," Even though education is a priority for our newspaper, the hardest part of this project was finding time to do it. With covid-19, almost all the newsroom resources seemed to be channeled to cover the pandemic. Being the only data journalist in the newsroom, it happened the same to me. So finding time to write about something that was not directly associated with the pandemic was hard. "," I would say that the biggest lesson here is that sometimes you just need to look to a database a bit differently to find a new story. This database is published every year, so naturally, everyone ends up getting similar stories. Adding a bit of statistical sophistication can lead you to new approaches.   Another lesson on this project is that I broke all rules or left the explanation about how we got to the story to the middle/end of the piece. Because explaining how we got to those four municipalities was essential to understanding why they were important, the infographic that changes through scroll started precisely there - to show why those places were important to have a look at.

"," For the first two stories, we scraped millions of interactions on Twitter by suspicious accounts to identify bot networks within them and uncover their origins. Data scraped included tweets, media posted, likes, accounts following and accounts followed. We stored this data in a postgresql database running on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We collected nearly 170GB of data for analysis (about 3GB of account activity and about 167 GB of media).   We used the Twitter API and twint, an open-source Twitter scraping API, to find and scrape millions of interactions by potential bots within the network. We analyzed the data that we had scraped using open source machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, xgboost and the Chinese language natural language processing library jieba. We did our network analysis of bot account networks using the library networkx and the visualization software gephi.   For the third story, we received a leak of more than 90GB of files, including secret government directives and memos, as well as contracts, documents and other media. We used computer scripts to generate a spreadsheet database from the thousands of directories within the file structure. This allowed our team to read and annotate the files collaboratively. "," It was infeasible to examine by hand each of the tens of thousands of accounts we scraped to determine if they are connected to the same scheme. Instead, we used machine learning to identify likely Chinese state-backed fake accounts based on profile information (e.g., account name, twitter handle, account age, profile picture, etc.) and account behavior (e.g., timing, frequency and language of posts, retweeting and liking activity, etc.). We labelled hundreds of known fake and real accounts by hand and used that information to build a machine learning model that could analyze data from an account it had not seen before and assess the likelihood that it was also fake. We then sampled and checked our results by hand. This process allowed us to identify more than 10,000 similar inauthentic accounts with suspected links to the Chinese government.        It is also often difficult to connect a fake network with its ultimate operators. In this case, we combined our data analysis with reporting to link a 2,000 account bot network to a Chinese internet PR company hired by state media.

Additional publication dates:     18-05-2020   08-06-2020   24-07-2020   26-10-2020   31-08-2020   12-12-2020  "," By shining a quantitative light on the punitive methods used by landlords and debt collectors to extract money from the poor during the pandemic, our reporting triggered local and national changes.   In response to our reporting about evictions filed in violation of the CARES Act, landlords dismissed more than 100 eviction cases that they had illegally filed against tenants. While reporting this story, it became clear that many tenants were confused as to whether their property was covered under the new law, so we built an app to help renters determine if they were covered by the federal ban.

We also geocoded and linked data sets (including court cases, lists of federally-backed properties and parcel map files) together using PostGIS, Mapbox and Vue.js to analyze illegal eviction filings.       Our database resulted in an interactive news app where readers could look up whether they were covered by the CARES Act and state eviction moratoria, as well as to find properties with large numbers of eviction filings during the pandemic. We used Postgres to store the data and ran queries in SQL and Pandas to analyze the data for various stories. Plaintiff names were extensively cleaned using regular expressions and text clustering in OpenRefine. "," It was a significant technical challenge to coordinate scrapers made by multiple people for multiple court websites to run weekly and create an accurate and up-to-date picture of debt and eviction cases filed in counties across the country. We made a suite of in-house tools and processes for doing so in a uniform fashion. Still, each had to be hand-crafted and vetted for completeness and accuracy, and entailed speaking with legal and housing experts on the ground across the country to understand each unique court system and local context.        Additionally, our decision to link data together to analyze evictions at the building and ownership level gave us a unique tool -- one that, to our knowledge, no other organization has -- that allowed us to publish unique insights on eviction practices during the initial waves of the pandemic.

Our story let the reader explore how much it would cost for them to live somewhere than where they currently live. It’s true that housing prices are high in the capital, Helsinki, but e.g. taxes and the cost of a car vs public transportation can be much higher in a small countryside municipality. Our story takes these and much more into account and calculates exactly the amount of money they’d have at their disposal if they moved to another town or municipality in Finland.  "," For an individual, the decision on where they live is a crucial one. Cost of living varies hugely around Finland. However, comparing different places is easier said than done. Housing prices, housing taxes, community taxes, transportation fees, fees for visiting doctor and e.g. the need to own a car varies hugely from municipality to municipality. Furthermore, the average salaries differ from place to place. White collar workers earn more in Helsinki than elsewhere but for nurses or factory workers the difference is not so big.     Our ground-breaking story took all these and more into account. The reader was asked to fill basic information about themselves and then our story calculated where in Finland they would have the most and the least money left after compulsory expenses.    Our story helped 175000 of our readers to evaluate where they would make most out of their money.  "," All this was made possible with the unique concept of changing story designed by Helsingin Sanomat. The story changes with the selection that reader makes, in this case by filling in information about their current home town, salary, house size, transportation preferencies etc. The story was coded with the javascript framework Vue.js.    For the story we acquired many different data sets, eg about housing prices, public transportation, doctor visits and taxes with different income levels in different municipalities.  ", The hardest part was to make the big picture and standardise costs: so many things affect on the cost of living. It was also hard was to get enough data for each municipality. We needed to do a lot of adjustments and manual work for small municipalities , It’s often very fruitful to combine the personal and general level in one story. Along to the reader specific data in the story there was general information on society level and the interviews of two persons living in different parts of Finland.

Even though the Finnish Immigration Service offers some data in their data portal it does not answer the basic question here: of those who came to Finland, how many have been granted an asylum, how many have been deported, how many are still in the process etc.     We finally got the data from the officials but the numbers don’t exactly add up in the end. That is because the number of people we know from 2015 is counted in persons but officials now count decisions – and one person can have multiple decisions made about him/her.     This said, we still managed to show the big picture.  ", Sometimes it is a good idea to check back on things that were big news in the past. This is especially true about data journalism using data from official sources because usually it takes time before the data is available.     Returning to a major news topic after few years can bring new light to the whole topic.

"," The underlying model was hard coded from scratch using javascript before being pulled into an HTML page and styled using CSS. We were also able to use javascript to isolate some set parameters to show visual comparisons side by side, such as the various immunity levels.    We also batch processed 100,000 runs of the simulation locally to give a comprehensive sample of outcomes, allowing us to accurately show where the herd immunity range fell. We were then able to create some separate SVG static graphics from this data to present in the page as part of the explanation.    We also decided to host the full model at the foot of the page which let's readers adjust parameters in real time for a reactive experience. "," There was no easy part to this project. However, two main challenges stood out above the rest.      Accuracy of an epidemic model   There are a number of variables which can be inserted into an equation to allow an outcome. The challenge for us was to carefully select data which fairly represented the virus and strike a balance between a model which was unrealistically simple and overly complicated, potentially introducing a wider opportunity for error. We then had to make sure all of the behavioral elements between the variables were correct, including social interventions like wearing masks and social distancing.    We worked with epidemiologists and mathematical modeling academics for months to ensure our model was as accurate and realistic as possible, while also making clear the simulation is based on set parameters and assumptions. We also added the interactive at the bottom of the page to allow these parameters to be adjusted.      Running in the browser   Another challenge was ensuring smooth delivery in the browser while hundreds of thousands of calculations are being made live.  "," Sometimes if there is little or no hard data available on a subject, it may be an opportunity to make something completely new and provide a service to readers. It can be a daunting task to build something like this from scratch, especially when a team doesn't have in-house expertise in epidemiology.

We found that Twinmark relied heavily on its partner Facebook pages to amplify content from its sites and increase clicks. Facebook took action and removed some Twinmark-linked pages and accounts, but only after the issue was raised with them. "," The data-driven investigative piece unearthed the loopholes in Facebook’s system and how these are being used by the same groups/companies/websites that the tech company took down for coordinated inauthentic behavior.   The story also brought to public attention the tactics they use in finding their way back to business, gaining fake engagement, and spreading propaganda and mis/disinformation. My story led to better understanding of the issue among Filipinos, something crucial as we approach a presidential election.   Twinmark and its network have been instrumental in spreading hate, propaganda, and disinformation since 2016. In the run up to the 2022 presidential election, this poses even greater threats to our struggling democracy.   Ultimately, because of my story, Facebook took down several accounts and pages mentioned, thereby confirming results of our months long investigation. "," We used our own social media monitoring tool, which monitors publicly available posts on Facebook, to keep track of the accounts' history of activity. I also closely monitored specific users, accounts and websites daily for almost 5 months. On top of this, I created a database using website identifiers to link the new and previously taken down websites.   A verified internal Twinmark database also provided an added layer of verification for the connections I identified.    I then used Flourish to display the connections among websites, and Facebook accounts and pages so the audience can further understand the ties. "," The most difficult part in doing this project was determining the exact links between:       Old Twinmark websites that were banned by Facebook and the new websites that either skirted the takedown or were created after the ban       Facebook accounts and the new Twinmark websites      Another difficult part was determining the real people behind these accounts and websites. They really tried to hide in anonymity, learning from their mistakes before the first Facebook takedown in 2019.    But we were able to identify them using a variety of methods: through our own social media monitoring tool, their website identifiers, manual monitoring of suspected accounts for 5 months, and through interviews with at least two former Twinmark employees and one Facebook page administrator.   The nominated article should be selected for the award because of how it used social media data to seek accountability from Facebook and for continuously shedding the light on the fight against disinformation in the country. "," While social media data are publicly available, analyzing them could be difficult and complicated. Despite this, the story proves that constant tracking of publicly available posts can help track and fight disinformation.   Millions of Filipinos are on Facebook. It’s practically our Internet. Because of this, the platform has become the real estate of choice by organized disinformation campaigns in the Philippines, including that of the state, even before it was used in the West.   It is critical for the media to learn, unearth, and make the public aware of the different disinformation and propaganda strategies, and to consistently do such stories so as not to drop the ball.   In a way, the story held power, including Facebook, to account. After we broke the story, Facebook took down the offspring of the original networks that were shuttered.   Despite this, we continue to ask: What else should be done?   We continue to do similar stories especially as we prepare for our 2022 presidential elections.   Using data obtained for this project, a colleague and I are currently working on a follow up story which investigates the roles of Filipino celebrities and influencers in disinformation.

Kyrgyzstan,https://kloop.kg/,Small,Winner,"""I would have killed her anyway"". Kloop's investigation of femicide in Kyrgyzstan",17/12/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Women, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python"," Our project investigates   femicide in Kyrgyzstan . Its uniqueness is that before us nobody has ever conducted any studies on women’s murders, what are the patterns of those murders and what are the grounds behind femicide in the country. Using the data we collected from various sources, we proved that women’s killings are the primary consequence of systematic domestic violence. Women are rarely being murdered outside their home, and the majority of murderers are their intimate partners. Our project tells the stories of women, provides an open-source database of femicides available for download and describes the policy response from the state. "," Our project is not just the data-journalism project, but a complete comprehensive research. The impact of it includes:       We, first of all, introduced the term “femicide” into the media space not just in Kyrgyzstan, but in Central Asia. Before our research was presented, the mass-media was predominantly covering the cases of domestic violence, rarely paying attention to femicide itself. Not just mass-media, but also NGO and research institutes, whose focus is gender equality, have systematically studied the problem of femicide. The data on women’s murders was not publicly opened, even the number of such murders was hidden from the public.        The project has resonated both in Kyrgyzstan and other Central Asian countries. It had received solid media coverage, it was presented in a number of round tables on domestic violence and it was highlighted by the UNWomen Kyrgyzstan, Soros Foundation and a number of feminist organizations.        We have disseminated our findings among several members of parliament and governmental bodies, however, as the project was published in late December 2020, we have not been able to receive any reaction yet.        We have published our research findings as a separate study (in Russian and Kyrgyz languages), and as a longread in online media outlet kloop.kg (in three languages: Russian, Kyrgyz and English.   Please note, that the original publication is dated December 17, 2020. Only the English translation was published later on January 28, 2021. For English translation please see ""Project link 2"" ). The article took 47 place by the number of unique viewers, and the average time spent on the article was almost 6 minutes. This is almost six times longer than the average time for other articles. The facebook coverage was 38,000 users, which is quite unique for our media outlet.     ","   In total we spent 6 months on the project.         We first developed the methodology, based on literature review and existing research on femicide in Georgia, Spain, Latin America etc. Generally femicide is the murder of a woman, usually committed by a man on the basis of misogyny, gender discrimination, and/or as a result of gender-based violence in which the state is complicit. So to properly define the term “femicide” we have come up with at least 12 criteria, by which a woman’s murder can be considered as femicide. For example, the “classic” femicide is murder of a woman by her husband because she was disobeying. Other criteria include murders because she refuses to consent, she was murdered with particular cruelty, she was socially-vulnerable etc.        To understand the femicide patterns we analysed news. We have scraped more than 54,000 of news articles from the largest news agency in Kyrgyzstan. These news also contained press-releases of the law enforcement bodies.        To narrow down our analysis we have identified around 80 words and sentences in accordance with the previously developed femicide criteria. This let us identify news and press releases that covered the women’s murders.        We then analyse more than 3,000 of news in details to identify femicide. As a result we were able to surely define at least 300 women’s murders as femicide during the past ten years. We have created a detailed database, containing the description of each case.        We have calculated the coefficient of femicide (number of women's murders per 100,000 of women) to provide international comparisons. We have also studied criminal statistics to find the “hidden” femicide and to understand the dynamics of women's murders.        Techniques: Python, Scraping, Analysis in Python and Google spreadsheets, data visualization in Flourish.studio, storytelling in Infogram.  "," One of the main difficulty was to analyse each murder to comply with the femicide criteria. The database was created from scratch, we had to constantly update it every time a new detail of the murder was found.    The other difficulty was that any official statistics on women’s murders is not publicly available. We were struggling with bureaucracy to send inquiries to the Ministry of the Internal Affairs, The General Prosecutor’s Office etc. and to get replies from them. The Ministry of the Internal Affairs does not want to connect domestic violence to femicide and they have completely denied our interview requests and ignored us.    It was also quite difficult to research the topic in general, because there are no experts in the country on femicide. We had to extensively search through the literature, find international experts to make sure we understand the topic and can explain it to our audience in a simple and intelligible way. The Kyrgyz society is a conservative and has a traditionalist culture, therefore anything that contains the prefix “fem” is immediately rejected.     However, we believe that we had overcome this and did our job very well.  "," We believe that our methodology is well-developed and journalists are welcome to use it for monitoring femicide in their countries. The methodology can be used by any beginner data-journalist.    We also encourage journalists to use our femicide database for writing their own stories. The database we created, contains full description of the location and date of the murder, the age of both victim and murderer, their initials, the type of a femicide, relation of the victim to the murderer, injures, type of punishment etc.    Despite the wide prevalence of femicide in the world, not every country recognizes it as a separate problem. Legislation in Central Asain countries, for example, does not distinguish murders of males and females. We however find it especially important that femicide should be introduced in legislation as a separate term, because the causes of women’s killings are completely different and are based on existing gender stereotypes and discrimination. We hope that our project can help journalists and other stakeholders to start systematically researching femicide and introduce it widely in their narratives.     We believe that telling about the problem is one of the ways to solve it.

Finland,Helsingin Sanomat HS.fi,Big,Shortlist,We know who you are dating,24/01/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration, Infographics, Lifestyle",Microsoft Excel," The phone’s dating apps know almost everything about their user: where you are, who you’re communicating with, what music you’re listening to, and even what you’re aroused about. We, together with an American news channel NBC News, went through the most popular dating apps, compared which data each of them collects, looked where the data ends up and what that data can cause in the wrong hands. When you are looking for love, the data privacy risks are not what you are thinking when agreeing on the terms of use.  "," It was an eye-opener for many. Dating apps, and all the tips you find online concerning to use of dating apps, tell you that more info you share about yourself, more accurate partner you can find. The story shows how security risks increase, the more data you share, and also how your data is being sold.  The terms of use can be 19 pages long. The story explains, what does those 19 pages actually mean.  "," To be able to see which data each dating app collects, we had to make an account for each dating app. Then we started to collect info from the apps to an excel. We also did a non-scientific “stalking test”: we tried to find out, how easy it is to identify people based on the dating app account. For this test we took the first three matches from each app we used. Then we did what any curious person would do: we googled them. We used Google image search and traditional Google search. 8 out of 9 of our matches we were able to identify with this methodology, even the dating app account often only shows the first name and pictures.  "," Tricky part was to make the dating app profiles, because there are restrictions, which kind of fake id’s you can use as a journalist. Our accounts had to be “human” enough, but not misleading too much. We wanted matches, but not to get involved.    But the really hard part was to read all the data privacy policies and terms of use and to really understand what they mean.

United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,Shortlist,How safe is it for you to cycle to work?,28/08/20,"Solutions journalism, Open data, News application, Chart, Map","Personalisation, Json, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap","  The Times and The Sunday Times  has championed cycling safety for years, ever since it launched the “cities fit for cycling” campaign in 2012. In our latest contribution we produced an interactive series which allows readers to compare the safety of their own cycle journeys with the national average as well as with possible alternative routes.   Readers can input a starting position and a destination and calculate how many traffic crashes have been recorded by police en route. The tool is informed by data from the Stats19 database, a record of every vehicle crash kept by the Department of Transport. "," The series ran at the top of the website from midday to midnight on August 28. It reached over 70,000 people over the next few days and scored well against internal engagement metrics.        The wealth of data underpinning the tool led to multiple news stories and a joint Times and Sunday Times series investigating cycling safety.   We combined the national accidents database with census data to determine the most popular start and end points for commuting by bike. The research showed that the overwhelming majority of crashes happened at junctions.   It demonstrated the scale of the challenge facing the government as it promises a “cycling and walking revolution”, with campaigners telling the Times that the findings showed ministers needed to spend more to deliver on their pledge to make travelling by bike safer.   We spoke to Victoria Lebrec who was on her way to work in London when she was crushed beneath a lorry that failed to spot her at a junction. She lost a leg in the accident and told the Times she wanted to see fully segregated cycle lanes to protect riders. A year after Ms Lebrec’s accident a 26-year-old woman was killed at the nearby Bank junction by a left-turning lorry.   The analysis also revealed that Oxford and Cambridge, two of the country’s most notoriously cycle-friendly cities, were home to the most high-risk stretches of road for commuters.   We also used the database to analyse more than 36,0000 weekend cycling accidents over the past decade, revealing that weekend cyclists racing against the clock could be pedalling into greater danger than the average commuter. "," The data was initially cleaned, reformatted and analysed using R, a statistical programming language.    We wanted the interactive to be constructive as well as informative so we used the Mapbox API to return three journeys. Each route was ranked based on the number of fatal, severe and slight crashes that had happened the past three years, with the journey time and crashes per 1,000 miles providing additional detail. How the options compare to the 2,000 most popular routes in Britain is displayed on a violin plot to provide a national comparison.   The tool uses data from the Stats19 database, a comprehensive record of every vehicle crash kept by the Department of Transport. This was cleaned, reformatted and analysed using R, a statistical programming language.   This analysis is done on-the-fly in the reader’s browser using a javascript library called Turf.JS. It generates a buffer area around the route and uses point-in-polygon analysis to match geocoded incidents in the data. These are stored in a MySQL API.     The dashboard was built in vanilla javascript to make the time between searching and results displaying as quick as possible. "," Our main technical challenge was keeping loading times down when analysing data in the browser. We were able to create a workable solution by putting the data behind an API, going without D3 to keep visualisations simple, and taking time to think about the user experience of waiting for results to return. "," We wanted to build a consumer tool which would provide useful information a cyclist could use whenever planning a journey. It would need to be something they could return to and reuse. With this in mind, we made sure to return three possible routes so that users could make an informed choice.   Our community does not shy away from the topic of cyclists and their status on the road; it is one they engage with wholeheartedly. Our goal was to encourage their discussion and inform a constructive debate.    By presenting the information as simply as possible, providing useful context, and offering more than one answer to the question we had posed, our tool was extensive enough so that it did not stand in the way of debate by being too limited or offering simplified answers which could jar with our readers experiences.

","   The hardest part was going through over 9,000 entries of fact checks from hundreds of organizations around the world. Although the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) provides a database, Rappler had to clean the raw data from it and process it to more effectively show the gravitas of the infodemic, particularly in the Philippines.

Chile,La Tercera,Big,Shortlist,Del 1 al 10 mil: Cómo Santiago se transformó en una de las ciudades con más muertos por covid-19 (From 1 to 10 thousand: How Santiago became one of the cities with most deaths by covid-19),11/09/20,"Explainer, Open data, Infographics, Map, Health","Scraping, Canvas, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, PostGIS, Node.js"," Considering confirmed and suspected deaths, in September the capital of Chile was reaching 10.000 deceases, placing Santiago as one of the cities with the most deaths from the pandemic in the world, exceeding a thousand deaths per million inhabitants.  We decided to address this with a visualization week by week. As the users scroll down, they see a map of Santiago filling with red and blue points, each for every death, explaining also the most important events of that week. In the end, the map is almost no visible for so many points, which is very shocking. "," We had 20,000 unique visitors in the next weeks after publishing our interactive. It was very commented on social media, highlighting “the impact” of seeing illustrated all the people who died and setting a record about passing the 10 thousand deaths (a number not everyone was aware of). “It distresses you a bit, but it's a very good way to graph it”, someone said on Twitter. We published it during the weekend of our national holiday, stressing the fact of how important was that we all took care of ourselves and we hope it helped at least a bit.  Our main goal with this project was to show a really big number, a data hard to visualize for people, in a way they could “see it”.  How to show, in more than a number, all the persons who died in just around seven months. In that sense, the week by week advance of the scrolling worked quite well, seeing every week more and more points in the maps. We also keep “fixed” in the upper side of the web a score of the number of people dying, which was also increasing every week. We believe this system helped readers to really understand the severity of the casualties. "," We used GatsbyJS, P5.js, ReactJS, GraphQL, WordPress (headless).   We first did the canvas part with P5.js drawing the Great Santiago area with segmented custom topojson files with the “comunas” delimiter and their correspondent centroid. That allows us to group little spots around that point programmatically.   Then we took the scraped data ordered by “comuna” (comune), date and other statistical data into a CSV file (gender, COVID-confirmed, or assumed by close contact), and we load it next to our P5.js drawing. Then we took our P5.js static development into a ReactJS component, sorting the passing days data with additional data fetched by headless WordPress custom meta consumed by Gatsby’s graphql.  With a scroll-aware listener, we were able to sync weeks with week-to-week data through a React useState, painting the corresponding real numbers into our P5 canvas, giving the actual scale of the death toll to our user according to the scroll pass by. "," The hardest part of the project was to decide the graphic layout to show the data. We draw and iterate different options for showing the deaths in the maps and the increase during the time (for example, to make circles of points for each commune or to show the point in a more distributed way. We also tried a lot of ways to build a “dialogue” between the text and the graphics. In the end, we choose what we thought caused more impact on the user.  Another hard aspect was the scrolling and make it work as we wanted, with smooth transitions between weeks.  We worked with a freelance data scientist and a designer, and the rest of the work was developed for 3 editors and our front developer. It took us more time than expected because we almost did it in our “spare” time (we regret nothing). I think our bosses didn’t understand and value what we did until they saw it, which confirms our initial assumption, that this was very difficult to realize how harsh the data were until you see it. "," What we most enjoy about working on projects like this is working in an interdisciplinary team in a very horizontal way. We learn so much from the data scientist comments and suggestions, the same from the designer and of course, our front developer who's always looking for better ways to improve the user experience.  This is the kind of project where journalists can expand their knowledge about visual journalism, which is more important every day. Because one thing is the data, and journalists can be very good at gather, process and write about it, but sometimes, especially in these times, that is not enough.  ",https://interactivo.latercera.com/muertos-covid-santiago/muertos-covid-santiago-data/,,,,,,,,"Álex, Acuña.

United States,The Markup,Small,Shortlist,Blacklight,22/09/20,"Investigation, News application, Fact-checking, OSINT, Business","Scraping, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js"," Blacklight is a work of experiential journalism that allows people to investigate the state of web privacy in real time and on their own terms. Blacklight instantly reveals the potential privacy violations on any website—and names the companies tracking you.    The tool was used for a companion investigative story, which examined the role of free website building tools in inserting trackers on small, unsuspecting websites, including those that serve vulnerable populations. "," Nearly one million people had used Blacklight to scan websites by early January, just a few months after we’d released it. Some have reached out to us to say they used the results to pressure the organizations they work for or websites they frequent to remove tracking technologies. At its height, when it was featured on the front page of Reddit, Blacklight was conducting more than 300 user-initiated scans every minute.    Many website operators contacted for the “The High Privacy Cost of a ‘Free’ Website” investigation removed user-tracking technology from their sites after we brought it to their attention—including several government webpages. Other website operators tweeted about doing it on their own after reading our story and scanning their site.    One smaller search engine even incorporated Blacklight, the code of which we published open-source, into its own product, allowing users to scan a featured site on the search results page before visiting. Some people are using Blacklight to scan the sites they rely on—and calling them out on Twitter for their ad-based tracking.   Reporters from Forbes, The Logic, and Vox used Blacklight to scan their employers’ sites and wrote about the results and how user tracking is employed in advertising-funded news operations. And a computational journalism class at Stanford has incorporated Blacklight into the syllabus.   Congresswoman Anna Eshoo, who represents Silicon Valley, wrote a letter to The Markup saying, ""While companies that profit from surveillance capitalism may be upset by your decision, I stand in full support of this tool.""    "," Blacklight was written in Node.js and relies on AWS’s Lambda, S3, and Cloudfront services. Using this combination of tools allowed us to build a real-time website privacy inspector that was very precise—the Node.js puppeteer module gave us full control over a browser to run our tests—and is also easy to scale to user demand. Blacklight has never gone down, even when it was receiving more than 300 requests a minute.     The privacy tests the tool runs were designed using existing research to study the techniques used by tracking scripts, then programmatically scraping thousands of websites to find instances of these techniques. This approach ensured that we were testing for things seen in the real world, not just in academic papers.     In addition, we tried to account for how Blacklight might be abused by malicious actors. For this reason we cache results for 24-48 hours on S3 so we’re not hitting the same website more than once a day.      The analysis and raw data on which the results are based can be downloaded from the tool, so that it can be used by journalists, researchers and others.    "," We faced several technical challenges. This tool required a lot of development for both the data collection and the analysis.    First, we had to determine how to measure the various potential privacy invasions of a website and also explain them in ways that were both precise and easy for a non-technical audience to understand. Second, we had to do a lot of testing to ensure we were getting accurate results for a large variety of websites and tracking vendors. We ended up collecting data for more than two million websites.    Blacklight carries out sophisticated tests, but it’s open-source code was written to be accessible to both professional and beginner programmers. We wanted to ensure technically literate folks could use the tool for their own purposes.   We also faced the challenge of explaining the privacy violations—and the role various companies played—in ways that were both accurate and understandable to a general audience.    "," Blacklight was a tool made, first and foremost, by journalists for journalists. We developed it to support our investigation “The High Privacy Cost of a ‘Free’ Website.” Since launch, a number of newsrooms have already used it for their own stories, including Forbes and Vox. A computational journalism class at Stanford University is launching a project this semester using Blacklight.   When it comes to online tracking, we talk a lot about the data and not enough about the companies that are deploying invasive practices to collect that data.

Landowners have already registered claims for more than 2,000 private properties in indigenous areas, including some that are home to isolated peoples. Indigenous groups, civil society organizations, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office and state prosecutors have denounced the statute and are challenging it in various courts.  ","   This journalistic investigation shone light to the consequences of a new policy that facilitated the escalating process of invasion of indigenous lands in the Amazon - which has become an even bigger problem with the Covid-19 pandemic, putting the lives of the indigenous populations in the Amazon at greater risk.

","   This project examined three public databases: FUNAI's Indigenous Lands Mapping; private properties registered in the national Rural Environmental Registry system [Cadastro Ambiental Rural, CAR]; and private properties certified by Sigef, the national Land Management System. For the purpose of this data-crossing, we took into account only the unratified indigenous lands, seeing that the new statute issued by the national agency for indigenous affairs authorized the certification of private properties inside these lands. From the CAR database, we considered only the rural properties located in municipalities where indigenous territories exist. From the database of private properties registered in the Sigef, we only took into account those properties which were certified and authorized. The results showed where the selected areas overlapped with indigenous territories. The entire survey took into consideration the eight states of the Legal Amazon region, plus part of the northeast state of Maranhão. We used free data editing programs such as Libreoffice, QGIS and Open Refine and design programs for data visualization such as Illustrator and Photoshop.  ","   The CAR database hasn't been consolidated all over Brazil yet, so we needed to collect the databases from each municipality.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Shortlist,"Tracking the excess deaths in Spain, day by day",31/03/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Breaking news, Chart, Health","D3.js, JQuery, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio"," In the last 100 years more than 12,000 people died in Spain in a week until the coronavirus crisis. An investigation by elDiario.es with individual data of more than 15 million registered deaths from 1975 showed that Covid-19 led Spain to the worst mortality crisis in its democratic history. A mortality figure that far exceeds the official deaths by coronavirus published by the Government. This publication is being updated every week.  "," This project compiled for the first time the historical mortality figures from civil registries for the last 45 years. At the worst moment of the crisis, while some public figures still spreading the idea that Covid-19 was a simple flu, this story showed that Spain was registering more deaths than ever during the democratic history of Spain. Measuring the excess mortality shown to be one of the most accurate ways to show real effect of the pandemic while there where thousands of citizend dying of Covid-19 without a positive PCR test. In this information, our readers wree able to see for the first time the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on mortality in their region compared to the last 45 years. The information was updated week after week (and continues to be updated) throughout the epidemic.    This project was one of the most read of the year in elDiario.es and also one of the one that made most people suscribe and pay for elDiario.es during the year, according to our statistics.  "," R, Rstudio and Excel for data compiling and data analyisis. Datawrapper, D3.js, Javascript and Flourish for data visualization. "," The hardest part of the project was combining the historical mortality databases of the National Institute of Statistics and the most recent mortality figures published by the civil registries. For example, it was necessary to combine the individual microdata of more than 15 million deaths registered between 1975 and 2019, which were incorporated at each moment with a different structure. Later, these figures were combined with data from MoMo, the early warning system for excess mortality, which includes 93% of the Spanish territory with the digitized system, and both databases had to be harmonized to make them as comparable as possible. In addition, most of the processes had to be automated to allow them to be updated quickly one or several times each week.    "," During the pandemic data journalist faced a complication, even most of the countries were actively publishing of registered deaths of coronavirus, all of this data showed subregister. Goverments were only incluiding deaths by coronavirus as the ones of people that had positive test for coronavirus, these means that people that died without hospital attention were not being registered or if they died without a PCR test.    This publication show a metholodogy on how data journalist can use historical death registers to really calculate how many people in dying during the pandemic.

United States,The Markup,Small,Shortlist,Google The Giant,28/07/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, Infographics, Politics, Business","Animation, Personalisation, Scraping, Json, CSV, Python"," For this groundbreaking investigation into Google’s flagship product, Google Search, we used novel computational techniques to expose how the company routinely boosts its own products, pushing down “organic” search results leading to other websites.    "," The findings of this investigation and a follow-up story informed debate in Washington and a congressional antitrust committee’s calls for wide-ranging regulation of the tech giant and its brethren.      The facts we uncovered were cited in all three antitrust lawsuits filed against Google by the Department of Justice and state attorneys general last year. The Department of Justice’s historic antitrust lawsuit alleged that Google ""has pushed the organic links further and further down the results page” and referenced training documents we obtained with specific instructions to Google employees to avoid using phrases like “market share” and “dominant.”      Another suit, filed by 10 states led by the attorney general of Texas, referred to Google's ""walled garden,"" while another lawsuit, filed by 38 states led by the attorneys general from Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, and Tennessee, emphasized how Google redirects search traffic to itself.      Our findings were also cited as proof that Google had built a “walled garden,” during the questioning of Google CEO Sundar Pichai at a congressional antitrust hearing with the nation’s four tech giants. The final report from the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee’s year-long investigation into big tech also mentioned our work as evidence of Google’s monopolistic behavior.     "," We scraped Google Trends to source the top search queries for all available categories (business, entertainment, science and technology, sports, and top stories) every six hours for two months. To do this, we had to reverse engineer Google’s client-side API by listening to network requests in the browser’s “Dev Tools,” copying the cURL request, and retrofitting it to operate as a standalone API.     We then used these search queries to perform Google searches on a mobile emulator we created using Selenium. Like the search queries, we maintained this continuous data collection for two months.     We processed the data using BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Selenium (more on this step in the next question).     We drafted static figures, using Matplotlib, that were ultimately made in JavaScript.      Due to the experimental nature of our project, we had rigorous error checking and validation. We used the drawing library p5.js to automatically annotate screenshots with bounding boxes indicating the space occupied by Google elements and our other categories (more on this categorization scheme in the next question). We used the annotation software Prodigy to record the precision and accuracy of bounding boxes determined by our parsers.    "," Developing parsers for Google Search required intimate domain knowledge and innovative technology.     There is no existing taxonomy of the enormous variety of results delivered in response to a Google search. We created a classification system that was robust and general enough to apply to all mobile Google search results. This process required four months of research, interviews, and sifting through troves of source code.      We then had to encode this knowledge into automated web parsers. It took months longer to build a total of 68 unique parsers spanning more than 1,000 lines of code to identify elements in our five-category classification system: Google answers, Google products, non-Google, Ads, and AMP.     Much of this process overlapped with our time spent developing our classification system, for a total of more than six months for both.     Still we weren’t done. We had a unique need for our story: to measure the placement and prominence of each of these categories of search results. To quantify this unique spatial data, we created a novel web parsing technique—inspired by the biology lab assay—that “stains” the area occupied by elements in each of our five categories.      We achieved this by leveraging the xpath of elements categorized in our parsers and re-rendering the parsed search pages in the Selenium mobile emulator. This yielded spatial metadata (coordinates and dimensions) for categorized web elements, which allowed us to quantify Google’s self-preferential treatment of its own properties.    "," Our project highlights three important lessons for other journalists:       Build your own datasets       Be mindful about what you’re counting       Be honest about your limitations       Accountability journalism depends on evidence. But when you write about private companies, as we do, information is particularly difficult to obtain. For instance, Google has no incentive to quantify how much space it is devoting to its own products on the search results page. And most independent analysis we had found was sparse or anecdotal data from search engine optimization consultants.    We firmly believe that building your own dataset is essential to service journalism. We hope that our multi-step data collection processes will inspire other newsrooms to devote the time, resources, and leadership support to build their own datasets.    However, even a made-to-order dataset is not necessarily story-ready. The most basic unit of what to count might not be clearly stated as a column in the dataset. Instead, we need to do what all journalists do: interviews and research. This applies to not only talking to people, but also talking to data so that you fully understand the elements and the architecture.    We were able to build our classification system through acquiring both intimate domain knowledge and an understanding of the structure of the search results page. This is how we were able to accurately count something that has never before been quantified.   Lastly, we hope that our Limitations section encourages other journalists to prioritize accuracy and honest conversations over big numbers and shocking statistics. We think it is of the utmost importance to disclose the shortcomings of projects and be precise about the claims that can be inferred from our findings. In this project, we achieved this in part by seeking feedback from computer scientists, statisticians, and industry professionals regarding the methods we were using.

United States,NBC News,Big,Citation,The deadly secret of China's invisible armada,22/07/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Documentary, Database, Open data, Infographics, Video, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Economy","Animation, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, Python"," For years, the Sea of Japan has held a grisly mystery: the bodies of hundreds of skeletal North Korean squid fishermen have washed ashore in Japan, their boats battered and drifting for months. Japanese police chalked it up to climate change and declining squid populations, but NBC News figured out the true reason, revealing through text and interactive graphics something extremely significant about the balance of power in the waters of the region. "," Using new satellite data, confirmed by his own visit to the region, investigative reporter Ian Urbina discovered that China was sending a previously invisible armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in North Korean waters. The Chinese boats violently displaced the much smaller and more decrepit North Korean boats, and collected so much squid that fishing stocks declined more than 70 percent.   Working with a group of data scientists and academic researchers, Urbina was the first journalist to describe what one expert called “the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation’s waters.” The fishing fleet is also in violation of U.N. sanctions that prohibit foreign fishing in North Korean waters.   Urbina’s work documented China’s willingness to use its maritime muscle in the region with impunity, noting that China has the world’s worst score when it comes to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The country’s fishing boats are famously aggressive, often armed and known for ramming competitors or foreign patrol vessels.   But his story was not just about geopolitics; it had an important human side. So many North Koreans have disappeared at sea in recent years because of the Chinese fleets that some North Korean port towns are now called “widows’ villages.” The economies of even South Korean ports have been damaged by the collapse of the squid harvests, thanks to the huge Chinese mechanized boats. "," To make this complex story more accessible to readers, NBC News prepared a series of remarkable graphics to accompany it. One animated map created by national interactive journalist Jiachuan Wu, used satellite technology to show the path of Chinese vessels as they left port, sailed around the Korean peninsula, and moved into North Korean waters. Another focused on two boats in particular, documenting with precise timing when they left China, when they illegally turned off their transponders, and when they moved into the North’s waters, matched with photographic evidence of their presence.   The data analysis was done using a combination of Python and Qgis. We cleaned the coordinates data with Python and looked for the narratives through all signal points after mapping them out in Qgis. The entire 2018 Automatic Identification System(AIS) routes data is a pretty large dataset with daily entries, which is not ideal for a user’s loading experience. To improve this front-end performance, animations in the story were created using Qgis and later produced to timelapse animation. We exported for desktop and mobile users with a reasonable and legible file size. To show the reader that Chinese lighting vessels are significantly brighter than those of North Korea, we looked for a real satellite image and later compared it with a brightness data map with lighting vessels highlighted. The side-by-side real image and data map shows clearly that at same time, brighter Chinese vessels were actively fishing illegally in the NK water zone.   Urbina also collaborated with NBC video journalist Marshall Crook on a video that showed the huge fleets and the massive lights they use to attract squid, in comparison to the much smaller wooden boats used by the rural North Korean fishermen, hundreds of which have washed ashore in Japan bearing corpses. "," Breaking down large datasets to tell a story in a compelling way — especially when based on a subject our readers aren’t familiar with — was a challenge in and of itself. From a visual standpoint, we wanted to convey the complex research result and methodology to the reader that the vessels detected in North Korea’s water are Chinese vessels. We were able to tell that through several datasets carrying signal coordinates and lighting positions from fishing trawlers detected by satellites. The data showed that vessels departed from China’s seaport, entering the NK water zone, fishing during the night, and eventually going back to China’s seaport. To make this clear to the reader throughout the visual, we started by showing an overview of vessels routes in 2018, along with a step-by-step visual presentation overlaying locations from satellite view and data map view for two specific vessels. "," Not every story needs to be fully text based. Clear, comprehensive visualizations can help readers understand a complicated subject and more journalists would benefit from embracing this form of storytelling.  ",https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/china-illegal-fishing-fleet/,https://www.nbcnews.com/video/-ghost-boats-how-a-secret-chinese-fishing-fleet-is-killing-north-korean-fishermen-88130117858,,,,,,,"Ian Urbina, Jiachuan Wu, Marshall Crook, Elise Wrabetz, Fábio Nascimento","   Ian Urbina,  a former investigative reporter for The New York Times, is the director of The Outlaw Ocean Project, a non-profit journalism organization based in Washington that focuses on reporting about environmental and human rights crimes at sea.

In the past year, dozens of cases related to the movement move through the courts daily, yet it is hard to understand the impact and the extent of the legal crackdown that protesters faced. In this series, our reporters recorded details from every case that concluded since the movement began, totaling over 600 charges, to analyse whether Hong Kongers were granted a fair and just legal process against a government that so ruthlessly stomped down the movement. "," There is no public database of cases related to the anti-extradition law movement, thus it is difficult to assess the ways in which the justice department have been handling these sometimes controversial cases. In this series, we tried to tackle three topics with our database: 1. the quality of police testimony; 2. outcomes of charges; 3. tracking rioting cases.   In the first part of the series, we recorded almost 40 cases in which the judge openly criticised police officers for providing faulty and inconsistent testimonies. Legal experts also noted that there have rarely been any consequences for police officers that provided testimonies that were disputed, even though it is illegal to provide false testimony.    Secondly, analyzing our database, we found that less than half of charges related to the movement were ruled as guilty. The police have repeatedly stated that the rate at which protesters had to “face legal consequences” were more than 80 percent, without making clear their statistical methods.    The most serious charge faced by protesters is rioting — a crime that could result in a 10-year sentence. Currently, 695 people have been charged with rioting. So far only 11 people have been sentenced to prison, while hundreds still face a long waiting process as their cases move through the legal system.   In this series, we went through a tedious data collection process and openly shared our database as a public service. We also tried to analyze case data to find patterns, paired with illustrative footage from protests, as well as various data visualizations, so that readers could better engage with and comprehend the current state of the social movement as hundreds of people are caught up in complicated legal processes. "," Stand News has a team of reporters that cover the courts across Hong Kong daily. We collaborated in recording case details in a Google Spreadsheet. We also used Python to scrape public channels in Telegram that crowdsourced daily updates from the courthouses, for cases that our reporters were not able to physically attend.    In visualizing the data, we used d3.js to build charts and graphics, as well as After Effects in creating animations as well as annotating videos from scenes of protests.    "," The protests in Hong Kong that began in 2019 have sparked major changes in society. Local journalists face mounting pressure in covering protest related news, as politicians and fellow reporters have been arrested and charged for speaking out. Our reporters have stood at the front lines of the most intense clashes of the protests and now, under the guise of the national security law, we continue to do our best to give voice to the people as they face harsh sentences. To us, this series is an important record of the continuation of the protest movement, and a way to hold the government and the justice system accountable. "," Collecting case data was a major challenge. Over 10,000 people have been arrested in the protests and over 2,000 have been charged. We decided only to tackle the cases which have concluded to limit the scope of the project. We would like to encourage other journalists to take on the challenge of building your own database when there is no public information available. At the same time, we think that it was a good strategy to try to limit the scale of the project to something that is more achievable.  ",https://bit.ly/3oOZowF,https://bit.ly/36Jh32y,https://bit.ly/3oNizH3,,,,,,"K.K.

In the Northern Territory - the only jurisdiction that refused to supply the requested data - the first two stories in the series (published Jan 28 and 29) led to widespread calls and mounting public pressure for NT police to release their sexual assault data.

The story opens with 140,000+ dots built in Adobe Illustrator and then animated “on scroll”. We felt the weight of the figure could only be truly illustrated by implementing a 1:1 ratio. The length of the scroll is hefty, exemplifying the enormity of the issue.   The article is dotted with expandable, first-hand accounts from survivors made with HTML, CSS and jQuery. The text glows to imbue each story with a sense of life, mimicking breath or a heartbeat. The negative space visually breaks up the density of the more complex data pieces and research.   The victim-survivors photographed requested different degrees of anonymity. We were able to respect their wishes yet maintain a consistent “look and feel” by using shadows, edited in Adobe Photoshop, to obscure faces/bodies - the extent of which the victim/survivors decided themselves. This technique allowed the survivors to literally ‘come out of the shadows’ and tell their stories - not only in their own words, but also on their own terms, with full agency.   To allow quick comparison between different neighbourhoods and police commands, we presented the data in a searchable map that presents a detailed analysis for the selected area. The maps were custom-built in JavaScript, using both the Leaflet map plugin and D3.js data tools.    The LGA small multiple stacked area charts were also a custom JavaScript build, using the D3.js data library. Again, this presentation was chosen to enable the user to quickly see the bigger picture, while also enabling easy comparison of specific neighbourhoods.   Data mining, cleaning and blending was done using Excel, Tableau Prep and Tableau Desktop, while initial “proof of concept” visualisation and mapping was done in Tableau. "," In terms of data, the hardest part was reconciling eight disparate datasets to produce coherent, accurate and meaningful national dataset of police sexual assault investigation outcomes.   As a first step, this required familiarity with the unique classification system used by each of the eight police databases. Our reporter worked with two independent teams of experts to create a  framework for “mapping” dozens of police investigation outcomes across these crime classification systems.   The next challenge was to obtain the data with the specific granularity, structure and format that would allow the datasets to be combined under this framework.   Our reporter negotiated with police and politicians for more than a year to obtain this exclusive data for every jurisdiction. In some instances, it involved informal collaboration with police commanders and police statisticians. In others, we were only able to obtain the requested data after applying pressure through backchannels.   Having obtained the data needed, we then worked with our independent experts to painstakingly reassign numerous investigation outcomes from the different jurisdictions to a national category.   In terms of reporting, the hardest part was finding victim-survivors whose cases had not progressed beyond the police. As experts explained to us, “failure” at the police stage meant these people were more likely to bury their experience and withdraw from all types of institutional support, including from advocacy groups, grassroots networks and legal services.   So we relied on personal contacts, building trust over more than six months with a network that included several survivors who had never disclosed their assault beyond one or two friends or family. This proved transformative for some, including Lauren*. It took eight months to gain her confidence but when the story was published, she said she felt “very proud” to have done something positive” to help bring about change for others. "," Sexual assault is regarded as one of the most serious and heinous crimes in Australia. Yet police mishandling of crime - and in particular, sexual crimes - has long evaded national scrutiny because of claims that police investigation outcomes cannot be compared across states and territories.   This authoritative series undermines these claims; in doing so, demonstrating the potential to carry out similar investigations for other categories of crime.   Crime reporting has traditionally tended to expose wrongdoing by revealing new information about a single case, crime or perpetrator. This project takes this worthy endeavour further: it uses a data-driven approach to uncover a long-running pattern of injustice across an entire category of crime involving multiple perpetrators, victims and police precincts.    The project also demonstrates that “new” storytelling techniques - such as data-driven investigation, graphics and interactive design - can be seamlessly blended with traditional person-centred storytelling to powerful effect.  ",https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-28/how-police-are-failing-survivors-of-sexual-assault/11871364?nw=0,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-29/sexual-assault-legal-system-horror-show-for-survivors/11903584?nw=0,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-20/sexual-assaults-reported-to-nt-police-least-likely-to-be-pursued/11917478?nw=0,,,,,,"Inga Ting, Alex Palmer, Nathanael Scott, Jack Fisher and Lauren Roberts"," Inga Ting (data journalist), Alex Palmer (designer), Nathanael Scott (developer) and Jack Fisher (video journalist) are part of ABC New’s Digital Story Innovations team.

United States,Quartz,Big,Shortlist,The coronavirus epidemic is changing emoji usage on Venmo,07/04/20,"Infographics, Chart, Business, Culture, Economy","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Python, Node.js"," As Covid-19 swept across the US and lockdowns ensued, what used to be everyday transactions—say, paying a friend for pizza or a taxi—drastically changed. Daniel Wolfe was able to illustrate these sharp declines and rises in person-to-person payments by comparing the change in usage of emoji in Venmo payment messages. The results reveal not only the broad shock to society—basketball emoji usage was way down because the NCAA tournament was canceled—but also the micro trends that bubbled up, like sending a nurse money for coffee or a friend payment for sewing a mask. "," Despite being written only in English and Venmo only being available in the US, the piece garnered notice around the world. We saw readers sharing the post with messages in English, Japanese, French, and Spanish, which is indicative of how Wolfe's visualization clarity broke through language barriers. The item was discussed on one of the US's most widely listened to radio program, used by at least one US school district, and cited in numerous newsletters as a way to understand how society was coping with the outbreak. "," The data was collected using a python and shell scripts, cleaned and analyzed using python in a jupyter notebook, then visualized with D3. "," Collecting the Venmo data is not easy. We had collected the 2017 data for a story then, and at that time there was an API that could be used to access public transaction data. By 2020, that API had been shut down so we had to periodically download the limited set of transactions that Venmo published to its website during the month of March then treat that data as a sample to do our calculations.   Parsing emoji is also complicated, and we had to come up with ways to extract the right meaning from the characters. For instance, a person emoji can be given various skin tones or genders. We had to determine whether a multi-part emoji was representative of its use or if combining those uses into one representative emoji would be better for the analysis. That meant grouping emoji like “skin-tone-4 haircut woman,”  “skin-tone-2 haircut man,” and “haircut woman” together as “haircut”. "," First and foremost, journalists can learn from this piece that data and visualization can be the entire story rather than just an aspect of it. That words can be formed around the design and layout of an experience rather than always the other way around. It can also be used as an example of how data collected by companies for reasons unrelated to the reporting can be used to tell a compelling narrative. It also shows that stories about business and personal finance are wonderful vessels to understand our society.

United States,Boston Globe,Big,Shortlist,"Boston Globe Spotlight Team's series ""Last Words""",26/09/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Video, Health","Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python"," Months before the pandemic, the Boston Globe Spotlight Team chose to tackle a subject few want to think about: death, dying, and the limited options for most people to die in peace, especially those from marginalized groups.    They found that in Massachusetts, a state that boasts some of the world’s greatest hospitals, income and race are factors in not only where and how people die, but in how long they live. The difference can be 15 years. They found that the region’s nursing homes were ill-prepared to handle the pandemic, and uncovered factors responsible for staggering COVID-19 fatality rates there. "," In a year saturated with bleak news, the stories in “Last Words” were among the most well-read in the Globe, lauded for their mixture of context and compassion, as well as their data-driven objectivity. They provoked heated discussion on a topic so many people prefer to avoid. Over five different days, the editorial page published numerous letters to the editor in response to the stories. The Globe’s comment board drew robust responses.    One reader thanked Globe reporters, saying, “It makes a big crack in the concrete wall of ignorance and denial in our society of the disparities and inequalities that our 'culture' has long tolerated.”   Government officials also responded. The series spurred state officials to release more data on the number of COVID cases and deaths at nursing homes, as they faced repeated pressure from the Globe to exhibit more transparency. Officials also publicly vowed to do better in overseeing safety at nursing homes, where Massachusetts had one of the highest death rates in the nation. One in seven long-term care residents died in the pandemic.    The state attorney general also began a probe into Medicaid nursing home discrimination, acting on information from the Globe’s undercover operation of bias against the poor at these facilities.   Overall, the powerful data analysis of the series and its deeply human stories served as a catalyst for discussions about death, dying and disparities, subjects so relevant in this pandemic year and beyond.  "," We used a variety of tools and techniques, including:   ● Linear and multiple regression to identify factors correlated with higher mortality rates at nursing homes. (First, we had to painstakingly gather data from a variety of state and federal databases and merge them together.)   ● Geocoding. We examined 21 years of detailed death certificate data to look for patterns in deaths (such as where people die by race and income) and identify deaths potentially related to COVID-19. But because the data did not include people's income, we geocoded the data based on the residential address of the decedent, looked up the median income for that Census tract, and then classified the person into an income bucket we devised partly based on Pew Research Center definitions.   ● Survey research. We commissioned Suffolk University to conduct a poll of Massachusetts residents and their views on deaths. We also surveyed the families of 450 people who died in 2016 by mail (using contact information from the state’s death data). The latter survey also included open-ended questions that gave reporters ideas for stories and names of potential interview subjects.   ● Audits. To identify Medicaid discrimination at nursing homes, we mimicked ""pair testing"" approaches often used by investigators to identify potential discrimination. We sent two emails to hundreds of nursing homes expressing interest in potentially placing an elderly parent in the facility. One set of emails indicated the person would have to rely entirely on Medicaid. The other set of emails indicated the person was affluent enough to afford to pay the bill themselves..   ● Content analysis. We conducted a content analysis of transcripts for the Massachusetts governor’s press conferences in the first month of the pandemic, finding that the governor and his staff rarely mentioned nursing homes at the briefings compared to hospitals. "," We faced several challenges in putting together this series. First, we had to sue the Massachusetts Department of Public Health twice to obtain the death data that was the backbone of the series, spending more than $16,000 in legal fees. Second, the data from the state and federal government was often incomplete and missing unique identifiers to easily merge the databases. (We wound up painstakingly joining databases by the names of nursing homes and manually fixing errors where the names of nursing homes were listed differently in different databases). In some cases, the state also withheld the pricese number of deaths at nursing homes, forcing us to contact the nursing homes themselves to find out the actual numbers and fill in that missing information in our database.    In order to successfully survey 450 families who had someone die in the same year, we needed to send out more than 5,000 letters – since most people don’t respond to mail surveys. (The state death data doesn’t contain phone numbers or email addresses for family members - just the name and address of the person who provided information to the state about the deceased.)    Of course, one of the biggest challenges was the pandemic. We were getting close to publishing a series about disparities in death and discrimination in nursing homes when the coronavirus pandemic erupted in the state – forcing us to pause publication of the series and then re-report many part of it.  "," The series powerfully demonstrates the importance and utility of death data - and it's worth it to even sue to get it. We obtained detailed data for 1.2 million deaths in Massachusetts, giving us incredibly detailed information for everyone who died in the state over more than two decades. That data could be used in any number of stories.    We also demonstrated how journalists can borrow some techniques from academia -- including multiple regression, paired testing, and content analysis -- to do their own studies. Multiple regression is a great technique to help figure out what factors are significantly related to deaths or something else reporters are studying. Paired testing is a useful way to to identify potential discrimination. Content analysis is a great way to measure what words or editorial choices people are making in their speeches, underscoring their priorities. We also showed two different ways of using scientific surveys - conducting your own or hiring a professional pollster. But the bottom line is journalists can take advantage of all these techniques themselves.    We think the series also showed how journalists can investigate a topic, then be forced to pivot when another major story breaks — like the pandemic. When that thappened to us, we didn't panic — we actually saw an opportunity to incorporate new pandemc death data and see if our earlier findings about inequities still held up.  They did and the result was a highly challenging and illuminating series to produce.  ",http://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/investigations/spotlight/2020/09/last-words/,https://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/investigations/spotlight/2020/09/last-words/part1-dying-poor/index.html,https://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/investigations/spotlight/2020/09/last-words/part2-forgotten-elderly/index.html,https://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/investigations/spotlight/2020/09/last-words/part3-nursing-homes/,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/28/metro/spotlight-team-probe-potential-medicaid-discrimination-massachusetts-nursing-homes/,https://apps.bostonglobe.com/metro/investigations/spotlight/2020/09/last-words/death-interactive-details/,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/26/metro/massachusetts-poll-race-education-gender-may-influence-some-divergent-views-about-death/,,"Reporters Mark Arsenault, Liz Kowalczyk, Todd Wallack, Rebecca Ostriker, Robert Weisman, Saurabh Datar and Spotlight editor Patricia Wen","   Mark Arsenault    Mark Arsenault covers casino development and gambling issues for The Boston Globe.

United States,"BuzzFeed News, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and more than 100 media partners around the world",Big,Shortlist,FinCEN Files,20/09/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Fact-checking, Podcast/radio, Infographics, Chart, Map, Corruption, Money-laundering, Economy, Terrorism","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python"," The FinCEN Files began with a trove of secret government documents and grew into a partnership of more than 400 journalists in 88 countries — the largest reporting project in history.   Our 16-month investigation proved that five global banks continued to profit from suspect transactions even after they paid hefty fines and promised to clean up their acts.   It revealed how laws meant to stop financial crime have instead allowed it to proliferate.   And it showed, transaction by transaction, how some of the world’s most notorious criminals used the international banking system to legitimize the profits from their deadly dealings. "," Even amid a global pandemic, the FinCEN Files registered significant impact.    The reckoning began even before we published. After we approached the Treasury Department with our findings, it announced a sweeping plan to “address the evolving threats of illicit finance.”   Upon publication, the financial sector shuddered as investors <a href=""https://apnews.com/article/paul-manafort-money-laundering-archive-7a2579c1eac8a1300de258f25504e8e9"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> drove down   the share price of major banks cited in the series. Lawmakers in <a href=""https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/jasonleopold/elizabeth-warren-bernie-sanders-fincen-files"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> the U.S.   and <a href=""https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/european-lawmakers-call-for-coordinated-banking-industry-reforms-in-wake-of-fincen-files/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> Europe   demanded a response from financial institutions and regulators, and <a href=""https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1990027/amlo-vows-probe-into-icijs-claims"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> Thailand   launched an inquiry into banks cited in our reporting.   Then, in December, the U.S. Congress <a href=""https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/advocates-celebrate-major-us-anti-money-laundering-victory/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> passed   the Corporate Transparency Act, the most consequential revision of U.S. anti-money laundering laws since 9/11. Key lawmakers credited the FinCEN Files with getting it over the line. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a co-sponsor, said the series “underscored that we need to strengthen, reform, and update our nation’s anti-money laundering laws.”   The legislation directly addressed our key findings. It forces owners of shell companies to identify themselves, shining a light on the shadowy entities powering the dark economy. It requires the Justice Department to file reports justifying its use of deferred prosecution agreements — sweetheart deals that let banks off easy. And the law adds protections and incentives for whistleblowers.   Closing another major loophole, the law empowers Treasury and Justice to subpoena records from foreign banks with corresponding accounts in U.S. institutions. It also requires the Treasury Department to pursue new technologies for uncovering criminal money flows.   In Europe, the impact included demands in the European Parliament for an overhaul of banking oversight; an examination by U.K. lawmakers into the effectiveness of anti-money laundering systems there; and a proposal from Belgian banks for a system to share information about suspicious transactions.   This <a href=""https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/heres-what-is-changing-after-the-fincen-files-shook-the-world-of-banking/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> story   summarized much of the impact across the globe. "," The FinCEN Files include more than 2,100 suspicious activity reports, which banks must file with the U.S. government to flag transactions that appear to be linked to illicit activity. Making sense of these reports, which covered tens of thousands of pages, required innovation and exhaustive effort.    Every SAR contains two parts: a set of data tables and a narrative. The tables were unconventionally formatted and could span dozens of pages each, so we wrote Python scripts to extract the information and put it into a single database enumerating thousands of SAR subjects, key dates, suspicious transaction totals, and other crucial details.   The narrative sections contained key information about money flows and relationships between banks. At first, ICIJ partner SVT used machine learning to screen the records and obtained a first set of transactional data that could be used for research.   As variations in language and the complexity of the reports prevented the capture of some essential details, we launched a large-scale data-extraction effort. For more than a year, 85 journalists in 30 countries extracted transaction information in the narratives by hand, sharing them securely with partners on ICIJ’s Global iHub platform.   ICIJ then reviewed each extraction three times, a process that took seven months. To facilitate this effort, ICIJ used the Django web framework to build a fact-checking tool that allowed colleagues to flag errors and track edits throughout the process.   Reporters also built and analyzed databases of public information (such as corporate records) and cross-referenced them with SAR data.   Together, this information offered an unprecedented map of torrents of money circling the globe and funding mayhem — all within view of banks and regulators.   The specific tools included: Python (Django, Jupyter, Pandas, PDFPlumber, NetworkX), Excel, Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, Linkurious, Neo4j, VisiData, Docker, Ansible, ICIJ’s research platform Datashare. "," Data quality issues posed major challenges for the team.   The FinCEN Files investigation involved data on more than $2 trillion in transactions dated from 1999-2017 that had been flagged in the suspicious activity reports by nearly 90 financial institutions.    It was spread across tens of thousands of pages, most of it unstructured. Even just organizing it all, let alone reporting on it, required innovation and exhaustive labor to unpack. This led to a large-scale data-extraction effort and an exhaustive fact-checking effort.   The government forms are poorly designed; bank compliance staffers often fill out SARs with incomplete, confusing, or inaccurate information; and U.S. authorities haven’t done much to police the quality of the information that banks submit.   For example: More than a fifth of the SARs in the FinCEN Files list no street number, city, or even country for one or more of the flagged subjects. In some cases, the bank that submitted the SAR failed to include addresses for customers in its own corporate network. And when an address was included, more than half of the FinCEN Files SARs listed the wrong country, as designated by a two-character code, ICIJ found.   BuzzFeed News and ICIJ went through multiple rounds of validation to confirm the countries and territories used for the analysis.   The records also included hundreds of spreadsheets with data on more than 100,000 transactions filled with party names, bank names, figures, and dates — using a variety of different formats and field names — but were unattached to the narrative that would have explained their inclusion.   ICIJ undertook an effort to standardize the field names and address formats to make them more useful to our partners. We also used shoe-leather reporting with sources and external documents to help make sense of this information. "," We believe this project demonstrates the value of large-scale, cross-border collaboration. The document and data in the FinCEN Files touch nearly every corner of the planet. Our partnership with more than 100 other newsrooms allowed us to produce major stories in dozens of countries, and break news in dozens more.    Getting to that point, however, required a strong shared foundation of trust, training, and collaboration. During the project’s first phase, BuzzFeed News and ICIJ convened a confidential meeting with more than 100 partners in Hamburg, Germany, for two days of meetings to brainstorm, teach, and develop reporting plans. Building off the success of those meetings, reporters continued to collaborate via ICIJ’s secure Global iHub platform, where they could discuss new leads, share insights, and ask questions.    In some ways, this massively collaborative approach added complexity to an already-complex project. Given the sensitivity and complexity of the material, for instance, all partners went through trainings on security and the use of ICIJ’s technologies for research tailored to the project. Partners spent non-trivial amounts of time reading each other's messages, catching up on the latest findings. And coordinating the final publication schedule was an exercise in diplomacy and intricate logistics.   But the benefits greatly outweighed those costs. As reporters scoured the FinCEN Files, they found evidence that assisted colleagues halfway around the world. Together, they pieced together a clearer picture than ever of dirty money flowing through the mainstream financial system. Independently, too, they dove deep into their countries and topics of expertise — now placed in the context of a globe-spanning investigation. The sheer size of the collaboration also unlocked possibilities that would have otherwise been unthinkably onerous, such as the grueling-yet-essential project to manually collect all transaction information described in the SAR narratives, as discussed above.

United States,"International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, FRONTLINE, Expresso, The New York Times and 33 other media partners",Big,Shortlist,Luanda Leaks,19/01/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Fact-checking, Map, Corruption, Business, Economy, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python"," Luanda Leaks exposes the inner workings of a global business empire fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in public money siphoned from one of the poorest countries in the world.   Drawing from more than 715,000 leaked records, public documents and hundreds of interviews, it casts unprecedented light on the mechanics of corruption at the grandest scale, and reveals how Western professionals play a vital, little-examined part in the blighting of countless lives.   The investigation centered on Isabel dos Santos, Africa’s wealthiest woman, involved more than 120 journalists in 20 countries. "," Reaction began before we even published. In December 2019, after ICIJ questioned Angola’s government, a court froze dos Santos’ major assets, including banks, a telecom company and a brewery. The government said it was trying to recover $1.1 billion in lost assets.   When the stories went live, the floodgates opened. Angola’s attorney general charged dos Santos with embezzlement and money laundering. A provincial court labeled a deal to acquire the jewelry company de Grisogono that was a focus of our reporting as “fraudulent.”   In Portugal, authorities froze dos Santos bank accounts and seized all of her assets, including luxury properties and stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars in major companies. The country’s top market regulator launched investigations of nine auditing companies that worked with dos Santos, threatening criminal charges if it could be determined they broke anti-money laundering laws in aiding dos Santos.   Dutch prosecutors began a criminal investigation, examining how a company owned by dos Santos’s husband managed to acquire a lucrative shareholding in the Portuguese oil and gas firm Galp. German police raided a state-owned bank as part of a criminal probe. Cape Verde’s finance minister said the Luanda Leaks revelations helped seal a new law that closes down offshore banks.   The head of PwC’s tax team for Angola and Portugal stepped down. The firm’s chairman said he was “shocked and disappointed” and launched an internal investigation. From a reputational perspective, the dos Santos story was the worst thing to have happened to PwC on his watch, he said.    PwC declined to respond to specific follow-up questions in December, but said that in the wake of the investigation a number of senior employees have left “or been subject to other remedial measures.” ","     The leak itself was of more than 715,000 records. Documents were in different formats (emails, PDFs, spreadsheets) and about half of the files were in Portuguese. To make this large trove of files searchable and share them with the team in a secure way, ICIJ used its research tool Datashare. As most of the team didn’t speak Portuguese, ICIJ used an open source software to translate the records, and have both the original and a translated searchable English version of the file in Datashare.   The high volume of files and unstructured data required additional efforts to analyze them. To help with the mining and reporting, ICIJ and media partners used machine learning to cluster similar types of files that could be of interest for the investigation and added filters with the results of those clusters to Datashare. ICIJ also used graph databases and entity extraction to facilitate establishing connections between the files.   ICIJ manually created massive databases from scratch to propel research and help analyze the material. We combined the records we obtained with corporate registries from more than a dozen jurisdictions, corporate documents and other datasets to compile and map an extensive—and exclusive—record of more than 400 companies owned or otherwise tied to Isabel dos Santos, her husband, or both, including 94 registered in secrecy jurisdictions. Each data entry was verified and fact-checked.   This database offered a unique view of the dos Santos companies and was central for the investigation. ICIJ made the final data available to the public: https://www.icij.org/investigations/luanda-leaks/explore-how-to-build-a-business-empire/ The specific tools used included: Datashare (ICIJ’s developed research tool to make the files searchable - open source), Google Sheets, Apertium, Neo4J, Linkurious, Talend, SQL Server, Universal Sentence Encoder, ElasticSearch, Annoy.     ","The records obtained by ICIJ included emails, government decrees, spreadsheets, ledgers, audits, incorporation papers, organizational charts, meeting minutes and videos, loan agreements, deeds, tax advice and tax returns. While the records, many in Portuguese, laid groundwork for stories, they were incomplete. They referenced other documents that were not included and events not further described. The reporting was like sifting through a giant box of pieces from countless different puzzles — and then finding that even when assembled, each was missing crucial parts. Much time was devoted to reconstructing transactions, tracing the flow of money from an Angolan or dos Santos business through shell companies and then into the legitimate financial system. Simply reading the financial documents required thousands of hours. ICIJ turned to forensic auditors and other experts to help better understand what we were seeing. Team members spent weeks on the ground in Angola, a country with no tradition of a free press and a difficult reporting environment. We chased leads around the globe, from Portugal and Brazil to Malta and Delaware. We interviewed hundreds of people, including government ministers, bank officers, company incorporation specialists and everyday Angolans. The persistence paid off: additional sources led to additional documents, helped fill in gaps in understanding, and pointed to new stories, including embezzlement of millions of dollars from the state oil company dos Santos ran to using her father's backing to plunder state infrastructure funds to a mass eviction of an entire seaside community, driven out by bulldozers and police to make way for a dos Santos real estate development. Another considerable challenge comes with our model: fashioning a single team out of disparate and far-flung news organizations. We shared tips and bits of reporting on our bespoke internal communications platform, held hundreds of virtual meetings and met up on the"," Faced with a trove of records in different formats? Consider a technological solution. ICIJ’s Datashare can power up collaborations and make the task of reading through documents across different desks and even newsrooms an achievable goal. Datashare is open source, meaning that any journalist can download and use it for free. (https://datashare.icij.org/)    For Luanda Leaks, we faced an additional hurdle: It wasn’t a few hundred documents that we wanted to collectively sort through—it was a vast trove of more than 750,000. ICIJ teamed up with Quartz AI studio to use “machine learning” to automate the sorting process. This subset of artificial intelligence could learn to identify similar groups of files more likely to contain stories—pulling out, for instance, balance sheets to queue up for review by our reporters. The results were later integrated into Datashare. Artificial intelligence experts who might be willing to lend a hand dwell in many sectors, including academia. Don’t be afraid to ask.   A set of original documents is the starting place for reporting, not the end. To build the company database, for examples, we started by pulling names and other relevant information from the files and then used public information harvested from company registries, databases and corporate documents to validate our findings and expand on what we were learning. To make sense of it, and to track our work, ICIJ manually built a database that compiled data on companies in which dos Santos or her husband hold, or have held, a stake as shareholder, directly or indirectly. ICIJ also relied on information gathered through previous investigations, including Offshore Leaks.

Germany,"Brands of the Funke Mediengruppe (Berliner Morgenpost, Hamburger Abendblatt, WAZ, Thüringer Allgemeine, Braunschweiger Zeitung and many more)",Big,Shortlist,Coronavirus-Monitor,04/03/20,"Explainer, Database, News application, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Node.js"," The Coronavirus-Monitor gives its users a comprehensive overview of the worldwide pandemic - with the latest figures fed into an easy to use tool. With the changing information needs features were changed, removed, and added. The home screen lets users explore the total number of infections, recoveries, deaths - for different countries, German federal states, by total and relative numbers, historical and current, in maps, graphs and tables. Additional sections visualize the development for Germany and lead to subprojects: to the ICU-Monitor showing the current utilization of German ICUs, to the analysis of excess mortality or the Vaccination-Monitor. "," As the Coronavirus-Monitor was the first major German dashboard on coronavirus (first German case February 27, launch March 04), and offered real added value to the Johns-Hopkins-University dashboard through its additional data on Germany's states as well as unique features, it landed a visitor success right on the first day. The enormous rush was kept stable by constantly integrating new features, reacting quickly to new information or information needs, and keeping the Monitor one step ahead of the competition in many of its offerings. With well over 300 million visits (400 million including the subprojects) in 2020, it is probably one of the most popular coronavirus resources in Germany and by far the most successful article in the history of the Funke Mediengruppe. One of the Group's outlets, the Berliner Morgenpost, increased its number of unique users for March by 680 percent compared to the previous year, making the Monitor a huge success in raising brand awareness. In addition, it was instrumental in the success of the Coronavirus newsletter and newsblog, as well as for new subscriptions through its referrals to other resources of the Group, as internal analysis has shown. As it was the only platform at all to regularly show the latest figures for the German states, which were initially only published via individual press releases by authorities, it became the main source for JHU for Germany and thus the main source for many media brands. Thus, we were always one step ahead by having the numbers for Germany first, as the other German media brands received them through JHU with a reporting delay. Although they quickly set up their own great offerings and other data sources got available, the Coronavirus-Monitor remained the first stop for many users, still leading to record daily hits today. "," The Coronavirus-Monitor is built modularly of multiple React.js widgets. The individual sections can be easily moved in their order, features can be adjusted and widgets can be included and updated on other project pages at the same time. Since the site had such immense success, the Maptiles from the third-party provider Maptiler quickly became too expensive, so the team set up their own Maptile Server. Data is scraped from multiple sites and sources or flows through APIs to our data server, where it is cleaned, renamed, and checked. Only then is the data passed to the project as JSON or CSV. Data for Germany is loaded from various official sources into a Google spreadsheet, where journalists from the team perform a daily manual check and then enter the data into the individual sheets for each federal state, from where it is in turn scraped and transferred to the data server. A Slack bot notifies the team of strange discrepancies, such as large downward corrections / decreasing total case counts. The maps are based on Leaflet.js, most of the graphics are built with d3.js.     "," Similar to how all journalists probably felt about this topic, the dynamic situation and the constant changes to the official data sources were a great challenge. Especially in the beginning, when authorities or even the JHU regularly changed their data formats, publication times, or definitions without warning, this meant a lot of manual work, sometimes on a Sunday at midnight. Due to the immensely high number of hits and the fact that our Monitor was the main source for the German figures of the JHU and thus also of many media offerings for months, we also had a great responsibility to double-check the data and to make definition changes clear. In addition, a single statement by a politician could trigger a whole new information need, e.g. a whole new indicator with a new threshold for lockdown policies, to which we had to respond quickly with a new feature. And this year, of all years, we had no designer for months (May to August), which limited the team to two full-time employees and two freelancers (working a maximum of three days a week) for a few months. In addition, we found ourselves in the home office as early as April, and never before had to search so intensively for new backend solutions, as the many accesses and the ever-growing database threatened to bring our normally perfectly adequate technology to its knees. Because normally we work on projects that we plan once, publish, and then update with more current data a year later at most. All in all, every aspect of this project, the space and time circumstances, the technical solutions, was an absolute challenge and turned our entire workflow upside down. The team really outdid themselves in every aspect, and still managed to release other projects and subprojects. "," This project showed what a small, dedicated and well organized team can do, even when circumstances are unfavorable (no designer for months, only two full-time employees, spontaneous home office) and variables are constantly changing (new backend solutions needed, data sources and information needs constantly changing). It also showed us what an impact it can have to quickly publish a well designed, minimal valuable product with the main focus to be simple and clear, a ""no bullshit dashboard"" as we called it internally, and then develop it further and further in the days to come, building it in a modular and agile way so you can react quickly to changes. Also important to the immense success were small features that set the Monitor apart from the competition: For example, it was the first dashboard that also showed recoveries, the first dashboard that offered a time slider, and through the manual work of the team in collecting the individual press releases, it was also the first dashboard with the current numbers for each German state. Such small features made the difference, catapulting a regional brand like Berliner Morgenpost to the top of unique-user growth in Germany and allowing this local newspaper to pass national brands like Süddeutsche Zeitung (known for example for the Panama Papers) or Zeit Online with its page views for a few weeks. Last but not least, this project can also show how money can be made with data journalism. Although it was not behind the paywall but remained freely accessible, considerable advertising revenue was generated and, by successfully redirecting the user flow to other resources such as the newsblog, newsletter sign-ups or other interactive subprojects with advertising integration, the reach of the entire offering of the Group was increased and even subscriptions were generated.

Brazil,Fiquem Sabendo,Small,Shortlist,120 years of darkness: shedding light on government pensions in Brazil,13/01/20,"Investigation, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, News application, Chart, Politics, Economy","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, PostgreSQL, Python"," For over a century Brazilian tax payers have given a blank check for the government to use on pensions for public servants with no oversight. For three years Fiquem Sabendo battled in the Supreme Audit Institution of Brazil,  pressuring for access to historical records. In 2020 we won, freeing 26 years worth of data about payments. We cleaned, analysed and uploaded the data online, identified issues and corrected the official database by collaborating with the  Ministry of Economy and then organized a pool of journalists to produce stories. Finally, we gave free access to our tool for everyone.  "," This was possibly the largest database ever obtained based on Freedom of Information in Brazil. The data on individual monthly pension payments to civilians from 1994 to 2020 consists of 100 million lines spread across 27 different files. It is also - possibly -  the most important in terms of public money disclosure. We are talking about U$ 88 billion in pensions for over 400.000 public servants' family members, through 95 million individual payments made in 26 years. In the dataset we found lifetime pensions established in 1900 and payments that reach up to R$ 30,000 monthly. Before that, it was impossible to hold the government nor beneficiaries accountable because their names and pensions were unknown to the public.    To take these historical numbers to the broader public, Fiquem Sabendo coordinated a collaborative task force with four journalists to produce stories from the dataset. Lucio Vaz (Gazeta do Povo), Eduardo Barretto (Época), Bruno Fonseca (Agência Pública), and Taís Seibt (Fiquem Sabendo/Yahoo) worked for over a month with our team to find scoops. Agência Pública, for example, found that hundreds of officers accused of torture during the dictatorship have been receiving lifetime pensions from the government.    Over a year since the data was released by our small independent team, it is still being used by many major news outlets (Google ""Fiquem Sabendo"" ""pensionistas""). Even president Bolsonaro tried to weigh in the situation by falsely claiming on social media he was the one to order the release of the dataset. The House of Representatives leader condemned the pensions.   The government was positively impacted by our investigation. We will explain later how our work changed the official records by almost a billion dollars in net value by identifying structural mistakes on the dataset and helping the Ministry of Economy to fix it.  "," We managed to transform the 60 GB dataset from an inaccessible archive of separated files into a dynamic and - most importantly - useful online dataset for reporters, researchers, and citizens.    On Shinyapps, the application structured by Fernando using R, anyone is able to explore filters, timelines and download smaller pieces for further exploration on Excel/Sheets. A very important aspect here is the monetary corrections applied to update the numbers. Through this tool, anyone can see both the original values from the official dataset and the new values considering two decades of inflation and a change of currency. The platform is still online and open to the public.   On Metabase, structured by Álvaro Justen using Python, it was possible to create dashboards of interactive graphs, make calculations, pivot tables, and follow a single beneficiary's complete path over the years. Because this is a tool that costs based on the usage volume, we gave exclusive access for journalists to deeper explore the data.    ","Overcoming public data censorship Fiquem Sabendo started this fight back in 2017 and only after three years in the Supreme Audit Institution of Brazil, we won. The decision, unanimous and favorable to the agency, guaranteed the publicity of payments made to pensioners of the federal government for the first time in history. In January of 2020 we got two months worth of data and - finally - in July we released 26 years of payments for accountability. This was a result of a long collaboration between journalism and law. Despite the huge achievement, we are still in a battle for the full release of the information! Over a year after the tribunal's decision, the government has not yet published the data on payments made to relatives of military personnel and secret agents, nor to relatives of Central Bank employees. Fiquem Sabendo has already filed two petitions for this information to be made public and as soon as it is we will repeat the same process. Identifying and correcting mistakes in the official dataset As we analysed the dataset we noticed strange entries. Because we had built two different tools, in different languages ​​(R and Python), by two different people, we were sure that the problems detected on our platforms were on the official data published by the Ministry of Economy. We then organized the probable errors and inconsistencies found in three spreadsheets: single payments over R$ 1 million, R$ 100,000 and empty cells. For over a month we went back and forth with the Human Resources Management Secretariat to show and correct the problems. How impactful were those mistakes in the public budget? Almost a billion dollars in net value. Because we collaborated with the technical department responsible for the information, our reporting was able to correct the original governmental","   Collaboration with other areas, not just other newsrooms    Having a lawyer as a cofounder working to support journalists showed us how important it is to have a team from diverse areas. Our reporting would not have existed if it wasn't for the whole legal battle that preceded it and the court's decision would not have invoked such public appeal if it had not been appropriately presented to society.      Open for everyone    Leaks and special sources are part of journalism, but we also need to fight to make things actually public. It is a structural part of our job to make public data available not just to do a scoop, but to create real accountability by allowing anyone to check the full data - available online. By using FOIA the reporting is not just about that one piece anymore, it is a pathway for others to push transparency even further. Documents obtained through the legal due process become a precedent for other documents, agencies and for state and city level decisions. The importance of this project does not end on itself, it can now be used to open pension payments all over the country, it can base requests for other parts of the government, etc.      Citizens are potential journalists waiting to act    They have the will. If we share the  tools, they can help us. It was through Twitter DMs of family members that didn't find their own relatives on the dataset that showed us the information first released by the government was not complete. ""Normal people'' helped us identify that the first dataset published by the Ministry of Economy did not include beneficiaries related to military personal, secret agents and the Central Bank. And that's what fueled our second petition to the Supreme Audit Institution of Brazil.

Kenya,Nation Media Group,Big,Shortlist,Unmasked by Nation Media Group,10/09/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, Illustration, Politics, Corruption, Economy","CSV, Python, Node.js","  Unmasked  is a flexible platform for investigative journalists and anti-corruption researchers in Kenya, that enables journalists and newsrooms to capture and publish invaluable open data from daily and investigative reporting.    The Nation Media Group created the project because in politically and technically constrained environment like Kenya, data for journalism is hard to come by and key information is made public by journalists and civil society.    Open data generated from stories increases value for all reporting, by providing insight to past and future stories while unmasking the complicated relationships behind grand corruption of people in power and associated people and organisations.  "," The project pulled  together multiple stories on issues such as <a href=""https://unmasked.nation.africa/issues/covid19millionaires"">#COVID19Millionaires  exposing the different actors, government agencies and companies involved.  The insights gained from curating the procurement stories in Kenya enriched data and investigative reporting at the Nation Media Group resulting in compelling stories including: <a href=""https://nation.africa/kenya/news/how-sh9bn-kemsa-plot-was-nipped-in-the-bud-2452750"">How Sh9bn Kemsa plot was nipped in the bud    Besides enhancing the reporting of procurement stories, other major impacts of the investigative Covid-19 stories done by NMG as part of the project include:     Audit ordered by President Uhuru Kenyatta   EACC finalising files for DPP to charge culprits in court   Kemsa suspended CEO and two directors   Health ministry ordered to publish list of all suppliers   Two parliamentary probes on going   EACC freezes payment of suppliers until verification is done, says expose helped it stop further losses of Sh9 billion     Unmasked,  increases the value of reporting for a newsroom, by connecting and building upon past stories, where each reported story contributes to providing a more complete understanding of the topic.    The platform enables journalists to quickly provide deeper context and insights when reporting, by exposing connections to past stories that might have been overlooked. The use of simple forms based on open standards enables capturing of complicated data and relationships such as beneficial ownership, without requiring expert knowledge.    The South-South cross-regional collaboration in development of this platform between Kenyan and Malaysian data journalists, shows that innovative techniques in using open data standards for reporting and investigations are possible and applicable in similar data and politically constrained environments for data journalism.   Publication of open standards compliant open data via a public API enables not just the newsroom, but other public users to innovate such as the <a href=""https://relations.nation.africa"">interactive data visualisation of relationships .     "," The project was built on top of the <a href=""https://plone.org/"">Plone open source content management system,  using open data standards of <a href=""https://www.popoloproject.com/"">Popolo-spec  (People & Organizations), <a href=""https://standard.open-contracting.org/"">Open Contracting Data Standard  (OCDS) and the <a href=""http://standard.openownership.org/en/0.2.0/"">Beneficial Ownership Data Standard  (BODS).    This choice allowed for rapid development and implementation of the standards, while providing a user friendly interface for entering and managing data from stories.    It provided a way to easily join up or extend overlapping data fields from different standards, such as extending fields for a Person from Popolo-spec with additional fields for Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) from BODS. Similarly, more detailed information for people and positions are made available for OCDS contract information, by using the same content for Persons that was extended before.   Custom views on the data, also allowed the platform to be used for different use cases for media in <a href=""https://unmasked.nation.africa"">Kenya  and for anti-corruption in <a href=""https://politikus.sinarproject.org/"">Malaysia .   It provides different workflow and access states, for which ongoing investigations and new data for unpublished stories, can be kept private for internal use until publication. Full text search throughout the platform allows journalists to not only search data, but also text in supporting documents including images.   Publication of open standards compliant open data, via a public ReST API that enables data journalists internally and externally to create visualizations or use tools to use data for data or investigative journalism.    A script was also developed to <a href=""https://github.com/Sinar/popit_relationship"">export the data, into neo4J  to enable visualization and exploration using network graphs.   Finally the <a href=""https://github.com/NMG-Digital/nmg.unmasked.views"">platform is open source  allowing others to also use it and where updates and additional features are shared among implementers.     "," Unmasked, an open data  public procurement investigation project,that was established by Nation Media Group with support from Hivos East Africa faced many challenges.   The project had to find a way to showcase how open data, especially procurement data can support journalism in uncovering corruption in procurement, in an environment where there is limited open data. It also had to do it with very limited human resources.   Due to Covid19 it was delayed and resource constrained, the entire platform was mainly developed between just two developers on a part-time basis, with additional support from NMG in-house journalists and where all interactions including workshops were done remotely between Malaysia and Kenya. The pandemic  also made it difficut for the journalists to go to investigate leads generated from insights derived from the platform for followup investigative and data driven stories.   Despite the challenges the process of enriching  the platform with more content by journalists and developers is ongoing. ","  Unmasked  is a testament to the fact that in environments with limited open data provided by the government, open data can be generated by the media through day to day and investigative reporting.    Open data standards can provide the structure needed as guidance for investigations, but also for collaboration in capturing and re-using data within the newsroom between different teams. A sports reporter could be reporting on a takeover bid of a football team, and be entering data on beneficial ownership without being a domain expert, while at the same time, possibly getting additional information on the persons and companies involved for an unrelated investigation for a story done by another team.   Finally, in an era of short news cycles and revenue, that project also shows that media can generate and publish open data through reporting, which in turn increases value by extending the relevancy of a story with each new connection made through data for new stories.    That data captured through reporting, contributes to open data that increases value for the entire newsrooom and organisation.       ",https://unmasked.nation.africa,https://relations.nation.africa,https://nation.africa/kenya/news/how-sh9bn-kemsa-plot-was-nipped-in-the-bud-2452750,https://unmasked.nation.africa/issues/tender-fraud-at-communications-authority-of-kenya,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IhtZNORf1yCyJ1lYACZl6MiXouMedzDDUumFoesgPLg/edit#slide=id.g89d9d5ffe4_0_77,,,,"Developer Khairil Yusof, Developer Samuel Ochola, Head of development and learning Churchill Otieno, investigative and financial journalist Paul Wafula, Data Editor Dorothy Otieno"," Chruchill Otieno is the Head of Development and Learning at Nation Media Group.

Germany,silo.institute,Small,Shortlist,Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing,30/05/20,"Explainer, Fact-checking, Mobile App, Infographics, Chart, Health","Animation, Canvas"," Contact tracing is a crucial but labour-intensive strategy to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmissions and the spread of COVID-19. In early 2020 several strategies to automate this process utilising smartphones and bluetooth technology have been put forward. This visual explainer based on the DP-3T proposal which was adopted by the Google/Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) system demonstrates how privacy preserving proximity tracing works, why we need it and the risks it entails. "," In line with the privacy preserving focus of our topic we refrained from monitoring visitor numbers which makes quantfying our outreach difficult. However, the project was well received on Twitter. It was <a href=""https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/zukunft-technologie/die-funktion-der-warn-app-modern-erklaert-li.87342"">covered by a local Berlin newspaper (Berliner Zeitung)  and – among others – <a href=""https://twitter.com/JuerMueller/status/1272086508409929729"">shared by Juergen Mueller,  CTO of SAP, the company responsible for implementing the Corona-Warn-App in Germany. We also have anecdotal evidence from friends and family that our visual article fostered understanding of how the app works and that it motivated people to install the app when it became available. "," Our project heavily relies on the scrollytelling pattern and features elements of explorable explanations and animated diagrams. Scrollytelling is used throughout the article to keep visual elements in the viewport while reading and to alter the appearance of said elements depending on the scroll position.   The first visualisation demonstrates how the disease spreads assuming different reproduction numbers (R) and allows the reader to explore how infections unfold by interacting with sliders to manipulate levels of immunity and isolation. It is based on a custom (but really simple) model that runs once when the page is loaded. The visual representation is implemented with p5.js.   The main part of the article consists of animated diagrams that all use the same custom-build visualisation engine capable of displaying nodes, links, and annotations in a polar coordinate system. This allowed us to easily position and animate elements by providing the distance and angle from a common reference points rather than x/y coordiantes.   The website is implemented with Vue.js and <a href=""https://github.com/fidelthomet/privacy-preserving-proximity-tracing/"">published on Github  under an open license. "," A major difficulty was that we had to develop our scrollytelling in sync with the actual development of the app.During our conception, there were ongoing discussions at the German and European level about whether to go for a centralised or decentralised approach, which was central to our project. On top of that, the publication of the app became several times.   Another challenge was the academic context in which the discussion about the specific functionality of the app took place.We had to fight our way through highly complex and constantly changing technical documents and papers. All this with the task of reproducing them as simplified as possible, but still correctly. "," First and foremost, they can learn that the use of interactive and visual formats are much more reader-friendly and allow for a higher degree of editorial creativity. We thus managed to convey the complex technical concepts and interrelationships in short and easily understandable text segments.   Transparency also plays a major role. Especially in this day and age, it is elementary to reference plausible sources that any reader can easily verify. We also believe it is helpful to publish the source code as well.

The burden of the virus is not spread evenly across the state, and our tracker’s charts and maps make it easy for readers to see how the situation is unfolding in their area. It is our goal to make this data as simple to understand as possible, because it is so important. "," What distinguishes the Tribune’s coronavirus tracker from our competitors is its clear design and its focus on accountability. It is our goal to make this data as simple to understand as possible for our readers, most of whom (like us!) are not epidemiologists. As Texas rolled back its restrictions and cases surged multiple times in 2020, we wanted a clear, reliable place for readers to understand the situation and how state leaders’ decisions impacted their personal safety.   The Texas Tribune’s case tracker was the Tribune’s most-visited story of 2020, with 2.65 million page views from 834,000 users from April through December. Users also spent more than more than three minutes on the page, which is more than double the average time spent on all other Tribune stories.   We know that the story attracted a very loyal audience, because a large portion of readers get to the page via direct links, indicating they’ve bookmarked the tracker and check it regularly. Data from the tracker also led to dozens of related stories, and the tracker charts were embedded across our site and others. Charts from the tracker were republished by news organizations across the state. "," This story was created by a team of data reporters and developers, and updating the story every day requires innovation and creative storytelling techniques. When updating we use a Python scraper to fetch the state’s data from multiple sites and insert it into our own database. Then, we use that data to publish a page with interactive maps and charts built using D3, a javascript charting library. All of this is based on the Tribune’s open-source, dynamic page publishing platform. Because the data changes every day as the pandemic situation changes, the charts must be dynamic and flexible. The maps and charts can also be embedded in Tribune stories or by our media partners across Texas. "," Throughout the pandemic, the state has repeatedly changed the way it reports the data, and the team of journalists on this story responded to those changes on the fly. For instance, the state added new, more accurate data as pandemic upfolded, as well as introduced errors that needed to be explained to readers. We rebuilt our data scrapers and redesigned the presentation of the tracker again and again as the story — and the virus — evolved. This story also requires a high level of team coordination and communication to pull off updates every day of the week for nine months. We take turns and share the load, and we all have the state health department’s press officers on speed dial to resolve frequent problems with the data on their end. "," A data tracker that updates every day and has no set end point is a huge undertaking — especially when it features data that is brand new to everyone involved. Everyone on the team producing the story needs to be ready to collaborate, adapt and support each other.   ",https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2020/texas-coronavirus-cases-map/,https://web.archive.org/web/20200415030216/https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2020/texas-coronavirus-cases-map/,https://web.archive.org/web/20201229180827/https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2020/texas-coronavirus-cases-map/,,,,,,"Chris Essig, Mandi Cai, Carla Astudillo, Anna Novak and Darla Cameron"," Chris Essig, Mandi Cai, Carla Astudillo, Anna Novak and Darla Cameron are the data visuals team for this project at the Texas Tribune, a nonprofit newsroom covering state politics and policy.

United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Shortlist,Covid-19: The global crisis in data,18/10/20,"Explainer, Long-form, Cross-border, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health, Economy","Animation, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, R, RStudio, Node.js"," As part of a major series examining whether the world could have been spared from hte pandemic, the Financial Times Visual and Data Journalism team compiled and analysed data from around the world to produce a definitive, visually immersive analysis of the Covid-19 pandemic. Presented as a series of chronological chapters, the story used cutting-edge web design and data analysis/visualisation techniques to take readers on an authoritative journey from Wuhan, China in January, through to Europe's second wave in October. "," As part of the FT's key coverage of the crisis, the story was made free-to-read and achieved outstanding reader engagement metrics. Most importantly, with an average viewing duration of over six minutes across hundreds of thousands of page views, this piece engaged and informed our readers. It was widely shared to enormously positive reviews on social media, including by one member of the UK government's own Covid-19 science advisory committe (SAGE).   We delievered a compelling, tightly integrated combination of rich storytelling and in-depth analysis. The piece was cited by noted SEO expert Rand Fishkin as an example of '10x content' - ""content that is at least ten times better than the next best piece of content available online on that same topic"".   The story concentrated on describing paradoxes of the crisis or debunking myths including     The false trade-off between protecting citizens and protecting economies   How China contained the virus amid the miggest mass human migration on the planet   How nowhere in the US is like the US (the problem of aggregates)    Each one of these chapters, supporting by data and visuals, was crafted to better inform the public about the biggest threat to global health in a century. We think we succeeded - the piece became a much-cited reference point in critical debates in the early weeks of Europe's second wave.     "," Firstly, I want to give some emphasis to the design process ahead of the tools used.   The story was designed from the ground up to provide a positive user experience, led by our User Experience Editor. We agreed in early team design sessions that we wanted to give the reader 'intelligent incentives to keep scrolling'. Care and attention was given to every user interface element and how it would support the story. For example, an autoplaying video topper on the page was created to generate an emotional entry point for the reader based on particularly memorable moments from an unforgettable year. Meanwhile, a scrollytelling intro that provided some tension/teasing ahead of the detail that was to follow. Then, a scrollytelling approach deliberately connected each unfolding regional chapter to the bigger picture of the global death toll.   Next I want to talk about how we used data.   Data is often accused of being 'sterile', but we wanted the piece to generate an emotional response. We achieved this through careful design, not just with the intro, but with elements such as the gradual animated unfolding of the central streamgraph's horrific death toll and the use of 'active titles' on each chart: data became visual rhetoric.   In terms of tools, we used an understandably broad range: the page itself was constructed with customised React and D3; R, QGIS and Adobe Illustrator were used to create the inline graphics within chapters, which were then rendered as SVG on the page. Video elements were prepped with Adobe AfterEffect/sElements. Zeplin was used for bespoke page design. "," Without doubt, the hardest part of this project was planning and executing a hugely ambitious piece of work around a story that was still evolving at a rapid pace.   Our solution to this challenge was to run a parallel development process with user experience and page design being carried out in parallel with story development: Early in the project, the entire team worked together to agree a narrative vehicle for the piece: that it would be a combination of chronological and geographical. With the design work addressing that broad remit, individual chapter authors were then drawn from across the Visual and Data Journalism team who would research, visualise and write individual sections of the story. Earlier chapters were created first, providing a model for later chapters to follow. This approach meant that, althoug the piece took around two months from conception to publication, it still incorprated up-to-date information and analysis at the time it was published.   Another big advantage to the project's workflow was that it drew on work that had already been carried out by the team earlier in the crisis;     The prominent 'streamgraph' that provided the visual spine of the story — the terrible human toll of the crisis — drew data directly from the team's coronavirus tracker project.    The individual chapters were produced by data journalists who had already been intimately involved in data reporting on the pandemic from its early stages    We feel that the piece exudes a confidence that was created by six months of constant effort tracking, analysing and reporting the biggest global story of this century.     "," That it pays to put charts and maps on a page first and write around them! So often, newsroom workflows are dominated by an intertial compulsion to produce copy first, with graphics to follow as decoration. We feel that the cohesive narrative presented by the 2,000+ words in the story was entirely down to the way that the graphical analysis was used to compose the chapters and broader narrative structure of the piece first. The words followed — and were more confident because of it.   Having said that, we also feel that this piece reflects how important it is that data journalists should be encouraged to actually  write  longer stories — all too often, data jouranlists are thought of as 'the graphics people'. In this piece, the words were finely crafted by writers who knew the data best — and it shows. It was particularly pleasing that entire sentences from the story were shared on social media almost as much as the graphics were, proving this was a story with substance and something to say.

The never-before-seen data shows how heat and humidity will push the South and Gulf Coast almost to be almost unlivable, while the upper midwest will become a more ideal place to live and farm. Together this is one of the most complete views of what our climate future looks like. "," This project was one of our most-viewed single pages on the website all year. We’ve heard from many, many readers that by stacking the information in an additive way -- showing how these individual problems will all affect the US in different ways, together -- we’ve driven home a key set of problems in the climate crisis that hadn’t been as clear before.  "," We used QGIS and Postgres/PostGIS for data analysis, and d3, Svelte.js, Illustrator and Photoshop for presentation. "," The hardest part of this project was figuring out how to combine seemingly disparate climate data sets into a complete portrait of the future of climate in the United States. From temperature to sea level rise to economic damages in dollars to the very concept of a ""niche"" that represents the ideal human habitation zone, we needed to show how individual counties ranked across the criteria. To solve this, the graphic includes three different visualizations: a globe, a set of county maps and a ranked table to let the reader explore these variables individually and then how they stack up together. Rather than attempt to create a combined index, the sortable table lets readers see how certain variables work together to amplify climate risks. "," A big lesson that can be learned from this piece is that organizing and designing data visualizations from existing datasets effectively can be more impactful and revelatory than publishing wholly new datasets. While this project did have some exclusive data, the lead visualization and a number of county datasets were surfaced from existing sources. The niche dataset had been out in the world as a paper, but had not been translated into an effective visual yet. We worked with the paper's authors to surface parts of the work most applicable to the US to create a piece that grabbed millions of eyeballs.  ",https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/,,,,,,,,"Al Shaw, Abrahm Lustgarten, Jeremy W.

That is partly because traffic planners have hardly ever conducted structured surveys of what types of bike lanes feel safe. Motorists and pedestrians haven’t been asked what kind of cycling infrastructure feels safe for them. The Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab teamed up with the startup FixMyCity and researchers to build a visual intuitive survey that allows to evaluate different types of road design.  "," More than 22.000 people participated in the survey, which was only possible thanks to the cooperation of the daily newspaper and experts, mixed with a playful design of the articles and the survey. The survey was shared nationally and internationally on social media.     The results attracted international attention and have since been as hotly debated in public as among experts. Furthermore, they became part of planning concepts between politicians and traffic planners. The generated data was published as open data for city planners to work with.   "," For the survey, thousands of photorealistic renderings were automatically generated by the research project. These simulated scenes all presented different combinations of bike lane features – such as width, color, demarcation or the position of parking spaces or amount of traffic on the street. This guaranteed that the individual factors could be separated in the evaluation afterwards.     For the data analysis we used Python pandas next to several other kinds of self-developed algorithms. Both teams worked together on the analysis – while working in close exchange with research experts and planners.   "," Straßencheck is a good example of how science and journalists can benefit from collaborations.

Portugal,Público,Big,Shortlist,What are the coffee shops and restaurants 300m from schools? Check out the map,15/09/20,"Breaking news, Database, News application, Map, Business, Health","Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, R, RStudio"," At the start of the school year, and amid the covid-19 pandemic, the Portuguese government ruled that every coffee shops, bakeries, and restaurants at 300 meters by any school would have a limit of four people by a table. But how many businesses were affected by this rule? No one seemed to know - not even the government.   Scrapping a geolocated database of Portuguese schools, and using Google Places API, we manage to find out that at least 21 thousand businesses were affected. ", This story was very successful because it answered the questions that the government was not able to answer when they announced the law: how many businesses were affected by it and how could a business owner (and their clients) know if that business was under that rule. ," The first challenge was to find a geolocated database of all schools and universities in the country. I had a list of all schools and I've added the university campus to it and was ready to geolocate it all. But then I've found that the Portuguese government <a class=""editor-rtfLink"" href=""http://www.igefe.mec.pt/PesquisaRede"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;; color: #4a6ee0;"" target=""_blank""> had that database   but you had to use a complex system of dropdowns to get the geolocation of any school. Fortunately, I was able to find the json file that was feeding that website which had all the coordinates for all schools. Using R, I've converted that json file to a data frame.   Because this website lacked all college institutions, I had to use <a class=""editor-rtfLink"" href=""https://www.dgeec.mec.pt/np4/38/?form"" style=""color: rgb(14, 16, 26); background: transparent; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt;; color: #4a6ee0;"" target=""_blank""> another database   and then geolocate all of them by hand.   With all the data loaded, I've used Google Places API to request all coffee shops and restaurants 300meters close to any of those coordinates. Because the API returned results that were not 300 meters close to that point, I then calculated the euclidean distance to the point, filtering out those cases that were too far away.   Then, while a reporter contacted some of the businesses that were affected by the rules, I built an interactive map using Mapbox that allowed the readers to explore the business affected by the law. "," Time and the bill. This was a kind of breaking news story and we had to answer fast to it. Finding all schools coordinates took me half a day, but I wasn’t considering the time that asking that data would take me.  I also had a little problem with Google Cloud. I was using the free credit they give you when you create an account and was expecting it to only give me the results that were precisely 300m from those points. After doing quick math based on the results from the first 200 schools, I thought that I would hardly pass that amount. But I forgot that the big cities were not yet collected, where there are more schools and more business - also some businesses were under the radar of two schools, which meant that I would have to delete those duplicates later - but they counted as an API request anyway. It was 4 am when I went to sleep, expecting the data to be all collected in the morning. It was indeed, but with a 300 euros bill. "," This kind of project is the kind that shows pretty well how data journalism can work on breaking news and how a data journalist's brain works. Most people thought it would be impossible to measure how many businesses were affected, but I thought about the possibility of using the school's coordinates and Google Places API to answer it. Of course, it is an estimate - I was not able to request Bars and Bakeries because of my bill problem. And we need to take into consideration the fact that there’s a percentage of businesses that are not on Google Maps.

Freedoms were stripped from people overnight in the huge wave of prosecutions that followed. Society began to cast doubt on the fairness and independence of the judiciary.      By cross referencing court records, news reports, and police numbers, we at The Initium Media produced an interactive documentation of this mass prosecution.      We also conducted in-depth interviews with those prosecuted and their lawyers, shining light on the pressures they face after being arrested, and issues such as excessive police powers and injustice.  ","   Initium Media targets the readers coming from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China who may have different impressions or attitudes towards the protesters in the anti-extradition bill movement. The access-free interactive website depicted a whole picture of the arrest and prosecution the protesters faced.      Most of the interviewees had concerns about confidentiality and wanted to be anonymous. It was a challenge for the storyteller. What we chose was to record their voices and merge their stories with words, figures, and graphics like an online Human Library.       Unlike the traditional practice, the project did not just focus on the personal experience of the interviewees which may be a bit biased, but tried to balance with a thorough explanation of the legal proceedings and supporting data. For instance, one interviewee had disclosed the verbal abuse of Hong Kong police. In order to show that was not a tip of the iceberg, our team had recorded all the complaints the counsel filed in the courts.       The impact of such a balanced and organized way to tell a story with both emotional elements and objective data would well convince the readers and challenge their prejudices.

The data is imported in the format of Json. The map layout is created with leaflet.js. Also, with the help of gsap, some infographics become animated and interactive.","   Data Collection is the hardest part of the project. The process of acquiring data was full of hindrances. The project intended to give the readers a whole picture of how the protesters of Anti E-lab movement undergo legal proceedings and comprehensive analysis of the cases.       While the Hong Kong judiciary erases the court list within 2-3 days' time. Firstly, we have to manually archive the documents on a daily basis in order to keep a tracking record. The information we needed for the project was scattered. There was no shortcut to gather the relevant information. What we did was to enter every single data from the court list and several media reports to build an all-inclusive database.       Moreover, the government refused to provide our team with certain figures, though the information was generally regarded as not sensitive. For example, more than half defendants were being charged with riot. But when and at what occasion were they being arrested? Unfortunately, there is no formal Archives Law in Hong Kong but only a non-binding ‘Code on the Access to Information’. Our journalist had once proceeded with an application; in the end, the officials still refused to disclose the information. Our team had to cross-check with all cases reported in the newspaper day by day to figure out the data we needed.       Hong Kong is now full of tension and distrust. Under such circumstances, it was extremely difficult to find interviewees than in the normal time. Most of the protesters had concerns about confidentiality even though they wanted their stories to be heard. Our journalist had been to different magistracies and contracted several protesters directly to search for a story that can represent a relatively comprehensive picture.  The efforts our team had devoted to this project should be well recognized.  "," The project embodies what ‘never says never’ is. The team had made a great effort to break through the limitations. Data collection is never an easy task, especially in the times that the government is holding a hostile attitude towards the media. What we can choose was either to pick the incomplete or even biased information from the officials or to find another way to develop our own database to convey a comprehensive angle of view. We journalists shall never give up on asking more and more details even if the path is much more difficult.       Another breakthrough is to turn the crisis into opportunity. When the interviewees rejected to disclose their identities, it was extremely hard to tell a good story with only texts and images. We then made use of sound as an impressive medium, in a way to balance the concern of confidentiality but still iIndulge the readers with the personal experience of the interviewees.    The skills may not be innovative for other journalists but the attitude to think out of-the-box is the spirit which the industry is looking for.

By calculating the intersection of those datasets we were able to reveal the animals hardest hit by bushfires.     Many species, including some that are critically endangered, have seen large swathes of their environment destroyed. Some of these species have had the majority of their territory wiped out, raising fears of extinction. "," This was the most in-depth analysis of habitat damage published at the time. Other news organisations and government agencies were publishing estimates and approximate headline figures, but we were able to give a detailed account of every animal individually.    After publication we were contacted by individuals and wildlife organisations asking about access to the raw data and analysis. It was seen as important information as attention turned to rebuilding habitats and protecting the species that were most vulnerable. "," We processed massive amounts of satellite-derived fire data and slowly built up our own “burned area” analysis. We then took more than 1,400 habitat spatial files and ran batch calculations in order to find the intersection of the two data sets, revealing the burned percentage and acreage of each habitat. This exclusive dataset showed us which animals were hardest hit by bushfires.     There was also a large amount of detailed cartography, satellite imagery analysis, and hand drawn illustration to tie the whole piece together as an immersive experience.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Shortlist,The Korean clusters: How coronavirus cases exploded in South Korean churches and hospitals,20/03/20,"Explainer, Infographics, Map, Health","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV"," In February 2020, South Korea announced thousands of coronavirus cases in the space of only a few days, an outbreak that initially pushed South Korea’s tally of confirmed cases much higher than anywhere else outside of China.   Reuters manually combed through daily government press releases to build a data-driven account of the spread and the emergence of patient 31, a single super spreader believed to be the source of thousands of infections. "," Our forensic reporting showed how one person could have a ripple effect in spreading the novel coronavirus. The story was lauded because of how we were able to explain the chain of transmission early in the pandemic.    The piece went viral far outside of Asia, with many on social media in the U.S. sharing it as an example of what can happen if social distancing isn’t adhered to. ", The Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention put out a detailed health bulletin every day. We had to sift through and look for specific details piecing together how “patient 31” became the inflection point for the virus in South Korea.    We were then able to build custom visualisations in the browser locally which could be exported and styled in Adobe Illustrator and placed within the story page using ai2html.     ," This story was built on manual data collection and old school reporting.

Bosnia and Herzegovina,OCCRP,Big,Shortlist,Europe's COVID-19 Spending Spree Unmasked,21/10/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, News application, Fact-checking, Infographics, Map, Corruption, Economy","Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python","   As countries across Europe fought the COVID-19 pandemic and rushed to obtain critical supplies — such as PPE and ventilators — many countries suspended their usual public procurement rules, resulting in billions of euros of spending largely hidden from the public. Along with media partners in 37 countries, OCCRP followed the money and collected information from over 37,800 COVID-19 related tenders and contracts worth over 21 billion euros (U.S. $24.9 billion). The data gives an unprecedented view of just what Europe’s governments have been spending their billions on — and where things may have gone astray.  ","   The project was the first collaborative effort by European journalists to pull together COVID-19 procurement data. It revealed that the majority of the continent's known procurement deals were signed as direct awards without tender, and that large, established companies were the major beneficiaries of the deals. The data also discovered massive discrepancies in prices paid for key items such as FFP2 masks, and identified countries — such as Ukraine and Czechia — where the prices paid varied most wildly.  The project also comprehensively documented which countries have been the most transparent about sharing data, and which countries have remained “black holes” for COVID-19 procurement information.      After publication, the authors were invited to speak on various events ranging from journalistic seminars through procurement specialist calls to the annual Transparency International Anti-Corruption Conference. At these occasions, colleagues could access the data and grievances were shared about the lack of transparency over irregular public spending (little competition) with expert audiences. One of the authors, Adriana Homolova, was also approached by the Dutch government to help design a more transparent system for public contracts publication, a project that was already in the pipeline of the government. Adriana is still being approached to speak about the data at universities and with procurement and open data researchers. The data collected will also be integrated into OpenContracting's “Emergency Procurement Explorer.”  ",   We used Python and Jupyter Notebooks to write scraping scripts for various public procurement websites and for data cleaning. This data was then fed into a Google Spreadsheet that was openly editable by anybody from the team and in the end was also used for data publication. Data visualisations for the publication were done with Flourish. Aleph was used to upload and search contracts and documents that were not public before.  ,"   The hardest part of this project was its sheer size. This project involved the coordination of dozens of individual journalists, all working to balance the demands of their own newsrooms, wrestling with a massive amount of data. Journalists stayed in regular contact via the Signal app, and over a period of months collaborated on a strategy to obtain and process extremely large and diverse data, regularly updating their findings in central spreadsheets and a wiki. This could have easily collapsed into chaos, but a core team worked diligently to make sure all data was properly inputted and the team was kept abreast of updates. Instead, the project managed to keep going thanks to a spirit of public service and constant communication and feedback from all involved. As for the data, the hardest part was to standardize very different data sources (official websites in many countries, FOIA requests, data leaks, TED data etc) into one coherent data set. This also unfortunately made it nearly impossible to keep it up to date properly.  ","   This one-of-a-kind trove of data gives journalists a starting point to further investigate government spending in their own countries. Compiling this data in one place allowed reporters to compare government spending and ask questions that held their governments to account: Why did mask prices fluctuate so wildly from country to country? Why isn't my government releasing this data when others are? OCCRP encouraged journalists to investigate COVID-19 related records in their countries and offered original source documents and assistance.          Information about government procurement is notoriously arcane for reporters to analyze: not only is the data itself incredibly complex in its structure (a tabular version of TED awards, the European procurement system, might have 150 columns), but it also requires a deep understanding of the legal and political process required for public institutions to spend billions of Euros. The pandemic compelled governments to deviate from their legal rules in ways that still needed to be proportional to the severity of the emergency. Holding power to account in this context requires a tight integration of data analysis and policy analysis.      We hope that now we’ve learned how to analyse EU procurement data in a crisis that put a special spotlight on the process, we can also encourage more reporters to dig into the data.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,The Economist's covid-19 excess deaths tracker,04/04/20,"Explainer, Cross-border, Open data, Chart","Scraping, D3.js, R"," In early April 2020, we published the world’s first international comparison of covid-19 excess mortality, after tip-offs from people in Italy and France that official death tolls were undercounting the actual number of fatalities. Later that month, we published the first interactive tracking page for excess mortality, showing data for several countries. In May, we were the first organisation to publish all of this data on GitHub, along with our sources and code. We have updated the database regularly since then, while expanding our selection of countries. "," Excess mortality is the best way to compare the impact of covid-19 across countries. Varied levels of testing, especially in developing nations, can make official death tolls unreliable. In April, no organisation was collecting this data internationally.    So we decided to do it ourselves. We put the tracker in front of our paywall, to act as a public service. We also published all of our data, sources and code on GitHub. We wanted academics to trust our work, and to give them the tools they needed for their own research. According to <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22economist.com%22+%22excess+deaths%22+%22covid%22"">Google Scholar,  our work on excess mortality has been cited in more than 120 academic articles.   This has shaped global awareness of excess mortality. After we published our tracking pages, other organisations (such as the New York Times and Financial Times) produced similar work. Governments also took notice. When we started out, only a handful published regular mortality data. Now, dozens do.    One notable example of our journalism encouraging greater transparency was in Mexico. The health ministry cited our tracker in official briefings (see this <a href=""https://twitter.com/jorgegavino/status/1303066030445604864"">link ). It then started to publish data in a similar format, replicating our heatmaps (see this <a href=""https://coronavirus.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Bol_Excs_Mort_MX_SE31_09Sep2020_20h30-1.pdf#page=24"">link ). Mexico has one of the world's highest rates of excess mortality, which is 150% greater than the official covid-19 death toll. It would not have been possible to establish this without the health ministry releasing this data.    "," To gather the data, we used a combination of R scripts and lots of manual labour. For some countries, we could automatically download data and clean it into the right format. For others, we had to access spreadsheets by hand, or even copy charts from official websites into a machine-readable format.   Once we had data in clean CSVs, we trained regression models in R that could predict a baseline of expected deaths in each week or month of 2020, based on national trends from recent years.   The graphics were written with React and D3.js. We think that one of the things that sets our tracker apart from others published by our competitors is that we made every chart interactive. We believe that in a topic as complicated as this one it’s even more important to be transparent, so we added tooltips to every chart, showing expected and total deaths for each point. We also added a toggle to switch between deaths per 100,000 people and absolute figures.   The tracker has been changing too: at the beginning of the pandemic it was mostly a grid of line charts, but after doubling the number of countries we redesigned the page. We added a heatmap with country and regional data and a little explainer that walks the reader through the concept of expected and total deaths. "," There were several challenging aspects of this project. Gathering the data in the first place required lots of investigating of government websites, many of which are in languages other than English. We sent emails to several possible sources, and asked The Economist’s correspondents from around the world to help track down information. Wrangling the numbers from different countries into a consistent format took a lot of effort.   Refreshing the data and adding new countries has also proved tricky and time consuming. Throughout the pandemic, we have tried to keep the page as up-to-date as possible. We have also answered several queries from readers.   Even after spending dozens of hours making the data consistent, we spent a considerable amount of time getting the little details right on the visualisations. Most countries publish weekly data but some only publish monthly files. Some countries don’t have nationwide data available, only major cities. We ended up adding multiple footnotes and different code paths to account for these.    "," Hopefully this project has demonstrated the importance of publishing data and code on GitHub, since it has allowed academics to interrogate our work, and also to use it in their own research. This project has also shown the benefits of automating work with R scripts. Updating every single source each week by hand would have been very cumbersome; increasingly, we can gather most of the data by directly downloading CSVs from government websites.

Serbia,KRIK,Small,Citation,"Database ""Judge who Judges"" (""Prosudi ko sudi"")",08/12/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Illustration, Politics, Corruption, Crime",Animation," Who are the judges who make decisions in the most important trials in Serbia? Why do many of those cases end up with the release of controversial businessmen, politicians, and criminals? How do judges progress in their careers, when they made illegal decisions, what property do they own?   KRIK's unique online database ""<a href=""http://prosudikosudi.rs/index.php"">Judge who judges ""  provides answers to all these questions.  Our new innovative database is the   only place  where you can read the complete profiles of 33 Serbian high-ranked judges,  who act in the main departments for organized crime and corruption. "," Believe it or not, this is the first time that someone in Serbia has tackled this topic, no one before KRIK has dared to raise the issue of accountability and transparency of judges . And now,   it is finally possible for Serbian citizens to have insight in work of high-ranked judges, to have informed opinions as the first step in the fight against corruption in judiciary, since our readers can now “judge the judges” .   This investigation had a huge impact, on several levels – it has   launched a significant public debate on accountability of judges and transparency of their work and income . Findings from our database were republished dozens of times in other Serbian media, our reporters and editors were called to talk in several TV shows, dedicated exclusively to our investigation of Serbian judiciary. Database has attracted enormous public attention, so already in the first month since launching our database had half million of visits,  which is remarkable result for a small country such as Serbia. Citizens were hungry for this information since they previously could not get data about judges anywhere and so they showered us with praise on social networks.   Some of the judges even subsequently contacted us to declare and explain their assets ! More importantly, <a href=""https://www.krik.rs/nakon-otkrica-krik-a-agencija-proverava-imovinu-sudije-savica/"">  state Agency  for the Prevention of Corruption has recently   launched its own investigation    of the origin of huge property of one of the judges we wrote about (Zoran Savic),    precisely because we discovered the disproportion of wealth in relation to his income ! This state investigation is currently ongoing. "," In Serbia there was no such database which was dedicated exclusively to transparency of the work of judges. That is why KRIK’s database was made carefully and thoroughly, by digging and combining data from all available official sources and archives in one place .   Our Database now contains narrative information on seven different areas :   1) judges’ career and promotions, 2) court cases he/she worked on, 3) illegal decisions (verdicts) he/she made, 4) proceedings led against judges - disciplinary, misdemeanor, 5) reported and undeclared property (of course without publishing addresses), 6) judges’ professional engagement out of court and 7) compromising business alliances. All of these were collected from official sources and registers.   The process looks as following: the journalists first started to search basic information about the judges’: immediate family members’ names, potential companies, declared assets, political connections, and possible records of proceedings. One part of this is to do initial online research. Then we mostly had to communicate directly with the courts and other official archives, since most data about judges were not available online. We filed hundreds of requests for documents and data to Serbian courts and state registers .   Our team has done detailed analysis of every collected document. After that, we have contacted all judges which we investigated  and included their answers and reactions to our discoveries in their profiles in that database. "," As mentioned above, this is the first time that someone in Serbia has tackled this topic, no one before KRIK has dared to raise the issue of accountability and transparency of judges. Our database is new and unique, that is why it was especially difficult, first we had to convince judges to talk to us!     Despite the public importance of what they do, Serbian judges usually do not want to communicate with the media. Prior to the publication of the database, KRIK tried to interview all 33 judges, but most (two thirds) did not respond to the invitation. However, some contacted us later when they saw the database and gave us quotes, which we have added to their profiles.   Also, Serbian associations of judges were divided in commenting our database, ones stubbornly continued to defend their secrecy and  they had publicly attacked KRIK,  saying that “ journalists have no rights to report about judges and their work ”, which is complete nonsense and testifies to their unprofessionalism. But the other Serbian association and several independent professionals pointed out how important it is to increase judicial transparency in such way as KRIK did. "," It took as more than a year to make this database and it was worth it, citizens were hungry for this data. It is always crucial to find a hole in a society that only quality investigative journalism can fill and then to be of service to its readers.      We will continue to update our database, KRIK team is immensely proud we have contributed to transparency in Serbian society!

United States,Bloomberg,Big,Shortlist,Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker,04/12/20,"Database, Infographics, Chart, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Node.js"," The Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker is the most up-to-date and comprehensive tally of vaccinations in the U.S. and around the globe, powered by a network of Bloomberg reporters in more than 50 countries who collect data from local sources unavailable in any other government or public dashboard. "," Bloomberg's tracker has been cited repeatedly by state governments (including Illinois, West Virginia, Connecticut and California), elected officials, international governments and news organizations (including MSNBC, PBS, Politico and Axios).  California, after falling behind most other states in its vaccination campaign on Bloomberg's rankings, launched a statewide data review and found that health-care providers were not properly submitting vaccination records. Maryland also moved to address what it said were problems with slow reporting because of its position on Bloomberg's ranking. In other states, citizens have used Bloomberg's dashboard and rankings to ask state officials why vaccine rollouts are moving ahead slowly.  In South Korea -- lauded for its pandemic response -- local media used Bloomberg's database of vaccine contracts to ask the government why it had not announced deals to acquire the shots. The deals were announced days later. "," The data entry and fact-checking are done through a massive and well-designed Google Sheets system, where reporters and editors take shifts working around the clock, entering data from government sources, and check each others' work. The data then goes through a processing and cleaning pipeline to eliminate questionable entries. This data pipeline is built in Node.js. Historical data is reconstructed through daily snapshots of the data and takes into consideration government data revises. "," The hardest part is to built and maintain this comprehensive vaccination database that doesn't exist anywhere. Because of the lack of international and even national data disclosure standards, it's challenging to deal with the data inconsistency issues. It is also challenging to build a clean and well maintained data pipeline, while coming up with the most relevant graphics that captures what people care about the most in the news "," The lesson that other journalists can learn from the project is that automation cannot replace reporting. At the very beginning, we considered making the process fully automated, scraping states' and countries' vaccine dashboards. We soon realized that it would highly limit the number of states and countries we are able to include in the tracker. The half-automated process we finally decided on allowed us to include as many states and countries as possible, and at the same time to have built-in measures to prevent human errors.

United States,Bloomberg,Big,Shortlist,Deadliest Mass Shootings Are Often Preceded by Violence at Home,30/06/20,"Investigation, Infographics, Women, Crime, Gun violence","Scraping, D3.js, CSV, Python, Node.js"," This story examines the relationship between domestic violence and mass shootings, weaving together personal narratives, data analysis and policy failures on a local and national scale to investigate one of the human costs of this country’s lax gun control laws. It analyzes 749 shootings from 2014 to 2019—the largest and most comprehensive by far of an analysis of this kind--to find that 60% of shootings with four or more victims were either domestic violence incidents or committed by men with histories of domestic violence. "," The story was shared by researchers and organizations such as Everytown, the Trace, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Giffords Courage, Moms Demand Action, and the Canadian Femicide Observatory.    It provided overwhelming evidence of the links between domestic violence and mass shootings. It was also the first large-scale study to expand the data beyond the deadlist mass shootings—reasoning that attempts upon lives should be taken just as seriously, whether victims ultimately survive or not. In doing so, it was the first study to find that mass shootings with domestic violence links were also more deadly.

Colombia,"La Paz en el Terreno, Rutas del Conflicto, Colombia2020 - El Espectador",Small,Shortlist,Risk maps: threats against communitarian leaders and Human Rights defenders in Colombia,08/05/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Women, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights","D3.js, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," After the Peace Agreement between the Colombian Government and the former FARC guerilla in 2016, thousands of communitarian leaders have been killed, threatened and prosecuted for defending Human Rights and the Peace Agreement implementation, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the inefficiency of the security measures granted by the Government, we, alongside these communitarian leaders, are building risk maps which warn of the dangers around their social work in the most violent regions of the country and point to urgent actions to mitigate that systematic violence.    "," Beside the fact that these maps have raised alert to the authorities responsible of fighting these risks, the most important impact of the project has been accompanying and recognizing the Colombian communitarian leaders and Human Rights defenders. In the meantime, the commercial press has limited itself to counting victims and has moved away from journalistic coverage in remote regions of Colombia, due to the difficulties that the pandemic has brought.   With a publishing strategy in multimedia and printed press —booklets and publications in El Espectador, the second-largest newspaper in Colombia— we have added to the positioning of this important issue on the country's news agenda, explaining the contexts around the risks and the interests of those behind this violence.   The quality of the investigations has been recognized by decision-making sectors in Colombian society, such as the Truth Commission and the Special Jurisdiction for Peace, institutions created after the Peace Agreement that have requested our work as input for their investigations in their mission to recognize the rights of victims and survivors of the conflict.   Also, we have encouraged the participation of the audiences of this journalistic alliance in clarifying these contexts of violence. La Paz en el Terreno (The Peace on the Ground) has a citizen communication channel (Your Memory Counts) that receives complaints, additional information and proposals for new topics to map.   Finally, the impact has also been evidenced in the interest of international cooperation organizations to support our work. Today we have the support of the UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) and the German Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung foundation, with whom we have worked on the development of these maps since 2019 and we will continue with other mappings in 2021.    "," Through workshops with cartographies, interviews, and safe spaces —both physical and virtual— to which groups of Human Rights defenders from the same regions are invited, it is possible to determine these risk maps, digitalized and published in multimedia and printed formats. Unique data journalistic pieces which show this issue in a way that could not be possible otherwise.   These risk maps are constructed under a team methodology and seek, through cartography, to involve the communities affected by the armed conflict in the construction of their information, so that it can then be contrasted, verified and contextualized. We adapted our methodology to remote, protected video communication due to the COVID-19 pandemic.    In terms of journalistic practices, this initiative of risk maps is characterized by an empathic approach with the sources or participants of the cartographic workshops.   Once we collect the information from the physical maps, they are systematized in databases, digitized, illustrated and built with the D3 Javascript library. These maps are contrasted with expert and official sources, especially the Army and the Police Force, many times responsible for these risk contexts.   Additionally, information from the databases of social organizations, state institutions and our records on violence against communitarian leaders and Human Rights defenders in each region is cross-checked to establish patterns of this violence, obtain investigation leads and build infographics that clarify the dimension of these attacks in each territory.   The material is gathered and explained in interactive reports built in HTML5, published on the websites of  Rutas del Conflicto (Routes of the Conflict), Colombia2020 by El Espectador and La Paz en Terreno, as well as in radio and print.    "," When community leaders are asked how others can contribute to the protection of their lives, they have repeated the answer in every possible public platform: by responsibly making their situation visible. The experience of La Paz en el Terreno has shown us that showcasing the leadership of some attacked Human Rights defenders can work as a protection measure, but it is something that must be done with great care and responsibly handled information.    In most cases, we exercise anonymity, reliable contact channels and physical, digital, emotional and gender-sensitive security protocols. The Foundation for Press Freedom has endorsed these protocols. In this way, we shield the security of our journalists, allies and sources.   On the other hand, due to the contexts of violence and inequality that surround the majority of community leaders, there are great difficulties in obtaining information, not only for security reasons but also because of the difficult access to communities, often far from the big cities. There, the collaboration of allies such as local social organizations and organizations from international cooperation has been key. They have a long history working with these populations, a wide recognition in these regions and are an important source of trust. These organizations have served as a bridge between us and groups of community leaders.   Another major challenge to accomplish this work in 2020 was the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the impossibility of meeting in person with our sources in the first months of the pandemic, it was necessary to adapt the methodology of the cartographic workshops to the virtual plane. Once the emergency somehow diminished, we were able to travel and meet, but keeping the respective biosecurity measures.    "," A belief that we share with many colleagues around the world is that journalism must go beyond reporting what is happening; it must also be deeply committed to social change. This project seeks to be useful for the dignity and recognition of the victims of the armed conflict, as well as an active agent in the construction of peace.   In particular, this project teaches that:     There are tools for social research, typical of Humanities and Social Sciences, that can be extremely useful for journalism, especially when it seeks to closely understand the voices and views of those who generally do not participate in the public sphere, like victims. One of these is social cartography, which proves quite valuable for journalistic research aimed to understand the territory through the eyes of our sources, identify and rethink social problems through maps, images and stories, and involve the protagonists of the stories in the construction of their own information. All of this material can also be subject to data journalism techniques, as we do in our work.   If we are small, it will always be better to find allies. This journalistic alliance shows that the union between journalistic projects that have similar interests can produce relevant and useful synergies for people. Rutas del Conflicto is a specialized media-outlet in research and data journalism and Colombia2020 covers day to day news and has a range of reach of tens of thousands of people. Both projects saw the need to come together to monitor violence against communitarian leaders, one of the most critical issues in terms of serious Human Rights violations in the country today.   After treating the information, you should give it back to the sources. The booklets are sent to the leaders and their communities.   A pandemic cannot stop good journalism.

How Kyrgyz businessmen fakes competition for 83 million soms,15/07/20,"Investigation, Database, Video, Corruption, Economy","Json, Python","   Kyrgyz businessmen imitate competition and win state tenders without any obstacles, because there are no other participants besides them. The law prohibits entering into contracts with such companies and calls it a ""conflict of interest.""      For this project we scrapped and combined the databases of state procurements and legal entities registered with the Ministry of Justice.   "," The whole project was not just publishing story, we conducted a series of online training sessions for all who were interested in learning Neo4J graph database (around 20 participants not only from Kyrgyzstan).   The explaining video has watched more than 200 000 times (both on Facebook and Instagram).    As a result of this project, after combining two databases we received a huge amount of our own data. Since we are small media we do not have enough resources to verify and work on everything.    So we decided to launch online investigation school, where we teach people journalism and investigations, while they train by working on with our data. Now we have around 100 students (althoug around 33 of them are actively participate, make all tasks and attend online classes). "," We scrapped two databases: state procurements and legal entities, combined them and used Neo4J graph database to show the connection between companies involved in state procurements. We also created an interactive interface where everyone can try and see how links are built in our database. "," Three challenging things:   1. The site of Kyrgyz state procurements itself: everything was filled in manually by employees (and often with errors and mistakes), so we double-checked the information   2. Every case needs to be veryfied to make sure that the companies are really controlled by the same people   3.

In the daily news updates, those who passed away are reported as case numbers #595, #1487, #1348, #1776, yet their lives are more than just that. This project serves as a remembrance of those lost to the pandemic, along with as many personal anecdotes as we could collect, from the lives that were lived.    "," As the pandemic got worse in Hong Kong, we felt like it was important to provide a record of those who have fallen victim to the disease. Beyond just collecting data, we were able to collect stories from those who have passed away.    One 88-year-old man visited his wife at a nursing home daily, before he succumbed to the disease. One daughter told us that she kept his 86-year-old dad’s dentures after he passed away. Another daughter told us that she wasn’t able to see his 80-year-old dad before he died because of miscommunication with quarantine officials.   Data doesn’t have to be impersonal. In these lives that were lost, there are many stories of affection, regrets, struggles. This project helped provide a chance for readers to remember those who were lost in this pandemic. "," We collected case data through various government sources, which is published in pdf format, in a google spreadsheet, and added additional anecdotal information as we collected it. We drew the illustrations of the figures representing people  with charcoal. We used d3.js for data visualization and web interactivity. "," As there is limited public information about those who have passed away, beyond just age, gender and place of residence, we had some difficulty in collecting anecdotes at first. We pieced together small bits of information from the daily coronavirus briefing when officials would announce new deaths. Along with the initial publish, we made a public call for those who have lost loved ones to reach out to us. We luckily received some responses and we were able to interview family members of several coronavirus victims, who shared details with us, as well as complaints against government arrangements that made it difficult for them to say goodbye.  "," To find families of those who have passed away from covid, we made public calls to action and were able to reach people this way.

An astonishing amount of data on criminal justice already goes uncounted or is deliberately obscured from the public. During the course of the pandemic, the need for strong data reporting behind bars has only grown more urgent and we focused on telling those stories.   ","     We were able to draw on our reporters’ expertise to write groundbreaking stories on COVID-19’s impact on the juvenile justice system, courts, policing and juries. We exposed how North Carolina prisons—despite being on lockdown—were still allowing hundreds of incarcerated people to work for local industries like chicken-processing plants, potentially bringing the virus back with them. After that exposé ran in local papers, the state closed the program. Our story on how Texas prison meals had become even more disgusting than usual prompted local lawmakers to press corrections officials to  improve the quality of the food.          Working with the Associated Press on covid tracking project  means that our data is sent to newsrooms across the country, with more than 670 citing our work. Sen. Amy Klobuchar used our data in a <a href=""https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/a/9/a9a3faa6-2122-4fd1-aebd-aaddf21921f5/1F113BD5AE7C957C6868525BBFF6B031.0508lettertoag.pdf"">letter  to former-Attorney General William Barr, while Sen. Cory Booker and Rep. Ayanna Pressley relied on our numbers in a letter to governors of five hard-hit states, urging them to release people from prison who are over 50 or have pre-existing health conditions.           Our reporting also reveals how little the Federal Bureau of Prisons has done to protect vulnerable prisoners. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries referred to our work while questioning BOP director during a House hearing, our  work  was cited in a<a href=""https://www.opn.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/20a0365p-06.pdf""> federal court ruling  allowing district courts to reduce sentences for incarcerated people in “extraordinary and compelling” circumstances—essentially, to counteract the Bureau of Prison’s reluctance.           Our August investigation into the role of the U.S. Marshals in spreading COVID-19 while transferring federal prisoners around the country led Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, and Congressman Ted Deutch, to write <a href=""https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senators-warren-booker-and-rep-deutch-demand-information-on-the-safety-of-prisoner-transportation-by-the-us-marshals-service-and-contractor-prisoner-transportation-services-amid-covid-19-pandemic"">letters  to both the Marshals Service and Prisoner Transportation Services, urging them to immediately start COVID-testing before transferring incarcerated people between facilities.  ","   For our weekly tracker, we monitor websites for all of our state and federal prison agencies using <a href=""https://newsklaxon.org/"">Klaxon,  an open-source reporting tool built by The Marshall Project. This alerts us to changes in data for many of the states. We have also built our own program that takes screenshots of most of the websites’ published data, such as it is.       We manually log all of the figures from the web and our shoe-leather reporting in a shared Google Spreadsheet, accessed by reporters at both The Marshall Project and The Associated Press. After the data has been manually checked, we run it through another battery of scripts to check for any discrepancies that need to be examined more closely.       Ultimately, our data analysis for all the projects is written in R, run through the RStudio IDE.  ","   To build and maintain the database that informs our covid tracking project has been enormously difficult. Most states provide only a fraction of the information we’re seeking. They might post positive cases and deaths, but not testing information, which makes it hard to put the number of cases into context. They might not report deaths at all. Most are not publicly reporting vaccine numbers. And some will report one set of numbers on their website with a current snapshot, without revealing that certain subsets of prisoners are being excluded. Only one or two of the departments post historic data on their site, so it’s extremely difficult to track changes over time. Very often numbers will be revised without any indication of why, for example, the number of recovered prisoners is 1,000 fewer today than it was a week ago. It requires creating our own historic snapshots and a series of checks to ensure the data’s integrity.      We try to surmount these problems by heavily employing the most powerful tool in a data journalist’s arsenal: the telephone. We contact the departments themselves every week and ask them to fill in the blanks and to answer questions about strange changes in any of the numbers. This requires persistence and a good system for examining the data as it comes in.  ","   By design, prisons and jails are among the most hidden institutions in American life, and an astonishing amount of data on criminal justice already goes uncounted or is deliberately obscured from the public. Even journalists who manage to gain access are only ever shown a highly edited version of life inside.           When we are given data, it’s often incomplete or comes out years after it’s relevant. We’ll receive thousands of pages of scanned, hand-written reports, forcing us to find time-consuming and laborious ways to pull the information into digital databases that we can use to make sense of it all and to share our knowledge with readers.          These stories, which rely on creating new data that doesn’t exist anywhere, have been incredibly demanding on our staff and our AP partners as well. To fill out the latest data from 51 agencies that are generally reticent to answer questions and have a habit of changing their answers when they do give them, demands a great deal of time and effort. To do it every week for ten months and counting is a huge undertaking. But without this data, we, and journalists and policymakers everywhere, would be operating completely in the dark as we try to assess conditions in prisons systems, and thus believe it’s crucially important that we continue to create the data and to make it available to everyone.

Hong Kong officials at first claimed to have no knowledge about the arrest, yet it was later revealed that the Hong Kong Government Flying Service flew two missions that coincided with the time and place of the arrest. This project reconstructed flight paths of government aircrafts the day of the arrest as well as months of flight records to point out suspicions around the event. "," The police and the Government Flying Service had refused to give details of the mission from the day of the arrest. Chief Executive Carrie Lam, head of the Security Bureau and the Commissioner of the Police all claimed that the Hong Kong government had nothing to do with the arrest of the 12 Hong Kongers. But through reconstruction of the flight paths, analysis of flight data, it became clear that there were irregularities in the deployment of government aircrafts the day of the arrest, building more suspicion around the event.   Hong Kong protests that began in 2019 were mounted against a proposed law that allowed extradition to China where the justice system is highly politicized. The arrest and subsequent detainment of the 12 Hong Kongers was highly significant to the protest movement in Hong Kong. The way with which the government handled information around the arrests raised even more suspicions. This project served as an important record to counter the government narrative that claimed no collusion with Chinese authorities in the arrest of the twelve Hong Kongers. "," We scraped flight data from flight tracking sites, and used R to process the data. We also utilized open source software mapshaper.js and QGIS to plot the map data. Finally we used a combination of illustrator and d3.js to visualize the information for the web. "," There was a huge amount of data associated with this story as we tried to piece together months of flight records from the Government Flying Service aircrafts. Flight tracking data is also somewhat inconsistent because of the limits of radar technology. Even after the initial effort of scraping the flight data, it was a difficult task to comb through the data and chain together flight information for individual flights in order to spot irregularities in deployment.    We also faced a quick turnaround on the stories as news was breaking fast. Each of the two visual stories was turned around in a day and involved a lot of technical challenges and reporting to pull together.    The political situation in Hong Kong has been on edge since protests began in 2019. Stories like these serve an important role in continuing to offer a spotlight on people involved in the protests as they face a government intent on stomping down opposition voices. "," Flightradar24 and FlightAware are two of the world’s largest flight tracking data companies. There are troves of information available on the sites and are an important resource in investigative journalism that involves tracking flights. Beyond just scraping data from the sites, we were also able to reach out to these companies to help answer questions in order to untangle the data.

United States,The University of Maryland's Howard Center for Investigative Journalism reporting consortium,Small,Shortlist,Nowhere to Go,02/08/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Business, Women, Health, Crime, Economy","Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","   Last year, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland collaborated with other universities to investigate the impact of homelessness and the threat of homelessness posed by the pandemic for a project called “Nowhere to Go.”      The initial stories this spring documented the criminalization of homelessness in some of the country’s least affordable cities. As the pandemic caused millions of Americans to lose their jobs, the consortium pivoted over the summer to determine whether the federal moratorium on evictions was working. This fall, it investigated evictions by public housing authorities, often the last stop before the street.  ","   The series focused attention on the plight of some of the nation’s most vulnerable people, with distribution by the Associated Press and USA Today.  By highlighting stories of individual tenants at risk of eviction, our work also led directly to some getting necessary assistance to remain housed.           It also drove the creation of two major journalistic collaborations that were launched for the project, collaborations that have continued even after this particular reporting project ended.           First, to tell these stories, we brought together data journalists and faculty at seven universities: the University of Maryland, University of Oregon, Boston University, Stanford University, the University of Florida, the University of Arkansas and Arizona State University. This multiple-university collaboration was, we believe, unprecedented in scope.  This collaboration is now working together on a new reporting project, and recruiting others to join.       Second, it kickstarted a collaborative effort to obtain hard-to-get court records in more than a dozen cities.  Data journalists working for the Howard Center at Maryland, the Big Local News project at Stanford University, USA Today and others collaboratively wrote custom, open-source software to scrape court records on evictions from online court record management systems in more than a dozen cities.  This effort was onerous -- but necessary -- because eviction records we needed to tell these stories were unavailable through other means.  This data collection effort has continued, and is even expanding.        We have open-sourced the court scraping software package we developed for this project and we continue to improve. We are also adding additional court systems to the list of jurisdictions from which we regularly collect records.  And we are starting to gather new case types, beyond just evictions.  We are releasing all the data we’ve collected on Stanford’s Big Local News data sharing platform for use by other journalists.   ","   We used several tools and technologies to bring this project to life, including:          Web scraping with Python, R and a suite of open source software libraries, including selenium.           Data analysis with Python, R and SQL, primarily working in Jupyter notebooks and R Studio.           GitHub for version control and open source tool sharing.           Open Refine for data cleaning.           ","        The hardest part of this project by far was on the data acquisition front.  Obtaining bulk court data in the U.S. is needlessly complicated.  Most state and county judicial systems in the U.S. are exempt from public records laws that would compel the release of bulk data.  When court systems do make bulk data available, they often sell access at prices unaffordable for most news organizations.          In most states, access to court records is made available through a public web application that typically allows users to look up individual cases, linked to a database back end that contains the bulk data we were after.  By writing custom web scraping software to programmatically access these sites, we were able to gather court data in bulk.           This was not an easy effort. No two web applications were alike. Though many sites employ software from a common technology vendor to power their sites, each site had its own quirks, making it difficult to write a single tool to gather all the data we needed.  And many sites had defenses designed to prevent automated tools like ours from gathering records at scale, but we developed legal techniques to defeat these systems.    ","   There are several things we think other journalists could benefit from that we discovered while working on this project.            Collaboration is a great way to take on journalism projects that are beyond the scope of one individual newsroom.  But it takes work to organize and manage correctly, especially on projects that combine student journalists with professionals.           Through this project, we have done more than just produce a package of meaningful journalism.  We have also provided other news organizations several opportunities to build on our reporting.               We have released the underlying data on evictions in more than a dozen cities for use by other journalists.           We have produced an open-source software package that they can modify to obtain court records in their local jurisdiction, and have opened the door to others who wish to join our collaboration and work alongside us.           We have also tested and implemented a stable, low-cost method for legally defeating captcha technology that could be of broad use to other journalists involved in scraping government websites.      ",https://homeless.cnsmaryland.org/,https://github.com/biglocalnews/court-scraper,https://biglocalnews.org/#/open_projects,,,,,,Howard Center for Investigative Journalism reporting consortium,"   The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, launched in 2019, gives University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism students the opportunity to work with news organizations across the country to report stories of national or international importance to the public.

United States,The New York Times,Big,Citation,Tracking the Coronavirus,03/03/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Map, Health","Personalisation, Scraping, D3.js, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Node.js"," In the vacuum left by the lack of a coordinated federal effort to disseminate data on the pandemic, we launched a project that would become the newsroom’s most ambitious data-tracking effort ever. We were one of the first organizations to provide county-level data on cases and deaths. We also compiled authoritative databases on case clusters at nursing homes, food-processing facilities, prisons and colleges. Our efforts focused on topics of public importance where timely, reliable data wasn’t available from the government. The data were presented on over 80 tracking pages, used in stories and made available to the public on Github. "," The project had a tremendous impact on many levels. Readers tell us about how they check the tracking pages every day, which are among the most-viewed pages we have ever published.   We decided early to make the county-level database freely available, extending the reach of the data far beyond the pages of The Times. It has been cited in more than 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers. It has been cited by federal agencies, like the Council of Economic Advisers, CDC and Department of Veterans Affairs, which said it would be used to provide better acute care in rural areas. Local and state officials cited the data in formulating policies. Health care companies said they were using the data to manage patients. Other companies said they were using the data to help inform when to return to the office.    The data has been cited in many news publications, and Google uses the data to power its U.S. and state dashboards whenever anyone searches for “covid cases.”   Our cluster data revealed how colleges drove Covid into areas that had been relatively virus free. It has revealed that about a third of Covid deaths are linked to nursing homes. And it has shown the wide racial gap in who gets sick and who dies.   When we began tracking nursing home cases, most states were not identifying affected facilities. We filed dozens of public records requests to surface this information. When we began tracking college cases, very few were proactively disclosing numbers. We filed more than 200 public records requests, and by mid-fall most colleges were sharing data. To analyze racial disparities, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request and successfully sued the CDC for access to its internal database. In total, we filed more than 400 public records requests for virus data. "," The county dataset of cases and deaths are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Node.js was used to create a data admin for doing QA and managing multiple sources of data for every geography, as well as to create a suite of more than 300 scrapers to collect the data. The nursing home system extends Google Sheets to use as a relational database, with both automated scrapers and news assistants entering data for individual states and facilities. After new data is collected, normalized, and fact checked, a custom Node.js script integrates the new data into the database.    The data are frequently pushed to thousands of pages on nytimes.com, which use JavaScript (D3 and Svelte) to dynamically generate text and visualizations, which explain the latest state of the outbreak in every state and county, in nursing homes, colleges, prisons and more. Google Drive, Google Documents, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access and R were also used to manage data and do analysis.    Some of the data collected through The Times’s survey process has also been analyzed by Times journalists and joined with other large datasets to produce investigative stories. Journalists joined The Times’s long-term care database to the federal government’s database, as well as to data on the racial make-up of nursing homes. They used regression analysis to determine whether there were patterns in the homes that had cases or deaths. Journalists joined the county-level database with Census data to identify counties where college students comprised at least 10 percent of the population. The journalists then took that list of about 200 counties and cross-referenced it with The Times’s college cases database. The resulting stories showed that college campuses were driving the spike in cases in the early fall, and that college outbreaks likely led to deaths in the wider community. "," The Times has several internal databases dedicated to tracking U.S. coronavirus cases at the county level and clusters at facilities. Each database has strict methodology for entry and verification, developed by Times journalists.    The county-level case database, vaccine database and nursing home database were initially manual operations, with a team of journalists checking public websites and Twitter feeds or contacting state and county governments and individual facilities. Both are now powered both by manual collection and computerized processes created by Times developers. The college, prison and cluster databases use manual collection only, and often involve extensive email or phone correspondence with government officials and business representatives. The collection effort includes dozens of journalists, who survey government entities and private facilities, collect and fact-check data, build and run automated collection systems and present the work in text and visually.    With little federal guidance for reporting, nursing homes, prisons, colleges and even local health departments often define and report cases and deaths in different ways. The Times has developed strict methodology to make sure cases and deaths are counted in a consistent way. For example, some colleges report positive tests rather than unique positive cases. Because it is possible for individuals to test positive multiple times, journalists have asked every college that reports positive tests (there are hundreds) to confirm the number of unique cases. If the college is unable to confirm a number or refuses to respond, those cases are removed from the total number of cases tied to colleges overall, and those colleges have been marked clearly in the online tracker as having potential duplicate test results. The Times also has strict fact-checking rules in place to make sure cases and deaths are sourced properly and checked by multiple people before publication. "," Problems in the data frequently led to story ideas. The county-level data did not contain enough information to analyze racial disparities on a national level. So, The Times filed a Freedom of Information Act request and eventually sued the C.D.C. for an anonymized database of individual confirmed cases along with characteristics of each infected person. The C.D.C. provided data on 1.45 million cases reported to the agency by states through the end of May. Many of the records were missing critical information The Times requested, like the race and home county of an infected person, so the analysis was based on the nearly 640,000 cases for which the race, ethnicity and home county of a patient was known. The data allowed journalists to measure racial disparities across 974 counties, accounting for about 55 percent of the nation’s population, a far wider look than had been possible previously.    Like many newsrooms across the country, The Times undertook this sprawling data collection and reporting effort remotely, with dozens of journalists working from laptops in their homes on shared databases. As cases and deaths have swelled, the databases housing this information have buckled under their weight multiple times, requiring creative solutions. In mid-March, the database, a shared Google spreadsheet, suddenly stopped functioning because it had too many cases and too many people working in it.

United States,The New York Times,Big,Shortlist,An Incalculable Loss,24/05/20,"Database, Illustration, Infographics, Health","Scraping, Canvas, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Node.js"," To mark the grim milestone of 100,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States, we collected obituaries of 1,000 people and distilled a brief excerpt for each to try to capture the humanity of the lives lost. The project sought to turn the death data into a more humanistic representation of the scale of the loss. Online, we combined the excerpts with 100,000 illustrated figures and an essay. In print, we took over the entire front page and several pages inside with the 1,000 names and obituary excerpts — still just 1 percent of the toll. "," The project drew widespread attention at a difficult moment in the pandemic. The decision to take over the front page of the print paper was especially resonant and ultimately drew people into the project to spend time with the names and their stories.   Many readers, including those who lost loved ones to Covid, expressed their gratitude for the piece, some in particularly emotional terms. One note: “I will cherish your echoing the pains of lives lost to Covid-19, and thereby helping us to grapple with what it means to be the America to which my parents each emigrated from eastern Europe just over a century ago.”   People who saw their own loved ones in the list and reached out; others shared the piece or left comments with their loved ones' names and a short sentence, adding them to the list and making them part of the project, too.    The all-type format of the front page inspired many derivative art projects, including one striking take amid the racial justice protests that sprung up not long afterward listing names of those killed by police. "," This was not a typical data project because a significant portion of the source material was qualitative and had to be collected and qualitatively reviewed for inclusion, then turned into readable data for display. The editing of the 1,000 excerpts was perhaps the most time-consuming and emotionally challenging part of the project.   To gather the obituaries we searched news reference sites like Factiva and Nexis as well as the obituary site Legacy.com for mentions of deaths related to coronavirus. We also searched Spanish- and Chinese-language media and did some more targeted searching on the sites of specific news outlets to make sure our list was as inclusive as possible.    All the material was poured into a series of 17 Google docs with about 100 pages of obits each. A team of researchers and editors read through them creating metadata (name, age, location) in ArchieML and choosing excerpts for publication. We created a Node script to download the data from the 17 docs and merge them into a single Google spreadsheet that powered the interactive.   For the graphic visualization we used an HTML canvas element with a series of small illustrations. We added aspects of randomness that would make the display feel more organic while also retaining a sense of order. For the typographic elements we chose to use real HTML text for crisp display. The final piece of the puzzle was to sync the two elements, which happens as the page loads and responds to the size of the viewport. "," It was emotionally taxing work on a tight deadline. At the time, such a scale of death was hard to fathom (though we’ve since nearly quintupled it), and to build the piece we had to confront it directly.    From initial concept to publication was less than two weeks, and it required an enormous team to pull off the research, editing and production. It was difficult to get the whole thing done from a practical standpoint and also difficult because of the subject matter.    Once we had the initial list of obituaries, a half-dozen editors read every one to choose the very short lines that went into the piece. Most are direct quotes, or lightly edited. Because we were keeping everything to a sentence or less, we ended up leaving so much out. It’s difficult to capture a whole life in a handful of words, or even the couple hundred words we were drawing from. But the hope was that collectively, the short descriptions would help readers better comprehend the enormous gravity of the deaths in a more visceral way than just a chart or data visualization.    It was also challenging to strike the right tone visually and in text, again remembering we were dealing with real people’s lives and wanting to honor their loved ones’ memories of them. We went through many iterations of the illustrations and design to make it feel at once personal and to convey the scale — a balance that is difficult to achieve in most data work. "," It’s important to humanize numbers, especially big ones, but it’s not easy. On this story, getting to the underlying source of the quantitative information helped us reveal a lot more than a summary statistic.   We started out feeling like the impact of 100,000 deaths was this awful, unknowable thing. How could we ever know what it meant? We tried to answer the question by breaking it down. Each death was a life, each life was a person, each person had a story, a community, an impact. That story was knowable, too. All together, they made up a big, overlapping story about our country.   One lesson we learned on the process: It was valuable for everyone involved to have a sense of the final work product early on. We did a proof-of-concept sketch of the front page that helped gain buy-in from leadership, and also gave the researchers and editors combing through the obits a tangible goal. Sometimes we do the reporting and then start designing, but in this case we needed both to happen on parallel tracks and we were lucky that they could inform each other.

United States,The New York Times,Big,Winner,Who Gets to Breathe Clean Air in New Delhi?,17/12/20,"Documentary, Database, News application, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment, Health","Sensor, D3.js, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js", We measured the air pollution that two children in New Delhi breathed as we followed them around the city on a normal day to see how wealth inequality affected their exposure. ," Everyone does not breathe the same air. This project went to extraordinary lengths to make visible this dangerous reality.    While Delhi’s poor air quality is well-known, disparities in individual exposure based on class or circumstances are poorly understood. Few researchers have collected this data. Many residents are unaware of the risks. The most harmful pollutants are commonplace, legal and largely invisible.   We showed, moment to moment, what that exposure looks like. Monu, who lives in a slum and attends school outside, is exposed to about four times as much pollution as Aamya, whose school and home are guarded by air purifiers. We watch as both children brush their hair, hang out with friends and sit down for dinner, and see overlaid the spikes and valleys of their real-time pollution exposure.    The visual contrast reflects a dispiriting reality: A long-term, consistent disparity like we observed that day could steal around five years more life from someone in Monu’s position, compared with an upper-middle-class child like Aamya.   Arden Pope, one of the world’s foremost experts on health and air pollution, called the piece “an engaging, important, and sobering story.” Scott Murray called it “the finest piece of data-driven visual journalism I have seen, ever, hands-down.” Most importantly, it is impossible to address health inequalities if they are not understood, and this piece provides an opening. "," We worked with researchers from ILK Labs in Bangalore to design a data collection and processing protocol involving three types of portable air quality sensors and custom software running on a battery-powered Raspberry Pi computer.    We recorded the air pollution data as CSV files. The video files included sidecar metadata generated by the cameras. We used Google Sheets and a custom Node.js app to parse the various metadata and sync it all via their timecodes. This new, combined data allowed us to generate all the time code-based visuals you see in the story.    The timelines and side-by-side photos, using this new data, were made interactive in the browser with JavaScript, leaning heavily on the D3 JavaScript library.    It is important to note that just as important as specific technologies used were the months of on-the-ground reporting from reporters in the New Delhi bureau to identify appropriate families, gain entry to their homes and schools, and understand the broader social context behind Monu’s and Aamya’s lives. The combination of deeply informed on-the-ground reporting and creative data-gathering and visualization helps make the project distinctive. "," It’s unusual for The Times to collect data for a project like this. We usually build charts and other graphics with data given to us by outside experts. But the data we wanted didn’t exist, so we had to collect it.    To add to the challenge, there wasn’t a turnkey, commercial project that did what we needed. Most air quality monitoring hardware is big and stationary.  We needed a small, mobile solution that let us keep up with our subjects. We settled on the Arduino-based Airbeam 2 sensor by HabitatMap, which took exposure measurements of the kids every five seconds as we documented their day with our cameras.    The sensor in the Airbeam 2 is well-regarded, but shortcomings in its mobile app led us to fork an open source project that reads real-time data off the sensor. Our heavily modified app ran on a tiny, battery powered Raspberry Pi Zero computer tethered to the sensor’s serial port. Our app allowed us to control the sensor and manage the data it collected, in the field, using only our phones.    To assist us in data collection and post-reporting analysis, we partnered with Adithi Upadhya and Meenakshi Kushwaha, pollution researchers with ILK Labs who have experience measuring pollution in India using lower-cost sensors like the Airbeam 2. They also collected stationary samples with their own equipment to help verify and normalize the data on our smaller, portable sensors. "," There is tremendous potential for sensor journalism and rigorous fieldwork to show aspects of the world that cannot be revealed in an interview or official records. With the guidance of researchers, we can design experiments that give us direct access to scientific data and far more visualization possibilities than if we relied on existing studies. At the same time, none of the data will matter if we can’t make it feel intuitive and personal, and this means empathetic, deeply informed beat reporting will be as critical to this journalism as it is to written work.

United States,The New York Times,Big,Shortlist,How the Virus Got Out and How the Virus Won,22/03/20,"Explainer, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Animation, 3D modelling, Three.js, QGIS, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js"," Clear and compelling visualizations illuminated two major public health failures. The first analyzed the movements of hundreds of millions of people to show why the most extensive global travel restrictions in history didn’t stop the epidemic. The second showed a vast wave of infection that swarmed across the United States before we knew about how bad it was, and how American officials chose to underestimate, downplay and ultimately ignore the threat. "," These two stories wove together emerging science and data analysis to create animated explanations of how the pandemic spread beyond our grasp. Combining data journalism with cutting-edge visualizations, the stories assembled the evidence and showed who was at fault.   The reporting for each story was immense. For “How the Virus Got Out,” we worked with many of the world’s top disease researchers to assess what fueled the epidemic. We scraped cell-phone tracking data from Baidu and matched it to global flight traffic, allowing us to describe, for the first time, how people moved around China and the world in the early months. The analysis found that about seven million people left Wuhan before the Chinese government locked it down, seeding outbreaks in 26 countries. This story was published in mid-March, when many Americans were becoming aware of the threat. It became The Times’s most-read international story of the year.   For How the Virus Won, we spent months analyzing genetic data, case reports, disease modeling and travel patterns. We partnered with epidemiologists and geneticists, who provided exclusive research on the genetic traces of the outbreak and the central role of travel from New York City. We visualized the hidden spread of the virus in the early months of the year, when the public didn’t know where the virus was and officials waited to act. Those delays, we estimated with Columbia University researchers, cost tens of thousands of lives.   Tom Inglesby, one of country’s top public health researchers, tweeted: “@CDCgov should be doing analyses like this NYT story to understand pandemic. This kind of analysis should be encouraged and permitted by Administration. Information needs to flow freely to understand exactly what happened, is happening, as it has in past outbreaks.” President Trump called the estimates of lives lost a “political hit job.” "," Both stories used WebGL to visualize the spread of the virus. The Three.js javascript library allowed us to bring our data into a three dimensional space where we animated hundreds of thousands of particles representing healthy and infected populations, virus mutations, virus deaths and travel distances. We used our internal Node-based publishing system to constantly parse each dataset while we were making design decisions, to ensure we were always sketching with the latest data.   In order to visualize such a large number of data objects, we used a technique that bypassed the computer’s CPU by sending animation information directly to the graphics processor. The animation calculations, which would have normally created a bottleneck in the Three.js library, were computed by embedding values in our custom WebGL shaders. The performance of the reader’s browser was far better using this technique.   Adobe Illustrator, Autodesk Maya and QGIS were used to create the maps and 3D models. "," Epidemics are difficult to understand. Viruses are invisible. Exponential growth is confusing. Testing is spotty. The hardest part about this project was finding a visualization form that could connect together what was happening in an intuitive way. And what was happening was terrifying.   We pushed the boundaries of what is possible in the browser, using technologies that would not have been possible just a few years ago. And we did it for our most ambitious telling of the world’s biggest story. But it was not visualization merely to track the virus — it was to help readers understand what went wrong.   Once you can visualize the invisible — we used dots of infections visiting new cities, growing quickly — then it’s easier to see why our various strategies didn’t work. Lockdowns were too late. New York City Mayor Bill DeBlasio’s March call to “get out of the town” was dangerous. Restrictions on travel from China meant little when cases were streaming in from Europe. We were limited by what we didn’t track and couldn’t see. "," The projects were cohesive because we knew what we wanted to say. This came out of extensive conversations with researchers about the dynamics of outbreaks and the data we would need to illustrate them. It allowed us to be very specific about which data we would go after, the forms we would explore and — just as important — the data we would ignore. We spent weeks negotiating with flight data firms, for instance, arguing that their data could play an important public service. Every aspect — reporting, data gathering, visualizations, writing — had to support the central message we wanted to convey.    But beyond what the pieces explicitly say, the animations here helped convey a visceral understanding of what happened when words were insufficient. Fear that the virus is streaming into new cities. Awe at the explosive power of exponential growth. Outrage that officials refused to see what was all around them. Sadness at the invisible, uncounted lives that could have been saved. Ultimately, it is these messages that leave a lasting impact and show the unique power  of data visualization in an all-consuming crisis.

Nigeria,"Code for Africa, The Guardian Nigeria, Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting, Humanitarian Open Street Map Team, AfricanDRONE, Uhuru Labs",Big,Winner,Mapping Makoko,26/02/20,n-a,"Drone mapping, OpenDataKit, Shorthand, Flourish data visualisations, Google Earth Pro, Google Sheets"," Neglected and Unmapped was produced through a partnership between Code for Africa, the Guardian Nigeria, The Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting, Humanitarian OpenStreetMap, MakokoDreams, AfricanDRONE and UhuruLabs.    Code for Africa (CfA) is the continent’s largest network of civic technology and data journalism labs, with teams in 12 countries. CfA builds digital democracy solutions that give citizens unfettered access to actionable information that empowers them to make informed decisions, and that strengthens civic engagement for improved public governance and accountability. This includes building infrastructure like the continent’s largest open data portals at openAFRICA and sourceAFRICA, as well as incubating initiatives as diverse as the africanDRONE network, the PesaCheck fact-checking initiative and the sensors.AFRICA air quality sensor network.   In this project CfA contributed conceptualised the project, managed and coordinated all parties involved (including the local community in Lagos and the local NGO partner, MakokoDreams), ran the field data collection and developed the data journalism campaign around it.   The Guardian Nigeria contributed to reporting on the mapping project conducted my CfA and partners in Makoko.    The Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting was the project funder.    The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team contributed to project funding. Volunteers from HOTOSM network helped to digitise maps through their crowdsourcing mapping platform.   AfricanDRONE and its subsidiary - Uhuru Labs - contributed to drone training, drone mapping and uploading drone footage to OpenStreetMap open data portal.    "," Makoko is one of Africa’s most unique inner-city slums, with a third of the community built on stilts in a lagoon off the Lagos mainland, accessible only by canoe. The rest of the settlement is on swampy land with little sanitation and few public services. Makoko is estimated to be home to 300,000 people, but government and residents claim the figure is higher. The numbers are hazy because the area appears as a near-blank space on maps — with little information about structures, density, or streets. This means it is almost impossible to properly track land ownership, plan infrastructure, optimize services, plan for emergencies, or support development.   Being a blank spot on the map means authorities never adequately allocate resources to Makoko, or — worse — exploit the lack of awareness to grab the land and displace dwellers. Neglected and Unmapped explored a bottom-up mapping project that helped the community fight for their land rights. The project combines data, satellite images, on-the-ground multimedia journalism, and long-form storytelling.   The project began with strategic partnerships and townhalls to introduce the project to the community and get their buy-in. This was a critical step, as years of neglect from officials, and individuals claiming to be working for their benefit had affected their perceptions of outsiders working in Makoko.    Once the community was brought on board, our team worked with people in Makoko to build their capacity and empower them to join the project. Fifteen local women and seventeen men were trained by the coalition partners to map Makoko using drones, canoes and open data platforms. Throughout the project 990 images captured by drones were uploaded to the OpenStreetMap and Java OpenStreetMap. The Humanitarian Open Street Map volunteers assisted in digitising the images. Additionally, 80 Points of Interest (POIs) were captured using The Open Data Toolkit (ODK) and dataset uploaded to openAFRICA. These POIs include sources of clean water, schools, healthcare facilities, places of worship, townhalls and more.    The mapping project was captured in a flagship story produced by media partners the Guardian Nigeria. This piece married drone journalism, geo-journalism, data visualisations and multimedia with first hand narratives of lives in Makoko to expose the challenges faced in the slum to an international audience. The project then received considerable international traction, receiving features in Agency France Press, Aljazeera, CNN, the BBC and the Guardian UK.    Mapping Makoko is an ongoing process. In 2020 the project team returned to Makoko and conducted fresh water samples for analysis, mapping a further 20 clean water sources as POIs in Makoko. We hope to continue mapping Makoko through future grant opportunities, as well as to use the collaborative model developed there as a blueprint for future data journalism projects.

Don't deal with all of the problems you have at once. Find a way to break down the big problem into smaller ones, once you make it with the smaller problems, your big one is gone.   Don't let side problems overwhelm you and confuse you, footnote them, and deal with them individually step by step.   Take a break for a day or two, whenever you get a large chunk of the work done.

Amendment to the Sentencing Guideline    The Korean Sentencing Guideline Council decided to raise up sentencing guidelines; 1 year to 2.5 years, if repeated in 5 years, up to 10.5 years after we questioned them if those guidlines were too low.    Coporate Kiiling Law    The Korea Coporate Kiling law was introduced last month. We are not saying that our reports were the only factor for it, however, we are proud of ourselves that we may have contributed to it.     ","  Google Sheet    Google sheet is the best friends of all. As almsot 10 people worked on a same page, collective tool is not a necessity but a essentials. Reading records of the death, we write them into several columns: where they worked, what postion they were in, what employment type they were, whether they had hard hats/safety belts, whether those who were responsible for their deaths has been punished, how much fine was, etc. It     Visualizaiton    We used Sankey chart(D3) for showing the whole stories of 1136's deaths. It's very rare to use this chart in S.Korea. We used one because it tells the story in a sight. If you click one of the character they have, you can see what happend to them in a line. Not only sankey charts, we introduced various charts in an interactive for helping users undertand instinctly.     Gamification    For pointing out that final sentences are too weak for the cost of lives, we make a little game in the middle of interaction. Asking users ""if you were a judge, who would you punish?; Comapy, or a individual? // How much fine would be enough? // Do you think improsoning neccessary?"" with a specific example, we make them to compare with actual sentence, which is striking weak.      "," No one has asked before. Those who are powerless, almost invisible were have been dying in work places, and they are fathers or sons of someone. Even no government agency has recorded  the death in work places fully in S.Korea; one has the photos of the site, other has a invetigation record, still other has a trial record. No one know the whole stories of their death. No one asked why.   We tracked 1136 deaths by requesting several agencies to give their separated records of their deaths, and sow them in line. It take 11 months to see what happend before and after their deaths due to different archiving system each institution has. We finally put the puzzle togther: from the reason to the punishment. The average fine for death is $5,000 and only 4 of responsible chiefs has got sentenced to imprisonment, too cheap for human lives.    The data we made is the one and only completed story no one ever questioned; because those who died were the voiceless. That's why we decided to open the data so that everyone in the field use them for the sake of the lives gone silently. After the reports, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, who were supposed to collect and manage the data, asked us to give them it alongside with civil orgainizations and civic hackers.     "," Fatigue works. When we fisrt started, a professor said; ""Can you do that? I've tried it before... too much to handle"". As one of the top networks in S.Korea, our team thought the MBC is few to go through all the way. That was right, but was not easy; making the data never exsited before in the world, and putting up with pressure from the top(What took you so long? Do you think it attracts viewership?).

Philippines,Rappler,Small,Participant,#BudgetWatch: The Philippine budget during the pandemic,24/09/20,"Investigation, Chart, Video, Politics, Business","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," Rappler's #BudgetWatch combined data journalism and online civic engagement campaigns to examine the Philippines' 2021 national budget. In executing the project, we published several stories on the misplaced priorities of a pandemic budget. We also amplified stakeholders' voices in a series of online fora. Our partners submitted to Congress the recommendations drawn from the webinars as proposed amendments to the budget bill. "," Rappler, in partnership with budget watchdog Institute for Leadership, Empowerment and Democracy, conducted 8 webinars with stakeholders in education, health, and labor, among other sectors, for in-depth discussions on programs that should be prioritized in the 2021 budget. Among the recommendations – which were adopted by two Philippine senators in their amendments to the budget bill – were increases in sectoral budgets and priority to social services and education in the Financial Support to Local Government Units (FSLGU), which funded the controversial P16.44-billion development fund of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict.   The amendment to prioritize social services and education in the FSLGU were included in the enrolled bill passed by Congress but it was vetoed by President Rodrigo Duterte. But there are some wins, such as the departmental budget increases, the biggest of which is the P9.6-billion hike in the Department of Labor and Employment budget. ", Rappler used Tabula's optical character recognition technology to convert scanned printed budget documents into a computer-readable format. These were processed in both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets and were eventually visualized using Datawrapper. ," The most challenging part in every data story is acquiring and processing government data. For example, ""2021 budget: The battle for 'pork',"" a story on the alleged pork barrel funds in the budget, took months to complete, given bureaucratic red tape and the Philippine government's practice of scanning printed documents, particularly on infrastructure projects.   Rappler had to sift through thousands of pages for the stories in this package, only to uncover the government's real priority in crafting the budget: political accommodation. "," This project shows that the work of the media is important in uncovering the real government priorities in the national budget, as well as in amplifying the voice of civil society in pushing for change. While the Philippine Congress heard us, the work is not yet done. We will still continue writing about stories on the budget to hold officials accountable.

United States,Injustice Watch,Small,Participant,#CheckYourJudges: The 2020 Cook County Judicial Elections Guides,01/03/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Infographics, Video, Map, Elections, Politics, Corruption","Personalisation, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","Judicial primary elections are some of the most important, but least followed, elections. Since 2016, Injustice Watch has sought to fill this information gap by providing critical information that's unavailable anywhere else about candidates running for judge in Cook County, one of the largest unified court systems in the country. We combed newspaper records, searched property histories, looked up lawsuits, analyzed campaign contributions, and synthesized the recommendations from local bar associations. Our 2020 Guides - published on March 1 and October 1, made all of this information easily accessible to the public in a clean, sleek digital format, minimizing extraneous"," Most news organizations don't invest the resources necessary to provide voters with comprehensive information about the more than 100 candidates for the bench. Once elected, the more than 400 judges in Cook County make decisions that affect people's lives, including the ability to take away someone's freedom, interpret or overturn state laws, and correct or perpetuate injustices. And it is very difficult to unseat a sitting judge; it's only happened once in the last two decades. These are, historically, very low-information races. Our work aims to increase engagement around judicial elections with the hope that it will result in a more just and qualified judiciary.   The impact of #CheckYourJudges 2020 has been extraordinary. More Cook County voters participated in <a href=""https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/judicial-elections/2020/retention-election-explainer/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">judicial retention races</a> this year than in any election in the past three decades. Although participation in the retention races has generally trended upward since at least 1990, when less than half of voters, on average, made a choice in the judicial races, last year, seven in 10 voters, on average, voted in the 60 Cook County retention elections.    Moreover, voters cared. They <a href=""https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/judicial-elections/2020/cook-county-elections-2020-judges-jackie-portman-brown-araujo-toomin-mahoney/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">kicked out one judge</a> up for retention whom we had reported on extensivelt and brought four others to the brink, marking the second election in a row that a Cook County judge lost a retention bid. In contrast, not a single judge lost retention between 1992 and 2016.   The March primary guide was used online by more than 76,000 people, or about 10 percent of those who cast a ballot.The November general election guide reached nearly a quarter of a million online users between early October and Election Day. In comparison, less than 70,000 visitors accessed the guide in the month leading up to the last general election in fall 2018.     "," The guides aim to recreate a ballot, using the same terminology, ordering of candidates and races. They use intuitive icons to signal important top-level information about candidates. The primary guide contains multiple geolocation features to allow voters to find their judicial district. Each guide includes a comprehensive profile of each candidate, including histories, bar association ratings, and connected news stories. The guide allows users to record their votes & create a custom guide to bring to the polling station.   Our goal was to maximize the audience that could use this guide and that could fully participate in this democratic exercise. Thus each guide and related reporting was produced in both English and Spanish. Accessibility features included labeling and alt text for screen readers for sight impaired users; fully use with just a keyboard for people who have motor disabilities; and full accessibility for people with different devices and levels of internet access. The guide is also a fully installable PWA (Progressive Web App).   For users with data enabled mobile device, users can vote for candidates in our guide and then take their phones to the polls and the guide will remember their votes. For users with mobile devices without data, guide works offline and can be installed just like an app. Users can choose their candidates, and then bring their phones to the polls without any data connection and still access guide. For users without mobile devices, the guide can be used on any computer. Users can make their choices, and then customize and create a PDF version of the guide which includes their votes, which can then be printed and brought to the polls.     "," The most difficult part of the project from an institutional perspective was the traditionally low level of information available to Cook County voters about judges, and the correspondingly low level of voter engagement. The challenge was to create a guide and accompanying journalism that informed and engaged our audience about a critically important group of public officials that generally fly under the media radar. Thus audience engagement in a range of forms was a critical part of our efforts to maximize the impact of the guides.   The most difficult part of the project from a data journalism perspective was creating a data structure flexible enough to accommodate complex election and candidate information, and to ensure the data entry interface was able to receive input from reporters, editors, and volunteers with different levels of technical proficiency. This entire data structure also needed to be translated into Spanish by third-party translators.In addition, we thought through all the different ways we expected our readers to vote, and tried to answer all their needs with a reader-centered design and several different technologies, including full offline functionality and on-the-fly PDF generation on the web .We also worked hard to include accessibility features including screen-reader labels in English and Spanish, and keyboard-only operation for motor-impaired readers.   Because of the hard deadline imposed by the elections, orchestrating this high-tech collaboration, with the added wrinkle of a pandemic forcing remote work, was a significant challenge for a micro newsroom. Our team rose to that challenge for both the primary and general elections, providing invaluable voter information that was not otherwise available in an accessible format. "," The takeaway is 1. perceiving a need, and 2. seizing an opportuinity. A micro newsroom with a well-defined mission like Injustice Watch can make a meaningful contribution to the democratic process if it identifies an important gap in public information to fill. In such a case, it can strategically marshal its resources to compete with larger newsrooms on content, multimedia technology, and impact. In an era in which traditional local newspapers have long been in decline, this is a critical message to communicate to journalists.      ",https://www.injusticewatch.org/interactives/judicial-election-guide/2020-general/en/,https://www.injusticewatch.org/interactives/judicial-election-guide/2020-primary/,https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2020/in-2020-cook-county-voters-cast-ballots-for-judges-in-historic-numbers/,https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2020/cook-county-jail-rejects-1000-judicial-election-guides-mailed-to-detainees/,https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2020/why-judicial-elections-matter/,https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/judicial-elections/2020/araujo-portman-brown-judge-jail-retention/,https://www.injusticewatch.org/commentary/2020/watch-wrongfully-convicted-chicago-man-reflects-on-the-power-of-judges/,,"Marc Lajoie data journalist and coder, Jonah Newman, Duncan Agnew, Jason Asenso, Connor Echols, Ebony Ellis, Steve Garrison, Olivia Louthen, Adam Mahoney, Arudi Masinjila, Annabelle Rice, Yi Ning Wong reporters, Jorge Mederos, Pablo Perdomo translators"," Marc Lajoie is a freelance data and interactive journalist who has been on staff at CBC/Radio-Canada, the South China Morning Post, and the Wall Street Journal.

United Kingdom,openDemocracy,Big,Participant,$280m ‘dark money' spent by US Christian right groups globally,27/10/20,"Investigation, Breaking news, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Elections, Politics, Women, Health, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," This Dark Money project revealed how US-based Christian groups, many linked to then-president Trump, have spent $280 million globally since 2007 fuelling campaigns against the rights of women and LGBTIQ people across five continents. We exposed how these organisations spend millions to influence and interfere with laws, policies and public opinion against sexual and reproductive rights globally. We revealed that they funded anti-LGBT lawsuits, and campaigned for restrictions on LGBT rights, abortion, contraception and divorce. We showed how they worked with groups who have violent agendas against LGBT communities. We also built an interactive database and visualised financial data. "," Our major investigation consisting of global findings as well as many regional stories was picked up by more than 60 media outlets across the world, including The Guardian, Reuters, Mother Jones, and Time. Our stories were widely shared across social media and disseminated in a variety of national and local news platforms. Progressive Christian leaders across the United States openly condemned the actions of the groups we exposed. In Africa, the UN agency UNFPA has commissioned a rapid assessment of opposition to comprehensive sexuality education in eastern and southern Africa, partly in response to our investigation. Several civil society groups in Latin America have convened to prepare a roadmap for action based on the implications of our investigation. In South Africa, the department of education discussed how to address the attacks of the groups we revealed on sex education and our editor was invited to deliver expert opinion. Additionally, following publication, we have organised a webinar for reporters on how the media should cover far-right groups which was attended by many, including reporters from the Christian media. "," In order to establish how much these organisations spent and where, the reporters sifted through hundreds of “Form 990” submitted by the target organisations to the United States Internal Revenue Service. We collected annual Form 990s belonging to 28 organisations across a 13-year period consisting of thousands of pages, and painstakingly read them all line by line. The reporters double-checked each other’s data work on these financial forms. We identified money flows and recorded the amounts spent by the organisations on a variety of anti-women’s right and anti-LGBT projects across the world. We have built an extensive and intricate in-house database with the numbers and details we have found and shared with our local reporters. We constantly fact-checked our database. But ultimately, we wanted to go beyond a purely data-based investigation and really dig deep into the implications of these millions of dollars that appear drily on governmental records and our spreadsheets. To achieve this, we juxtaposed on-the-ground local reporting with data. This way, we reported many local stories that revealed the real-life impact of the projects funded by what the experts called “dark money” interfering with local politics to expand the influence of American right-wing religious groups. Additionally, to make these money flows transparent for our audience, we built an interactive public database containing financial income data of these organisations and their spending. The easy-to-navigate database allows one to explore this spending by region and year too, as well as different categories (eg. “anti-LGBT”, “connected to Trump”, etc).    Our visualisation was built using VueJS. All the source code is hosted on Github; the production version is compiled and served from Github Pages. The visualisation uses flat files which are exported into CSV format from Google Spreadsheets.  "," Sifting through thousands of pages of financial filings and pulling out numbers from these 990 forms was particularly hard and took meticulous attention to detail and meant we had to include multiple rounds of fact-checking, involving different team members at different times.   In terms of our interactive database, one of the challenging things was that the region definitions from the Internal Revenue Service (in terms of the set of countries included in each region) don't easily align with regional groupings under other international definitions. We had to design our own shapefiles using QGIS in order to make the map work correctly according to the IRS definitions. The front-end visualisation is otherwise quite straightforward, and uses quite a lot of open-source software, such as Bootstrap and ChartJS. We also wrote a couple of custom scripts to extract tables stored in Google Docs into Markdown format – for example, this was used for the organisation descriptions.   Overall, this mixed-methods investigation brought along its own challenges, from dealing with raw and inconsistent data to visualising financial information in a captivating way to coordinating a network of local reporters who work in different environments with different professional risk levels. But ultimately, we produced a solid investigation reinforced by hard data and reported from the ground through powerful story-telling. "," The key lesson for us was to realise how data-driven reporting can further and strengthen our work, shining a light on the backlash against women and LGBTIQ rights around the world. Through data work, we not only followed the money but also the influence and interference from the US-based religious groups to the rest of the world. This made us realise that hard data can be utilised well to tell human rights stories, go beyond only micro-level testimonies and see the larger picture, patterns and global trends. We, however, also learned that it is crucial to be able to fuse traditional reporting and data work, which complemented each other in our project. This type of mixed-methods approach allowed us to tell impactful stories in the public interest that no single journalistic method could tackle so effectively. At the same time, we believe it is vital to appreciate the amount of work required to decipher public - especially financial - data and make it accessible to a wider audience. For this, we depended on collaborating globally with our local reporters and editors, as well as tech developers, to ensure that our data collection process was meticulous and that our data was consistent and accurate. This showed us that being able to effectively collaborate across borders is an essential part of large-scale investigations. To facilitate this further, after publication, we created an elaborate methodology dossier which we shared with journalists globally who were interested in replicating our work. As a result, several newsrooms worked on local investigations using our raw dataset as well as our findings. Learning from this, we aim to share more data earlier, therefore collaborating more widely in the future when it comes to data-driven stories that have potential for strong impact in the various localities.   ",https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/special-investigation-global-us-christian-right-dark-money/,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/trump-us-christian-spending-global-revealed/,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/trump-sekulow-war-womens-lgbt-rights-europe/,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/us-groups-linked-to-covid-conspiracies-pour-millions-of-dark-money-into-latin-america/,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/interactive-explore-us-christian-right-dark-money-spending-globally/,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/africa-us-christian-right-50m/,https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/revealed-trump-lawyer-funds-putin-linked-religious-lobbyists-russia/,,"Claire Provost, Nandini Archer, Inge Snip, Mark Brough, Lou Ferreira, Diana Cariboni, Isabella Cota, Tatev Hovhannisyan, Lydia Namubiru, Khatondi Soita, Teddy Wilson, Claudia Torrisi, Kerry Cullinan, Zarina Geloo, Tuyeimo Haidula, Adam Ramsay, Joni Hess"," Claire Provost is global investigations editor at openDemocracy, focused on our project Tracking the Backlash against women's and LGBTIQ rights.

United States,Bloomberg,Big,Participant,2020 Presidential Election Results,03/11/20,"Breaking news, Infographics, Map, Elections, Politics","Json, CSV, Node.js", The Bloomberg 2020 Presidential Election Results graphic was a live-updating election results tracker that gave viewers unique and invaluable data insights to better navigate a tense and frought election night. ," In a crowded field of election graphics, Bloomberg's results tracker stood out to readers and peers (including write-ups in Flowing Data and Fast Company) because of its fresh approach to the visuals of election data. The Electoral College and House cartograms were recognized for advancing the art of cartograms through a design that adhered to readers' mental maps of the US while showing a view proportional to representation and not land. To provide better transparency to our readers, we worked with an election modeler to determine how many votes each county and state should expect to receive in a normal/high/historic year. This work was wrapped into state-by-state county maps that displayed where expected votes were still outstanding using bubbles instead of the typical shaded choropleth. The graphic also provided key insights into the data, such as tracking the Biden/Trump margin by state over time, that became widely shared by viewers and other journalists as margins in key swing states shrunk. "," The graphic was built on js frameworks Svelte and Sapper, with additional help from D3 to provide graphic helpers and Google Docs, which fed most of the text. Svelte and Sapper allowed us to scaffold out the different pages for the application while providing reactive functionality. We also worked with statistician Andrew Therriault who built a voter turnout model that was used throughout the graphic. You can read more about his work in the methodology linked in the graphic. "," Live data graphics always present much more uncertainty into the creation and publishing of a graphic. This election in particular required everyone on the team to be thoughtful about how the graphics might be taken out of context through a screenshot, or used to score political points. We designed and iterated with these ideas in mind. The other challenge of doing election graphics is one of differentiation. Many teams receive identical data, and so it's imperative to present something new and insightful to the audience in a field of graphics full of conventions and tradition. The Bloomberg election results graphic met this challenge with new forms and looks into the data while still working within viewer expectations for familiar touchstones like blue/red colors for Democrats and Republicans, and the ubiquitous election map.

China,Shanghai Observer,Big,Participant,277 confirmed cases and 44 deaths lead you to know what is Coronavirus,26/01/20,"Open data, Infographics","Adobe Creative Suite, CSV"," This project reveals which groups of people are easily infected and how Covid-19 was spread in China in early January.   After collecting the data of the 277 confirmed cases and 44 deaths, we analyzed their genders, ages, travel history, clinical symptoms, and underlying health conditions, so as to illustrate the main physical features of those infected. All the visualization of this information is contained in this project.    In the second half of the project, we analyzed the 18 clusters reported as of January 26, to see to what extent the virus had spread from Wuhan to all over the country. "," This project reached more than 1 million views after it published on multiple content platforms, including the App named Shanghai Observer owned by JieFang Daily, Toutiao.com owned by ByteDance, and WeChat Official Accounts.   It provided our readers with a basic understanding of the symptoms, susceptible population of COVID-19 at the very beginning of its outbreak when people knew little and there was no previous information about the virus.   After we open the case data, we received requests from universities, newsrooms and many other research organizations. "," The softwares we used for this project were Excel and Adobe Illustrator, as Excel for data collection, encoding and cleaning, and Illustrator for visualization.   We referred to the COVID-19 situation reports from government websites, and collected personal information such as residence, travel history, gender, age of daily confirmed.   In the following step, we transformed the collected information into organized data in Excel, with columns being 'city', 'Gender', 'Age', 'travel to Wuhan'( if yes, input 1, if no, then input 0), multiple symptoms and underlying health conditions ( used 1 and 0 to distinguish Yes or No as well).   Then we visualized the data in the forms of bar charts, pie charts and butterfly diagrams. "," The hardest part is to collect and sort out as much information as possible about the patient cases, including their age, gender, activity trajectory, symptoms, past medical history, etc.     Since there was no unified standard for information release in the early stage of the epidemic, the degree of disclosure of non-private information about cases was different, meaning that browsing multiple web pages over and over again was needed to collect information; the formats of the public information varied also so that it was difficult to organize information with a universal set of crawlers and code.     In order to solve the above problems, we shared out the work and cooperated with each other. Each of us was responsible for several provinces and spent nearly six hours a day collecting, sorting, labelling and proofreading these case information. So far, we have kept the data free and public. "," In the early stage of the epidemic, ordinary people lacked the ability to distinguish in the face of complicated information and reports. As journalists, we need to analyze the facts and data to clarify the unfounded speculation, let people know about the truth and relieve panic and anxiety. It is something that journalists should overcome.     When dealing with large-scale unstructured text data, a team with tacit cooperation and clear division of labor is needed. For the extraction of important information, it is necessary to design a set of reasonable and efficient methods, set up indicators covering key information and keep updated in a timely manner.     The most important thing is to stick with it.   One thing worth mentioning is that we have made all the data we collect public. All the readers can get access to the dats through the global COVID-19 dataset we set up by our own.

We show the trends in the spread of disinformation in the last 5 months through data visualization.  "," This is the first complete investigative report in the world that analyzed the disinformation about COVID-19. We analyzed more than 5,000 fact-checking reports written by fact-checking organizations in the world to find out the characteristics of disinformation spread in different countries. It was discovered that in addition to viruses, disinformation also caused huge harm to countries.  Even in Taiwan, where epidemic prevention results seem to be very successful, disinformation had some kind of impact too. We also verified the influence of these fake messages in tens of millions of tweets from Twitter, and found that disinformation in the ""good news"" category is more likely to spread, which was different from the sensational one.​  "," In the part of data analysis, we used web-crawlers to get the fact-checking reports of IFCN(The International Fact-Checking Network), and used R to analyze the data. Manual classification of disinformation was the most time-consuming part of this project. We used TF-IDF word segmentation to help reporter find the same type of disinformation. Also, we used some functions of Google Spreadsheet, like translation, to minimize the time spent on manual classification.   This project is made by Vue.js and D3.js to implement a scroll-telling story with clustered bubbles chart, scroll-telling is a well-known story form which is better for producing chart-based story, due to the chart is fixed on the main position of the web page, and each section of the story only have one main position, and is easy for implement in the year 2020 due to we can just using the ""sticky"" CSS position value.

""A Call to Stop the Next Pandemic"" explores the rise of zoonotic diseases and their connection to deforestation, illegal wildlife trade and land conversion. Through an interactive article combining animation and infographics, the project explains the history of zoonotic diseases and how they are linked to human behavior, as well as how the increased risk of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19 poses a threat to already marginalized people, including indigenous communities. "," “A Call to Stop The Next Pandemic” is the visual and interactive accompaniment to World Wildlife Fund’s ongoing pandemic campaign examining how human behavior has contributed to a sharp rise in emerging infectious diseases over the past forty years. The educational content is meant to distill complex data into a clear and interactive primer that explains the origins of zoonotic diseases like COVID-19, a topic that is not often discussed despite its historic significance to human health. To accomplish this, we used a combination of data-driven animation and interactive graphics that guide the user through a narrative experience that drills down into key human behaviors that led to an environment ripe for the development and transmission of zoonotic diseases.   The project has had a significant impact on zoonotic disease awareness in the general public and spurred tens of thousands of people to take action. To date, 42,328 people have sent over 130,000 messages to Congress. The animated explainer video has received over 130,000 views and has been translated by users into several languages, broadening the reach of the message. On social media, the content generated 21,204 likes, and over 2,000 shares and saves. Additionally several prominent celebrities shared the content including Jared Leto, Alyssa Milano, and Isabella Gomez, greatly expanding the content’s reach through their millions of followers. "," To accomplish the difficult task of communicating the complex connections between humans and zoonotic diseases, we used a number of digital tools and technologies weaved into a cohesive narrative on a dedicated page of worldwildlife.org. The reader is introduced to the concept of zoonotic diseases with a brief and engaging animated video created using Adobe After Effects which was repurposed for social media to promote the project.   As the reader continues through the article, engaging infographics and interactive modules provide a more hands-on deep dive into the subject. All of these tools are tied together using a unified design system led by a photo illustration that drives home the human connection to our natural world. The project was built in JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3 using WWF's proprietary content management system, allowing for modular blocks of interactive content which were easily updated on the backend as this quickly evolving situation developed. Additionally, to maximize accessibility and future-proof the design, the static data visualizations were built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3. The project was entirely responsive on mobile and tablet, ensuring that readers would get the full interactive experience on any device they were using. "," As the pandemic spread throughout the world, the science team at World Wildlife Fund began researching how human behavior is linked to the rise in animal-borne infectious diseases. When COVID-19 hit the U.S., WWF was able to act quickly and use this research to educate our audiences. The biggest challenge was figuring out a way to simplify this exhaustively researched and highly technical report into plain language that anyone could understand.   There was an urgent desire to understand why this had happened and where COVID-19 came from. Seeing a need for immediate action, we produced this project in three weeks as a primer with the intention of rolling out additional content over the coming year as we curated ongoing research from the science team. By helping audiences understand the history and causes of zoonotic diseases, readers can better understand how they can be prevented. "," One of the most valuable things that journalists and storytellers can learn is the ability to simplify the complexity of our modern world for a general audience. Bridging the gap between human behavior and the rise in zoonotic infectious diseases is a challenging but important requirement to help readers better understand our world and their personal responsibility in it. This is an essential task for journalism in the 21st century; not just to report on news events happening around the world, but to empower readers with the essential knowledge and understanding needed to be citizens of an increasingly complex world. This will require working directly with scientists and experts on the front lines of our most pressing issues and translating highly technical research for the general public using design and code to make it accessible and easy to understand.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,A year upended: How governments (still) fight to keep Covid-19 in check — and what may work best,30/12/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Fact-checking, Chart","Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R"," Stay-at-home, social distancing - did they work?   This story explains the impact of  movement restrictions  in seven key places in Asia - Singapore, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - and how the population  complied  with the measures.   Relying on a global study published in The Lancet medical journal that discovered the delayed impact of certain measures on the R-rate, which shows how long the outbreak has been spreading at a faster speed, we were able to use  visual storytelling, graphics and personal profiles  to highlight the wider consequences of such movement restrictions in each featured area. ", We hope that it is used to explain the effectiveness of different movement restrictions used by policymakers in Asia. It is complicated and we hope we were able to deliver the message of nuance with clarity. ," The project uses R for data analysis and outputs SVG charts using the ggplot2 library which has been set up to output different sizes for mobile and desktop using our in-house styles. The SVG charts are then adjusted in Adobe Illustrator to add annotations and refine styles. They are then inserted using the in-house Vue.js modular template which includes a 'scrollytelling' module among other key visual elements such as full-width parralax images and pull-out quotes.    As a result of this, we were able to update the latest data up to the most recent days before publishing with minimal effort. As it turned out, even though the analysis is not time-sensitive, at least till the final days of the year, South Korea's third wave was still on the rise when we first began the story and had eventually overtaken its first peak in early 2020 by the time we were about to publish. "," This project underwent a few rounds of editorial changes. The first concept was to use the government response index in much the same way as many reputable news organisations had been doing at the time (late October) but with a focus on Asia.    Upon our first pitch, our editors were keen to see how we could use the index to find out which measures worked better than others, as opposed to looking at countries. We were grateful to come across a different study (linked below) on movement restrictions by the University of Edinburgh which used the same index but took a global view at movement restriction effectiveness more specifically.    Our second pitch was approved but we then had to add additional locations - we originally proposed four including Singapore. This is, of course, fine, but it meant we needed to find a way to visually communicate the situations in seven countries quite high up in the beginning, but also have it display all in one mobile view. We resolved this issue after a day of staring at the 7 area charts to find a common pattern - the waves of each place's daily new cases reflected to a certain extent the regularity/irregularity and number of movement restriction measures. We used 'sparklines' to show waves in one view that were then used later on in the story. "," We think it is encouraging to not be disheartened when you get a negative response to a pitch. At the time it was frustrating as it was a dataset that was being used by many and well, and we had done a considerable load of work on it. However, in the end, I think the project turned out far better as a result of us being pushed to find something that suited the editorial needs.    We also think it is important to bring back human stories into data. We tried to do this by using personal profiles that represented the ""voice of the many"" as uncovered in the data. We ran the data analysis, suggested possible profiles that would fit the majority and co-ordinated this with our correspondents in the various locations. They all gave us exactly what we were looking for on their first attempt so this was heartening to confirm the intepretations we had made of data and ensured it wasn't biased.

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Participant,Abandoned at sea: The desperate journeys of Rohingya refugees,08/12/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border, Illustration, Map, Politics, Immigration, Human rights","Animation, Google Sheets, CSV"," The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) collaborated with us to produce a long-form, visual story on Rohingya refugees who risk their lives crossing the Andaman Sea in search of refuge in Southeast Asia. Through the use of striking maps, gorgeous illustrations, and original audio clips, Kontinentalist retells the Rohingya refugee crisis story in an innovative format that combines the best elements of storytelling and data visualisation. Taking immersive and empathetic storytelling to a new level for an indescribably important cause, this is a story that will move readers to learn more about and support one of Asia's long persecuted minorities.         "," The Rohingya humanitarian crisis has sporadically gained media attention over the decade due to the crises at sea, but in general the issue has been severely underreported in Southeast Asia. While regional NGOs, refugee advocates and individuals have made meaningful contributions to the refugee cause, we wanted to spread a deeper awareness of the Rohingya's plight by producing an impactful piece that would spur readers in the region to take further action. One of the key messages that we wanted to send across is that Rohingya refugees need greater protection from the Association of Southeast Aian Nations (ASEAN) community, especially as the impacts of COVID-19 disproportionately affect refugees. One of the ways in which ASEAN countries can relieve their plight is by ensuring their safe disembarkation and offer refugees opportunities for asylum in a time where border closures and public health restrictions have led to heightened fear and insecurity.    The story was shared widely on social media, and received an overwhelming response on UNCHR’S global Instagram page. It also received good feedback from NGOs working on refugee and humanitarian issues, as well as regional media outfits who have approached us with ideas for future collaboration.     "," Datasets and reports were provided by the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) but further research was done to supplement the text and support the data visualisations. Illustrations were done with Procreate and Adobe Photoshop.   The base map was designed in-house using Mapbox GL JS. We overlaid the story text over the map using Scrollama which triggers the map to zoom in or out, and changing the mapview on scroll. Using Turf JS, we animated one of the many journeys taken by a Rohingya refugee. We coded the geojson points into the map as coloured circles with diameters that were proportional to our numerical dataset. These coloured circles were linked to a custom timelapse ui component. This controls when the circles appear on the map according to the ticks on the timelapse ui component.     "," The hardest part of the project was translating the data into powerful and effective data visualisations that were also sensitive to the political climate and the UNHCR’s relationship with governments in the region. When we first brainstormed the storyboard, we had big ideas of how we could relay the data and information, but we had to be mindful of how we portrayed the movement of Rohingya refugees and the varied governmental response to the crisis. We were also careful not to produce a visualisation that could be manipulated or taken out of context to feed anti-refugee/anti-immigrant sentiment in the region.    The technical and academic language employed in UNHCR reports and our other research sources further proved to be a challenge as we wanted the story to be as personal, humane and accessible as possible. In this story, original audio interviews and secondary anecdotes with refugee surviors played an important role in inspiring the language and guiding the overall narrative and flow of the story.   "," With the right combination of visualisation and language tools, journalists can tell both data-driven and human-centric stories that can rouse emotion and engender social change. Maps, for example, are an incredibly compelling way to take readers on a journey. In this story, the map was used to relay the experiences of the Rohingya before and during the maritime journey and showed the scale of the tragedies at sea over a certain time period.  ",https://kontinentalist.com/stories/the-rohingya-in-myanmar-a-refugee-crisis-at-sea,,,,,,,,"Zafirah Zein, Loh Pei Ying, Siti Aishah, Joceline Kuswanto, Griselda Gabriele","  Zafirah Zein     Writer    Zafirah is a freelance writer and journalist as well as the co-editor of an independent magazine called AKAR.

We were even congratulated by a helicopter firm from the area for such an accurate and interesting depiction. ," First, we needed to research the list of aircraft that were currently operating and compile their tail numbers. Using the tail numbers, we were able to download their flight path data. Each flight was a separate file so we had to clean and sort all of the data over the space of a month before selecting the days and times to focus on.   From there we were able to plot and map this data and with fire hotspots from NASA to tell the story of how the aircraft operate together.    The top animation was built using javascript and drawn in the browser before being exported and styled further.   We added beautifully drawn illustrations throughout the page to help with the explanation but also tie the piece together.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,Amazon gold rush: The threatened tribe,26/06/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Environment, Culture",Adobe Creative Suite," Illegal gold mining activity has risen sharply over the last five years in Brazil’s indigenous Yanomami reservation in the heart of the Amazonian rainforest, a Reuters analysis of exclusive data shows. Working with Earthrise Media, a non-profit group that analyzes satellite imagery, Reuters plotted the expansion of the mines across the reservation.    An analysis of these sites revealed that the number of mines has grown 20-fold over the past five years. Collectively, the mining areas identified in the reservation cover an area roughly the size of over 1,000 soccer fields. "," The piece put the tribe’s struggle on the map and highlighted the issues faced by the indigenous tribes of the Amazon. The project has been cited in other publications and papers by the likes of Columbia Human Right Law Review and human rights groups such as Survival International.     The advocacy and research director of Survival International informed Reuters that she sent it to Dario Yanomami of Hutukara Yanomami Association in Brazil, who was very pleased to see such an important and strong report. "," The main dataset was collected by studying hundreds of satellite images. The analysis involved scouring images covering the entire reservation. Earthrise enlisted the help of dozens of people to get through the first initial screening.   Some of the extra eyes came from ninth grade students at Weston High School in Massachusetts. Retired NASA Astronaut Catherine Coleman initiated the student search with a recorded video, saying “We need your help”.   Three classes combed through the images using a purpose-built tool, focusing mainly on river systems. Earthrise then revised and refined the findings.   We were then able to plot and map this data to tell the story. Other graphics showing mining permits across the Amazon and tree loss also complemented the story. ", The sheer volume of satellite imagery was definitely a hurdle and meant this was definitely not going to be a quick story to report or produce.   Then turning the raw data sets into a deeply reported story with compelling visual narrative was also a challenge. It was also important to find that balance between bringing the problem to life and not overembelishing. ," If a data set does not exist, that doesn’t mean there isn’t a story.

Brazil,InfoAmazonia,Small,Participant,Amazônia Sufocada (Suffocated Amazon),18/08/20,"Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment","QGIS, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","Suffocated Amazon is a I special coverage of Brazilian Amazon fires and deforestation over 2020 dry season (specially August - October). The project has three main fronts that, together, inform the public about the serious crisis taking place in the Amazon. An interactive map with real-time visualization of Amazon fires and automated analysis revealing what are the most critical areas burning. Over the map, a layer of geolocated stories, produced by local journalists, reporting and contextualizing the degradation observed via satellite from the ground. And, a Twitter robot which sends fire alerts on the most critical Conservation Units and Indigenous"," As the project was an extensive coverage along the fire season, which lasted almost 5 months in total, there were several impacts on our audience, and the results show it helped to improve understanding of the fires related to deforestation by our readers and the new readers that came with the project. And also helped them to understand on a regular basis since they could see every day where the fires were, how many they were, and then see the context of what was happening.    Besides the platform originally designed for the project on our website, several stories were published by DW Brazil (which became a re-publisher partner of the project), broadening the audience reach, and also by several national and local outlets in an organic way.      We also had a lot of feedback from environmental and local community organizations, especially indigenous organizations which shared a lot of our reports and posts on social media.     About change of laws or policies, I highlight one of our stories, in Acre state, that reported how the buffer zone of National Park Serra do Divisor was burning more than usual, driven by a bill that intends to weaken the protection of the conservation unity so to make possible the construction of a road that, guided by the intention of draining soybeans to the Pacific, intends to divide the park in half, disrespecting the traditional communities that live there and have not been heard in the process. After our report, the Public Ministry of Acre filed an appeal, citing our report as a source, and requesting the suspension of the construction process till at least the affected communities were duly consulted. The process is still going on.  "," We used several tools and techniques for grabbing the Nasa satellite data, building our own fire database from it, cleaning it, and cross-referencing the fires data with geospatial information (indigenous lands, conservations units, municipalities, estates, and biomes) in order to be able to spatially analyze it and create geo-data visualizations from it and, later, to build the Twitter robot with these same data (and some other specific analyzes). The programming was done mostly in Python, the pre-processing of the geospatial data in QGis/Google Sheet,s and the automated maps were created in Mapbox, and updated daily through the Mapbox API upload.   The workflow happens as follow:   1. We pre-process data from NASA/FIRMS fires and the territorial limits of the municipalities, states and protected areas in the Legal Amazon.    2. Every day, we update this data with new information that we capture from NASA/FIRMS databases.    3. With the updated data we create GeoJSON and MbTiles files that are then sent to Mapbox.    4. From the data and maps styled in Mapbox, we generate the layer maps shown on the special project page and the threads that are published daily on Twitter.    All the code is open-source and we have it documented here: <a href=""https://github.com/RodrigoMenegat/amazonia-sufocada/blob/master/README.md"">https://github.com/RodrigoMenegat/amazonia-sufocada/blob/master/README.md</a>     "," The hardest technical part of the project had to do with the satellite data definition. We were almost done publishing the automated fire map in August when the reference satellite used by the Brazilian National Space Agency as a reference (the Aqua satellite, from Nasa) presented technical problems and the publication of data was suspended by NASA.    Because of this, we had to not only to develop our database from scratch but also deepen our understanding of the different satellites and the differences in capturing fire alerts among them, starting a fruitful content partnership with the Brazilian National Space Agency (Inpe).    As we decided to continue the project with another satellite that had more resolution and a longer life span (the Suomi-NPP/VIIRS instrument), the amount of active fire captured was much larger than the official reference satellite. With this, we had two additional challenges: explain in the reports and in the Twitter robot which was the data used, why they were so much more fire alerts than those usually published, and also deal with the large amount of data generated. The fire season ended up with more than 1 million hot spots recorded by the S-NPP satellite in the Amazon, all these geolocated points, updated daily on our map server, were not always usually handled by Mapbox and we had to develop codes to handle this automatically and show all the points in the map.    On the other hand, reporting locally during the pandemic found all the restrictions journalism was submitted this past year, and most of the reports, which covered traditional and isolated communities, had to be done remotely. Thus, it was harder than the pre-pandemic scenarios to get the communities' reports in order to understand on the ground basis what we're monitoring by satellite imagery. "," One thing other journalists could learn from this project is the impact on environmental narratives of what we call geo-journalism, the connection between Earth Sciences/geo-spatial data journalistic stories. I believe by being a broad coverage, which was mainly looking at satellite data and their spatial distribution to frame the reports, brought all together this strong element of our production: data connected to the stories, also made from them.  ",https://infoamazonia.org/pt/projects/portugues-amazonia-sufocada/,https://twitter.com/botqueimadas,https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2020/11/degradacao-e-ilegalidade-acompanham-rastro-da-soja-em-rodovia-no-oeste-do-para/,https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2020/10/portugues-fumaca-das-queimadas-eleva-poluicao-do-ar-a-niveis-preocupantes-no-acre/,https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2020/11/portugues-repavimentacao-da-br-319-pode-aumentar-quatro-vezes-o-desmatamento-no-amazonas/,https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2020/10/portugues-serra-do-divisor-ve-aumento-de-pressoes-com-promessa-de-estrada-e-de-extincao-de-parque/,https://infoamazonia.org/pt/2020/10/portugues-fogo-grileiros-e-gado-ameacam-terra-de-indigenas-isolados-que-liderou-desmatamento/,,"InfoAmazonia project team: Juliana Mori, Thadeu Melo, Rodrigo Menegat, Guilherme Guerreiro Neto, Izabel Santos, Juliana Arini, Leandro Chaves"," Short biography of Juliana Mori, general coordinator and DataViz of the project      Juliana Mori is a journalist specialized in geospatial data visualization and audiovisual productions.

Chow became an iconic symbol of the Hong Kong protests that began in 2019. A year later, a hearing was called for the cause of Chow’s death. Before the start of the hearing, our team created a 3D model and reconstructed the scene from that night, along with video footage, information from media reports and police briefings, to provide readers with a better understanding of the night’s event.    "," The circumstances around Chow Sze Lok’s death have always remained a mystery. Even though there were hundreds of protesters, police officers and other emergency workers at the scene of the protests, no one saw how Chow fell off the parking lot building. The security company also released hundreds of hours of footage from the parking lot surveillance cameras, which didn’t capture the critical moment of Chow’s fall.   There have been major rifts between Hong Kong people and the police since protests began in 2019. Surrounding Chow’s death, the police have made multiple statements that were later disputed. For example, the police claimed they did not enter the parking lot before Chow’s death at 1 a.m. that night, but later, CitizenNews revealed footage that showed that riot police had entered the parking lot earlier at 11 p.m. The police also claimed that there was surveillance footage showing Chow entering and exiting an adjacent building but refused to release the videos.    Our project served to sort through the trove of information from that night and highlight the unanswered key moments around Chow’s death. The 3D reconstruct also allowed readers to better grasp the layout of the parking lot and where Chow, the police, firefighters, EMT and other key locations were.  ", We used the open source software Blender to create the 3D model of the parking lot and used Adobe After Effects to render a video that flew through the scene.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,Anatomy of Singapore's outbreak,01/12/20,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Animation, Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite"," Reuters transformed printed Covid-19 case data into a slick animation of Singapore's explosive worker dormitory clusters. The piece documents and explains how and where clusters formed, and visualises the scale of the dormitory outbreaks compared to imported and locally transmitted cases. "," The project demonstrated how poorer groups, in this case foreign workers, were not adequetly protected from the virus. The striking visualisation was shared widely on social media, attracted high readership on reuters.com, and was regarded as one of the most vivid explanations of how the outbreak exploded in Singapore. "," With more than 30,000 dots representing cases, all moving together on the screen, we needed to build and code this piece in a way that would not affect browser performance. We used WebGL to ensure the visualisation would be rendered using the graphics card on each reader's computer. The end result was a transformation from basic press release data to a vivid, animated reconstruction of how case clusters formed in Singapore. "," The hardest part of this piece was the final rendering and production. Visualising the thousands of cases together while not compromising on clarity of the narrative, quality of the graphics, and speed and performance of the browser rendering was extremely hard and took a lot of innovative ideas.    It would have been easier just to run the data into a standard forced layout format but that brings the movement to a snail’s pace with so many nodes and drastically reduced the clarity of the piece.   In the end we assigned predetermined positions to some of the dots and controlled how they behaved, forcing the carousel movement as clusters form. "," There can sometimes be completely bespoke solutions when visualising a story and they can be the hardest to code and produce. However, they can also be extremely compelling especially for a once in a generation story like the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indonesia,Katadata,Small,Participant,Andrea Lidwina,18/02/20,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Employment",Microsoft Excel," This article explored Indonesian youth through two aspects. First, demography; youth comes from various socio-economic backgrounds and it makes them different in some ways one to another. Second, aspiration; youth has their own aspiration and they have been using their youthfulness to express it throughout the years. Those two aspects were then used to assess President Joko Widodo’s decision, whether it was the right one or what should actually be chosen/improved, in appointing some millennials to be in charge of important governmental positions in his second-term of presidency. "," This article provided an insight or a further understanding to 8,213 readers—since it was first published until February 4, 2021—about Indonesian youth’s position in politics. We did that by explaining youth demographic, the history or pattern of their movement and how often times they are shut by the government eventually. We also explained what millennials in position should do during their time, to better represent Indonesian youth as a whole, for being chosen was just the first step. "," Because this was a simple data analysis article, we only used Microsoft Excel to compile data from credible sources, such as Statistics Indonesia, IDN Research Institute and CSIS. Then, we used data visualization platform, for instance amCharts and Flourish, and infographics to display those data. "," The hardest part of this project was we had to read many references, books and journals, in order to understand the history, movement and characteristic of Indonesian youth which changed over the years but showed a similar pattern as well. In addition to that, the available data wasn’t the most up to date, mainly about youth demographic. Hence, we couldn’t describe Indonesian youth nowadays precisely. "," Other journalists can learn about the history and characteristic of youth in Indonesia from this article. Youth often initiates change and government reform, but government also has some ways to tackle them down. Furthermore, what happens in our government today shouldn’t just be seen as it is. Journalists should look at the previous government or regime to understand the political pattern and motive. Therefore, we can provide more depth analysis and different perspective to public.

Cuba,"Postdata.club, Artificial Intelligence Research Group - Havana University",Small,Participant,Armanbot: automated baseball news generation,14/08/20,"News application, Sports","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, JQuery, Json, Python"," In Cuba, baseball is the national sport an people follow cuban players performance in the different leagues, specially in Major Leagues (MLB). This implies following a great number of matches with a large number of players and reporting the performance of them. Armanbot then generates, using AI methods, daily news about the performance of cubans in MLB. Thus, each day the cuban players who participated in each game held are identified and, then, their performance and impact on the results of the teams for which they play are described.  With this, an article is generated and published, all automatically. "," With the Armanbot project, the performance of all Cuban players in all major league matches during the 2020 season was followed day by day and integrally. Thus, for the first time in Cuba, an automatic news generation project was carried out. This quickly captured the interest of other newsrooms in the country to monitor both the performance of Cuban players in the major leagues, as well as their spread to other leagues including the Cuban national league. Also, given the impact it had on national journalists, the debate began, which did not exist before, about the possibilities and impacts that automatic news generation can have on newsrooms. "," Baseball-Reference (BR) was used as data source for the system. BR reports the statistics of the matches for each day and has a database of MLB players. Each day the data of the matches held and the Cuban players who participated were automatically obtained and structured.   In order to determine the relevant players, information was collected from ESPN on the outstanding players by matchday in previous seasons. With this information and BR statistics, a training set was built that allowed the creation of a machine learning model, based on logistic regression, to classify the performance of the players on each day.   Having the data of each match of the day and the most prominent players, the text of the news is generated. For this, a rule-based heuristic strategy was adopted. Rules were defined for the different possible situations. With sentence templates and parts of them, the final text is generated. For each possible sentence or parts of them, several alternatives were drawn up that could be selected indistinctly. A similar scheme was adopted with the titles. For the summary of the news, the algorithm provided by Gensim was used. This way, the information to be published is generated for each day: title, summary and content of the report.   For the publication of the daily news, we used Github Pages and Github Actions for the.automated tasks (scraping, classification, text generation). A scheduled task is executed daily from the repository of the news site that generates the news and adds it to a file in JSON format. With this file, using HTML5, Javascript and JQuery, the news that Armanbot writes us daily is displayed in each browser. "," In this automatic news generation project, the main challenge was that the texts generated from the data were not mere statistical reports, that the texts had variability and a certain empathy with readers even when texts responded to a certain type of information scheme. In addition, all this could be done with not so complicated methods that do not involve research and development that requires large resources and that, therefore, may be available to any newsroom and that in the future can be extended to other newsrooms interested in related projects . To this must be included, that the entire process had to be developed in an automated and transparent way, with zero maintenance costs in infrastructure. "," Automatic news generation is a possibility that is available to many newsrooms and can be carried out in different domains in a controlled manner. This can contribute to a better distribution of work in small newsrooms or in those where actions must be covered periodically over long periods of time.   This is one of the possible contributions, which are already being made, of AI in journalism and it can be carried out with methods in this field that can be within the reach of simple collaborations (as we did in Postdata.club) between different actors, both from journalism and from the investigation.   On the other hand, Postdata.club, with only three permanent people in its newsroom, was able to fully cover the performance of all Cuban players in all major league matches.

United Kingdom,Global Witness,Big,Participant,"Beef, Banks and the Brazilian Amazon",02/12/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Human rights","Sensor, Scraping, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Python"," This investigation reveals how Brazil’s biggest beef trading companies – JBS, Marfrig and Minerva – are linked to tens of thousands of hectares of illegal deforestation in the Amazon state of Pará. Despite relatively clean bills of health in private audits, our analysis shows how the firms’ suppliers – both direct and indirect – are deliberately flouting the law, with the companies themselves turning a blind eye. To conduct this analysis, Global Witness’s data investigations team had to build a picture of the beef traders’ supply chains using a range of publicly available datasets, automated techniques and manual research. "," The model Global Witness has developed is being adopted by other journalists and civil society organisations (CSOs), like Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo, for similar investigations in other Amazon states. Previously, CSO investigations have focused on individual case studies or company sourcing in areas of high deforestation – whereas this methodology allows groups to definitively track direct connections between traders and deforestation.    This work also contributed to long-standing civil society efforts calling for accountability from beef traders. On the day that JBS was due to reply to our allegations as we prepared our report it announced that it would begin monitoring its indirect suppliers by 2025 – an issue it had committed to address over a decade ago but had failed to act on. This data investigation showed the real-world consequences of international banks, asset managers and investors failing to insist on basic data that is needed to do due diligence on companies operating in high-risk sectors and jurisdictions. This investigation directly elevated discussions of how proposed legislation in the UK to tackle global deforestation through its supply chain – and similar measures in the EU – needed to cover financing. This included a new amendment on finance being tabled to the UK Environment Bill in the House of Commons.    Investigators also held meetings with Brazilian Environmental Federal Prosecutors after publication that monitor the beef companies compliance with their commitments, and verbally told them they had demanded from the beef giants a response concerning our allegations. Finally, as a direct result of our work, JBS blocked a ranch featured in our report – El Shadai – after the company had purchased from the ranch in consecutive years despite it having been blacklisted by Ibama (Brazil’s forest inspection agency) for illegal deforestation.  "," To conduct the analysis, Global Witness’s data investigations team had to build a picture of the beef traders’ supply chains. We used documents called animal transit guides (GTAs), filed by ranches with the Pará state agriculture agency when they move animals around – for example, when selling cows for slaughter or export. The GTAs are available to consult one-by-one through an online portal. By guessing the documents’ ID numbers and automating the process through web scraping, we were able to obtain more than three million GTAs dating from 2014 to 2020.   Animal transit guides are just one piece of the puzzle. To quantify deforestation, we used a data set called PRODES, published by Brazil’s federal space agency, which shows areas of deforestation detected in satellite imagery. We then overlaid this data with information from the Pará state rural environmental register (CAR), which shows the boundaries of ranches, self-reported by their owners. The three data sources were combined automatically to throw up a series of suspect ranches, which were then investigated manually by Global Witness researchers, utilising landsat and sentinel imagery to remove, for example, any possible cases of false positives.   Our scraper was written in Python using the Scrapy framework. We initially experimented with doing the geospatial analysis in R, before switching to Postgres/PostGIS. Case studies were then investigated in detail using QGIS. Global Witness’s data investigations team provided a template QGIS project to help our expert forests investigators use the software. "," This project presented a number of challenges. First, restrictions on access to the Pará GTA portal made it difficult to scrape, and we had to spend a significant amount of time and effort (tweaking scraper settings, renting servers in Brazil, etc.) developing an approach which would deliver consistent results.   Once the data had been collected, it needed to be processed and joined at scale with other publicly available data sets using fuzzy matching, requiring us to develop complex heuristics for determining accurate matches, particularly between cattle sales documents and farm ownership records.   Following on from the data collection and automatic processing steps, Global Witness’s forests team painstakingly verified deforestation in hundreds of individual candidate ranches using satellite imagery, working closely with our Brazilian partner organisation Imazon, building up a database of confirmed cases that could be used in the final report. Additionally, the data team had to collate deforestation permits and overlay these over the ranches to check on the legality of the forest clearance, in order to quantify the rate that was illegal. Ultimately, these were the most difficult and complicated parts of the project. "," The project provides a template for data-driven investigation of agricultural supply chains for deforestation risk. The specific methodology set out in detail in our report and the code published on our <a href=""https://github.com/Global-Witness/beef-supply-chain"">GitHub page</a> allows fellow journalists to recreate Global Witness's entire research method, from scraping to automated analysis to manual verification using satellite imagery. But it also offers a starting point for expansion of this work to look at other forest-risk commodities such as soy and palm oil and other jurisdictions, both in Brazil and internationally. The modular approach taken means that new data sets can be slotted into the methodology relatively quickly and simply.  Beyond the technical methodology, the level of detail provided in our report on the editorial process – particularly our analysis and refutation of the big beef traders' initial responses to our findings – should prove useful to journalists working on these companies in the future, giving them some idea of the arguments likely to be deployed to counter allegations of deforestation in their supply chains.

China,Shanghai Observer,Big,Participant,Behind 1541 Asymptomatic cases: varying definition and statistical puzzle,02/04/20,Investigation,Animation," In late March, asymptomatic missions were increasingly spread and found in mainland China. However, the number of current asymptomatic cases was unknown while it's excluded from confirmed cases.   In the story, we compared the modifications related to the asymptomatic definition in six versions of Guidance for COVID-19 Prevention, Control and Diagnosis and Management from CDC since January 22<sup>th</sup>. Meanwhile, we collected and structured the ratio data from public information at provincial level.    The data varied from 1.83% to 37.84%, which indicated CDC's ambiguous definition lead to contradictions and negligence in tracking asymptomatic cases in local health departments. "," The project is the first data-driven project that brought up the challenge of tracking asymptomatics in early April,  when most of the provinces refused to release data to the public.    We structured the ratio of asymptomatic cases in different areas of China and the world and also structured the content of different versions of CDC guidance. Right after CDC published the total asymptomatic cases, we could check the data accuracy and depicted where they were.   Later the asymptomatics data was counted into Covid case reports and published daily both national and local.  "," We collected data from news, bulletins, medical journals and other public information. We used illustrator to visualize how definition texts varied and how the asymptomatics got excluded from confirmed cases, as well as compared ratios in different regions. "," In March and April, before the project, there was no structured data about the asymptomatics. In China, the asymptomatics was not defined as confirmed cases even though the nucleic acid testing showed positive, which resulted in a lack of tracking.   There is no big data or fancy interactions in this project, but it points out the contradictions between China's definition of the asymptomatics and WHO's, reveals the different statistical methods used by local health departments can lead to a huge data difference.    The unveiling information had covered disease transmission for a long time.

United States,FLORIDA TODAY,Small,Participant,"Behind the Black Ink: Stories of the dead and the pandemic missteps Florida tried to hide, by Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon and Jim Waymer",08/05/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Politics, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," In April, FLORIDA TODAY reporters Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon and Jim Waymer obtained Florida Medical Examiners’ database of COVID-19 deaths, which held facts about the pandemic and the state’s early response. As political considerations got factored into that response during an election year, the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis sought to control public information as Florida re-opened. Officials first blocked release of the full database. Then they redacted key fields, rendering it useless. Using the original unredacted data, FLORIDA TODAY produced a story about the state’s first 601 coronavirus fatalities, unveiling systemic failures of the state’s contact tracing and testing regimes. ","The ME database and stories FLORIDA TODAY published allowed the public to see detailed narratives of the first fatal cases of COVID-19, revealing the humanity and tragedy of the pandemic's toll. And they brought to light missed opportunities by health officials to trace how the disease was spreading. Their impact ramped up pressure on the DeSantis Administration for greater transparency of COVID data. They stirred a statewide debate over censorship of public records that garnered national headlines. The project was a boost to researchers, public records advocates and even medical examiners themselves, who argued that shutting down data access during a public health crisis cut people off from important information about the impact and scope of the pandemic.Newspapers and television across Florida added to the conversation with their own analyses of the data made available, thanks to Alessandro and Jim. A leading public health policy expert, Jay Wolfson, Senior Associate Dean at University of South Florida's Morsani College of Medicine, hailed FLORIDA TODAY's coverage, saying the ME's data needed to be cracked open as it's part of a fabric of information needed by leaders and policymakers need to plan and ensure the state's health. ""My colleagues have been continuously frustrated by ther inability to gain access to data"" he said, describing FLORIDA TODAY's main story as a ""detailed article that makes excellent use of case examples as w Our stories underscored the vital role medical examiners play in public health by highlighting the detective work they do to explain why people die, connecting the coronavirus and other medical conditions in ways that only be understood from autopsies. The stories eventually led to the State caving into a threatened lawsuit by a consortium of news organizations. Because of FLORIDA TODAY, the information the state was looking to restrict was already out"," We used relatively simple tools: Excel, Google Sheets and Google Flourish to visualize the data with some analysis. Extracting certain data required reporters to manually read each entry. For example, the number of days a decedent was hospitalized was not recorded by medical examiners, but could be extracted from the narratives medical examiners wrote because they routinely included key dates such as when a COVID-19 test was performed or when a person was hospitalized and, of course, the date of death. Reading through the narratives and doing keyword searches also helped identify cases of interest, as well as identifying trends. The number of times “diabetes” or “cruise” was mentioned in a column helped establish patterns and extract valuable information from the data. "," The sheer size of the database, the inconsistency and messiness of the data presented challenges to organizing and making sense of the information. It also turned writing a clear, digestible story into an extremely sensitive exercise in prioritization. We needed to make sure the data and cases we highlighted were representative, not sensational, and appropriately respectful to surviving friends and families involved.   To adapt a metaphor credited to Michelangelo, we had to see the story inside the block of data and know which superfluous bits to chip away. It was quite ambitious for a small county newsroom to take on a state-wide story in such a very short period of time.   Making it even more challenging was the fact that the story landed when the newsroom was hobbled by furloughs, meaning that on any given day, staff was down by 25%. Producing this project in just a week, was difficult given the staff shortages and demands of a daily newspaper.   Then there were the dilemmas over privacy – legal and ethical – with which the newsroom needed to contend. Privacy was one of the reasons given by the state as a justification for withholding the data in the first place.   But understanding that data was vital to public interest and public health policy at the critical time that Gov. Ron DeSantis was pushing to reopen the state against the advice of many experts, we decided to “publish and be damned.” The first responsibility of watchdog journalism is to expose realities the powerful don’t want the public to see, and that’s what we did. "," The success of this project showed that small newsrooms, with a little training, but lots of ambition and perseverance, can in a pragmatic, low-cost way do data journalism on the fly, punching way above their weight. It shows that it pays to spend time developing sources and staying up to date with the free tools available to make sense of information.   FLORIDA TODAY reporter Alessandro Marazzi Sassoon had been in touch with the Chairman of the Medical Examiners Commission, Dr. Stephen J. Nelson, since well before the pandemic because of the oversize role medical examiners exert in wide variety of fields, from criminal justice to public health. He was among the few reporters to know the medical examiners kept a database and requested it routinely before it became a politically controversial issue.    Reporter Jim Waymer, on the other hand, was regularly in touch with Google to understand how their tools could be used by journalists to organize, prioritize and illustrate data, meaning he was able to exploit the database Alessandro had. This enabled them to quickly peel back the layers of data and speak not just about the numbers of dead, but to get to the stories that those who died had to tell.

United Kingdom,The Times,Big,Participant,Behind the numbers,07/04/20,"Explainer, Open data","Google Sheets, CSV, R", Last year data was thrust into the spotlight like never before and we felt our readers would benefit from context and explanations of what the global pandemic meant for them.    Behind the Numbers was a new series which aimed to explain what the figures really meant – from why counting deaths is not straightforward to how many people were being tested.  ," Each story in the series was published to coincide with the broader news agenda. In April we explained why calculating the death toll is so difficult and we looked at why men were dying at higher rates than women. In May we wrote about why the death count was likely to be higher than the official figures and looked at how the data on the number of people being tested was flawed.    Each story performed extremely well with readers so we expanded the series to look at other topics, starting with what the data told us about racism in the criminal justice system.  ", These stories involved thoroughly researching all the datasets available and putting them in context for readers.

Although each has its own particularities, they are all subject to multiple prejudices from childhood to adulthood: education, income and employment, housing, relations with the police and health. "," The first impact of this project has been to to go beyond prejudices by highlighting facts, figures and points of view that are largely overlooked or biased by the media. The second impact was to show positive actions that are being undertaken in favor of indigenous people (see Project link 2). "," The main tools used were the different libraries associated with Python and JavaScript programming languages. Several studies carried out on Aboriginals in Quebec recently have given us access to a large amount of data about the subject. By using Python libraries for data science (Numpy, Pandas, etc.), we were able to extract relevant data and analyze them to compare the living conditions of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Quebec. We were thus able to observe the disparities at several levels: graduation, income, housing, health, etc. For data visualizations, we mainly used JavaScript's D3.js library. The Adobe Creative Suite was also used for visualisations involving one specific number to highlight.  "," The hardest part of the project was making sure we gave an accurate and complete picture of the situation. The portrait of Indigenous people in Quebec in the media is indeed often superficial or wrong and not representative of their reality. This contributes to perpetuating stereotypes towards these communities. We therefore wanted to do a rigorous work and collect as much information as possible on that subject. We had to read an immense quantity of academic literature, reports and articles in order to understand the historical and current situation. We conducted several interviews in order to be sure that Native people’s points of view were well represented. We also had to do a thorough data analysis in order to find statistics that were meaningful and representative of inequalities for each stage of life. "," The article presents a way of interweaving data, images, testimonials and text in a fluid and impactful way. The half-text, half-visualization  slider  format enables to simultaneously discover the data and all the explanations behind it. Readers can thus, beyond the numbers, completely put themselves in the place of an Aboriginal person in Quebec: they successively go through the different stages of their life and gradually discover all the accumulated obstacles. The images and testimonials through the article help to set a pace and associate these data and informations with real people and concrete traumatic experiences. Data come to life!

United States,Bloomberg,Big,Participant,Best and Worst Places to Be in Covid,24/10/20,Health,"Microsoft Excel, CSV, Node.js", The Bloomberg Covid Resilience Ranking is a comprehensive tool to assess which of the biggest 53 economies in the world are tackling the coronavirus with the least amount of social and economic disruption. ," The findings are a snapshot of how the world has changed in the Covid-19 era, reflecting the success of places in the Asia-Pacific region in containing and managing the threat, and the surprise underperformance of the U.S. and Europe. It tells readers where to look for the best and worst Covid strategies, with data-points shifting as the circumstances and focus of the pandemic changes. With many of the measures adjusting in real time, readers are able to discern patterns and gain understanding of developments as the pandemic continues to morph into its second year. For example, as the fierce winter wave continues in the northern hemisphere, previously high-rated places with minimal-disruption, no-lockdown strategies like Japan and Sweden have seen their ranking drop as outbreaks swell, reflecting the limits of a light-touch approach.    The Ranking has received global attention and affirmation. It's been cited by politicians from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern to Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and covered across print media, TV news, talkshows and documentaries everywhere from mainland China to Finland, France to South Korea. "," Google’s collaborative working tools are utilized for organizing the article’s content. Data are entered and organized in Google Sheets, which also has controls for aspects of the heatmap table visualization, and the body copy and placement of other elements are composed in Google Docs. Node.JS scripts are used to pull from Google Drive and our internal charting tool. The page is built with EJS templating, using custom markup based on ArchieML. The heatmap table is rendered using the Svelte JavaScript framework. This setup allows reporters to maintain and edit the article for subsequent updates. "," The Ranking brought together 10 (later expanded to 11) data-points into one definitive gauge, giving readers an interactive way of seeing the macro global pandemic state-of-play, while allowing them to drill down into specific economies or data indicators like vaccine access and fatalities per capita.    The 10 indicators were finalized over months to capture the full spectrum of lived experience in the Covid-19 pandemic, one that has upended previous notions of the best places to be during a public health crisis.    Going beyond basic indicators like the number of cases and fatalities, the Ranking took into account factors like people’s ability and willingness to move around, the stringency of the rules governing their daily lives, their level of access to vaccines, and how effective and developed their health-care systems are more broadly.    "," The lession that other journalist can learn from the project is that when you go beyond the basic and conventional indicators, the newsroom is able to cover the impact of the pandemic on a deeper level, and that is appreciate by the readers.

France,Dans mon labo,Small,Participant,"Beware, lazy journalists! I'm chasing your clichés",01/06/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, News application, Crowdsourcing, Infographics","Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, Python"," Journalists are supposed to avoid overused expressions in their writing, or at least that's what they teach in J-schools. Yet the stories we read are often filled with clichés.    To name and shame the news outlets that keep perpetuating the bad habits, I prepared a set of lively infographics, updated daily. They showcase the most frequent journalistic clichés and the news outlets that produces them in bulk.    But I also interviewed experts to understand why I was so obsessed by this topic. "," I am proud to say that my work put a smile on the face of many many journalists and news junkies during the grim pandemic year we went through.    To date, the page received 18,000 visitors, not bad for a personal blog. Soon after the publication, my Twitter mentions filled with users proclaiming their love or their hate of a particular cliché. Some of them kept on exchanging them ones joyfully FOR DAYS, which is a form of online harassment if you ask me.   I received 60+ suggestions of new expressions to add to my scraping engine – eight months in, I am still getting some. I guess denouncing a cliché has a cathartic effect for some readers.   It was mentioned by Nicolas Demorand, France’s most listened radio host, which prompted a furry of textos from friends of colleagues and made my mom very proud. I was interviewed by another famous radio host, Pascale Clark, at the station Europe 1. I suspect that radio journalists like to make fun about their print counterparts.   On a most serious note, many journalism teachers as well as various trainers from other fields have thanked me for this tool, that they use with their students.   The project also inspired a Canadian journalist, Philippe Couture. We worked together on a special Quebecois edition for the rankings, by tweaking the list of clichés to be detected and the news outlets to watch. "," The very first step was to come up with an initial list of 10+ clichés to detect. It later grew up to 100+ expressions used of the web scraping and/or for the custom detector provided at the bottom of the page.    I then wrote two Python scripts. The first one searches daily for each expression in the French edition of Google News, using its little-known RSS feeds. The second one searches the same source for the number of stories published by each news outlet identified by the first script.   The number of stories (averaged on several weeks) is used to weight the number of clichés found by an estimation of the size of the medium. We need fairness here, I don't want to infuriate the French media world. The result we get is a global clichés score for each news outlet.   I then wrote a third Python script, that works as an API to access the scraped data. It can be queried to retrieve a list of clichés or a list of news outlets on a custom timespan, in the form of a JSON file.   On the front-end side, I wrote a Vue.js application to generate dynamically the infographics by querying said API.   (The whole process is probably vastly oversized for such a lightheaded topic, but the French lockdown during the first phase of the Covid pandemic was long, and I needed a project to clear my mind.) "," I set myself a challenge: to create the definitive online ressource on the topic of clichés, and not just a one-shot story that will die in a few days.   So it had to be updated live, I could not just use the results of some punctual searches. That led me to write Python scripts reliable enough to run each day without crashes and errors.   One consequence is that I had to take a step back from my code at the end of the project, to decide if the infographics were enough or if I needed to beef up the story itself. That prompted me to interview two linguists after showing them the then almost finished project, to get a more scientific take on the subject.    They explained me why journalists can be so obsessed by clichés, and why the readers probably don't care about them so much.    Believe it or not, despite the long hours with my friends Python and Javascript, the more traditional journalistic work of the project is the part I am the most proud of. "," Here are some take-aways:  <ul>  doing data-driven journalism does not mean you have to work on serious stuff all year. Sometimes it's good to work on a Covid-19 dashboard that saves lives. Sometimes it's good to be The Pudding.   getting some usable data for a one-shot story is far more easy than working on a comprehensive process to work with this data on a long-term basis. No shocker here.   if you are too deep in technical stuff, it's easy to forget about the basic journalistic work: reading documentation, interviewing people that know the data more than you, questioning the take on the subject you chose initially…   designing custom infographics means being obsessed about details until the last minute. The first time you think your work is over, there is probably 10% of the total time still left to go.   bar chart races are cool, they are not a fad so don't let any dataviz pundit tell you the opposite.  </ul>",https://dansmonlabo.com/2020/06/01/jai-repris-la-chasse-aux-cliches-dans-les-medias-et-voila-ce-que-jai-appris-1969/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NVJLpa9EveF7xqDU4ralU-O1tqpH8T2XQgM1mQat9U4/edit?usp=sharing,https://twitter.com/yannguegan/status/1267480178890084353,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&u=https://www.franceinter.fr/emissions/les-80-de/les-80-de-12-juin-2020,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&u=https://www.europe1.fr/emissions/linfo-media-du-jour/tirer-la-sonnette-dalarme-grincer-des-dents-la-chasse-aux-cliches-journalistiques-3980126,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&u=https://lesecrans.ca/dans-mon-labo-yann-guegan-analyse-medias-quebec/,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=fr&tl=en&u=https://www.tdg.ch/la-jouissive-chasse-aux-poncifs-697542857705,,Yann Guégan," I am a journalist in charge of editorial innovation at Contexte’s newsroom in Paris.

Through illustrative and interactive storytelling backed up by comprehensive datasets from Birdlife International and the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force, the story kept readers engaged as they learned about real threats migratory bird species face and the efforts taken to protect them. The story received good attention amongst environmentalists and conservation groups, and was shared widely on social media.     "," Datasets were provided by Birdlife International and the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force, but further research was done to find suitable and relevant data from other research and non-governmental organisations. Illustrations were done with Adobe Photoshop.   Maps were made with Mapbox GL JS. We overlaid the story text over the map using Scrollama. This helps to link the story text to the map such that the text triggers different map functions like zooming in or out and/or changing the mapview as the reader scrolls through the story.   We also used Turf JS to animate the routes of the migratory birds. We combined Turf JS with Scrollama to create a ""driven"" route which extends the line drawn on the map depending on how much the reader scrolls on the page.     "," The hardest part about this project was in creating a narrative that was easy to understand around comprehensive datasets and complex concepts, and making sure that maps and illustrations would be helpful for the readers instead of being included merely for aesthetic purposes.

We produced more than 10 contents and divided our coverage in three parts: pre-electoral, electoral and post-electoral, considering that each moment had unique information to highlight.  "," In 2020, Brazil had municipal elections at the same time that the country was struggling with covid-19 pandemics. Therefore, electors had to evaluate mayoral response to the crisis in every city. In this context, more information, based on data, was essential for voters.       The infographics of this project contributed so that the voters who follow the newspaper could have an understanding based on data of the candidates for the election, their historical context and, in a second moment, of the election result.       The election was also marked by the increase of gender and racial diversity, both in number of contenders and elected officials. The publications aimed to present this change whenever it was possible, even for live results coverage, which is something that  some media outlets tend to not prioritize. "," For data analysis and processing, we used R and R Studio, which also helped us to plot the graphs. Almost all of them were made using ggplot2 and other Tidyverse resources.       For all publications, we first built a script on Google Docs and shared it with the entire team. Then we built the visualizations in Adobe Illustrator, where we exported an HTML code that we edited and published on the website. ",     Editing the graphics that we are going to present to readers. We think seriously and discuss which visualizations we have will be easier to understand. Even if it is not the most beautiful although the harmony of the elements and clarity is essential in our production. Our goal is to present clear and interesting stories with data. ," Journalists can use this project as a reference to tell stories with infographics and bring understanding to their readers without necessarily writing too many paragraphs of text.   They also can use our planned coverage (pre-electoral, electoral and post-electoral) as a template for electoral coverage in general. Each moment demands different aspects to highlight and it is important to have a clear view of that from the beginning.  ",https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2020/11/30/O-resultado-geral-e-o-hist%C3%B3rico-das-elei%C3%A7%C3%B5es-para-prefeito,https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2020/11/29/O-desfecho-das-elei%C3%A7%C3%B5es-para-prefeito-nas-capitais-em-2020,https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2020/11/16/O-perfil-dos-vereadores-eleitos-no-Brasil-em-2020,https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2020/12/03/O-resultado-das-elei%C3%A7%C3%B5es-em-S%C3%A3o-Paulo-e-no-Rio-em-detalhes,https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2020/11/12/O-desempenho-dos-prefeitos-que-buscam-reelei%C3%A7%C3%A3o-nas-capitais,https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2020/10/22/A-idade-dos-candidatos-a-prefeito-e-vereador-em-2020,https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2020/09/10/Qual-o-n%C3%BAmero-de-filiados-a-partidos-no-Brasil-em-2020,,"Lucas Gomes, Caroline Souza, Gabriel Maia, Renata Rizzi, Gabriella Sales, Gabriel Zanlorenssi","  Lucas Gomes (designer),  B.A. in Design (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro)    Gabriel Zanlorenssi (data scientist and assistant-editor),  M.A. in Political Science (Universidade de São Paulo)    Caroline Souza (design assistant),  B.A. in Geography (Universidade de São Paulo)    Gabriel Maia (data analyst),  undergraduate student in Oceanography (Universidade de São Paulo)    Gabriella Sales (intern),  undergraduate sutdent in Journalism (Universidade de São Paulo)    Renata Rizzi (editor),  P.h.D. in Economics (Universidade de São Paulo) ",

Japan,Nikkei,Big,Participant,China's data superpower,24/11/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Politics, Business","Scraping, Python"," This was a series of stories focusing on China’s influence in the digital world. We are curious how China uses its power to censor the cross-border data flow and fragment the internet world. We analyzed the cross-border data flow and revealed that China has overtaken the U.S. in the volume of data flow and now has twice the size of the U.S.. Also, we used the positioning satellite data to investigate China's influence in space. According to our analysis, Chinese version of GPS, Beidou has more global coverage than the U.S. original. "," We published the article both in Japanese and English. Both received high engagement from our readers especially from outside Japan. Our report was referenced in many areas including <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/chief-of-defence-staff-at-rusi-annual-lecture"">defense officials</a> and our group company, Financial Times also published <a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/58fd14f0-4fba-4242-bf25-3f493979125e"">the article</a> on its site. "," To illustrate the fragmentation of the data world, we compared the user activities at the code-sharing site GitHub and its Chinese rival Gitee. We used their APIs with Python and analyzed the activities. Due to the fears of losing access to GitHub, some programmers are gradually networking with Gitee.   In the article on China's satellites, we scraped the data from the visualization tool offered by U.S. receiver company Trimble. Trimble's GNSS (Global Navigate Satellite System) planning tool is very helpful to understand where satellites circulate. We used Selenium with Python and collected the number of observable satellites for each country's capital city in the world. "," Nikkei acquired figures for the amount of data that enters and leaves each country from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a United Nations Specialized Agency, and U.S.-based data analytics company TeleGeography.   There are pros and cons to both the ITU data and the TeleGeography data. The ITU data is narrowly focused on the bandwidth used for actual communications, but it does not cover the communication partner country. TeleGeography’s data shows a breakdown of communication partners, but because it includes bandwidth not used for communications it is undeniably slightly different than the actual state of communications.   After the tough discussion, we decided to use ITU figures to compare the total amounts of cross-border data by country, and TeleGeography’s statistics were used to calculate the relative compositions of communications with partner countries. "," It is difficult to grasp China’s influence in the digital world based on ordinary data. But China cannot interrupt data beyond its boundaries.

United States,The Hechinger Report & NBC News Digital,Big,Participant,Colleges in Crisis,04/08/20,"Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Infographics","D3.js, JQuery, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python"," Even before the pandemic, many colleges and universities were in serious financial trouble. This series, a partnership between The Hechinger Report and NBC News Digital, quantified the problem. The project used rigorous and exclusive data analysis of financial metrics for 2,662 higher education institutions and presented results in a ground-breaking interactive tool. The series included four stories detailing in depth the reasons behind these financial woes, including mismanagement by college administrators. It exposed the depth of the crisis, the impact on students and communities, and the potential for solutions.  "," This project clearly resonated with the public, performing exceedingly well on both NBC’s and The Hechinger Report’s websites. Reporters were contacted by many people, including higher education administrators and consultants, asking to have access to the underlying data to explore it further.   It wasn’t only the tool that received attention. The accompanying stories also generated engagement. In response to a piece by Sarah Butrymowicz about abrupt school closures, a senior analyst for the Government Accountability Office working on a report on the impact of college closures reached out to ask us to share our research on the topic.  "," The foundation of this project was The Hechinger Report’s interactive tool, the Financial Fitness Tracker, which was informed by methodology developed by Robert Zemsky, a University of Pennsylvania education professor; Susan Shaman, the former director of institutional research at Penn; and Susan Campbell Baldridge, a professor and former provost at Middlebury College. Their methodology draws on federal data that most schools have reported steadily over the past decade and allows public and private institutions to be scored according to similar standards. Our series and tool applied the methodology to individual schools, as the academic researchers did not, to make the scores transparent and public.          Using Excel and Python, The Hechinger Report’s data visualization editor, Pete D’Amato, spent months translating the academic author’s methodologies into mathematical formulae and using them to programmatically analyze data for each institution. Institutional financial health was assessed in several categories, including enrollment and tuition revenue. To account for a lag in federally reported data, D’Amato projected values out to 2019-2020, the most recent academic year. He determined two thresholds – alert and warning – by taking the 20<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> percentile, respectively, in each category.   D’Amato then turned this data to create the reader friendly Financial Fitness Tracker using d3.js, json and jQuery. For each institution, the tool displays their long term trend in each metric and shows whether or not they’ve crossed the warning threshold. It also provides information on trends in admissions and revenues and expenses. NBC’s Joe Murphy assisted with the testing and presentation of the data. "," One unusual obstacle was acquiring a deep understanding of the methodology laid out by the three academic researchers, whose work was published by Johns Hopkins University. Since those authors did not name any institutions analyzed using their methodology, it was difficult to test their analyses by comparing them to other commonly available outcome metrics. Hechinger’s Pete D’Amato put a great deal of labor into translating the authors' methodologies into mathematical formulae in order to be able to programmatically analyze data for each institution. Additionally, this project was also made more difficult by the sheer amount of data. A lot of staff-hours were put into assembling and, more importantly, bulletproofing the final product.   This subject also required extreme care with reporting, since the appearance of financial stress within an institution could create additional stigma that would compound the problems. With that in mind, the journalists made sure to contextualize the financial difficulties within the universe of all higher education institutions, and to explain the ways in which financial difficulties have, in the past, sometimes harmed an institution and sometimes not affected the institution at all. We wanted to make sure readers knew that identifying an institution as being under stress, financially, did not necessarily mean it was at risk of closing.  "," This project shows the importance of journalists developing transparent and easily understood metrics for gauging the relative stability of major institutions such as colleges and universities that millions of Americans consider important to their financial and personal development. While industry-specific rankings like those of U.S. News and World Reports help families make decisions for higher education, journalists can leverage analytics to make school funding and financing more easily understandable for this audience as well.   This project, and the Financial Fitness Tracker in particular, can also serve as a launching point for local stories. In fact, several NBC affiliates have already used it for that exact purpose. For instance, KXAN, the Austin affiliate of NBC News, provided robust coverage based off Hechinger’s analysis and reporting. They produced an on-air report which included a conversation between KXAN and The Hechinger Report. They also interviewed college administrators and students in central Texas—with a special callout box for our Financial Fitness Tracker as well as the longform on-air conversation.

"," Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, many articles have been published about the impact of the covid-19 on the economy, unemployment, domestic violence, and the psychological effects of quarantine and how to deal with it.Among the researches I did in this field, I encountered a serious problem, and that was the society's reaction to this virus. As mentioned in the article, the hidden part of this research is the culture of a society in dealing with an issue. An issue that has been seen in connection with various issues in Iranian culture for many years. Exclusion and rejection of people from society with various diseases, and the most important example is the people who have AIDS. that although the type of illness and society's view of the two is very different, what they have in common is the community's concern about themselves being infected with these viruses and their fear of social stigma, the reason of which is low awareness. "," in order to answer my question and investigate how true this issue is, I utilized qualitative method with grounded theory methodology for analysing the data to explore the social stigma in Iranian culture and the relation between coronavirus infection and social stigma.    By utilizing qualitative method and in-depth and semi-structure interviews, participants were asked to become narrators of their experiences.    some of the interviewees had good and positive experience but some of them not. I collect the negative answer and by coding the data attempt to show and narrate the cultural problems of a society in relation to a disease.

Months later, the progression of the virus has taken many twists and turns as it spread into the local community before hitting foreign worker dormitories hard.    This is an ongoing project which has pivoted twice to deal with the changing nature of the virus, involving major design and coding overhauls.    We remain the only media outlet in Singapore to continually update our readers with daily local data in a visual storytelling format since it was first published in February 2020. "," Not only is this graphic among the top 10 of all stories published by The Straits Times in 2020, it has also had incredible longevity. At key moments in the outbreak, the graphic has seen more people flocking to this page over a longer extended period than any other story.    Daily updating takes less than 30 minutes, and this is an incredible feat when faced by multiple data points in PDF formats spread across the Ministry of Health’s website. Data delivery has also pivoted many times. "," We used a combination of Google sheets via mostly manual entry because the data delivery methods were constantly changing. In a way, we are actually glad to have needed such a close eye on the daily data as we were able to pick up on any discrepancy, of which there were many, and query the authorities when neccessary.    The network graphics, which were in use in the early stages of the local spread in the community, were an engineering feat. We were able to dynamically update the clusters daily for almost two months! It used force directed layout from D3 and the clusters were laid out in a scrollytelling narrative format so we could highlight the key points to our readers for that day. It worked amazing on mobile even as the clusters grew. It is a true shame we were not able to continue using this and had to resort to more common charts as cases spiralled. "," Data is delivered to the media via PDFs and it has changed frequently over the course of the outbreak. The team has had to manually update from the PDFs into our own dataset which is used to power the main graphics.    Later, it spread to multiple data points across more than five locations across their website and other PDFs.

United States,"aatishb.com, Minute Physics",Small,Participant,Covid Trends,27/03/20,"Explainer, Illustration, Chart, Video","Animation, CSV, Python"," In early March, Aatish developed a Python code notebook to gather & analyze daily global COVID case numbers. He noticed that cases in different regions followed a similar pattern of exponential growth. This led him to collaborate with Henry Reich, who creates the science YouTube channel Minute Physics, to create the interactive graph Covid Trends [1], and also create an explainer video introducing this graph [2]. Covid Trends received many millions of visitors in 2020, and our companion video (How To Tell If We're Beating COVID-19) was viewed 6 million times. "," Covid Trends visualized trends at a time when most venues were reporting daily numbers in isolation. It was one of the first COVID graphs to employ a 7-day average and a logarithmic scale, and it used a novel set of axes (recent cases vs cumulative cases) to emphasize deviations from exponential growth. This work inspired similar graphs at NPR, The Financial Times, Our World in Data, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Health [4], and the Indian Statistical Institute [5]. It was featured in IndiaSpend (a data journalism non-profit) [5] and Popular Mechanics’ list of the best COVID graphs [3], was cited in over a dozen academic publications [6], incorporated input from 25 contributors [7], and was forked on Github over 100 times. "," We used standard animation tools to create the animated YouTube video. For the website, we used custom JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the libraries plotly.js for graphing and vue.js for interactivity (i.e. reactivity). Our initial background data analysis research was conducted in Python Jupyter notebooks. We use world data from Johns Hopkins University and US state data from NYTimes.         "," The most challenging aspect of this project was finding a representation of the data that clearly highlighted trends at a glance. After a few weeks of experimentation, we hit upon a few useful strategies that visually emphasized when cases in a country grew along an exponential growth trajectory (and also when cases deviated from this trajectory):     1. We employed a 7-day window to smooth out the data (while this is now standard, this was rare in early March 2020).     2. We employed a logarithmic scale and a novel choice of axes to help people easily identify exponential growth trends as straight lines in the graph. Because of our background in physics, we were familiar with the technique of representing data in 'phase space' and employed this idea here.     3. As time is not one of the axes in our graph, we instead used an animation to represent time. By representing time with motion, this animated view allowed viewers to more easily grasp the growth of cases over time at a glance. "," We open-sourced our codebase under the permissive MIT license. This project has been forked on GitHub over 100 times and incorporated input from over a dozen contributors [7]. Other journalists can learn about how to create an open-source customizable interactive tool that continues to be useful to many people, incorporates volunteer contributions, and represents data through a lens that emphasizes trends rather than individual data points in isolation.

The compulsory quarantine imposed on them at the crossing forced hundreds of drivers to sleep in the open air for days and sometimes for two weeks awaiting their turn to get a place at the quarantine station. The examination procedures also violated health protocols and were considered infectious. ," The investigation shed light on an issue that most people didn't know about specially since it pertains to a group of people that are under reported: truck drivers. Most importantly, the investigation increased pressure on the government that it announced a decrease in the compulsory quarantine period from two weeks to only one week after the investigation was published. After a while, it was only compulsory to do a PCR test. If the result came back negative, the drivers would have to quarantine at home, and it it came back positive, they would have to move to a quarantine station. "," I used live video chats with drivers at the border instead of face-to-face interviews due to the lockdown and the closure of all facilities. As for the digital tools, I used videos, audio recordings, videographs, charts, timelines, and open source data. "," While working on this investigation, it was hard to control all of the details because it was a completely new situation and there were new things happening everyday. Therefore, I had to put certain themes in front of me to focus on, including the confusion of government decisions, the poor implementation of those decisions, the violation of health protocols, and the victims of those violations. From there, I had to collect all of the facts to build a deep story that covers everything that happened from the beginning of the pandemic, to the imposition of quarantine on drivers, up until all of the continued confusion for months and the social, physical, and health consequences of this confusion.   In addition tot this, every investigative journalist seeks to check every piece of information told by his sources, and this was difficult to do while working under lockdown and being unable to do field work and go to the crossing, so I resorted to remote video interviews with drivers at the crossing to document everything with image and sound. Some of the drivers interviewed were quarantined and some were waiting for their turns to quarantine. This monitoring and documentation phase went on for a month, and was then followed by using open source data, verification, and double checking all the information and making sure the information gathered matched the data.   One of the other hard things was obtaining statistics related to a new pandemic, so I resorted to the daily press briefing issued by the Jordanian Ministry of Health regarding the Coronavirus. I collected the important statistics over a period of 4 months and analyzed them in order to uncover the existing gaps and unveil confusion. "," It is important to invest in the tools currently offered by technology to overcome the difficulties that our circumstances sometimes impose on us, and it is vital to analyze the data to get a clear picture of the situation that the journalist seeks to document. Remember that if an official body refuses to give a statement or provide you with statistics, then your role does not end here, because the same information and statistics can be found in annual reports issued by a another related party.

It should work ok to google translate the information.  "," Due to the fact that very few people were tested for Covid in Sweden in the first months of the pandemic, measuring the number of people in intensive care became the most reliable indicator of how well (or how badly) the fight against the disease was going. Through the article, we provided a way for the public to inform themselves about the current status of the outbreak nationally as well as in their own regions.The article is often referred to in discussions about how the pandemic is affecting Sweden, both in domestically and internationally, and has, as of this date, had 32,4 million page views - that is alot in our mediahouse.

We get at lot of emails form doctors and nurses that prefer using our page instead of other sources - that's how we know we have done our job. "," In order for the data to be as up to date as possible, we set up an automatic data pipeline where a python-script on our server would collect the latest data and upload it to a file server for our visualizations to use. There was no public API we could use, so in order to get the information we needed from the official source, we had to reverse-engineer http-requests sent to their server and figure out what parameters to change in the call to get the correct data.The visualizations were made in javascript and html, with the help of d3 and Svelte. We wanted the reader to be able to easily compare trends in different regions, and allowing them to get more detailed information in specific regions, so we decided to display mini-versions of the charts in grids. Clicking on the mini-version gave the reader a more detailed view. We also built warning-bots that let's us know if someting looks strange with the numbers at our sources webpage. This has been useful for us, but also for them several times when we have discovered faults in the data long before they do. The article is design to work equally well on desktop and on mobile.

Another challenge has been staying on top of new information as it became available. When we first published the article there was no information about the number of people being treated in intensive care any given day (the only information we had was how many new individuals had been checked in to intensive care each day, we didn't know how many were still being treated). We also had no information about inpatient care, and so when the new data suddenly became available, we had to scramble to quickly set up the new data pipelines and create the new visualizations. "," Our project shows how basic chart designs can be effectively utilized to communicate critical information in a simple yet powerful way, which both allows the reader to get quick overview of the current situation, and allowing for more detailed exploration of the specifics of the data.

By breaking down the numbers for this «Corona House», the reader is led through the economic, health, and social impacts the virus had on the Swiss population in 2020.   "," The article was one of the most-read articles in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ) in the week of its publication. It also yielded 25 new paid subscriptions and 42 new registrations. Furthermore, the story was featured in various outstanding data journalism collections, such as the monthly ""Best of the Visualization Web"" compilation by Andy Kirk and GIJN's ""Data Journalism Top 10"" list.   Online, the article caused fruitful discussions among our readers: Some readers remarked how applying the statistics to 100 people renders one of the most extensive problems of the pandemic visible: Of the 100 residents of the ""Corona House"" not one dies. However, many are affected by health problems caused both by the virus itself and by the pandemic at large. This discrepancy between a relatively low lethality and the dispersed and thus more invisible secondary impacts is what makes the various political approaches to curb the pandemic so controversial. Beyond these discussions, readers also praised the way we told the story. One reader, for example, wrote in the comment section: ""Compliments! A great example of how serious press work can enlighten (...)."" Another person commented: ""Bravo NZZ. A sight to behold! An example of enjoyable online journalism."" From these online comments and discussions, we gather that the story made an important contribution to the understanding of the coronavirus pandemic and its impacts on Swiss society. "," As the reader scrolls through the story, an illustration of the ""Corona House"" and its residents stays in a fixed position while different statistics are faded in as a short sentence. Those residents that are affected by the statistic are highlighted visually. These ""scrollytelling"" elements alternate with brief summaries of feature stories by the NZZ, portraying real people's struggles in the pandemic. More detailed illustrations showing life within the apartments accompany those summaries.   We based the residents and the configuration of the households in the residential complex on official population statistics by the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics. The data on the impacts of Covid-19 across economic and social spheres stems from various sources, such as surveys, official covid-19 statistics, and scientific studies.    The story concept was created through an iterative sketching process. For the production, we later turned to Adobe Illustrator and Sketch. Data was collected collaboratively in a Google spreadsheet. We developed the story's online implementation with our own charting tool ""Q"" which allows us to add custom code to our Content Management System called ""Livingdocs"". The custom code is written in HTML, CSS and Javascript, specifically sevelte.js.  "," This project's challenge was to condense the impacts of a global health pandemic into a coherent story that makes abstract concepts and large numbers more tangible. The story went through multiple iterations to curate the most important and prevalent statistics related to the pandemic and to sharpen the visual storytelling concept. In effect, the project combines two approaches: the statistical game of applying numbers to a small sample and the visual metaphor of the ""Corona House"", which addresses how people have become isolated in their own four walls during the pandemic. This combination is reflected in the visual style of the story, which merges data and illustrative elements. We believe that the resulting playfulness makes for a powerful, immersive way to look at statistics that allows a broad range of people to ""find themselves"" within this story.   "," One of the core questions that data journalists should ask themselves daily is how a number relates to their readers' lives. While governments create numbers, and scientists compute numbers, data journalists are in the business of communicating numbers. That doesn't mean that journalists cannot be active players on the data aggregation and analysis side of a story. It just means that, at the end of the day, no matter what has happened in the process before, the numbers have to be communicated tangibly. This project demonstrates how making numbers more relevant to the individual can be carried out on multiple levels. On the side of the data, we can think of ways to break down large numbers to more accessible sizes and choose statistical concepts that make numbers relevant to people's lives. On the side of the visual storytelling concept, we can use visual metaphors and alternate between overviews and detailed examples to allow the reader to gain a foothold in the story. And on the side of the visualization, we can choose metaphors and styles that are immediate and reflect life rather than abstract it.  ",https://www.nzz.ch/schweiz/corona-in-der-schweiz-wie-covid-19-unser-leben-veraendert-hat-ld.1588566,https://docs.google.com/document/d/10179rjEJz3f_qYDuoRACUQ0MlxpTe2jO1K8N9JnRjlM/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,,,"Adina Renner, Anja Lemcke, Roman Karavia, Barnaby Skinner","  Barnaby Skinner   Barnaby Skinner is the head of the NZZ Visuals department at Neue Zürcher Zeitung (NZZ).

Nigeria,Stears Business,Small,Participant,Covid-19 live monitoring in Nigeria and States response index,24/03/20,"Open data, Chart, Map, Health","Scraping, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap"," The Stears Business team put together a series of live-data visualisations to help track the spread of the virus in Nigeria since the first case on 27th February 2020. It was a data-driven special project and the data is open data, gotten from NCDC and compiled by Stears Business.   The second part is a State Response Index. The Index is a dynamic measure of each state in Nigeria's  aggressiveness  in combatting the virus and implementing palliative economic measures. The rankings measure how aggressively each state government has responded to the pandemic and is not a measure of a state's performance. "," The project increased awareness to the general public by giving live updates in a format that is easy to understand and share. The visualisations were shared on social media and in groups, giving accurate reports per time.   Some researches from the London School of Economics, UK and a local University sent emails requesting for the data to use for further socio-economic research on Nigeria.   State leaders, Governors and Senators referred to the Stears Business state response index multiple times in the press and meetings while discussing the state's efforts to minimise the infection in their communities. "," Google Sheets was used to import the data automatically from the NCDC official site. The Google Sheets was linked to a Tableau workbook that automatically updates daily.    Tableau was used to create the visualisations and embed on the live website via our custom editor. The map was created with Open Street map via Tableau. Tableau was also used for cleaning, wrangling, analysis and visualisations. The cases graph is a log chat because covid-19 infection is exponential and log charts are an efficient way to see the trend and if the curve is flattening. "," The hardest part of this project was the data collection. We did not know how many rows, entries or cases we would have to record. We had to switch up the arrangement of the data collected three times to reduce errors, human redundancy and add relevant columns.   Another challenge in data collection was inconsistency by the official NCDC Government agency in releasing data. We had to reach out to volunteers in the agency to get the data release process standardised, constantly check to see if anything has broken and make robust alllowances so we can easily implement any changes. "," From this project, other journalists can see the impact of data journalism for social good. It also highlights the importance of working with the Government to democratise data and strive for open data.    The need for adequate data collection and aggregation is also important, so that the team does not get overwhelmed as the project scales.

Germany,ZEIT ONLINE,Big,Participant,Covid-19 Live-Dashboard,02/04/20,"Database, News application, Infographics, Map, Politics, Environment, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python"," The German regional health offices report all Covid-19 cases to the highest authority for disease surveillance. As these regional authorities are still poorly equipped, there are still delays in reporting. Early on, we therefore started to collect the latest infection figures directly from the German 401 districts. This is partly done manually, as there are rarely reliably structured data sources on the local websites that are suitable for a scraper. In addition, scrapers provide us with comparative figures. We are presenting these figures from the very beginning of the pandemic on our front page which is linked to our Live-Article. ","  The visits to our front page are growing against the trend, we explain this with the people who visit the Corona dashboard there several times a day. The detailed live-article behind it recorded millions of views in 2020. Overall, in 2020, our daily reach quadrupled at its peaks. This all contributed to our revenues increasing by half compared to the previous year - in the middle of a global crisis. The ZEIT ONLINE Covid-19 dashboard belongs to one of several sources used by Johns Hopkins University for the German numbers.  ","  We use a combination of Google Sheets and GraphQL for the backend. The frontend is mainly based on Javascript, React and D3.   ","  The hardest part was to coordinate the manual retrieval and collection of data several times a day and to ensure its quality. Where possible, scrapers were implemented, which have to be technically maintained when structures on external websites change. In order to be faster than the official reporting chain, we are still busy manually collecting the latest infection figures and deaths from regional sites. The constantly changing situation remains a daily challenge. And from a design perspective: how to present the detailed information in a limited space on a dashboard in a perfect way (with a very focus on mobile)?  New limit values are adopted, a gigantic vaccination campaign is launched, etc. This means not only the constant modification of the interactive live graphics, but also permanent dialogue with the authorities and, most importantly, the constant explanation and classification of the figures for our readers.  ","  The pandemic demands up-to-date information, which is requested by our readership. Based on that data, political decisions such as lockdowns are also made. ZEIT ONLINE ‘s data-team quickly realised that it was difficult for the higher-level government agencies in Germany to deliver regional data in time. An important insight: we data journalists should not be despondent in such a situation, but should be aware of our strengths, which we are trained for over the years in many important and time-critical projects. We had many players and different roles in the project. Our learning: You need one place to gather all the self collected data and compare it to official data. Parallel to the collection of data, an additional information and early warning system has been built up over time. All team members receive automated notifications via Slack when new data has been published externally and made available. In addition, the own figures are compared with other data sources and warning messages are sent via Slack if there are significant deviations. In this way, errors can be found quickly. In addition, dramatic regional changes can be quickly picked up on editorially. Another learning: It is not enough to focus on your nation. A pandemic is an inernational challenge. That is why our readers demand international comparative figures. It is essential that these figures are published directly next to national figures.

Currently we manually generate different scripts (whith Jupyter notebook) programmed in python to extract, consolidate, analyze and normalize the data from the different tables and add them to the historical series that must be modified on the fly in the workflow that we have organized.

Finland,Helsingin Sanomat HS.fi,Big,Participant,Covid-19 Tracking Project,09/03/20,"Breaking news, Database, News application, Infographics, Health",Node.js," At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic there was no reliable public source for Covid-19 cases in Finland. We started to collect that data by hand to our database. Right from the beginning we also published that data as open-source API for everyone to use.    The Helsingin Sanomat Covid-17 Tracking Project covers roughly three main areas: creating and maintaining our own open source Covid database, creating automatically updating graphs and alerts based on the data and publishing a daily Covid data story.   "," Our Covid-19 tracking project has had huge impact on two fronts: informing the public and in creating a new kind of open-source culture in journalism.     Our API has been used by several of our competitors, many start-ups and EU’s official statistics. In April 2020 alone the APIs were used 86 million times and in May 50 million times.    Later, when official government API sources got better, we automatized the datasourcing and continued to offer that data through our API. These APIs are still used by many because of the easy usability.    The government doesn’t still offer all crucial information such as hospitalization numbers in a machine-readable way. We have continued to update that data manually to our database and even the EU’s European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control still uses HS API in their official statistics.     In May 2020, together with the tech company Futurice, we created a service called Oiretutka (https://github.com/futurice/symptomradar) where people could report their symptoms. Through that we were able to detect a Covid-19 surge in Northern Finland before official statistics.    The money and time spend on maintaining our open-source database has been significant, but we feel publishing open-source data is important for journalism. It is new kind of journalism but based on traditional journalistic principles: we want to spread current, accurate information about important issues to the public.     We also use the data by ourselves. We have created multiple, automatically updating charts and tools. Also, our news robot writes a daily breaking news story about the newest Covid-19 cases. Our daily data story, that has been read millions of times during the pandemic, presents all our corona data graphs.     This combination of data gathering, news automation and open data is, we believe, unique and important part of the future of journalism.  "," The software components of the Covid-19 project have been built with node.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, various AWS resources (S3, Lambda, EC2 and various supporting services).    React is the main library used to build the automatically updating visualisations. The visualisation layer was built to support multiple visualisation dimensions, such as different geographical scopes (Finland <--> Global), measurements (Confirmed cases, deaths, hospitalisations, vaccinations) and scales (incidence vs absolute numbers). In addition the journalists could pick and choose the visualisations that supported their story the best.    The automated gathering of the data was implemented as one node.js service, which would collate the data from the multiple automated sources available (such as Johns Hopkins open corona data, The Finnish Health Authority’s APIs and the HS data collected by hand). In addition to scraping the data periodically from the sources a more efficient detection of changes in the Finnish situation was implemented with AWS Lambda to give HS an edge in reporting the real time situation of Finland.    The open data APIs were build using AWS Lambda for ease of scaling and maintenance. The lambdas normalise the data collected by hand and machine for a standardised access to the data for the consumers.    Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic HS Datadesk has worked in an extreme agile manner, combining software development expertise with journalistic excellence to provide tools to address the constantly changing news situations. A practical example of this has been that all the web visualisations have been made in a way that they are easily exportable to print as well, enabling the infographic designers quickly and easily make print versions of the visualisations. Another example is the editor that allows journalists to create visualisations for exactly their story (<a href=""https://bit.ly/2ITUM9J"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">https://bit.ly/2ITUM9J</a>).  "," Covid-19 has of course been new terrain for all of us, so we had to design everything on the go. One of the biggest challenges has been the inconsistency and schedule changes in some of our data source,  e.g. the data structure changing without prior notice.   ", The power of open-source data and the benefits of sometimes collaborating with competitors. Combining software development with journalism is potent combination in responding to both longer running situations and quick reactions.  ,https://github.com/HS-Datadesk/koronavirus-avoindata,https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000007691333.html,,,,,,,"Päivi Ala-Risku, Elisa Bestetti, Antti J.

While COVID-19 demonstrated the importance of home comfort, it also hit hard at organizations dedicated to homeless people, such as Montreal's emergency shelter services. In order to find out how their situation was evolving,  Le Devoir  surveyed them using an online questionnaire and interviews. 19 of them participated in this fieldwork.     ", We were able to get a picture of the situation when little data were publicly available. The readers were therefore able to discover the reality experienced by emergency shelter services in Montreal from different perspectives. ," This project required the use of several tools, both for data collection and visualization. To create the survey, we used the software  Google Forms , which enabled us to collect information associated with each organization. The results were then converted as an  Excel  file, allowing further analysis. Then, we wanted to show on a map in one look the capacities of all shelters in Montreal before and during the pandemic. We therefore used  QGIS, Json  and  D3.js  to illustrate the geography of the city, its main streets and the location of each refuge, with disks of area, proportional to the number of available places. The  D3.js  library was also used to create the waffle charts showing the differences in available places, budgets and number of meals served before and during COVID-19. "," The hardest part of the project was to find all the informations on the current situation, needed for a data journalism article. In fact, as the COVID-19 crisis was evolving very fast, all the data available on shelters in Montreal were quickly out of date. Furthermore, only few studies or academic literature representative of the reality existed because of the phenomenon of ""hidden homelessness"". Thus, we decided to create our own data bank. For each shelter, we had to make several calls and send emails until we reached the person in charge, to talk about our project and ask to fill out our survey. Then, we had to verify all the collected data to ensure their consistency and uniformity, as well as to recontact several organizations to ask for clarification. Analyzing the results was also difficult, because we had to handle a large amount of data collected from all organizations and extract strong statistics representative of the overall situation in Montreal. "," The article demonstrates how to overcome the lack of global data available on a subject.  No source could tell us about the COVID-19 situation in the Montreal shelters, so we asked them all by ourselves. Our investigation enabled us to create a unique article, describing a striking problem presented nowhere else on such a large scale. The large data bank we gathered also allowed us to describe in words and figures both the overall picture of shelters in Montreal and the particularly worrying situation of certain types of organizations (for women, Aboriginal people and young persons). We were thus able not only to describe the difficulties experienced by the managers of the shelters that we interviewed, but also to illustrate their points with data visualisations, showing how the problem was generalized.

India,Health Analytics Asia,Small,Participant,COVID-19: Find the testing centre near you,18/03/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Open data, Map, Health","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV"," At the onset of Covid-19 in India, information on government response and guidelines was scarce. Something as simple as Covid test centre locations was released as a PDF list with data scattered on the website of the country's premier body on their website. On March 18, 2020, Health Analytics Asia team started cleaning and verifying this data, and plotted it on Google Maps, updating it 24/7. The map reached millions in a matter of days. A critical piece of information was timely mapped and conveyed to users. It’s journalistic impact and relevance was widely appreciated in India. "," During the initial days of the publication, Health Analytics Asia received calls querying the centres mapped -- the general public was anxious in finding out the nearest locations where they could get tested. The map crossed 2 million views in 12 days and was republished by major news bodies. A measure of impact of the project is that the country’s premier authority - Indian Council of Medical Research - followed with a map of their own weeks later. The map stays relevant and is one of the most visited stories even after 10 months of publishing. With the latest developments in the Covid vaccine, the general public realises the need for answers about the COVID testing centres. The pandemic is far from over - this data and the visualisation onto Google Maps helped bridge the communication gap between authorities and the general public. "," Basic techniques of data scraping and refining were used in accordance with the instincts to present the crucial piece of information out in public as soon as possible. The project did not need any complex or advanced tools to be used. The method consisted of a simple step-by-step algorithm repeated on a daily basis with utmost care and an eye for detail. Since different PDF files were being published every day by ICMR, often redefining their categorisation of data, the first step was to comprehend it in a manner that connected with the preceding version. This was followed by scraping data from the PDF and sorting it into a CSV format. This required some refining and cleaning up of the addresses corresponding to the Google Maps locations, while keeping the categorisation of centres as intended by ICMR. The last step was to upload the locations on Google Maps, thus demarcating the updated COVID testing centres across the country. The entire project stemmed from the idea that data was present in the public domain, but it wasn’t readable in the manner that it needed to be - for the people who needed it most. Refining and optimisation were the key techniques used along with regular updation and cross-referencing sources.     "," Basic techniques of data scraping and refining were used in accordance with the instincts to present the crucial piece of information out in public as soon as possible.

The major learning from this project, to me, is that journalism is not about having a rare piece of information extracted from dark corners of the world; it’s about making sense of information [data] and providing citizens with timely information in a way they will be able to easily understand and act upon. Identifying the requirements of the general public is equally important as reporting precise and accurate information. It’s not about the complexity of a project; a simple data journalism project such as this can, using easily available but important tools does go a long way to serve people if it is pertinent, relevant at that point in time.

"," We curated data from more than 2,500 reports on deaths with Covid-19 symptoms from the websites of 08 Bangladeshi media outlets. The media outlets include all the major news portals in Bangladesh: Bangla Tribune, bdnews24.com, Daily Star, Daily Ittefaq, Daily Juganotor, Daily Kaler Kantho, Daily Prothom Alo, and Daily Samakal. We opted the media reports as source because of two reasons: (a) although there were reports of death with Covid-19 symptoms as far as we know noone was compiling them that could be used for further analysis or insights, (b) until now there has been no other open source that could be used for collecting data on deaths with Covid-19 symptoms.   The data ranges from 18th March to 31st August.   Findings of the data viz:   (a) The data viz shows that in Bangladesh the highest number of death (227) with Covid-19 symptoms occurred in Cumilla district which had less than 10,000 confirmed cases till 31st August 2020.   (b) According to official death tally percentage of people aged 0-20 years was 1.28% of total death until 31st August, 2020. On the other hand our data viz shows that the percentage for 0-20 years age range is 4.65 for deaths with Covid-19 symptoms.   (c) The data visual shows that 79% of the deceased with Covid-19 symptoms were male while 21% were female which resembles with official data for confirmed Covid-19 deaths. It should be noted that gender information was not available in 101 media reports. "," We gathered 12 types of information from 2,500 news report which are: (1) date of death, (2) division wher the death occured, (3) district where the death occured, (4) upazila wher the death occured, (5) name of the deceased, (6) age of the deceased, (7)gender of the deceased, (8) place of death, (9) source who confirmed the death, (10) if sample was taken from the deceased for Covid-19 test, (11) name of the media that reported the death, and (12) weblink of the published news.   We collected these data from 8 media reports seperately. Then we merged all 2,500 data in one single spreadsheet for cleaning and refining. As part of this we first sorted the data based on date, division, district and upazila. Then we checked the victims name and age against the date/district/upazila in order to avoid repetition. Finally the daat visual was developed with Laravel, html, css, Java Script, Google Chart. ", As we were combining reports from 8 different media outlets on same issue the hardest part of the project was to clean the data ensuring no repetition occurs.   Until now there is no other resource in Bangladesh than our data viz where people could get a complete picture of the deaths with Covid-19 symptoms. Moreover the data viz even presents data on upazila level. ," Information on death with Covid-19 symptoms for a specific area/region could be vital for decision makers, common people to learn about the Coronavirus situation. But the information will not have impact until it is converted into data. Journalists from aroudn the world could learn that developing data viz by converting news reports into data could be a useful method to unearth the pandemic situation in their area/region.

Taiwan,READr,Small,Participant,COVID-19: The mask map in Taiwan,06/02/20,"Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, News application, Infographics, Map, Lifestyle",Json," With the worsening COVID-19 outbreak in China, panic buying of face masks was spurred worldwide. In order to curb panic buying and the hoarding of face masks in Taiwan, the government launched a name-based rationing system for face masks. Despite the purchase limiting quantity of masks, this policy ensures that every citizen could had masks. At this time, which pharmacy sold masks became key information. READr used the open data from government to make a mask map, so that people could check the current inventory of masks by the map, as not to make a trip in vain. "," Users only need to open this webpage, allow the webpage to access your location, or enter the address by themselves, the mask map would display which pharmacies have stocks of masks near you. We use colors to mark the inventory of masks. During peak usage periods, people could set their goals by looking for ""green lights."" The map also showed which group of people could buy masks today. At that time, the policy allowed the people whose ID card numbers end with an even number to buy masks on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and the people whose ID card numbers end with an odd number to buy masks on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.   We also actually visited these stores through this map, and learned about what happened on the first day of sale by capturing real-time data on the inventory of masks, throgh these experenice to write related reports. "," From the backend, we automatically process the government open data, save them to Google Cloud Storage, and update them regularly. From the frontend, we use Vue.js and Google Maps to build an interactive mask map, a map where people can find the most available mask stores and read the stores' information by locating themselves or manually typing in their addresses. "," We published the map on the first day the mask real-name system was launched. This relies on our close contact with the citizen science and technology community. At the veryfirst time, we knew that the government would open the mask inventory data and we had the idea to make a map. The engineer complete the map within 5 days.

Cuba,"Postdata.club, Juventud Técnica, School of Math and Computer Science - Havana University",Small,Participant,Covid19CubaData,23/03/20,"Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Map","D3.js, JQuery, Json, CSV, Python"," Covid19CubaData is the reference platform in Cuba for data and information of the Covid19 epidemic in the country. It is the only one that structures the data, visualizes it and releases it as open data, all following a collaborative and open model. It was conceived as a platform that, based on the data and the principal website, evolved over time, with an android app, a telegram bot and several mirror websites. This platform is the reference for Covid data in Cuba and has been used by media, government, institutions, researchers, as well as other data referents related to the epidemic. "," The Covid19CubaData platform is the national and international reference for Covid 19 data and information in Cuba. It is used periodically by the health authorities and the government of the country for monitoring and decision-making throughout the epidemic. The President of the country, in an article published in the Journal of the Cuban Academy of Sciences, recognized and mentioned the platform - the only result that does not come from a governmental or institutional initiative - as one of the main results and tools in the fight. against the epidemic in the country. The Minister of Public Health, in his report to Parliament, also mentioned the platform as one of the most useful tools. The United Nations (UN) included the platform in a compendium of digital initiatives on Covid 19 at a global level. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) registers it as a data source for the epidemic in Cuba. The National Office of Statistics and Information of Cuba, source of the country's official statistics, also refers to it as a data source, as well as the Cuban Academy of Sciences and other multiple institutions and ministries. It is a source of data and information for multiple media and institutions, inside and outside of Cuba. The data that is released by the platform is used by scientists and researchers in their forecasts and analysis of Covid. The platform is cited in multiple articles and scientific publications. The project has also been the subject of several informative articles both by the press and by television, inside and outside of Cuba. The android application developed was the 5th most downloaded, counting applications of any kind, in the country during 2020. It was awarded as the best application in Cuba related to Covid19. "," The project was conceived as a collaborative platform, both at the software and data level. For this, its infrastructure was based on github, using this platform both as a repository of code and data, besides it was used as web server (via github pages) and also for tasks automation (vai github actions). Based on this, the data was structured, data that is taken from the textual reports published daily by the country's authorities, as JSON documents that are filled in every day. With this, different databases were created as well as different visualizations and tools. Likewise, other international data sources were automatically integrated and correlated (using github actions) with national ones. Likewise, other data that were obtained from other national sources were integrated, analized and visualized. With all this, the website, an android application and a telegram bot were built. For this, multiple languages, technologies, formats and paradigms were used: html, css, javascript, jquery, c3js, d3js, leaflet, datatables, flutter, android, telegram, python, docker, json, csv, excel, openoffice, bootstrap. "," In Cuba there is no tradition of open data, for the first time in history data related to an epidemic were commented on daily by health authorities. However, this data was published as common textual reports that did not allow its use in a automated and interoperable way. That was the first challenge, to structure the data on a daily basis so it could be released while being interoperable and in different formats. Next was, with this data, to build a platform that not only released the data but also offered affordable information with the technical elements related to the epidemic. Then, reach all possible audience by developing access and visuality for multiple formats (web, mobile and messaging applications). To this should be added the ability to react because due to the nature of the data and the way in which it is reported, it would be necessary to react quickly, with new developments, data structures, or the search for new information. Finally, all this would have to be done under quarantine conditions with a team that would not have the possibility of working in the same place.   From this, the Postdata.club team summoned two other actors, who accepted to be part from the beginning, who could contribute to the project, both from the journalistic and data curation point of view and from the development point of view: the magazine Juventud Técnica and the Havana University (students of the Data Journalism course that Postdata.club teaches there). In addition, since it was published as an open source project, several developers joined to collaborate. This team then was coordinated by Postdata.club through telegram groups. Thus, the project has been carried out remotely, publishing every day, developing new versions without the members of his team having met in person even once. "," - The importance of open and interoperable data. The data that we structured and released was the basis for the development of multiple projects, research, collaborations, and publications. Projects, such as OurWorldInData, from which we collect data to correlate them with those of the country, in turn took data from us for their own developments, achieving a contribution cycle.   - The importance of developing an open project (both code and data). In this way, several people contributed to the project, either by reviewing the code, creating mirror sites to reach more people, or taking the code and data for other developments.   - The importance of collaboration. If this project had not been thought of as a collaboration from the beginning, it would have been difficult to achieve the impact and position it has in Cuba and all over. This was made possible by the integration of different people from different spaces in search of a social and communicative objective.   - The development of a community and its feedback. Data is the essence of the project and it is structured and built in different ways: from automatic to manual. This makes it necessary to have a total transparency of the process and that the data can be verified by all. In this way, the community contributed not only with new ideas, but actively in the curation of the data and the detection of inconsistencies and errors.   - The possibilities of spatially distributed newsrooms and teams with multiple knowledge through the use of different digital tools for communication and development.

Finland,Helsingin Sanomat HS.fi,Big,Participant,Crime of the Priests,23/08/20,"Investigation, Infographics, Crime",Microsoft Excel," The article revealed types and mounts of crimes the priests of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland have committed. We found out more than 80 percent of the crimes and convictions haven’t been addressed in church cathedral chapters, although all acts should be evaluated by the church’s disciplinary machinery. If the church became aware of the priest's criminal conviction, the case was downplayed and often had no consequences. The results were displayed with s a search engine, including a description of each final judgment, a description of the act, the verdict, and the conclusions made by the church's cathedral chapter.  "," The results of the survey came as a big surprise to the leadership of the Evangelical Lutheran Church as well as the judiciary. This was the first time this kind of investigation has been done in Finland. Surprised by the number of priests' crimes, Archbishop Tapio Luoma of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland urged priests and church lecturers (female priests) convicted of crimes to contact the bishop and cathedral chapter of their own diocese. These were about 60 priests or church lecturers whose crimes have not come to the attention of the church or the handling of the cathedral chapters. The National Courts Administration Finland, which oversees the work of the courts, began to investigate why information about priests' convictions does not always go to the cathedral chapter. Some of the church's cathedral chapters acknowledged the shortcomings and began to trace priests convicted of a crime whose crimes had not ended up for investigation by the church priests' quality control body (court chapter). For example, the cathedral chapter of the Diocese of Helsinki traced fifteen criminal convictions of ten priests, all of which are to be dealt with in the cathedral chapter assessing the suitability of priests. "," Information requests, court files, Excel, OCR.  "," The whole project was laborious and took about two months. The biggest problem was that journalists do not have direct access to the criminal record in Finland. Instead, we asked information about the charges, which are public. But the charge is not a verdict. Therefore, the judgments had to be requested individually from each district court and had to be followed by a final judgment to the Court of Appeal and possibly the Supreme Court. Ordering judgments, tracking orders, and unloading judgments in Excel took a lot of time. "," The project showed that despite the great investigation, it is possible to investigate the crime of one group of decision-makers - in this case priests - by working in a disciplined manner and devoting enough time to requests for information, deciphering results, analyzing and creating an interesting story around research results.  ",https://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/art-2000006610762.html,,,,,,,,"Tuomo Pietiläinen, Petri Salmén, Ella Kiviniemi, Joonas Laitinen"," Tuomo Pietiläinen, text and data gathering    Petri Salmén, infographics    Ella Kiviniemi, photography    Tuomo Pietiläinen & Joonas Laitinen, search engine  ",
Mexico,EL QUINTO ELEMENTO LABORATORIO DE INVESTIGACIÓN E INNOVACIÓN PERIODISTICA,Small,Participant,Crisis Forense (Forensic Crisis),22/09/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, Map, Crime, Human rights","JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, RStudio"," “Crisis Forense” (Forensic Crisis) is an investigation published in September 2020. This <a href=""https://quintoelab.org/project/mexico-nation-overwhelmed-by-its-dead"">investigation</a>, based on public records, reveals the collapse of the forensic system in Mexico. In a country where 80.000 people are missing, we found that the Mexican morgues have received almost 39.000 bodies since 2006 that remain unidentified.   To visualize and share the data we designed:       National map of morgues.       Interactive that shows the number of unidentified bodies in each state and where they are sheltered       Interactive database to consult and download information like where each body was found, the cause of death and current location.     "," Our investigation put together the first database that shows the extent of the forensic crisis in Mexico, something that no authorities had done before. We built the first official and solid data about the forensic crisis in Mexico from all 32 states and the federal government. Our investigation was taken up by the most important national media and media abroad such as The Guardian (England), Univision (USA), El Diario (Spain), Ciper (Chile), and Infobae (Argentina).   Human rights organizations and collectives of people missing families are using our information to demand for an Extraordinary Mechanism for Forensic Identification that the federal government has created but has not implemented.    In Mexico, the government estimates that over 80,000 people are missing, and their families look for them, even in the morgues. However,  neither local or federal governments had ever informed the public the number of non-identified bodies under their custody, their characteristics nor where they are at the moment. The result is that families have to seek for their loved ones in each morgue where public servers denied them information and the databases they have. That is the first step to recover their identities and deliver the bodies to their loved ones.   Besides, the data and the tools we designed have allowed families of missing people to pressure the morgues’ public servers because now they know the specifics of the cases. They have told us that we filled an unattended government responsibility and information gap.   Our database is being used by several local journalists to investigate places where bodies were found, what happened with them and where they are sheltered now after consulting our interactive database. "," This investigation is based on more than 200 public information requests to each forensic authority of the 32 states of Mexico and the federal government.   We used Excel to build a database l with 38,891 rows, each one representing an unidentified body. We analyzed the data with RStudio to obtain numbers for each state, gender, year of register, place where the body was found, and place where it is sheltered.   This database was the source for the interactive tool that was built with React.js that allows users to choose any of the 32 states and federal government and show the distribution for year and sheltered place: <a href=""https://quintoelab.org/crisisforense/#interactivo"">https://quintoelab.org/crisisforense/#interactivo</a>    The database was uploaded directly to our private server as a CSV. It is queried on the back-end using the wpDataTables plugin, which uses a jQuery Javascript library called DatatablesJS. For displaying such a huge database, this last plugin allows users to add custom filters and makes sure the whole database is accessible for everyone who wants to save it and keep it for future queries, even if only a fraction of the database was meant to be saved. It is a highly flexible tool: people can put filters, search by words and download just their selection. It’s available here: <a href=""https://quintoelab.org/crisisforense/datos/"">https://quintoelab.org/crisisforense/datos/</a>     We made up another database with the information of each morgue address. The addresses were geolocalized using <a href=""https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/"">https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/geocoder/</a> and uploaded to CartoDB as an interactive map: <a href=""https://bit.ly/3oGRAgx"">https://bit.ly/3oGRAgx</a>    All the databases and the documents we received from the forensic authorities are available in their original version on Dropbox for anyone to download. "," The government’s opacity related to human rights violations is common in Mexico. We achieved to collect information from 33 different forensic authorities at the state and federal levels, even when some of them denied us the information or we had difficulty accessing it.    Since the start of the so-called ‘war against drugs’ 14 years ago, Mexico faces a humanitarian crisis due to the massive and systematic disappearances of people. However, no authority has reported the number of bodies that remain without identity. Nonprofit organizations, academics or media couldn’t get this data either. We know how many people are missing, how many murders and t crimes have been committed but the forensic crisis was completely hidden.   Another obstacle in this project was the disparity in the register of the non-identified bodies from one state to another: we had to normalize the data, scrape documents in PDF, and sometimes transcribe hundreds of pages..   We made what the Mexican government promised but never delivered for over a decade, even when the Mexican law obligated the national attorney to do so.   We wanted our work to be useful, so we designed the map and interactives to help people to understand the forensic crisis in our country and incentive them to use this information. We knew we couldn’t analyze and understand all the data we got, that probably local journalist and families who seek for their lovely ones could recognize places, could link dates or simply ask more questions to the database, so we built an interactive easy to use database so anyone can use and, hopefully, find some clues to give the identity back to an anonymous body. "," We believe in the importance of journalism that provides solutions or gives a social service, in this case illuminating an extremely painful social problem linked to the disappearance of people.   We are convinced that our work can be an example and inspiration to create investigative journalism based on public records, to make databases, and to build interdisciplinary teams with programmers and designers to create tools that help people understand and promote the use of information.   With our story, we published our methodology: from the elaboration of the requests of information and the design of forms to systematize the heterogeneous data we received to the methodological decision we took in some complex cases. This is public here: <a href=""https://quintoelab.org/crisisforense/como-hicimos-crisis-forense/"">https://quintoelab.org/crisisforense/como-hicimos-crisis-forense/</a>, and we will translate to English soon.   We use the scrolly telling format to explain our main findings and combine the data with several stories that accompany the special ‘Crisis Forense’, so people can see that this big problem isn’t just a number problem but a crisis with faces and families fighting for justice.

Besides getting a glimpse into how the housing market forces have varied over time, readers are also able to look at key indicators like how the values of their own flats or flats in the vicinity have appreciated, thereby coming to greater understanding and appreciation of Singapore's unique approach to providing affordable housing to all. Housing is always a topic that is very close to our hearts, but few have been able to relate to the issue in an analytical manner for readers in an intriguing way. Our project provides a relatable way for our audience on how the nation’s past efforts have laid the cornerstone for where we call our heartlands today. "," Multiple datasets were downloaded from government open data sources, including the resale transaction prices and price index from 1990 to 2020, HDB property information that contains the address of existing HDB blocks, highest floor level, and lease commence date. Road network data for Singapore was downloaded from OpenStreetMap and converted to GeoJSON format.   Google API was used to collect the coordinates for each address in the dataset. Data analysis and processing were done in RStudio. This included calculating average prices by unit, floor level, and address for each year, and median floor area for each flat type by year from 1966 to 2019. Preprocessed data to be used in the visualization then were exported in CSV format.   Data visualizations were created using D3. The price search map was based on OneMap, the local map provider, and Leaflet.js. OneMap was also used for postcode search. The price timeline map was drawn with D3, using the OpenStreetMap network data to create the base layer and spatial visualizations of prices changing over time. The photo views from the house window are using panolens.js and Three.js. "," As the project seeks to encapsulate the nation’s public housing journey that spans across a good 60 years, the analysis was highly research-intensive. We wanted to build appreciation through data by connecting to people's own life experiences. This includes examples such as how the size of apartments changed or how an increasing number of high-rise buildings were constructed over time. A further important component was offering the possibility to search addresses (such as their own house) on the map and get in-depth information about it. This necessitated working with detailed time series and high volume data spanning multiple decades.   Beside the interactive components, we knew that having a compelling story is also very important. To create this, we needed to go beyond what was available as structured digital data. We spent amount of time going through reams of paper detailing our nation-building efforts, sourcing for past trends and information in the archives which may not be immediately available, and working with the authorities to retrieve certain materials, including valuable photographs taken in the olden days within HDB flats. We also spent a considerable amount of time exploring how best to segment the information into various topics of interest, to facilitate viewing and understanding. "," This project is a demonstration of how data visualization can be employed to illustrate a seemingly profound and complex issue like public housing development. We designed the introduction in a way that readers can use their own flat as a benchmark, by which to also appreciate the changes that have happened to flats located elsewhere and across the nation. This allows them to gain a fuller and deeper understanding on the issue.

China,Communication University of China,Small,Participant,Darkest Hour of Chinese Theaters in COVID-19,26/07/20,"Explainer, Long-form, Documentary, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Lifestyle, Culture, Employment","Scraping, JQuery, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap, Python, Node.js"," Our work divides into three parts. The first focuses on the struggles and plight of Chinese cinemas and their practitioners after the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. The second points out that the state's assistance policies are only a ""drop in the bucket"". The final part finds that the pandemic is not the only reason for the enormous impact on the cinema industry.   It took us three months to complete the project, based on more than 500,000 pieces of data, 200,000 words of interview script, and field visits to more than 20 cinemas around China. "," The publicity and originality of our works are strong. It reflects the real situation of movie theaters under the pandemic from the perspective of data and personal stories, and provides a more in-depth perspective that is different from mainstream reports.   Precisely because of this, our work was unanimously recognized and praised by the interviewees. Many interviewees, including movie theater staff and related scholars, forwarded our work and liked it.   Many interviewees said they were inspired. One interviewee was disappointed because the theater operated by the theater continued to lose money and did not receive effective government support. As a result, she fell into insomnia and was not understood by her family, and planned to leave the industry. After seeing our final report, she told us that because she discovered that her situation has also happened to many people, and many cinema workers like her stick to this line because of their love for the cinema, she feels very moved, and no longer intend to leave this line. After the theater resumed work, she posted a message on the social platform: Hello, spring.   Our work has won multiple awards. It won the second prize, the best visualization award, and the best creative award in the fifth China data journalism competition, the first prize in the University Data News Visualization Creative Competition, and selected for the 2020 People's Daily Online Scholarship Outstanding Financial Media Works. "," The data pipeline began with data collection, which drew on existing frameworks for web scraping with Python's  scrapy  and  splash . Web data contributed to our understanding of subject-matter in two main ways. First, we gathered data concerning the box office, location, seating capacity for over 90% of China's official cinemas. They offered an insightful glance at the impact of suspension upon the film industry, and a historical review of its development in the last decade. Secondly, we built a text dataset with more than 1 million rows based on  Weibo , China's Twitter, to extract people's opinions and sentiments regarding the nationwide closing of cinemas. This went a long way in tracking relevant emotion on social media as the pandemic deepened.     The data analysis process relied heavily on the computational power of R and Excel. The most common task was to convert unstructured web data into a cleaner form ready for further group summary and visualization, i.e., alternating between the ""long"" and ""wide data"" format. We also explored the distributional characteristics of the business conditions of theaters before the pandemic. With hierarchical clustering, we identified the income pattern that smaller theaters, to a greater extent, fell victim to the suspension. We also published code files and the data dictionary to ensure reproducibility.   For data visualization, we had a mixed usage of code-based tools and design software. We implemented all the interactive graphics in JavaScript libraries such as  plotly  and  ECharts , some of which taking advantage of R's interface to html widgets. Map layers were created with the  leaflet  package. Static plots were primarily produced with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. "," The hardest part is to figure out how to organize all the details.   When going out for interviews, we followed the instructor's advice to collect multimedia material as much as possible. After gathering all the material, however, we were in trouble facing more than 200,000 words, 590 photos, 50 video clips, and 10 audio records. How to tell a good story from those sources? Besides, due to the COVID-19, all of the team members were trapped at home, which adds difficulties to teamwork. To solve the problem, we spent more than 20 hours in online meetings, discussing the details in session and draw an online mind map together. After all the members were clear about the framework, the team was divided into three parts, responsible for writing, visualization, and data analysis respectively. It's a big challenge for mutual understanding, trust, and support. But our team managed to do it.   After careful consideration, we decided to focus on persons. Data is just a tool and an assistant to tell the feature story. The principle line is the experience of those cinema practitioners under COVID-19: What did they do? How did they feel? Would the pandemic change their career and life completely? And data draws out a bigger picture: What happened to the whole cinema industry? What's the future of it? We believe the meat and potatoes of good journalistic work are always issues concerning people. While with the broad background portrayed by data, such stories can become more vivid and attractive. The personal tragedy is embedded in history, with more social and humanistic value. In conclusion, it is an integrated journalism work creatively combining big data with the personal feature. The visualization, like the time axis and word cloud, is also aligned with this purpose. "," First of all, this project has the significance of recording the times. When Covid-19 broke out, citizens' lives and social production are greatly affected. To be specific, cinemas were all closed for the sake of epidemic prevention and national policies. As a result, not only the owner of cinemas but also cinema workers were greatly affected and barely had income during a tough time. We assume that it is the journalists' priority to record the era and show human care for ordinary people. Thus, we choose to present this project themed on cinemas during Covid-19 in form of data journalism. We maintain that it was a valuable opportunity to record this hard time and how film practitioners managed to survive. Hence, we propose that other journalists could pay more attention to a specific group or industry in a specific period in selecting topics.   Secondly, the biggest feature of our project, which we feel most proud of, is the combination of feature writing, images, sound elements, and data. In our data news project, feature writing serves as the foundation, and multimedia elements enrich the presentation form of the work. Through a large amount of data mining and quantitative analysis, we hope to convey to the audience the current situation of the movie theater and the development of the entire movie industry in the form of data news. Plus, we took into account the interactive design, hoping to create an immersive experience for news users. We hope that interactive design and large-scale data mining would be useful for other journalists while producing data news projects.

The project effectively propagandized the positive social impact brought by Jiangxi’s economic green development, deeply rooted the concept of green development,and provided a vivid success case for other provinces that want to develop green finance.The purpose is to enable all provinces to consciously and responsibly reduce resource consumption and waste emissions in the process of production and living.In this way,human production and life are going to be controlled within the tolerable range of natural resources and ecological environment. Eventually,the man-made pollution to ecological environment will be eliminated,and the expectation about the better life for the people asked by new development philosophy will come true. "," We used Magic media brain, Dycharts, Pr and several data processing platforms in the production process. The most important data video production tool is Magic Media Brain, which is an intelligent production platform that uses AI technology to help users complete short video content more efficiently. In the production of data charts, for dynamic charts we used Magic Media Brain, but for static charts we used Dycharts,which is the China’s first data and visualization service platform. It not only provides high-quality data resources, but also helps users complete the whole process from data acquisition, to data analysis and processing, to data visualization presentation and release. In animation production and picture processing, we choose Pr, namely Adobe Premiere, which is a software with better picture quality for editing.   This project is a video data news work that mines data and uses Magic Media Brain for data processing and visualization. In the early, we obtained public data resources from government platforms and other credible platforms, after filtering the data,we visualized the collected data by using data processing software such as dycharts and Pr, finally, the processed data was integrated into a visual data video through Magic Media Brain. "," The most difficult part of this project is data collection. We need to collect large-scale data from various data platforms or websites,but they don't always publish all their data or sometimes they lack some data. Therefore,we need to conduct further mining or abandon part of the data. On this basis, the data had been sorted, filtered and supplemented, and finally the data files we need had been formed, so we had invested a lot of time and energy at this stage.   In order to let the teachers experts understand our work better,we will briefly state the idea of our work. In terms of conception,our project started from green finance, and extended how Jiangxi Province had been practicing the concept of green development), and then expounded the integration of ecological environment protection and economic development.The project vividly interpreted what is “lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets”.In terms of the structure of the project, we constructed it in accordance with the idea of ""Two Increases and One Decrease"" goal improving water resources, increasing forest resources and how to saving energy and reducing emissions，and showed the contribution made by Jiangxi Province to this goal.   Nowadays, environmental issues are global problems. Through solid data collection and detailed visualization, this project strongly illustrates that green finance is able to promote the economic development of Jiangxi and achieve a “win-win” situation of environmental protection and economic development. "," 1.When we are faced with a big proposition, we choose a small perspective.In the data presentation, the connection between the data should be established, from point to surface.The connection should be reasonable and scientific, not far-fetched.   2.We take into account the many general characteristics of political proposition: seriousness, sensitive words, confidentiality principle,broad and so on.In the process of making the product, we managed to retain these elements while still maintaining a lively, visual and readable style.   3.The video images of this work are diverse, using a combination of various charts and images.   4.A very important question of making a data news is whether “topic first” or “data first”.The choice will seriously affect the display of data news.In this project,our team chose “data first” principle and tried hard to find the connection between the  data to establish their structural relations.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Participant,Data-driven stories to monitor the Government's strategy in response to the pandemic,19/05/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Open data, News application, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python, Node.js","  Given the context of a pandemic and the lack of culture of transparency in Argentina, we proposed to monitor the sanitary strategy and evaluate que quality of public data. This was a hard task since several government sources coexist with information the data of which do not agree. Multiple pieces were prepared from the analysis of said information evidencing contradictions between data and official discourse, which obliged the Government to make some changes on its strategy. The lack of tests, the precarious epidemiologic surveillance system and several problems to give real-time answers were some of the results.  ","  Based on our data analysis and journalistic productions, we included the discussion about data quality and their accessibility in the public agenda. Moreover, we created pieces every day to monitor sanitary decisions of the National Government. Thus, for example, as regards “What are the most common symptoms of the Argentinians infected?”, this story caused a concrete change in the management of pandemic: the Ministry of Health changed the definition for suspicious case and included four of the eight more frequent symptoms in order that people may access to a test and subsequent diagnose. We also noted inconsistencies between public data and official discourse, such as the differences in the test volumes in the two national jurisdictions with higher number of cases. Moreover, we found mistakes in the data provided by the epidemiologic surveillance national system: entries are deleted from the public access database and there are inconsistencies in the changes of status of the same patient. This leads to a decrease in a number of positive cases informed to citizens and to international agencies.     In addition, all these pieces activated the demand for public information and made possible a discussion about new problems that otherwise would not have happened, since information was not easily accessed by citizens.        ","  it was used Python, BigQuery, Excel and SQL for the analysis and data process. From the moment the Government began publishing the dataset with Covid cases informed, it was created a program in Python that scraps the files and stores them in a database every day. As from June 2020, we have been storing 180 files, with an average of 2.5 million entries each. Then, different queries are carried out in SQL every day to monitor certain patterns. Almost all of the analysis for the journalistic pieces presented was made under this logic.     In order to carry out a more complete monitoring of the data provided by the Government, we had to research new technologies as BigQuery, where we archived all files on the same table to determine any delay in the uploading of cases and number of entries deleted every day. There are two automatized processes: scrapping and the upload of all files on the same table and the running of queries for their subsequent visualization.     In addition, a more detailed preprocess was made for the pieces about symptoms and laboratories, since data given after access requests to public information were duplicated, wrongly structured and badly spelled. Open Refine tool was used for this process and a manual clean-up of files was carried out as well. As regards data analysis, data were structured on an Excel matrix to determine que frequency in symptom incidence and the number of laboratories that processed samples every day. Tableau Public tool was used to visualize data in all these pieces.  ","  For several months, we did not have any open format or real-time information of the pandemic, so we did more than 10 requests for information access (with a minimum delay of 20 days) to access these data, vital for the follow-up of the pandemic and the Government did not give us that access.     In all cases, we found other obstacles that delayed the process when we received the answers. Data provided had serious quality problems: unstructured data, duplicated, spelling mistakes and out-of-date data.     Consequently, at the end of all this process, the out-of-date was evident and obliged us to make a new request of access to information to publish a story with a more updated analysis.     We also had to train ourselves to acquire the necessary skills to understand and analyze health data related to the pandemic. This expertise took time, but also requires flexibility to translate the complexity that arises from national figures into relevant stories for our readers.        ","  One of the most important aspects that we learned from this project entailed going further concerning data provided by a government, that is to say, examine their quality and use them to monitor public discourses and policies that may hide political interests beyond the public needs. We are also convinced that is fundamental the demand for public information and the work with multiple sources of information; we learned that if any government refuses to give us data, there are other alternative sources where unstructured official information may be collected and reconstructed, such as social media official accounts.     Moreover, we had the cooperation and synergy of the newspaper teams with different skills, who used to work separately. For example, the Business Intelligence area together with the data journalist team working with the health area to process huge information volumes.     The advance of the pandemic and the increase of data complexity and volume defy the team skills: persons with few technical knowledge learned different technology (such as SQL) and those persons who regularly work on data analysis face new challenges to accelerate their processes to agree with demand of information flow.

With the use of intelligent textual analysis and interactive technology, the project analyzed and visualized eight Five-Year Plan documents – more than 360,000 words in total – which have been archived since 1953. "," The project guided the readers through China's development over the years in light of the five-year plans. The uniqueness of content and presentation format attracted 968 mainstream media to repost this presentation over social media, including The Associated Press, Yahoo Finance, Canadian Business Weekly, and the Associated Press of Australia, potentially reaching 240 million people across the globe. It was reposted in English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Indonesian, Russian, Korean and other 17 languages. "," In terms of narrative, the product adopts Martini's data news visualization framework, which is rare in regular news reporting but is more common in the field of data journalism. This narrative provides readers with a cover page and a linear frame that can be interrupted to trigger event response by sliding.       We used Jquery, html, css languages to compress text and combined the P5.js visual programming language library to query the keywords in the text, creating a visual line of the keywords in the text. In terms of dissemination, the work is bilingual, Chinese and English, adapted for both PC and smartphone/pad, making it efficient to share on social media. "," The most difficult part was finding the ""story"" in these complex policy texts. And we tried to tell this story from two approaches. The first was to combine decades of textual changes, including text order, word frequency, new phrases, etc., with actual changes in socioeconomic conditions to determine how the relevant five-year plan actually affected the relevant Chinese sectors. For example, we tried to find out if urban-rural income ratio actually decreased or not after the FYP called for “narrowing the social gap.”       The second challenge was how to effectively deliver a large amount of information to readers. With a lot of data from several decades, it was a daunting task to lead readers to ""travel sixty-five years"" and feel the changes without feeling too much pressure.       To solve these issues, we adopted the Martini Cup method to guide readers to a general understanding of the five-year plan, and then provided them with choices to explore at will. "," This project offers great insights into handling textual data analysis and visualization. Chinese text is not like English text – combining the same characters in different ways can express totally different meanings. Thus, it is sometimes impossible to use computer languages such as Python to analyze the Chinese text. We spent a lot of time dealing with the text by hand-picking the important phrases. The second part was how to visualize these data. So, we put all the text of each five-year plan on a page and differentiated it by using different font sizes. Meanwhile, we collected some other data to support and show how policies influence aspects of the Chinese society.

United Kingdom,"Channel 4 News, London, UK",Big,Participant,Deterring Democracy,28/09/20,"Investigation, Documentary, Database, Video, Elections, Politics",Python," ‘Deterring Democracy’ revealed the secret data strategies of Donald Trump’s Presidential campaign, and his blueprint for dividing America and taking the White House.   After years of source work, we obtained Trump’s 2016 campaign database - one of the largest ever leaks, with 5,000 SQL tables totaling 5TB of data.   In a complex project we rebuilt it, showing how thousands of data points on more than 200 million US citizens were used to segment and manipulate people.   It revealed strategies to deter millions of Black Americans from voting altogether, and splinter the country on racial lines using messages of fear.     "," The project was a global news event, which trended across Twitter and was reported widely in the UK, Europe, India, Australia and Asia. In the US, it was covered by major outlets including The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, CNN, ABC, PBS, NPR, Salon, Axios, Forbes, The Atlantic, Vanity Fair, Variety, Bloomberg, the Daily Beast and the New York Times among others.   Importantly, the story was also covered in detail by regional US outlets in battleground states  including Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Virginia, and Georgia. In Florida, we collaborated with the Miami Herald to produce a series of impactful features on battleground counties also titled ‘Deterring Democracy’.   The broadcasts galvanised multiple Black rights organisations including the NAACP and Color  of Change who had long-accused the Trump campaign of running a racist and divisive political operation, and charged Facebook with enabling it.   Channel 4 News obtained exclusive interviews with key Black politicians and figures in the US,  including the Democratic chief whip Jim Clyburn, campaigner Al Sharpton and Professor Cornel West.   The day after the “deterrence” report was broadcast, former President Barack Obama released a  video telling Black voters:  “Right now, from the White House on down, folks are working to keep people from voting, especially communities of colour. That’s because there’s a lot at stake in this election. Not just our pandemic response or racial justice, but our democracy itself.”     "," The technical infrastructure was a MySQL database large enough and powerful enough for terabytes of data to be ingested relatively quickly, and to handle multiple large-scale joins and queries. We used a bespoke process to help bulk ingestion of zipped files for speed. Security measures included encrypting the data at all points, and limitations and protections to access.   In addition to our data security measures, we had a further obligation to ensure the highest possible level of protection for our source/s. Early on, we identified technical information in the SQL files we felt may pose a risk, and decided to remove them. We designed a Python program that would perform these tasks and produce a short clear log so any member of the team could check it had succeeded for each file.   For analysis, two members of our Investigations learned SQL, to allow a full range of tasks including multiple table joins and complex querying. Multiple joins across tables were especially important in examining data techniques used by the campaign.   We found some statistical analysis was better performed using Python Pandas on exported CSVs. One of the team learned Pandas to perform large-scale counts and analysis. Combining SQL table joins with automated Pandas processes enabled us to quickly produce numerical analysis for geographies across the United States, or for example, for all precincts in battleground states.   A final step in our analysis was to try to evaluate the result of the campaign’s strategy in key areas. To do this we obtained state voter records and voting history, and joined these to the campaign data. This allowed us to evaluate, for example, how many citizens that were marked for a ‘deterrence’ operation actually turned out to vote in the 2016 election - in some cases very small numbers.     "," The scale of the data involved in this project was beyond anything we’d dealt with before. It required a huge amount of research and upskilling to understand how best to handle it. The quantity of files, and large file sizes, necessitated planning ahead to prepare files for ingestion or analysis, and produced large volumes of outputs that needed to be examined. It meant a mountain of work, all during the heat and hard deadline of the 2020 US election.   A considerable further challenge came in the vital need to understand the people at the end of the Trump campaign’s ‘data points’, to marry our analysis with the stories of the people involved.   Our first film examined the campaign’s ‘deterrence’ operation that saw predominantly Black urban areas targeted most heavily. We needed to approach residents of these communities with copies of their personal data. This was data they didn’t know existed, and didn’t know how we had obtained it. We also needed to ask them about the potential they had been manipulated, and if their voting decision in 2016 was fully their own. In neighbourhoods of Milwaukee people told of their suspicion and distrust of the media. Many people also felt under fire for low turnouts in 2016, and that they were being ‘blamed’ for Trump’s victory. As a result, our teams faced some understandable hostility.   In all, despite the pressures of the election and covid travel restrictions, we put three teams on the ground across the US. All spent weeks gaining the trust and cooperation of our contributors. This process required huge sensitivity and perseverance, from experienced and talented journalists, and finally allowed us to join up our data analysis with the stories of the people involved.     "," Serious concerns have emerged around a growing industry using big data, opaque algorithms and social media manipulation as a key tool in fighting political campaigns around the world.   We began to examine this subject in a previous investigation into UK-based political data firm Cambridge Analytica in 2017 and 2018, that resulted in a series of films including a lengthy undercover operation that won a Bafta, Emmy and Peabody.   In the field of political journalism, which is dominated by access to key figures and off-the-record sources, this project demonstrated an essential point: to hold power to account, reporters must be empowered to scrutinise big data.   Big data increasingly governs the lives of individuals, and algorithms determine how decisions are made. When used alongside social media its power is enormous, and can govern the direction of nations with huge consequences for many millions of people.   We believe the obtaining of the Trump campaign database is the first time the techniques of a modern data campaign have been fully exposed in this way. It uncovered material that answered questions as to how the campaign sought to manipulate the electorate - and exposed a blueprint for a divided America that still has serious ramifications today.   But it poses more questions. It’s vital for journalists to be able to interrogate the consequences of this on people’s lives and we hope our investigation contributes to the knowledge journalists, campaigners and the public have in this area, to protect the public interest.     ",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIf5ELaOjOk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5gDbPFMCDk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Swqc2NjEXM,,,,,,"Job Rabkin, Guy Basnett, Ed Howker, Heidi Pett, Krishnan Guru-Murthy, Lindsey Hilsum, Ayshah Tull, Matt Frei, Siobhan Kennedy, Michael French, Anne-Marie Fugelsang, Sola Renner, Dani Isdale, Milicent Teasdale, Josh Ho, Dickon Mager, James Betteridge"," The Channel 4 News Investigations Team is part of Channel 4 News, a nightly news programme on the Channel 4 network in the UK.

Mexico,NoSinNosotras.com,Small,Participant,Don't you dare say #NobodyLess: #TheHardData,14/02/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Open data, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Politics, Corruption, Women, Gun violence, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel"," In a country where 51% of the population thinks that a FEMINICIDE is “when a woman hurts herself”, “when two women love each other” or “when a woman dominates the man”, it is necessary to generate pedagogy when it comes to violence of gender.   After all, there’s still the belief that ""violence"" is a faceless entity, but, when we submit it to a statistical review, we manage to find that 84.25% of homicides, 77.57% of robberies, 92.84% of rapes, and 78.57% of ALL crimes are committed by males.   So this stops being an insecurity problem to be a men problem. "," After the brutal femicide of Ingrid Escamilla, who was killed and flayed by her partner on January 9 of 2020, the voices that urged to decree a #GenderAlert throughout the country and social protocols to deal with sexist violence in schools and businesses gained strength.   However, many men perceived themselves as being “excluded” from the victims, pointing out that “crime” also affects male citizens.   By putting in perspective the 7 causes for classifying the murder of a woman as femicide, we found that there are clear differences that allow us to demystify the figure of the ""monster the devil got into"".   For example: 1 out of every 2 assaults against women in the country are committed by ordinary men; 1 in 2 ordinary men physically, emotionally, or sexually hurt their stable partner; and 1 in 2 murders of women occurs inside a home by ordinary men.   Likewise, a review of the crime indicators of the 32 states of the Mexican Republic allowed us to detect a full opacity in the typification of the cases by government authorities since there are cases of murder against woman, there are cases of injuries against women, there are cases of kidnapping against woman, and there are cases of harassment against women, but the classification of femicides doesn't exist.   As a result, the research obtained a scope of 622,960 impacts (measurable and verifiable), helping to generate pedagogy among the population that is requesting “mancides” to be analyzed as a crime.   Additionally, we provided the community with the most current number at that time: Mexican men kill 19 women every day (not just 10), beat 155 (not just 85), 21 disappear (not just 5), and rape 86 ( not just 20). ) before the sun goes down. "," The most complex part of these investigations was to analyze the 148 crimes contemplated by the National Census of State Justice Procurement, with victims and perpetrators, for 32 states of the Republic and full national compilation, generating a total of 9,768 variables.   Taking into consideration this volume of data, I generated an Excel formula that allows us to automate the exact disaggregation of men and women who are accused of crimes in the Mexican Republic, their degree of kinship with the person attacked, and the numerical proportion on territories with the highest crime incidence (per crime).   Once I automated these figures, it was quite easy to apply the principles of UN Women, Oxfam International, and CIMAC Press to build narratives with a gender perspective, modeling the indicators under a simple but powerful reading that directly impacts the language:   Because it is not the same to say that ""33,981 women are sexually abused every year (as if they were asking for it)"" to express that ""31,558 MEN are raping young girls and women in a yearly-basis"".   Subsequently, I modelized the data with a non-sexist perspective using Adobe InDesign for distribution on social media, allowing me to generate master degree research’s in less than a week after the story exploded on the agenda-setting, maintaining novelty, temporality, and validity among digital communities to the extent that some of this data was used in iconoclasm and local protests all around the country. "," In the mexican journalistic communication messages, a lot of media companies still construct the idea of sexual aggressors, assailants, and murderers as ""people of unknown identity in ski masks, sheltered by the darkness of a slum and waiting on an alley"", so that’s how they are still conceived by 73% of the population.   However, once we verified the National Survey on the Dynamics of Household Relationships and the data from the National Census of State Justice Procurement, we were able to identify who assaults women in spaces such as the home, the school, the office, helping to disaggregate the following conclusión with our Excel Formula:   The males are killed in the street and their enemies are killed with a firearm; the females have killed in their homes and their acquaintances, with blows.   Subsequently, applying this Formula to the 32 states of the Republic, with crossed data of the population proportion, was a challenge that demanded great patience, but which now allows us to end the myth that ""few murders are equivalent to a minor problem"" ( If 10 people live in your state and 5 are murdered, is even worse than 20 people killed in a 100 hundred citizen territory).   Unfortunately, and as obvious as it may seem, many mexican state governors still use this resource to cushion the evils, so it was required to create a dynamic table in just a week to present this information in an understandable and graphic manner that would allow the problem to be dimensioned before the murder of Ingrid Escamilla was shelved. "," If the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to do something, it is to learn new skills and abilities to “do more with less” in record time.   It is not necessary to have large newsrooms, budget increases, state-of-the-art technology, predictive tools, neural networks, and machine-learning protocols to tell stories that captivate our audiences, encouraging them to make the immediate transition to an increasingly just, empathetic, and informed world.   Very humbly, I allow myself to invite all of our invaluable information professionals to dare to “make things happen” and, from the powerful platform that social media provide us, launch in-depth investigations in real-time that will serve the public that really needs us: common men and women who are truth-thirsty in a country that ranks second in the world of #FakeNews distribution.   If a team of only one person can do it from a living room apartment, zero budget, and one-week deadlines with half a million impacts, I am sure that my colleagues, with much more preparation than myself, will be able to generate even more robust results.   Let's make it digital, let's make it simple, let’s make it quick, and, most importantly, let's make it useful.

United Kingdom,"BBC Birmingham, Coventry University",Big,Participant,Dying for a Burger?,24/02/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Documentary, Chart, Video, Environment, Lifestyle, Business, Health, Economy, Employment","Animation, Microsoft Excel"," Exhaust fumes are a massive contributor to air pollution. It’s therefore hard to believe that despite the huge number of drive through restaurants across the UK, the level of exhaust pollutants next to the serving hatches and the potential impact on the health and well-being of restaurant employees serving from them has never been fully measured and assessed…until now!   This investigation set out to show how drive thru workers are being exposed to peaks in major air pollutants well in excess of legal limits using data gathered, scrutinised and presented as part of an 18 month long project. "," This report was developed by the BBC in conjunction with Coventry University to gather data in an area as yet unexplored - the impact of pollution on drive thru workers,   The findings, presented both in the form of an academic study and as a broadcast report, were transmitted by the BBC across England using datasets gathered at 10 locations to provide a region by region snaphot of issues related to drive thru outlets in those localities reaching a linear audience of around 3 million people across a broad demographic on BBC1.   More significantly it led to MPs tabling an early day motion in parliament calling for better understanding of the potential threat of pollution to drive thru workers on the basis of the data gathered, calls by trade unions for better worker protection across the drive thru sector and a commitment from at least one of the operators featured to reassess its working practices in light of the findings.   The subject matter was also picked up by other media outlets both within and outside the BBC and has gone on to promote further discussion both within academic circles and across the commercial world.  "," This was a labour intensive project requiring the use of commercial air monitoring equipment mounted on two vehicles which were parked adjacent to the serving hatches of drive thru restaurants and left in situ for two week periods at a time.   The data was gathered using AQMesh commercial monitors which use a small sensor to measure outdoor air quality, offering real-time localised air quality information and data analysis via a cloud based server.   In order to facilitate data gathering without a power feed for two weeks in each location, these had to be custom designed with an internal rechargable battery to provide sufficient power to take an air sample every 15 minutes 24 hours a day across a two week period.    As the information was fed back to a remote server, the data could be looked at in almost real time allowing patterns to be identified early on. "," This was a logistically difficult and time consuming exercise taking 18 months to complete and without the co-operation of any of the big drive thru operators we approached.   On that basis it had to be completed under their radar without raising suspicions while still gaining access to their premises.   To facilitate this, we custom rigged two vans with the air monitors described in the previous section. The intention was to place each van next to a drive thru window at one of ten drive thru locations across the country for two weeks at a time. This was particularly challenging because each location had to fulfil particular criteria, both from a data gathering and practical perspective.   The locations needed to have parking spaces which backed directly onto the drive through windows so that the air monitoring equipment was at exactly the same height and distance from the customers exhaust fumes as the worker at the serving hatch. This instantly ruled out a large number of locations and we had some difficulty finding suitable sites across the country.   From a practical perspective, we also had to find locations where the car park was not controlled by a private parking company which would either ticket or tow away our vans when left for long periods given that we were operating without the express permission of the drive thru company in question. This is turn ruled out a large number of additional sites. Nevertheless perseverence paid off and we managed to find locations with similar layouts which enabled us to gather data at multiple sites which could be compared.. "," This was a project that took a huge amount of commitment, determination and resolve to deliver, using limited resources to expose an apparent problem at some of the largest drive thru restaurant chains in the world.     What it shows is that anything is possible with the right attitude and by building effective collaborative relationships.   As we knew our data gathering methods and conclusions would likely be challenged by the big drive thru operators - which is precisely what happened - it was important that we worked with an academic partner to ensure that our findings would stand up to peer review.   Coventry University not only agreed to work with us but helped to fund the air monitoring equipment we'd need to use over an extended period of time.   This is just the latest in a long line of collaborations between BBC Birmingham and Coventry University showcasing the value of such partnerships in the field of data journalism.          ",https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljk8m6hg05imndb/DRIVE%20THRU%20FOR%20GOMW.mov?dl=0,https://edm.parliament.uk/early-day-motion/55695/exposure-of-workers-in-drivethrough-restaurants-to-air-pollution,https://www.coventry.ac.uk/news/2020/coventry-university-research-reveals-high-levels-of-air-pollution-which-could-harm-health-of-drive-thru-staff-and-customers/,https://airqualitynews.com/2020/10/19/drive-throughs-are-hotspots-for-air-pollution/,https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/air-pollution-mcdonalds-kfc-costa-17804352,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birmingham-drive-thru-mcdonalds-fails-17801560,https://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/costa-taunton-air-pollution-high-3883386,,"Jonathan Gibson - Reporter/Producer BBC Birmingham, Assistant Professor Dr Anitha Chinnaswamy - Coventry University"," Jonathan Gibson is a multiple award winning investigative journalist who specialises in covert filming.  Based at BBC Birmingham he develops, produces and presents investigations for the BBC across all platforms regionally, nationally and internationally.        Dr Anitha Chinnaswamy is an Assistant Professor at the Business School in Coventry University and a Research Associate with the Centre for Business in Society (CBiS).

United States,Reuters,Big,Participant,Dying Inside,16/10/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Politics, Women, Health, Crime, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL","  In a first-of-its-kind investigation built on 1,500 public records requests, Reuters documented more than 7,500 inmate deaths from 2008-2019 at more than 500 local jails – every major jail in the U.S. and the 10 largest in each state. Two-thirds of those who died were awaiting trial and presumed innocent. Mortality rates were higher in jails that privatized the management of their medical services using big correctional healthcare contractors. Deaths of women inmates, trapped in male-oriented detention systems, soared to record highs. Thousands perished from preventable causes. Black inmates died in disproportionate numbers.  ","  Congressional leaders and state legislators proposed several reforms to address the revelations of  Dying Inside . Our database also was used by local journalists, watchdog groups and civil rights advocates to identify local jails with high inmate death rates and highlight those problems in news reports and independent studies.     In West Virginia and Georgia, Reuters’ data spurred state legislators to draft bills setting new standards for jail oversight. In Mississippi, after Reuters published previously unreported surveillance video and details on the 2018 death of Harvey Hill, a state legislator and veteran Congressman pushed for criminal charges against the jail guards who beat him. “It's just disheartening to see this happen to another African American male,” said Mississippi lawmaker Chris Bell. The Justice Department is now investigating the death and a decision on whether to issue indictments is expected this year.             In Washington, congressional leaders pushed the U.S. Justice Department to strengthen its tracking of jail deaths. Reuters’ reporting “underscores the need to overhaul our pretrial detention practices,” said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler. Senator Richard Blumenthal said Congress should consider restricting DOJ funding if it fails to address systemic reporting problems.      NaphCare Inc, a correctional healthcare company cited in the Reuters investigation, vowed to take “corrective initiatives” to reduce death rates at jails under its care after reading our report.      “The increase in deaths in custody reflected in (Reuters’) statistics - in particular of people of African descent, of women and of people in pretrial detention - is especially alarming, not least because many of these deaths are preventable,” the United Nations’ Human Rights Office said in a statement, urging jails to “reduce over-reliance on pre-trial detention.”     Follow-up stories listed at the bottom of the main project page captured some of this impact:  <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-jails/""> https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-jails/ </a> ","  Our records’ requests yielded thousands of pages of documents and more than 150,000 data points that had to be keyed in and analyzed. We broke the data into two sets:      * A “jails” database capturing annual data on inmate populations, mortality and healthcare for each of 500-plus jails in our sample. The data, spanning 2008-2019, included yearly headcounts, deaths by type (suicide; homicide; medical/natural; drugs/alcohol; accident; other), and details on any healthcare contractors employed in each year.     * A “deaths” database with details on all of the more than 7,500 deaths we documented. For each death, we captured, when available, the inmate’s name, age, race, gender, date of death, cause of death, length of incarceration and custody status (convicted vs. awaiting trial).     We built both databases in Google Sheets, and we used folders in Google Docs to organize text records for each jail, such as investigation documents, autopsy reports and correspondence. The videos we collected also were archived in Google Docs.      We did our own data analysis, primarily using PostgreSQL and Microsoft Excel. We consulted with independent experts to validate some of our statistical models, which we designed in R-Studio. For example, in comparing death rates at jails with privatized healthcare to those with publicly managed medical services, we developed a statistical model that controlled for the size of the jail population, the size of the county, the county mortality rates and the year. We published sidebars explaining our methodology and naming any experts who reviewed our work.     We also open-sourced our data for journalists, policymakers and other stakeholders, providing downloadable ZIP files containing the “jails” dataset, the “deaths” dataset and record layouts, both nationally and by state. Additionally, we offered easily shareable PDFs with summary data on deaths by jail and state.  ","  Our series is the most in-depth exploration ever published of U.S. jail deaths and the 1,500 records requests behind the reporting posed extraordinary challenges. We focused on 523 jails and sent three rounds of requests over 18 months, each gathering new details. Achieving the project’s nearly 100% response rate required persistence and, at times, pressure of litigation.     To determine our universe of jails, we used the U.S. Justice Department’s Census of Local Jails to identify all facilities with average populations of at least 750 inmates, as well as the 10 largest jails in each state. Then we reviewed every jail’s records policies and wrote tailored requests for each.     Many jails were reluctant to provide the information we requested – records on all inmate fatalities over a 12-year span, including the circumstances of each death and other details. We often had to contact jails repeatedly, cajoling officials for months to gain cooperation.     We ultimately collected more than 150,000 data points; each had to be manually entered, confirmed and fact checked.     As our data came together, we identified specific jails as case studies to illustrate various problems and trends. This required interviews at multiple jails and reviews of lawsuits, official audits and local news coverage.     We reported at more than a dozen locations. To uncover the story of neglect and death in a Savannah jail, three reporters spent six weeks in the city developing sources to corroborate assertions from legal filings and other documents. In Mississippi, we obtained previously unreported jail video and investigation reports to reveal how guards fatally beat Harvey Hill, held for trespassing. We made multiple trips to Georgia’s Cobb County to report the story of Chinedu Efoagui, who died after 512 days behind bars, unconvicted, in a traffic case.  ","  Until now, reporters have never been able to identify the nation’s deadliest jails or compare mortality rates across facilities. The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics has collected data on every death in U.S. jails for more than 20 years, but under an obscure statutory restriction, jail-by-jail mortality data has never been released – not to the public, not to policy makers, not even to Justice Department lawyers who are supposed to take legal action against jails with unconstitutional conditions.      We have replicated the government’s restricted data for more than 500 of the nation’s largest jails and made it available to other journalists. This marks the first time reporters have had access to this sort of data so they can readily examine and compare mortality and health care at their local jails. Those jails, typically run by local sheriffs or police departments, often are among the least transparent components of the U.S. criminal justice system, facing a fraction of the accountability required of state and federal prisons.     In addition to making our data available to other news organizations, we have provided a roadmap for how to conduct these investigations.

Singapore,zaobao.sg,Big,Participant,Dynamic tracking of COVID-19 in Singapore,10/02/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Open data, News application, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Personalisation, D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","     In early February 2020, we built this interactive website to inform and communicate with local audiences about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore based on the daily reports released by the Ministry of Health. As the situation evolved, we kept updating the data every day until June 2nd. With the substantial details of the new cases, we created communicative data visualizations in different stages of the epidemic situation and with scales of data to help better picture the relationship between cases within a cluster, how these clusters are inter-related and activities-based, and how cases are disseminated to various hospitals. "," This website is the most popular interactive news and data visualization story in Zaobao's interactive news section, as reflected by the number of views in <a href=""https://interactive.zaobao.com/2020/novel-coronavirus-cases-in-singapore-v1/case-study/"">Google Analytics</a>, fetching a total Page View of 892,278. Compared with daily breaking news or news archives, the accumulated data allows us to present more comprehensive insights on both temporal (i.e. the trend) and spatial dimensions (i.e. the cluster tracking on the map). Digital interactive format provides a more engaging and exploratory experience for audiences, as the audience can use filters and search to navigate the site according to their own interests. It also served as an additional tool for journalists to study and explore potential news angles. "," The case data were from daily situation reports released by the Ministry of Health in PDFs. We manually record the information into multiple spreadsheets, including the key dates, age, gender, nationality, visited clinics and hospitals, related cases or/and belonging cluster, and reported news from our newsroom for individual cases, identified clusters, and the count of death and discharge cases. We also maintained a list of important measures announced by the government, such as border closures, travel restrictions, and lockdown measures. We visualized the close contact tracking and the testing situation in the beginning until the data was no longer available.   Part of data processing was done in RStudio in the late period. This included generating reused attributes across the spreadsheets and some Chinese translations.   Data visualizations were created using D3. The cluster map was based on OneMap, the local map provider, and Leaflet.js. "," Besides the data collection and translation, we have to adjust the content and visualizations to meet the audience's points of interest that were changing over time due to the unexpected COVID situation. Eventually, we built multiple customized data visualizations to provide an engaging and exploratory experience for the audience.   For example, in the initial stage, daily new cases remained largely in the tens. Instead of the overview trend typically represented by a line chart, local audiences were more interested in the details of each case. We managed to create a journey visualization to show the key dates such as confirmed date, quarantine date, and the audience can click to expand the journey and read more information such as the dates of visits to clinics, and related news.   As the number of discharged cases increased, the audience became more interested in the length and place of hospital stays. We built a two-sided bar chart to visualize for each case the number of days between the onset of symptoms and being confirmed and the length of subsequent stay in hospital. It also allows the audience to sort by case id or the number of days, group by the hospital, gender, country of origin, or age group, and filter by a particular cluster or group. This visualization intends to facilitate answering questions like whether cases of a certain age group are more vulnerable, and whether some hospitals can handle better, etc.   However, with the number of new cases crossing 500 per day, the government stopped giving details of cases. We then implemented a new visualization for summarizing the median length of known cases, and a cluster tracking map to highlight the newly discovered clusters and the geographical distribution of the clusters by plotting clusters as tiny dots on the local map. "," The Singapore government was among the few globally that released substantial details of the new cases. This provided us with an opportunity to explore communicative visualizations in different stages of the epidemic situation and with scales of data.   This also highlights the need for customized visualizations in journalism and underlines the importance for the newsrooms to adapt accordingly.   This project exposes both data literacy and visualization literacy issues. In terms of data literacy, the audience might fail to know that the answer they are looking for can be answered by playing with filters. We found that the audience differs in their capacity for navigating and understanding the visualization. For instance, they might fail or are reluctant to read a visualization that is not a bar chart or line chart; they might get used to thinking a visualization is always static as print and fail to hover or click. These issues not only require design considerations, but also data visualization education for journalists who produce the content.

Portugal,ComUM,Small,Participant,Economy do (not) move without people - Economia (não) mexe com ruas vazias,19/06/20,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Video, Politics, Business, Health, Economy, Employment","Personalisation, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," The report ""Economia (não) mexe de ruas vazias"" was made by three students in their final months of the degree during the lockdown. The project wanted to explore the impact of Covid-19 on the Portuguese economy. In the report, we interviewed small business owners and tried to see how the restrictions imposed by the government affected them. We also analyzed the public data and data provided by organizations and compared it to other years (after Covid-19) and produced a mini newsapp to estimate how much income a restaurant would not cash in during Portuguse's quarantine.  "," Portugal was one of the countries that were getting out of the last economic recession. The job market started to open and young people were excited, but then a pandemic started. Our country had several restrictions in the first lockdown so we tried to explain how much impact everything would have on the Portuguese economy.   The report tells the story of six small business in different areas: catering, local tourism, advertising, door seller, hairdresser and beautician.  All of them had to change their lives during the pandemic. During the project, we see the positive and the negative impact on their business. People who read it could see how much a restaurant was suffering and how a door seller made of the pandemic their best friend through social media.The report was made for everyone - even though there were specialist terms, we clarified what they meant and mainly used simple language   This report was all made from home (because of the pandemic), so it also proved to the world of journalism (and students) how we can innovate by using inphografics, charts and interactive apps in media. The work was one of the finalists in the Portuguese's Awards of Cyber journalism in the student category.    .  "," The project was designed by me, a journalism student, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I used the bootstrap library. The videos were edited in Adobe Premiere, excluding the video ""diferentes tipos de empresas"" that was made through Aftereffects. Our static inphogafries were made in Illustrator.    Our charts were all interactive, so people could adapt what they see. For the charts I used chart.js. People could choose the data and download the one that we used. We also had an interactive chronology using Timeline JS.   The mini news app was the most challenging part of our work. The base code was part of a maths problem about cookies and how many calories one person had eaten. With that code, I added more variables and customized the function to suit our work and theme. This part was essential in the project  - first of all, it helped illustrate the story of a family who had a restaurant and, with the lockdown, was having trouble paying bills. Second of all, any reader could estimate how much a restaurant had lost during this pandemic. "," This was an academic project, developed during the last semester it started in January and it was supposed to end in May, but in March our country had a very strict lockdown-students couldn't leave their home so we had to change our topic. It was challenging to adapt to the circumstances and remake our previous work.   We didn't have any course unit that taught us how to code or how to analyze data, everything was developed without additional support from professors and colleagues  During the process, the website that was used in the previous years shut down, so we didn’t have any customized website that was suitable, therefore I started developing everything that you can see on our page.    The most challenging difficulty was using Javascript because it was very difficult no learn in such a short time. In the end, by using open code, everything was made on time.    As we were in lockdown, I tried to replace the photojournalism part of the project with the charts and the news app - this kept readers captivated and interested, as they could personalize the data,  in reading such a long project. "," Lockdown was a very strange time for journalists, especially regarding big projects. In this report, you can see how you can add more details to your story by using an interactive news app. It is a project made without any money and any experienced coder. It shows how interactive journalism has many paths to investigate, even for journalism students.    The main lesson people can take from this project is that With code that already existed, a lot of things can be done, I hope this project made my teachers reflect on how much anyone who worked with online journalism could take advantage of knowing the basics of coding. Perhaps this will help change how journalism is taught in Portugal, so the newsrooms can change with a new generation.

Brazil,Revista AzMina,Small,Participant,Elas no Congresso,15/06/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, Chart, Elections, Politics, Women, Human rights","Google Sheets, CSV, R, Python"," Elas no Congresso is a legislative monitoring project that uses public data from the Brazilian legislature to monitor women's rights in the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. With a robot on Twitter, which daily tweets the processing of bills on women's rights, a ranking that illustrates the position of deputies and senators in relation to this topic, content and disseminated through special reports and a weekly newsletter, Elas no Congresso make monitoring the Brazilian legislative production on topics such as violence against women, sexual and reproductive rights, politics and several others more transparent and didactic. "," In just six months of projects, Elas no Congresso have already revealed important narratives about women's rights in the legislature. We have shown, for example, that 1 in 4 projects on women's rights in Congress is unfavorable for women. Our ranking and reports were published in Uol, Época, Yahoo, Marie Claire, Rádio Câmara and others. The open source of our robot inspired the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism to monitor bills on freedom of expression and the press. In our newsletter, we reveal the backstage of a disinformation campaign initiated by the Bolsonarista bench for the Chamber to stop the passage of bills that combat violence against women in the pandemic.   Among the 594 ranked parliamentarians, there were reactions of very discomfort among those who were among the worst placed and celebration among the best placed. We have also heard reports from parliamentarians who promised to improve projects that were considered unfavorable by organizations that analyzed the bills to create the ranking. We interviewed 23 parliamentarians in December 2020, among deputies and senators, and, on a scale of 1 to 5, 75% of those who answered how much Elas no Congresso impact their parliamentary performance rated 4 or 5: that is, a great impact.   Elas no Congresso also won the Innovation category of the Claudio Weber Abramo Award for Data Journalism 2020, and was one of ten nominated in the same category for the Gabriel García Márquez Journalism Award 2020. "," We mainly use Python to build our robot on Twitter and to analyze data that originates the ranking and reports.   AzMina selected a broad list of keywords often related to women's rights. These are terms that range from domestic violence, maternity leave and abortion to adjacent themes such as childbirth, child custody and breastfeeding. The robot then does a daily search of the Chamber and Senate APIs to find projects of interest, which have these keywords on their menu, and which had their processing changed on the last day. Finally, she publishes on the Twitter account, using the social network API, the details of this proposition: the legislative house where she is located, the type and number of the article, the author, the main theme, the current status of processing and also the link to the project text. The robot's code is open and has ample potential to be reproduced with the use of keywords from other important themes for Brazilian democracy.   The ranking was developed with statistical advice based on certain criteria and their weights. The modeling and tests were done in R. This ranking has been transformed into a visualization and allows institutions and companies to map stakeholders for their advocacy strategies, and for voters to know the performance of those they elected. The website has a responsive design, automatically adjusting depending on the device on which it is being displayed, ensuring that it is the content viewed on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer. The site is also user friendly, with a user-focused (UX) experience design. "," Elas no Congresso is the first legislative, public and free monitoring project, specializing in women's rights in the country. AzMina joined the project with its expertise in technology, journalism, and advocacy and mobilization, an unprecedented initiative in the country at a time when women's rights have been victims of daily attacks by the federal government and Congress. Today, Elas no Congresso have articulation with feminist organizations, which help in the evaluation of bills and also receive and use our monitoring to organize their advocacy strategies, with parliamentarians who are evaluated, interviewed and share their agendas and proposals with us, with the the press that uses this data to cover gender, and with civil society that mobilizes to draw the attention of parliamentarians responsible for the progress and setbacks monitored by the project. All of this despite the immense difficulties that the pandemic has imposed on the team. "," For the media ecosystem, the project reduces the difficulty for reporters and editors to keep track of complicated and, in most cases, not as transparent processes as the bills move forward in regional legislative bodies. Our project facilitates coverage of women's rights in local and national vehicles.   Furthermore, today, large companies have money, structures, tools and human resources dedicated to monitoring and managing their interests in Congress. But most civil society and press organizations have not yet fully mastered these methods. Elas no Congresso is a project of open code and methodology that allows replicability for monitoring any sector, a very important tool for the press that needs to spend financial and human resources to cover the legislative production of Congress on different fronts. Our robot inspired the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism to monitor bills on freedom of expression and the press, for example.    The lack of monitoring of political action undermines public debate on themes and projects that have the potential to impact the lives of half of the Brazilian population, in addition to undermining support for or opposition to these projects.

Team members Disha Shetty and Tish Sanghera then went on the ground to investigate projects, their impact on indigenous communities, and on the environment, to demonstrate the human and ecological cost of India's development.  "," We were able to track some of the impact of the projects:   1) Prominent journalist, opposition party leaders and policy makers took note of our reporting and responded on social media with praise.    2) Media influencers in India used the project in their youtube videos to talk about how Indian government was handling the environment   3) An international project (EJAtlas) that maps environmental conflicts around the world incorporated our data in their project   4) Officials running a conservation project under the Indian government reached out to seek data that we had mapped   5) Another publication (Article - 14) republished the story   6) Our stories were quoted by other journalists writing on the issue of environment   7) Other journalists in India and a Latin American country (Ecuador) used the series in their talks   8) Team members Tish Sanghera and Disha Shetty were invited to webinars to talk about the project.    9) Local movements to save biodiversity hotspots used our project and data from there to make the case to protect environment. "," We used data journalism, coding to visualize the data as well as ground reporting. We also took pictures and created videos for social media. Our series was a multi-media project. We also generously used maps, graphs and other illustrations wherever necessarily in the stories. All the data was contextualized using ground reporting and telling the human stories. We were also able to find inconsistencies in the data when we went out reporting.    We also wrote grant proposal and raised money through the Pulitzer Center to be able to tell this story and make this project possible. This project was a collaboration between journalists (Tish Sanghera and Disha Shetty) and an engineer (Pankhuri Kumar), who took care of the visualization as well as the newsroom of IndiaSpend.  "," The data we needed was not available in a downloadable format.

In that sense we were able to investigate what we set out to.     We also had to keep negotiating for extra time with our editors as the project kept widening in scope.  "," What other journalists can learn from this project is that data journalism is incomplete without ground reporting. The data is the starting point, it can point to broad trends, but it is the ground reporting that highlights the gaps. It when you meet the people that the data refers to on the ground when the context emerges.

"," We worked with the programming language R to scrape the data from different sources, sometimes in a not friendly format as PDF. We used this language also to normalize the data as fast as we could to publish the graphic in a little time. To visualize the data, we worked with a tool developed by the engineering team of Europa Press based in D3.js. And finally, to distribute the dataset, we used the own distribution platform of Europa Press. ", Probably the hardest part was to keep updating the graphics every day with a small team of three journalists working on the project at part time and dealing with the lack of data in the firsts moments of the pandemic and the inconsistencies in the info coming from official sources.

This resulted in a 12% decline in domestic production in three years; from 9.3 million tonnes in 2016 to 8.1 million tonnes in 2019.   We used an innovative design for the investigation that contained a very large amount of data, numbers and statistics. The investigation revealed the misfortune and deterioration of the wheat imported by the Egyptian government "," A briefing request was submitted in the Egyptian Parliament, and several discussions took place between researchers and analysts about the necessity to change and amend the Egyptian standard for importing wheat. It had a great resonance among journalists in the Arab world, which called on the channel Deutsche Welle to re-publish the investigation through its channel. https://ms-my.facebook.com/dw.sulta5/videos/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86/604041203772001/   A large number of citizens wrote to us after the investigation was published on social media, Facebook and Twitter.

Kenya,"Lighthouse Reports, Bellingcat, Der Spiegel ""Report Mainz"" (a program on ARD, the German public broadcaster), TV Asahi",Big,Participant,EU Border Agency Frontex Complicit in Greek Refugee Pushback Campaign,23/10/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, OSINT, Map, Immigration, Crime","Sensor, R, RStudio, Python"," Greek border guards have been forcing large numbers of refugees back to a dangerous sea in 'pushback' operations that violate international law. We proved that a European Union border agency, Frontex, was complicit in the controversial practice. Until then Frontex had denied any knowledge of pushbacks. "," The investigation led to the following.   - Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri was grilled during a hearing in front of the EU Parliament’s LIBE committee. EU Parliamentarians then launched a formal probe into the allegation (which is ongoing).   - The EU Obudsman launched its own investigation into the allegations (ongoing).   -  The EU's Home Affairs Commissioner and the President of the Commission called on Frontex to conducte extraordinary management board meetings to address the allegations.   - Frontex then pledged to reform and bolster its rights monitoring mechanisms and to investigate all incidents. The agency launched major inquiries and created a special Working Group to explore the legality of its operations to date.   - The Greek government, which had previously flatly denied any wrongdoing despite a pile of evidence, has also pledged a thorough investigation.   - The findings of the investigation were picked up by media world-wide and some outlets (from the BBC to the New York Times) conducted their own investigations in ways that amplified the impact and enriched the original story.   - The story also helped raise the awareness among EU citizens of the continuing violations of the human rights of asylum seekers and refugees, while bolstering demands for transparency and accountability at Frontex. "," We combined various methods of data collection including interviews with migrants and the tracking data of boats and aircrafts (respectively called AIS and ADSB). We sought to find out whether the aircrafts and boats of Frontex were present when migrants were pushed back. We proved this in a number of cases and, in one case, we were even able to show that a Frontex boat directly blocked the path of a migrant's dinghy to stop it.   We first collected a list of all the Frontex assets used in the Agegan using mostly open-source data (web searches, social media photo and videos etc). We then obtained AIS data that provides the GPS location of boats (purchased from www.vesselfinder.com) and ADSB data that provides the location of aircrafts (obtained from http://adsbexchange.com). We also obtained the location of pushbacks from several NGOs as well as in interviews with migrants and the metadata of any images and videos they took during their crossing of the Aegean. We plotted all these datasets on several maps, and found the cases where Frontex assets were near pushbacks (this was done with R and Python).   Then, we enriched these findings by analysing videos and photos obtained from migrants in order to understand the details of what had happened in each pushback incidents.    You can read our methodology in more details here, with an emphasis on the visual video analysis: https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/10/23/frontex-at-fault-european-border-force-complicit-in-illegal-pushbacks "," One of the most difficult aspects of the project was to track down all of the assets owned by Frontex in order to get their tracking data. This was a herculean task which required going through hundreds of Instagram posts, such as those of dining at a restaurant facing the port where some of the Frontex vessels were moored, going through Facebook profiles of staff, etc.   The next hurdle was to obtain the tracking data for the boats and planes, searching for it on various websites and understanding its limitations. The tracking data is generated by most aircrafts and boats in order to avoid crashing into each other. There are many providers of this type of data, each with its own limitations that required a deep technical understanding to apprehend.   We also had to figure out how to combine all of this data and create customised maps in order to make sense of it. The last challenge was to use these computer-generated maps to find the cases where Frontex assets were near pusbacks. This required looking at many maps in order to find cases where Frontex' boats had suspicious patterns. For example, some boats would go back and forth to make waves and push migrants back towards Turkey. Some planes flew in circles while others were going back and forth in straight lines. We had to understand these patterns in the data in order to grasp how they translated in real life.     "," The project was a collaboration of several outlets convened by Lighthouse Reports which included Bellingcat, Der Spiegel ""Report Mainz” (a program on ARD, the German public broadcaster) and Japanese broadcaster TV Asahi. A dozen people with very different skills and backgrounds worked together, trusted each other and shared information. This project would not have succeeded without this collaboration.    Another key lesson was that it is possible to combine various types of journalism to create a stronger story. This story cannot fit neatly under one heading: data-journalism, open-source journalism, or a human interest journalism - all of those approaches enabled us to gather solid evidence and build an enticing story.

United Kingdom,Good Men Project in partnership with Medium and Equality Includes You,Small,Participant,Excluded: Gender and Jim Crow in The U.S. Criminal Justice System,27/12/20,"Explainer, Long-form, Women, Crime","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," By placing mass female incarceration in the context of American slavery my entry reveals how our criminal justice system has always disproportionately targeted Black, Indigenous, Women of Color, more so than men, in order to use them as a source of cheap labor. By choosing to partner with Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Community College that enabled me to interview Native female college students who’ve been affected by the iniquities in our criminal justice system I’ve demonstrated the hundreds of thousands of women who are being disappeared from mainstream society every year as a result of disenfranchisement and legalized discrimination. ", This project that involved my collaboration with the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Community College in Wisconsin where I interviewed formerly incarcerated Native female college students to learn more about their experiences inside of the American criminal justice system resulted in me being shortlisted for the Financial Times/Bracken Bower Prize 2020 where I examined the historic misogyny aimed at female offenders. I was also awarded the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize 2020 that recognises one woman who through her writing has raised awareness of state violence against women.   Reception to this piece on Medium was particularly positive and resulted in me being recognised as a top writer in racism. A shorter version of this piece has been accepted for publication in the printed edition of the Harvard Women’s Policy Journal to be published in April 2021. ," My entry uses oral testimony, recent research and statistics to provide a personal and nuanced portrayal of the ongoing female incarceration crisis, situating women’s mass incarceration in the context of American slavery. My entry enables the reader to gain a strong understanding on what is quite a complex subject as it starts in the modern day before moving back to the nineteenth century that coincided with the beginnings of the modern American penal system, before returning to the present. My entry explains what drives female reoffending, why the criminal justice system disproportionately targets women of color and the implications this has for the United States. When interviewing the women I use the Zoom software and encrypted recorded interviews in order to protect their identities. ", As a former prisoner myself I would say the hardest part of this project was first gaining the trust of Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwe Community College and the women I later went on to interview in 2020. So often when women in prison are asked to tell their stories they’re rarely presented as individuals and in the past I’ve encountered resistance whenever I’ve tried to explain to others that women in prison rarely fit the stereotypes society has of them. Any woman who has left prison and made a success of herself is routinely presented as the exception. The difficult part of the project was humanising these women and also explaining what is it about our criminal justice system that means women are more likely than men to fare poorly. ," The key learning points other journalists can take away from this project is making it a point to interview individuals who are directly affected by the story. I was motivated to write Excluded because so often when a journalist writes about female offenders the reader hears from everyone in the criminal justice system, from the Guard to the Healthcare Professional, everyone that is apart from the person serving the actual prison sentence. If I hadn’t made it a point to speak to women who had been directly affected by the racial inequalities present inside our criminal justice system I, like a lot of people would take it for granted that the reason why women are more likely than men to return to prison is that they’re lazy or incapable of reform. The only way to challenge established narratives is by interviewing those whose voices are so often marginalised. If we’ve learned anything from 2020 it’s that tolerance and understanding is only possible when everyone, regardless of their background, is afforded the opportunity to speak.

Switzerland,Data team of the Swiss Public Broadcast (SRF Data),Big,Participant,Facial recognition - it's that easy to build your own surveillance machine,07/02/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Illustration, Infographics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Python"," How do journalists show the potential impact of a new technology on society best? They try it out themselves. That's what we thought when we crawled hundred thousands of images from Instagram and searched them for the faces of 2500 Swiss politicians – and found hundreds of matches. We were suprised how easy an open-source version of a popular facial recognition library can be leveraged to effectively build a little surveillance machine that can ingest thousands, if not millions of publicly available images and dig through them in search for friends, foes, and PEPs. ","Our experiment came right after the 2020 Clearview revelations by the NYT. While this investigation was ground-breaking and certainly had a lot of impact around the world, it remained vague regarding the simplicity and power of the technology behind it. And it also failed to emphasize how vulnerable large social networks still are to crawling and essentially data theft. That's why we thought we should try out bulk collecting images and using publicly available technology for facial recognition ourselves. Only so does our reader realize how dangerous facial recognition can be, when even journalists can build their own surveillance machine. In our experiment, we were able to identify several hundred candidates for and members of parliament in around 200'000 Instagram images from popular Swiss events, some of them dating back to as early as 2015. In one case, we identified a female candidate for the Swiss parliament, showing her in her teens, participating in a street rave. In another case we could identify several of these candidates and MPs participating in political rallies. While as such, these examples might not be as spectacular, they clearly show what's possible with facial recognition combined with the availability of images that were uploaded to the Internet some point in time: Search for somebody just using his or her facial features and uncover potentially harmful images that might damage somebody's reputation when taken out of context, or even worse, when used for repression. After our research, we confronted several of the people we found in the images, and they were all more or less shocked to see their ""past"" uncovered with such a technology. Also, we confronted Facebook asking them why their Instagram portal is still so easily crawleable, getting as the answer that they were looking into the problem and that the safety"," We built our facial recognition system with Python and used it to glue together different parts of the system:     An Instagram crawler that downloaded all pictures having a particular hashtag of a Swiss event (e.g. #streetparade2018), using the https://instaloader.github.io/ library which was of great help.   A facial recognition machine that used the open source Dlib library and a Python wrapper (https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) to extract faces, embed them, and match them with ""search"" faces that we extracted from portrait images our 2500 politicians.   A MongoDB instance to store all the images, intermediate results, and statistics.   A React frontend that we used internally to go through potential matches and find actual matches with which we could confront the politicians.   Another React frontend that would showcase some of these matches to our readers (see some examples of matches in the ""Testen Sie die Suchmaschine!"" section at the top of the project link).   "," The hardest part of the work was getting started: Understanding the technology and finding good open source libraries and packages that could be used out of the box. Also, fine-tuning the facial recognition algorithm to our needs and re-iterating on the system that we used to handproof potential facial matches took some time. Nevertheless, it was still possible within 3-4 weeks, which showed us how anyone with some time and dedication could come up with a similar system.   This work should be selected because it required us to try out an often written about, but rarely really understood technology, facial recognition. For this, we actually needed to deeply understand the AI behind it, to dig through pages of documentation, and to write their own code in several iterations to achieve what's otherwise behind the curtains of big companies. We also took the effort to really explain how facial recognition works to their readership – to leave the often superficial explanations behind and explain the concepts on a high-level, so the readers would understand the implications of that technology, such as racial bias. Lastly, we took the risk to violate Instagram / Facebook terms of service and to also violate Swiss data protection law. However, public interest was on our side and we were not charged with anything. In fact, the Swiss data protection officer actually, while condemning the bulk-scale collection of image data, praised our work for showcasing the dangers of that technology to a large audience. "," We think it's rewarding to try out novel and possibly impactful technologies like facial recognition, deep fakes, and the like on your own. Nowadays, with the wide-spread availabilty of open source code and great documentation, also journalists and newsrooms with less engineering capabilities can do this. We think that the impact on the readers is just so much higher when you can show them that you were able to do it yourself, as it certainly helps in terms of credibility to not to be relying on an external expert.

Then, when we decided to write about the solidarity initiatives in some Brazilian favelas during the pandemic, we expected to respect three premises:  <ul>  Firstly, we wanted to know further details about the initiatives of these favelas but without exposing their residents to the risk of contagion   secondly, media rarely write about the positive aspects of these neighbourhoods; we wanted to focus on the responses to difficulties rather than to show difficulties   and finally, we wanted to talk about the pandemic, but we knew that readers were overwhelmed with news about the pandemic so the format should be engaging.  </ul>  A comic seemed an ideal tool to achieve our three requirements.   This web-comic combines the foundations of traditional journalism with comic designs.  <ul>  Like other journalism stories,  the first step was researching  and identifying stories, scenarios and heroes we wanted to show.   After identifying scenarios and collecting data,  we used a solution story outline to structure the idea  including the problem, the response, how the response works, the evidence, the insights, the limitations, the characters and  thesources.   The next step was  interviewing the heroes  to learn more about their initiatives.   After designing, we created some animations on Photosop and we developed it. For developing we used  WordPress as backend and Vue.js + NuxtJS for frontend.   </ul>","<ul>  AVOIDING UNNECERY RISKS. As we said, the aim was to cover the initiatives of the favelas in Sao Paulo combating the pandemic but without exposing their residents to the risk of contagion, so on some occasions, the journalist and illustrator visited the places together. However, in cases where it was not necessary, the journalist interviewed some people by phone and the illustrator used photographs provided by the organizations.   LANGUAGE. This is a cross-border story. It was written by a Brazilian journalist and illustrated by a Brazilian illustrator both based on Sao Paulo, it was coordinated by a Spanish journalist and designed and developed in Poland where our media, Outriders is based. A challenging part was communication, since the journalist and illustrator spoke in Portuguese, however we decided to use Portuguese as the first language, once we had the script it was translated into English and after that, into Spanish and Polish. That challenge become an advantade since we got to preserve the original conversation style of the comic.  </ul>"," We believe that a comic is an ideal format to cover sensitive topics, not only during a pandemic but during a conflict or harmful event. On the one hand, it seems less intrusive when it comes to portraying the reality of people than photographing or making a video; on the other hand, it has an engaging component to attract attention to important topics.

Hoaxes greatly interfere with control of the spread of virus.     Among them, the public does not believe that there is Covid-19. So they ignore health protocols.   If one of them or their family member gets infected with COVID-19, then they believe it. Even though fighting Covid-19 doesn't have to be a patient first.   We found hoaxes circulating on social media. Then we convey the facts and real data. Undisputed facts and data from the authorities or based on analysis of facts and data.     "," The impact of our eradication of hoaxes is the spread of correct and accurate information in fighting Covid-19   Lots of articles that we make have been uploaded back to the official government website. Such as <a href=""https://www.kominfo.go.id/content/all/laporan_isu_hoaks"">https://www.kominfo.go.id/content/all/leport_isu_hoaks</a> and <a href=""https://covid19.go.id/p/hoax-buster"">https://covid19.go.id/p/hoax-buster.</a>   From there we also created a hoax buster community for Medcom.id fact-checking readers. We regularly receive hoax information and provide actual data or facts   Thus, Medcom.id readers in particular can be free from fake news "," <a href=""https://www.medcom.id/telusur/cek-fakta/VNx4lP1N-tips-sederhana-memeriksa-video-hoaks"">The method we use in combating hoaxes. </a>First, we conduct cyber patrols on social media.   We collect hoax indicated information. Then we examined the issues or hoax points that were circulating one by one.   We use a number of techniques and tools. To check for hoax information in the form of narrative, we use keywords in search engines. Like google.   If not found, we try to confirm directly to the authorities or related.   Second, to check for hoax information in the form of images, we use a reverse image technique. The search engines we usually use include image.google   Third, to check hoax information in the form of videos, we use the same thing as checking images or photos. However, it takes carefulness and accuracy in choosing a representative image "," The most difficult part of this project was checking the hoax information in the form of a video. In this case, we find certain parties who try to blur the image on the video by zooming in and zooming out.   We have found videos like this uploaded several times on the YouTube channel. In the video, there are a number of different videos that are put together to lead to certain issues. In fact, there is no connection at all   One of the social media observers in Indonesia, Ismail Fahmi, the founder of Drone Emprit, stated that hoax information in the form of videos has the most potential to deceive citizens.   Meanwhile, if it is in the form of pictures or photos and text, people are relatively unbelievable. However, if it is in the form of a video and accompanied by bombastic text, the likelihood of netizens getting caught in fake news is very high "," We are fortunate to be journalists who focus on fact checking. This is because most journalists only focus on producing news. They take it from outside the internet, then put it on the internet.   Meanwhile, in this era of social media, everyone can post ""news"" on the internet. Each person. Not only professional journalists.   Therefore, the potential for hoax news is very high. Therefore, every mass media platform should have <a href=""https://www.medcom.id/cekfakta/"">a fact-checking team.</a>   They are expected to balance or reduce the circulation of hoax narratives or fake news. In the end is the creation of a society that has information with guaranteed quality.

Brazil,Agência Pública (apublica.org),Small,Participant,Fires raze nearly half of Indigenous territories in Brazil's Pantanal,17/09/20,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Environment, Health, Human rights","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","  Based on satellite data from the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research, this report found that, in September 2020, nearly half of the certified indigenous territories inside the Pantanal, the world's biggest wetland, had already been subject to fires. The data also indicate that some of the fires began on private lands before spreading to Indigenous territories, where it cut off villages, destroyed homes and farms, and sent community members to hospital for respiratory problems. The investigation analyzed all fire outbreaks reported from the beginning of 2020 until it reached its peak in August and September.  ","  This investigative report showed how the number of fire outbreaks began increasing at the end of July before taking of in August and September, which support the firefighting officials' statements that there was ample warning about a higher-than-average number of fires in 2020, but budget cuts and a delay in hiring dashed any chance of efforts to prevent the burning. It also shows how outbreaks can start on private properties, where fire is used for clearing lands, and then spread to Indigenous territories and conservation areas. Finally, it revealed that the surge in the number and extent of fires came amid a plunge in the number of fines imposed by the Brazilian government for environmental crimes, including those related to burning and deforestation.      This investigative piece has been republished by 51 news websites, in portuguese, spanish and english, being featured in important national and international outlets, such as <a href=""https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2020-09-19/incendios-ja-tomam-quase-metade-das-terras-indigenas-no-pantanal.html"">El País Brasil</a>, <a href=""https://www.eldiario.es/internacional/incendios-devoran-tierras-indigenas-brasil-medio-recortes_1_6247255.html"">eldiário.es</a>, <a href=""https://www.msn.com/es-es/noticias/internacional/los-incendios-devoran-las-tierras-ind%c3%adgenas-de-brasil-en-medio-de-los-recortes/ar-BB19G0ga?ocid=st2"">MSN</a> (Spain) and <a href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/fires-raze-nearly-half-of-indigenous-territories-in-brazils-pantanales/"">Mongabay</a> (US).

","  We used the database of fines imposed by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), data from the National Institute of Space Research (Inpe), data from the national agency for indigenous affairs (FUNAI) Indigenous Lands Mapping and the national Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) database of private properties. We analysed all fire outbreaks reported in the Pantanal to monitor the evolution of the fires in the region and inside indigenous territories. Then, we overlapped this data with the CAR database of properties in order to see if the fires had started in public, private or indigenous lands. We used free data editing programs such as Libreoffice, QGIS and Open Refine and design programs for data visualization such as Illustrator and Photoshop.  ","  The most difficult part were the linking of so many databases, as well as developing a method to visualize the historical evolution of fire outbreaks in an area as large and diverse as the Pantanal. The lack of response from public bodies and gaps of data in the CAR database also made it difficult to identify the areas where the outbreaks had begun. In addition, the emergency situation faced by the local population, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic, made it harder to get in touch with them to collect detailed accounts and interviews.  ",  This piece is an independent and in-depth investigation into a problem that directly affected the indigenous peoples in the region. Linking of different databases allowed us to reveal other aspects of the devastation scenario and to contribute to indicate areas that should be prioritized by the government while fighting the fire outbreaks and providing social assistance to the local communities.  ,https://apublica.org/2020/09/incendios-ja-tomam-quase-metade-das-terras-indigenas-no-pantanal/,https://news.mongabay.com/2020/10/fires-raze-nearly-half-of-indigenous-territories-in-brazils-pantanales/,,,,,,,"Bianca Muniz, Bruno Fonseca, Raphaela Ribeiro","  Founded in 2011 by women reporters, Agência Pública is the first non-profit investigative news agency in Brazil.

China,The Paper，WeChat Official Account,Big,Participant,Flowing Boundary:Data-driven Interactive Narrative Visualization about Covid-19 in China,18/06/20,"Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Health","Animation, 3D modelling, D3.js, Three.js, Canvas, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Node.js"," In the special context of the global spread of Newcastle pneumonia, this project uses visualization to present different dimensions of information and data in the process of fighting the epidemic in China. The metaphorical visual language and interactive web communication format narrate the dynamics of the epidemic and the twists and turns of individual destinies. The exploration of the four chapters is supported to provoke empathy and reflection in the reader. "," News reports during the epidemic were mostly about the epidemic situation and government decisions, and confirmed cases were more often converted into numbers and activity paths. This project tries to focus on the fate of individuals behind the public events and provide a richer perspective for news dissemination.   We can find some underlying facts in the data. The Chinese government's decisions were somewhat effective in controlling the rate of spread of the epidemic in the country, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of confirmed cases and a large number of cured cases at a later stage.   The occupations of those who died in the fight against the epidemic included mainly medical and nursing staff, civil servants, police officers, teaching staff, volunteers, village cadres, workers, street office workers, etc. The ages of those who died on duty ranged from 21 to 77 years old. The causes of death are mainly overwork and death, but also include car accidents, viral infections, accidents, etc., of which men account for the majority.   In social media, the location of the help-seekers was concentrated in Wuhan, Hubei. In addition to  hospital ,  infection ,  quarantine , etc., the text of the message also included  dad ,  mom,  and other high-frequency words. This confirms that the highest incidence rate is among people aged 50 and above and that the highest risk of death from NCCP is among men aged 60 and above with severe pneumonia.   These facts are helpful to arouse the public's sense of social responsibility and empathy, which in turn promotes social concern and assistance for individual events. "," The data information used in this project is partly from the information of the Health Care Commission aggregated by DXY, The Paper, and other platforms, and partly from social network data obtained by crawler technology, combined with manual cleaning to organize the data set.   Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop were used in the design phase to draw the interface, and Adobe Effects was used to edit the video and audio.   The development phase mainly uses HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, GLSL, and other technologies. For the 3D scene on the web page, we chose to use the custom shader function provided by THREE.js, based on which we wrote vertex shaders and fragment shaders to achieve a more free rendering of the 3D scene. For 2D scenes in web pages, D3.js is used to control the graphical elements and JQuery and CSS are used to control the UI. in HTML pages, most of the animation effects are implemented in the Canvas element via the function  window.requestAnimationFrame() . This function accepts a callback function as a parameter, which is executed at the frequency of the browser window redraw and is used to handle the animation effects. The redraw frequency is usually up to 60 frames per second, but in practice, the maximum number of frames depends on the user device. "," The difficulties of this project were mainly focused on three stages: data collection, visualization design, and web development.   In the data collection phase, the data information publicly available through official channels was limited, so we selected four types of data: the number of confirmed and dead cases nationwide in the time period between the first appearance of confirmed cases in China and the lifting of the lockdown in Wuhan, the patient's help information posted on the social media platform Weibo, the statistics of sacrificial anti-epidemic victims, and the cured cases in various provinces and cities nationwide. A crawler tool was combined with manual collation to obtain a reliable dataset.   During the design process, we established a coherent internal logic and visual style to complete the storytelling. Secondly, good graphic elements and visual mapping help the data information to be understood and remembered. Therefore, we used natural scenes from night to day, winter to spring to compare the development of the epidemic. And symbols containing contexts such as dust, windows, flowers, and carrier doves are used as visual factors. In addition, the data involved in this project are characterized by many attributes and large quantities, so a composite visual decoding approach is frequently used, incorporating variants of various charts such as scatter, pie, and bubble charts.   At the technical level, how to optimize a larger number of interactive images, videos, animations, 3D scenes, and other resources becomes a complex technical problem. To ensure a good user experience, we constructed a single-page-type web structure, dividing the whole web structure into four parts to browse. "," Compared with traditional print media, the innovation of digital media technology has solved the problem of information overload to a certain extent, and data journalism and interactive journalism will increasingly appear in the news genre. Visualization not only helps professionals to research and analyze data but also helps general readers to understand, remember and empathize with news events based on data facts. The integration of illustrations, graphics, audio, video animation, audio, interactive web pages, and other media will enrich the form and enhance the efficiency of news dissemination.

China,CGTN,Big,Participant,FOREIGNERS IN CHINA (1949-2020),20/05/20,"Explainer, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Mobile App, Illustration, Chart, Immigration","D3.js, Python"," This project named ""An Enduring Fascination – Foreigners in China (1949-2020)"" is a news work of big data interactive presentation.   With a unique civilization stretching back over 5,000 years, China has always held a special fascination for foreigners. In the modern era, this interest in China has grown steadily, especially since 1949. We believed that it would be of great value to tease out how this closeness developed, and this project presents the relationship from a brand-new perspective. "," After the project was launched, it attracted the attention of overseas Chinese research groups, media communication groups and overseas education groups, among others.   On the first day of its release on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, the project was viewed more than 190,000 times. As of June 6, 2020, it has been read more than 7.68 million times worldwide and has 47,000 interactions. It was particularly popular in North America and Europe. "," Python was the core programming language supporting us for data digging, collecting and filtering. The tools of Flourish and d3 were mainly used to conduct data visualization support. What do these mean?   We aimed to sort out the data of management service policy, which are related to foreigners in China from 1949 to 2020. After more than half a year’s work, we successfully captured and collected 2,050,177 original reports from the People’s Daily database and big data archives from the National Bureau of Statistics, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Culture and Tourism and ten other ministries in total.   After data analysis, we decided to create a visual interactive presentation to show the social changes of China’s policies on international immigration management and service; the development of China's opening to the world; and especially to summarize China's progress in international immigration management and participation in global governance, as well as problems that need to be solved. In order to make sure that the content perfectly matched the presentation, we built an interdisciplinary team that integrated communication, data reporting, digital art and technical practice.   After unremitting efforts, the team successfully completed multiple complex processes including data collection, computational analysis, content identification, big data analysis, visual design, content writing and editing, online testing and policy verification. "," Stabilizing the fluency of invoking external database information and best expressing the data visually were the two most difficult aspects of the project.   To best express the data, we picked the wave-point element.   We use a lot of interactive elements, which is especially important for a big data project. When the data dimension is high and the data volume is large, people will generally sacrifice data presentation. However, we made a great effort with the project's interactive design. It helped us highlight the content that we wanted to show, but at the same time the integrity of the data was retained to its maximum extent, giving readers the pleasure of exploration. "," The project has mined useful data pertaining variously to categories of sojourners such as Businessmen, Investors Journalists, Scholars, Spouses, Students, Traders, Tourists. It has tracked the development of legal and institutional frameworks that facilitate easier progression for sojourners in these areas and mapped progressive opening-up on a geographical basis.

This is not to mention the health hazards they are exposed to from the corpses, some of which are infected with serious diseases, and the lack of periodic monitoring, safety and prevention measures.         "," The report sheds light on the lives of morgue workers and showed their humane face to the public reader, their career struggles and the stigma they face. Many readers have and colleagues spoke of the tremendous change of view of these workers and their lives and how they are treated.   Many readers have and colleagues spoke of the tremendous change of view of these workers and their lives and how they are treated. After the report was published in Zenith magazine in German,   it gained wide traction in the German speaking world since it touches on a very mysterious world. The report also shed light on the COVID-19 risks for the morgue workers and stressed the need for them to get the required PPE.   The investigative report had a great role in reconsidering the aid and the foreign grants that the forensic department in Egypt gets.   “Forensic doctors leave Egypt mainly in search for better financial offers. They are usually offered salaries that are 10 times higher than what they get at home, in addition to the modern equipment they can find in other countries.  "," The report was produced using cross media and included photographic pictures, illustrations and animations that documented the lives of the morgue workers and photocopies of some of their documents. Videos were used to document interviews and a Podcast to tell the stories and the struggle of this segment of the population in addition to audio clips and graphics and info-graphic illustrations and interactive materials like maps that show the morgues in Egypt. "," The hardest challenge I faced during my work on the investigative report was to get the morgue workers to talk to the media and open up about their line of work, fearing that they might be identified by their relatives and the secrecy of their job would be blown up and be stigmatized by them and get socially excluded. Some of the people we talked to were already infected with highly infective diseases so I had to take extra precautions while interviewing them. The third challenge was extracting official information and numbers from official institutions in the country, since officials don't really talk to the media and some of the institutions involved in the forensic work hide information about their workers. After many months of attempts I managed to convince the people I interviewed to get to talk to me and open up about their secret careers, which was the key to write the first investigative report about the morgues in Arabic.

"Hong Kong S.A.R., China",Initium Media （端傳媒）,Small,Participant,"From Jetta to Tesla, the ""Chinese"" parts are in a car: How does China become a part of the global automotive industry chain",14/09/20,"Explainer, Chart, Business, Economy",3D modelling," It is a 3-D interactive page that breaks a car (from Volkwagen's Jetta to Tesla) apart into key parts with detailed investigation into the global supply chain of each parts and their development in China. The context of this project was a time in the beginning of pandemic that economic de-coupling from China was heavily discussed. We chose one of the most globalised industry, auto-mobile, as an example, to tell the story of exactly how China became a significant part of global car industrial chain and what's its weak parts. "," The 3D image and smoothing reading experience of this project brought a lot interest from readers who may not necessary concerned about automobile industry or car making in general. While a lot of readers are attracted to the page because of the images, the data on such an important global supply chain made an impression. A continuing in-depth reporting story on German carmaker Volkswagen‘s dependency on Chinese market was able to get more attention. Also, a number of organisations, from trade to education to art sector, have since approached us to ask the techniques behind this project.       It is also a project that addresses critically on a complicated economic and political debate: de-coupling. Instead of answering why de-couple, how to de-couple, who's losing or who's wining from a de-coupling future, we focused on, with concrete data and interesting storytelling, how particular industry is being globalised especially with China being a player. There was no car industry in China 40 years ago and now it's the biggest. Later, in early 2021, reports will show that for instance, a lot of German companies decide to be more localised in China; our project from early 2020, when the hype was on de-coupling, demonstrated why such sectors are seeking to be more localised.     "," The project was developed with Vue.js, compiled with Webpack, using pug as html templating language, and SASS for CSS preprocessing. We used FFMpeg to export and compress data from original video, Canvas to control the play of serialized frames according to mouse scrolling. "," In terms of data and information acquisition, due to the closed and scattered data of most industries in mainland China, we search and select representative data from more than ten different main sources, such as official reports, analysis reports of securities companies, independent global industry databases.   In terms of data selection and presentation, in addition to locate no around 10 typical parts from nearly 20,000 parts in a car, the representation of parts in the global industrial chain and the corresponding timeliness are explained, which is of great significance for reviewing globalization in the year of the pandemic.   In addition, the process of translating professional and complex information into concrete 3D images for general readers is also challenging task for us, a small independent media with limited resources. "," For other journalists, we provided a database documenting typical auto parts in mainland China and its globalisation process until 2020. At the same time, we also hope to find out for our peers, especially Chinese media, the way forward for news media to use interactive experience to tell stories and present a complex ecology.

United Kingdom,The Times,Big,Participant,Gangs in schools investigation,08/08/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Crime","CSV, R, Node.js"," I am writing to enter the Times investigation into gangs in schools and the impact it has on both students and staff. Through an automated programmatic technique we surveyed more than 1,300 schools - thought to be the biggest analysis of its kind - and found that children as young as eight are being groomed by gangs and exploited by drug dealers, with pupils bringing zombie knives, hammers and knuckle dusters into classrooms.  "," We highlighted the problem schools were facing when it comes to gangs, weapons and security and the impact that it is having on the education system.   We spoke to 186 children across five secondary schools and a pupil referral unit — a school that accommodates the most troubled and disruptive pupils — with help from the charity Votesforschools.    One of these children - a 15-year-old from Epsom in Surrey said “knife crime has been normalised: it happens so often, no one is really alarmed by it any more. But if we spend every moment fearing for our lives, not taking risks, is that even living?”. "," We sent a bulk email to schools asking for their contribution to our investigation. This was done using a script, written in node.JS, that sent an email with a personalised URL to  5,000 schools email addresses that we had collated in our own in-house database. The URL directed schools to a form that we built and was hosted on The Times’ website. Once schools had filled out the form, which contained questions on a number of topics including gangs, weapons and security, this populated a database on formstack.   After a grace period of 30 days we could then start to analyse the database and the responses we received. This was done using the R programming language and I started to look for conclusions and trends that could be drawn from the results. For example, we found that more than 60 per cent of the secondary schools searched children, some more than once a week, using airport-style security, metal wands and sniffer dogs to find drugs and weapons.   Without the automated setup of this process from the bulk email to data collection, this investigation would not have been feasible as speaking to more than 1,000 schools would not have been possible. Furthermore, this is a process that we will be able to replicate for future projects, for example if we wanted to speak to multiple councils at once. ", The hardest part was analysing the vast amount of information we received back from the schools and deciding what was the most interesting and important to write around. We wanted to ensure that we presented real-life examples and not just focus on the facts and figures. , To make sure you send the FOI from an email address that isn’t your own otherwise you’ll have a lot of schools responses to deal with!    We spent a lot of time on making sure the email we were sending was as clear as could be in terms of the instructions for the schools to follow. We thought a lot about what we wanted to achieve and what information we wanted to obtain from the school.   By spending a lot of time on our data collection process we were able to maximise the number of schools we could speak to with relatively little manual work. ,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/c5e5ba82-d8ed-11ea-a099-b011877a86c1?shareToken=2a017b0c03304b87dbbe34dd157207a5,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/cea50d44-d8ed-11ea-a099-b011877a86c1?shareToken=16e10a41ce019c7732c4046a7cd028c3,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/d802557c-d8ed-11ea-a099-b011877a86c1?shareToken=d354cb30c61afc4f5b3990d82f4a6cb5,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/face13f2-d8de-11ea-8f95-6d813022b2d7?shareToken=9e9f53abb456d17551cc12f4ef970bed,,,,,"Daniel Clark, Nicola Woolcock, Sam Joiner, Tom Calver"," Daniel Clark is an interactive journalist for  The Times  and  The Sunday Times .

Nigeria,AFP Fact Check,Big,Participant,Ghana leader falsely claims his country fronts Africa's COVID-19 testing,13/05/20,"Investigation, Fact-checking","Google Sheets, CSV","  Testing is central to the fight against the novel coronavirus, which has infected several millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people across the world. And with the fragile nature of health systems in Africa, the capacity of countries in the continent to promptly test people for the virus to curtail its spread has become a major talking point globally.      The project checks the veracity of a claim by Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo that the African nation had administered more COVID-19 tests per million people than any other country on the continent.  ","     1. My fact-checking report triggered an important national discussion in Ghana (which later metamorphosed into a continental debate) about COVID-19 testing capabilities of African countries.   Details of the report were widely reported by major media organisations (radio, television and online), particularly in Ghana, including:   JoyNewsOnTV: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/JoyNewsOnTV/posts/3913102482094962"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/JoyNewsOnTV/posts/3913102482094962</a>   Joy997Fm: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/joy997fm/posts/10158316060316894"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/joy997fm/posts/10158316060316894</a>       2. The report helped Ghanaians to hold President Nana Akufo-Addo and his cabinet members to account for spreading false information. It reignited the #KickNanaOut hashtag on social media, making the slogan the top trending topic on Twitter in Ghana on May 16, 2020. #KickNanaOut is a hashtag used by government critics in the West African country to criticise the shortcomings of President Akufo-Addo's administration. This was covered by multiple news outlets:    Ghana Web: <a href=""https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/KickNanaOut-AFP-expos-triggers-anti-Akufo-Addo-campaign-on-social-media-954250"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/KickNanaOut-AFP-expos-triggers-anti-Akufo-Addo-campaign-on-social-media-954250</a>   GhanaCelebrities: <a href=""https://www.ghanacelebrities.com/2020/05/16/kick-nana-out-trending-after-afp-exposed-akufo-addo-for-lying-about-ghana-leading-covid-19-testing-in-africa/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Ghanacelebritiescom+%28GhanaCelebrities.Com%29"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ghanacelebrities.com/2020/05/16/kick-nana-out-trending-after-afp-exposed-akufo-addo-for-lying-about-ghana-leading-covid-19-testing-in-africa/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Ghanacelebritiescom+%28GhanaCelebrities.Com%29</a>   Ghana Trending: <a href=""https://ghtrending.online/59/291721/17/04/2020/05/17/kicknanaout-afp-expos-triggers-anti-akufo-addo-campaign-on-social-media/"" target=""_blank"">https://ghtrending.online/59/291721/17/04/2020/05/17/kicknanaout-afp-expos-triggers-anti-akufo-addo-campaign-on-social-media/</a>   3. The report raised the voices of Ghanaians and other Africans who had doubts about the president's claim but could not conduct verification or did not have the platform to disprove him.   4. Ghana's Deputy Health Minister Bernard Okoe-Boye and the country's COVID-19 Risk Communication Director Dr. Dacosta Aboagye both reacted to the fact-checking report.    When television host Emefa Apawu queried the government officials over the false claim, Okoe-Boye did not admit Ghana was leading Africa in COVID-19 testing. He, however, used a different metric (tests per thousand) to explain that the country was ""part of the first three"" countries leading the continent in COVID-19 testing.    Deputy Health Minister Bernard Okoe-Boye's interview was featured here: <a href=""https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/national/okoe-boye-reacts-to-afp-report-on-covid-19-testing-in-africa/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=okoe-boye-reacts-to-afp-report-on-covid-19-testing-in-africa"" target=""_blank"">https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/national/okoe-boye-reacts-to-afp-report-on-covid-19-testing-in-africa/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=okoe-boye-reacts-to-afp-report-on-covid-19-testing-in-africa</a>   <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7C9w0rcaw&t=13s"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX7C9w0rcaw&t=13s</a>   Aboagye said ""whether the president said this or that… is not, but let's look at the positives from what we have actually achieved as a country.""    Risk Communication Director Dr. Dacosta Aboagye's interview was featured here: <a href=""https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/national/covid-19-discussion-should-move-from-afp-fact-check-of-akufo-addo-dr-aboagye-urges/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=covid-19-discussion-should-move-from-afp-fact-check-of-akufo-addo-dr-aboagye-urges"" target=""_blank"">https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/national/covid-19-discussion-should-move-from-afp-fact-check-of-akufo-addo-dr-aboagye-urges/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=covid-19-discussion-should-move-from-afp-fact-check-of-akufo-addo-dr-aboagye-urges</a> ","  My report used findings (including the solution) from data collated from the six countries and presented the information in a tabular form on Google Spreadsheets. The table ranks Ghana behind South Africa, Mauritius and Djibouti in COVID-19 testing per million people as of May 10, 2020, which goes contrary to President Akufo-Addo's claim.     First, the claim was tested against the available evidence by defining COVID-19 ""tests per million people"". The number of COVID-19 tests per million people conducted by any country is calculated by dividing the country’s number of COVID-19 tests by its total population, and then multiplying the result by one million.     To obtain this figure, two parameters were used to test the claim against the available evidence: a country's total population and the number of COVID-19 tests conducted.     But since there was no readily available data on the number of COVID-19 tests conducted for all the 54 countries on the African continent at the time of publication, and since we only needed to find out whether there was at least one African country with higher COVID-19 tests per million people than Ghana, we decided to compare Ghana with five other African countries -- Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana, Djibouti, and Mauritius -- with publicly accessible data on the two parameters.     COVID-19 testing numbers were obtained from the national health authorities of these countries, while population figures were sourced from national statistics offices and the United Nations.  ","  The hardest part of this project was collating Covid-19 testing data of countries considered in the project, and also presenting it in a digestible format.     I think the project should be selected because of its uniqueness.   President Akufo-Addo made the claim amid the COVID-19 pandemic when effective testing, contact tracing and isolation of infected cases were deemed crucial to curtail the spread of the virus. Also, the false claim was made just a few months ahead of Ghana's 2020 presidential election where Akufo-Addo seeks reelection against the former president and his critic John Mahama.  ","  Attention to details! I read the president's speech with utmost skepticism and found some of his assertions to be inaccurate. This could have gone unchecked if I had not paid such attention to the key statements and it is important for journalists not just to reports what public officers say but to ensure these statements are factually accurate, and a way of doing this is to constantly check for the veracity of the assertions  before we inform our audience. This would improve public trust on media reports and hold the public officers accountable for their words.

After selecting a municipality from the map, the reader receives information on the selected municipality and a contextualization of the data.  This work has two aims: first, to inform about climate change at the local level; second, to encourage local journalists to write stories about their places. "," The project has had a great impact so far. Shortly after its publication the map became the most viewed content in the European Data Journalism Network’s website. Moreover, the data has been reused by almost 90 media outlets across Europe, whether they be national or local newspapers.   On top of that, the project has been used for advocacy purposes by a number of civil society organizations calling for stronger initiatives against climate change across Europe, such asStopGlobalWarming, an Initiative of European Citizens that promotes the approval of a carbon tax at the continental level. "," The analysis has been carried out using Rstats, and especially its geocomputation libraries. After downloading the dataset from the Copernicus/ECMWF website, which consisted in multiple daily estimates of temperature values for more than a million tiles of 5.5x5.5 km2, we calculated the average temperature variation of every tile in the last half century. In a second step, we matched the values of the tiles with the respective local administrative units’ shapefiles, as well as with NUTS2 and NUTS 3 shapefiles.   After creating the dataset, we worked on the map itself, trying to effectively visualize the data.   From a technical point of view we relied on d3.js and Mapbox to design a granular map that shows 60 years of temperature trends in each country of Europe. From a narrative point of view, we relied instead on a scrollytelling approach to enable readers to understand the data and the temperature trends, comparing a given municipality with others in the same region. "," When it comes to the data analysis, the hardest part was matching the municipalities with the dataset tiles. The extension of encompassed municipalities differed largely, sometimes by orders of magnitude.   To obtain a single value for each municipality, we associated the center coordinates of every municipality to the closest grid cell of the available data (having thus a common method for any city). Yet, to calculate the city center, instead of using the simple geometric centroid, we decided to weight the center based on the population grid. This was made in order to have the center of the municipality's polygons closer to the urban areas. Indeed, when thinking about a city, the average person depicts in its mind the main urban area, generally the most densely populated.   For the Map page development, instead, we had to manage 100.000+ points and preserve a fluid and engaging information experience, so we spent a significant amount of time to find the best coding strategy to balance performance and efficiency. "," This project shows that the analysis of the local impact of global phenomena is both important and successful.  The project moves past a traditional data-journalism project based on a map, offering a scrollytelling experience which brings the reader across the charts and the data. From a data visualization point of view, the point-based design allows a more precise analysis, and discovery of crucial municipalities that are suffering more from climate change compared to others, due to different issues (land use, pollution, population, etc etc). This makes the project something more than an article: a real tool to discovery.  Finally, this project made it available a wealth of data that has been reused by many other organizations, inside and outside the media landscape. This, besides giving to the project a snowball effect, also made it possible to create and nurture a network with other journalists and civil society organizations.

Supporting locally grown food also helps us towards sustainability as our farmers ensure that the land is well-kept through minimal use of harmful chemicals and fertilizers. However, farmers continue to face the challenge of feeding a growing population, providing for their families, and protecting the environment. To make sure there is enough nutritious and safe food on their table, our farmers deal with varying circumstances such as extreme weather conditions, pests infestation and disease outbreaks. Come rain or shine, our farmers tend to their fields and do everything they can to have a good harvest. They deal with the most difficult situations, yet local farmers earn very little. The CRA initiative continues to thrive in Northern Mindanao and among the local beneficiaries are farmers from Kiabo, Bukidnon. As part of our indigenous groups, they are inheritors and practitioners of a unique culture and distinct ways of relating to people and the environment.  "," The hardest part of implementing this project is the natural cautiousness of the farmers towards government projects. They have been ""burned"" before by people with political agenda. That is why we never dictated them or imposed projects and programs. We let them decide what projects to implement and the pace. We worked around their practices and beliefs, and introduced new technologies with caustion. Respect for their beliefs were given prime consideration.   Still, we try to introduce new technologies as long as it did not contradict with how they do things. We taught them the ""entrepreneurial mindset"" as compaired to their ""just for existence"" farming mindset. This has paid off. During the pandemic, we were informed that they were able to sell their herbs and black rice. This encouraged them to plant more.   We also encouraged participation of allmost all members of the family including the youth. The younger members of the family were encouraged to handle marketing while their elders remain the producers. Processing and value-adding trainings and Farm Business School was also introduced to other members of the family..   We continue to espouse participation from all stakeholders through our Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA) Program. Through the CRA Program, we are able to reach out to far-flung agricultural communities to enhance their capacities to withstand climate-related issues. These are families whose income is only enough for their most basic needs and can barely support their livelihood.

The publication of GRIT is the center’s continuing effort to write, document and chronicle how our farmer-beneficiaries became self-sufficient and resilient to rise to the challenge in farming brought about by climate change.   Journalists can learn that even in the far-flung and less visited areas, there are stories to tell. These stories  would inspire even the most cynic.  For everyone, it is an eye opener. These people who are underserved and usually neglected  by government live peacefully among themselves. They don't make demands but work tirelessly and with dignity. They appreciate interventions, though sometimes with reservations. Still, if you gain their trust, they will be friends for life.    Stories like theirs must be told, With just a little push and a helping hand, they were able to triumph. These are people  who find joy in little things. Being able to send  their children to school with a few cents in their pockets gave them unparralled joys.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,Guardian coronavirus trackers: The UK and the world,02/03/20,"Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","D3.js, R","Throughout the year, the Guardian has been tracking the spread of the disease both in the UK and around the world. This coverage has concentrated on two tracking pages. The UK page tracks the number of daily cases, deaths, hospitalisations and - now - vaccine doses, as well as the geographical spread of case rates and restrictions. The global page tracks the latest case and death rates per country, analysing trends both over time and geographically. These are designed to present the latest data in the clearest way possible so that our readers can understand the current state of the"," Our trackers are some of the team’s most-visited pieces of data journalism over 2020, with millions of both regular readers and new audiences engaging in the content. We regularly receive contact from readers who have used the pages, either simply complimenting the clarity of the information or making suggestions for future improvements. As this is a live event with both the state of data and the focus of the story constantly changing, we regularly integrate these suggestions into our thinking.   As we have been able to track the number of people who have engaged with the interactives on both pages, we are able to see that thousands of members of our community uses these pages as a resource to get the latest information on their area - whether that’s the latest information on cases in their local authority, or details on the latest lockdown restrictions that apply to them. In a rapidly changing and unprecedented pandemic, such localised, free and easy-to-use information has proved essential for people to understand how the situation impacts their lives. "," To make the self-updating graphics for the UK tracker, we used a Lambda which fetches the coronavirus numbers from the government API on a daily schedule. The Lambda then cuts down the government data to exactly what we need, and writes that data as a file to S3. On the frontend - when the user loads the page, the S3 file is fetched and is run through D3 templates to create the maps and charts.    On the backend of the global tracker, we have used both AWS EC2 in the past and AWS Lambda currently in order to pull the data. D3 was used to build the maps and charts of the global tracker. We also developed the pages as AMP-friendly formats and integrated tracking for the interactives within Ophan, the Guardian’s in-house analytics platform.   The individual components have been designed so that, aside from the tracker pages themselves, they can be embedded in any Guardian journalism, bringing clear up-to-date data visualisation to our readers even if they're not on the tracker pages. "," All the numbers related to coronavirus are less simple than they initially appear. Case rates depend upon test rates. And not only do death rates depend upon case rates, but they also are subject to different definitions of a Covid-related death. One of the biggest challenges with this piece was the selection of correct and suitable metrics on a quick deadline and then the clear and effective communication to our readers who are anxious to understand the latest coronavirus news.   Also, the coronavirus pandemic changes on a daily basis - with the stories, metrics and emphasis shifting continually. This means that the team behind our trackers has to be highly adaptive and responsive. Problems have been triggered by a variety of things: a country changing their counting methods for cases or deaths; a new variant causing a dramatic change of the picture; or a new metric such as vaccine doses being introduced by a new source that we need to quickly create a data pipeline and visualisation for. Therefore, the page requires a lot of maintenance. The last example of this was the fact that, as countries started approving vaccine rollouts, we have had to find new sources for vaccination data - with Our World in Data coming to the forefront of up-to-date sources of vaccine data - and include three new components to the two trackers to show how a new part of the story is progressing. ​ "," Simple, utility-driven data journalism is a useful resource for readers, and these tracker pages are worth the amount of time and resource they take in both the initial production and continual maintenance. The team has collectively put weeks of work into these tracker pages, and the rewards have been worth it. We can see from the amount of people reading from the page, as well as the amount of time they engage with the content, that our community - and those beyond - value the work we put into these pages.    This once again proves the power of simple visuals such as bar charts, line charts and maps in telling readers exactly what they need to know in the biggest ongoing story we've ever covered - and that makes them one of the most rewarding, valuable and useful pieces of data-driven content that we can produce.   Coronavirus is an exceptionally long-running story. But as data journalists tackle more systemic and long-duration topics, it’s critical to build the tech behind these pipelines and visualisations like an app that has to work for a year, not like a one-off with a shelf-life of several weeks.   That means investing the time up front to bring in tech best practices, making the code easy to maintain and change. And as we strive to be visually accessible - we also need to be technically accessible and the graphics should work on old mobiles as well as on new computers.   Making that technical investment allows data journalists to add value beyond the 24hour news cycle.

China,"Caixin Media, Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund",Big,Participant,Healthy China Ongoing: A Smoke-free Digital Map to Push Forward the Progress of Smoke-free Laws,18/09/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, Infographics, Map, Health","D3.js, Canvas, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV"," In 2019, the third anniversary of launching Healthy China 2030 plan, in order to show the progress of smoke-free environment, encourage cities that have passed tobacco control legislation, promote cities that are planning legislation of a total ban on smoking, and drive more cities put smoke-free legislation into the legislative plan, we plan to develop an interactive digital map to show current situation of smoke-free legislation in China. We launched the map in 2020, shortly before the law was passed in Chongqing, to enhance social awareness to ensure the law passed with strictest standard. "," In the beginning of the project, 20 experts in the field of tobacco control (including HWO, China CDC，university professors, tobacco tax experts, etc) were invited to discuss a set of standard parameters that could be used to quantify the effect of urban tobacco control. They were invited again before the map was launched. This project actually sets the agenda and acts as a center player for the group of people to share and discuss experience and insights to the issue.   Shortly after the map was launched, a hashtag topic was created and spread on Weibo, the largest public social media platform in China. Millions of readers browsed and discussed smoke free law and the condition in their hometown. A few days later, a serie of posters using the data visualization in this map were shown in subway car in Xi'an. And five more cities passed their first smoke free law.   The management system of the map is handed to smoke free law campiagn officers, and the data has been continuously updated. The impact of the project would last for a long time, until all of the residents in China are protected with smoke frree law. "," We use data visualization programming library D3 to create the map. Also we use SQL to program database. We use HTML, CSS, JavaScript to create the website.  "," Smoke free is a public health agenda and it's very positive, so in the beginning of the project we thought it would be well and widely supported. However, as the project progresses, we were caught between tobacco companies and health authorities. It turned out to be a problem far more complicated than we thought. Different provinces and cities have different levels of economic development and policies, should we use uniform (the stricitest) standard to evaluate their progress on smoke free protection? After a long arguement and discussion with the experts, and after weeks of research and discussion within the group, we decided to stick to the stricitest standard because that's our mission: to urge regulators on the behalf of the public. So, the data of smoke free cities is slightly different from the government, some of the ""smoke free law"" which are not 100% forbiding smoking indoors are removed in our list. This actually created some pressure between some law makers and us.   The launched map is in fact not the full version of the project. In the full version we collected data of cities planning to make smoke free law and show them with a yellow color. We also provide links to the local government when the draft law in under public acquistion. However, just a few days before the launch of the project, we realized that the tobacco companies would use our map as a tool to find the next target to lobby. So after another heated discussion, we decided to hide the information and only show in the interial version to a small group of social workers and government officers. "," The map itselft provided the most complete data of China smoke free legislation so far. The journalist in the related field can use it as a powerful tool to find information they need with their report.

United States,"Columbia Journalism Investigations and Center for Public Integrity with McClatchy's The State and The News & Observer, California Health Report, Centro de Periodismo Investigativo and InvestigateWest",Big,Participant,Hidden Epidemics,25/08/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Crowdsourcing, Chart, Environment, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, RStudio, Python"," For decades, scientists warned that climate change would harm our health, spurring an unprecedented rise in deadly heat, infectious disease and disaster-related trauma. But the U.S. public health system, hampered by underfunding and political resistance, is ill-prepared for this crisis, as documented in our 16-month investigation. Americans are suffering the consequences.       Columbia Journalism Investigations and the Center for Public Integrity anchored the series, collaborating with newsrooms around the country. In addition to the organizations that reported or edited submitted stories, we partnered with City Limits, IowaWatch, The Island Packet, The Lens, The Mendocino Voice and Side Effects Public Media. "," Stories in the “Hidden Epidemics” series ran in or were cited by at least 30 national and local publications, including The Guardian, The Nation, Mother Jones and the Texas Tribune. Covering Climate Now, which carried the series for republication, named one of our pieces a “CAN’T-MISS [STORY] FROM 2020.” The Center for Cooperative Media listed the series’ second installment on the mental toll of climate disasters as one of the top 10 collaborative journalism projects of the year.   CJI and Public Integrity reporters discussed our findings on a half-dozen radio and TV programs, including Public Radio International’s The Takeaway. We hosted a virtual community event on the mental health toll of repeated hurricanes, floods and wildfires that attracted nearly 200 participants and sparked a public debate over important issues such as U.S. public-health preparedness and climate justice. On the academic front, CJI reporters presented our findings at the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance’s annual Data Week.    Local editors and reporters who worked with us saw great interest in these stories from readers; our  Vibrio  story was the most-read environmental piece at the McClatchy-owned South Carolinian flagship The State over the past two years. But perhaps the most important statement of impact comes from one veteran media watchdog in North Carolina, who wrote, of that  Vibrio  story, also published in The State’s sister paper The News & Observer, “I thought as the alert from N&O arrived on my screen, ‘This is a fearmongering bit of click bait and here I am clicking on it.’ Reading to the end, my appreciation deepened and deepened as the stories and technical realities unfolded. This is a rare and helpful example of public interest journalism.” "," Data analyses for the series showed us where to focus geographically (heat deaths, vibriosis cases), which newsrooms to recruit as partners (regions with repeat climate disasters and higher shares of social vulnerability), how to identify climate’s current impacts on people’s lives and more. Data was key. But we aimed to slide it into stories in the manner of ducks swimming: If we did it right, the hard work would be virtually invisible.       Data that powered an indoor heat deaths interactive — one that shows temperature, air-conditioning status and other details about each case in an Arizona county — was processed using Python/Pandas and visualized using d3.js. For all the other heat-related analyses, as well as the environmental data for the  Vibrio  story, we used RStudio. Illustrator was used to refine figures made with ggplot.         For the  Vibrio  story, we used dynamic tables on Google Spreadsheets to see trends in time and geography and identify the most dangerous species, the riskiest seasons, the most common ways of infections and the places with higher incidence in state and county level across the nation.   We maintained and analyzed datasets for our mental health stories using Microsoft Excel, with an occasional assist from Microsoft Access. We used Tabula to collect some datasets from PDFs, Dataminr to webscrape others and OpenRefine to clean the data. That allowed us to show that student homelessness spikes after major disasters, among other findings.   We used JotForm as a platform for a survey of disaster survivors, putting its skip-logic options to work. Other data work included partnering with a Columbia University epidemiologist on a model to estimate the number of Arizona heat deaths that are primarily due to warming temperatures, and tapping buoys and satellite data to show water temperature changes over time. "," Obtaining data and documents through public-record requests was a slog. For example, two agencies denied the existence of data tracking progress in the federal Crisis Counseling Program for disaster survivors, even after we learned that counselors must record this information. Only after we found blank forms and formal memos confirming responsibility for maintaining the data did we get it.   We also wrangled with incomplete datasets. Salinity data used in the  Vibrio  story contained many missing values and dates as well as values suspiciously outside of normal ranges. We had to drop our plans for a broad analysis and use a case study approach: illustrating one weather event and coinciding vibriosis case, relying on one salinity sensor.   To analyze warming in the Chesapeake Bay, we needed long-term water temperature data. Data from buoys was mostly limited to the last 10 years. Scientists pointed us to data derived from a mix of satellites and buoys, but there were accuracy questions. Ultimately, we found one buoy with a longer time record that we could compare with the satellite data. The buoy data had similar inconsistencies as the salinity data, with changing formats between years. But after cleaning it up and interpolating between missing data points, we were able to use the buoy as a check for the satellite data and we determined the satellite data was solid.    To create the indoor heat death database used in our reporting and in a graphic, we pulled information manually out of 130 autopsy records. It was both tedious and emotionally demanding. Some physical descriptions were gruesome, and most records contained snippets of circumstances surrounding the death; all the people we read about died alone, and many of the records suggested lonely, isolated lives. "," Climate change is an all-of-the-above story. It affects everyone, and just about every journalist can find climate stories on their beat. The datasets we tapped show that reach: student homelessness, a federal social vulnerability index, mental-health services, water salinity, death records, disaster declarations, 911 calls and more.    So that’s one lesson: Look widely for data when reporting a climate story. Climate change is creating measurable havoc, and showing that human impact with data is powerful and necessary.   Another is the power of collaboration. By joining forces with 10 regional newsrooms in areas hit by disasters, we were able to leverage everyone’s reach for an extensive survey answered by more than 200 disaster survivors and mental-health professionals. In that way, we created data to fill a gap and found sources we never would have known about otherwise.   Designing and managing that survey was a months-long affair. Outreach ranged from postcards to Facebook ads to three interns who spent weeks reaching out to groups around the country. So, word to the wise: Embark on surveys only if you’ve got the time to invest.   One useful aspect of this partnership was that newsrooms could do a little (share the survey) or a lot, depending on their interest and capacity. We shared our disasters reporting and data with partners; some co-published our story, some localized it, some produced their own pieces, some collaborated with our interns on stories. Being flexible rather than prescriptive can work out better for everyone.   And the final lesson: It’s possible to connect local, human stories to big datasets — even during a pandemic when travel is restricted or impossible. We talked to hundreds of people, most of them by phone.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,Higher education entry grades have gone up up to 4 values,06/10/20,"Infographics, Chart","CSV, R, RStudio"," To get to a public college in Portugal, you need to get better marks than the other students applying for the same degree you want. If a degree opens with 80 places in some university, you need to at least be the 80th with the best school results to get in.

Using the results from the last 4 years and standard deviation, I’ve calculated which ones were mostly affected by this.

United Kingdom,The Times,Big,Participant,HMRC enforcers threaten families left penniless by the pandemic,09/12/20,"Investigation, Open data","Google Sheets, CSV, R"," While the government spent billions helping people through the pandemic the UK’s tax authority HMRC was using debt collection agencies to chase people on low-incomes, threatening to take money directly from their bank accounts and remove their property.   Using programmatic analysis of open source data, Freedom of Information requests and investigative reporting we built up a picture of the heavy handed treatment many UK citizens were experiencing.  The investigation exposed the 800 letters accusing people of deliberately not repaying debts and also revealed that HMRC had employed “field force collectors” to visit people struggling with tax debts at business premises.     "," The collection of stories were read by hundreds of thousands of subscribers online, ran on the front page of the printed edition and was picked up by <a href=""https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/hmrc-enforcers-threatening-cash-strapped-23144562"">other news outlets</a>. But the impact went beyond informing readers of the damaging behaviour of the tax authorities.    When we first contacted HMRC with our findings they apologised, saying the content of the letters sent ""was a mistake and does not reflect our current approach to debt collection"".    A month later the tax authority confirmed it would stop using debt collectors and threatening repossessions during the pandemic. It also suspended the use of field force collectors until the end of the national lockdown.   MPs on the Public Accounts Committee criticised HMRC for failing to support people whose livelihoods had been shattered by the pandemic.  "," We used the programming language R to clean and analyse open source data on spending by HMRC to ascertain how much it had spent on debt collection agencies. Using a script we were able to rerun the analysis as more data was published each month, keeping track of spending throughout the investigation.    We used Freedom of Information requests to identify the number of complaints to HMRC regarding debt collection agencies as well as details of the millions of cases HMRC was sending to debt collectors and the number of field force officer visits.    ", One difficult element was ascertaining which metric in the open data we needed to analyse. While the UK government publishes a lot of data it does not always make it easy to understand exactly what each metric means and the names of variables are often obscure. To confirm we were using the correct metric we contacted another company that had previously published similar research.     ," Open data and Freedom of Information requests are a good combination, allowing us to build up a solid picture of how much was being spent and on and the full scale of HMRC's use of debt collectors.

Brazil,Época,Big,Participant,How an innocent man dies in Rio de Janeiro,27/01/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Gun violence, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," The report “How an innocent man dies in Rio de Janeiro”, published in eight pages of Revista Época in January 2020, is the result of a four-month journalistic investigation. Reporter Rafael Soares analyzed, one by one, the investigations of all 195 homicides committed by the Rio de Janeiro police in the month with the highest number of occurrences in the state's history - July 2019 - and discovered cases with serious indications of police errors and executions summary. "," The result of the journalistic investigation contrasted the speeches of the federal and Rio governments. Both President Jair Bolsonaro and Governor Wilson Witzel were elected by replicating the speech that ""greater legal protection"" was needed for the police officer who killed on duty. The speech was accompanied by an increase in the number of deaths in operations in Rio, which led to a peak of 195 cases in July 2019 - to date the highest number in the history of the state. However, the serious failures in homicide investigations and evidences of executions revealed by the report opened wide that, unlike the official version, the officers that kill on duty are protected by the criminal justice system.   The report served as the basis for a series of requests made to the Supreme Federal Court (STF) by political parties and civil society organizations in the Fundamental Precept Failure Statement (ADPF) 635, which questions Rio's security policy and operations in favelas during the pandemic of coronavirus. One of the requests was inspired by the result of the report: the one that claimed that investigations into homicides committed by state agents should be carried out, independently, by the Prosecutor's Office. The request was unanimously accepted by the STF plenary on August 18th. "," The journalistic investigation was divided into three stages. The first was the data collection. The reporter obtained access to data of all 151 police investigations (a police inquiry may investigate more than one murder)on homicides committed by officers on duty on July 2019 through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Information such as the investigation's serial numbers, locations of all investigations, investigated officers, units in charge of the investigation and actual stage of the proceedings were provided by the police.   Then, began the second stage: the documental research. In order to gain access to other important documents of the investigations - such as forensic reports, for example - regular visits to the Homicide Unit and the Prosector's Office were necessary. By the end of this stage, the reporter was able to collect detailed information on the majority of the investigations and could produce an Excel table with the data. The objective was to understand both if there were indications of irregularities in the police actions as well as to point out flaws in the investigations (lack of expertise at the crime scene or testimonies from victims' relatives, for example).   The thirdd stage was the field work. The reporter selected eight cases with serious  indications of police misconduct and collected over a month testimony from relatives of victims, witnesses to the crimes and members of the criminal justice system involved in the cases - investigators, prosecutors, public defenders, lawyers and experts. This new stage was intended to advance in relation to the official investigation, hearing new witnesses, and to outline a more detailed profile of the victims. "," The hardest part of the project was to overcome the lack of transparency of law enforcement agencies in Brazil. Till 2018, Rio de Janeiro police didn't respond to FOIA requests. Since then, the answers are rare and often incomplete. Because of that, this project of analizing all investigations on police killings in a month had to be postponed for over two years. The reporter came up with this project's idea in January 2018, but by that time police didn't provide the requested data.   For two years, I interviewed lawyers, police officers and prosecutors to understand how worked the digital system of Rio's police and Prosecutor's Office that controls the progress of investigations. My goal was to write better requests to get the data. I learned that this sistem is able to filter several informations of each inquiry and it also generates csv editable files. And above all I learned that this files were not protected by any kind of confidenciality. In September 2019, I received for the first time the archives. I started to make the same request every month not to miss any update.   The second stage of the investigation was also a challenge. For two months I had to convince more than a dozen of sources to gave me access to the documents. As the majority of the investigations were ongoing, prosecutors and investigators were not able to provide copies of the investigations. In a lot of cases, I had to copy the content of the documents by hand. In the end of that process, I had acces to inquiries of 135 of the 195 murders committed by Rio police in July 2019.     "," This project is a good example of how to combine techniques of tradicional reporting — such as field work, interviews with sources and documental research — with data journalism's methodology and analysis to overcome an opaque government. In countries like Brazil, where transparency is not a rule followed by governments and access to public data can be hard and scarce, it's a challenge to get big amounts of data, specially from law enforcement agencies.   In this case, the main goal of the reporter was to analyze how the police investigates itself in the brazilian state with the biggest number of police killings. Therefore, it was fundamental to get information about all inquiries.   If Rio's police provided all the data (the complete investigations of police killings or more detailled data about each inquiry), it would be a lot easier to analize the material and come up with findings. But as it didn't happened it was necessary to create a methodology to get the data and then to organize it.       Through the FOIA requests, I was able to get basic information from each inquiry. Then I started to get other necessary data in multiple others sources (documents, interviews, field work). In the end, every information of each inquiry was put in a database, where I could segment and rank everything.   In the end, this project taught me the importance to rely not only on one but on multiple sources to build an journalistic investigation.    ",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x8WBhAS88BpUsNy1KBkFoQmbrA6MCQ8f/view?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oxFc6CjQXFC9t6cBK42z12Yef4IWlHGUW_2XPLLkibk/edit?usp=sharing,https://epoca.globo.com/rio/como-morre-um-inocente-no-rio-de-janeiro-1-24208427,,,,,,Rafael Soares," Rafael Soares is an investigative reporter based in Rio de Janeiro.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,How are people confining where I live?,19/11/20,"News application, Chart, Lifestyle, Health","Personalisation, CSV, R, RStudio"," The first rules of the portuguese national lockdown were pretty explicit: everyone should stay at home. But that quickly moved into semi-lockdowns, with rules on the weekends or regional rules applied differently depending on how the numbers for that specific place. So we built a news app using Google’s mobility data that allowed everyone exploring the level of confinement for the place where they lived. ", This story allowed everyone to know if people where they lived were staying at home. Since everyone based their opinions on what they saw on the streets or the number of people they saw at the supermarket it created some non-factual ideas about if people were respecting the general idea that you should stay at home. ," I used R to get the data and do some data transformation. Because data was a variation of those six indicators compared to the values in January, I decided that I should do some transformations to let the users understand those numbers. So I applied a rolling average to let everyone see the trend instead of the numbers - that could vary a lot according to the days. Then, because we had data previous to the first national lockdown, I’ve used the standard deviation for when the country was not on lockdown and when it was to create a scale - non-confinement, confined and somewhat confined. A general value for the municipality was calculated if we had data for at least 3 or the six indicators.   I’ve used the plumber R package to create an API for those values and used Vue.js to build a page with custom links for every municipality available. "," Deciding on a methodology that allowed me to create those 3 levels of lockdown. Also, in a more technical problem, because I was avoiding use d3.js for the charts, I thought using chart.js would be easy. But it didn’t offer me the custom choices I wanted, so it was really hard to create a chart with 3 colors dynamically. "," When you present data, you can help people have a more honest conversation. The article was shared on social media by our readers when people were arguing if people were staying at home when they should be. It’s not because you saw a few people at the supermarket that you should assume that no one is staying at home.

Sweden,"J++,Sveriges Natur",Small,Participant,How butterflies respond to climate change by moving north,25/03/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Environment","QGIS, R, RStudio"," Global warming poses a threat to biodiversity, as warmer climates force species to move, and butterflies are among the first to respond to this.    As our analysis showed, they’re already on their way. Using methods developed in close collaboration with researchers in the field, we analysed 1.5 million observations, reported to the database Artdataportalen, and were able to identify 40 species that have moved north.    To our knowledge, this is the first such analysis using observational data to see how species’ ranges are changing in Sweden and a novel way to illustrate some of the concrete effects of climate change. "," Climate change is the issue of our times, but it can be difficult to report on it in a way that engages audiences. Biodiversity loss especially can feel abstract.    That’s why we wanted to focus on the very tangible effects these are having on people’s everyday lives. We wanted to find a data-driven, quantifiable way of telling the story of changes that are already occurring around us. Using observational data we were able to show our audience how things look in their area, revealing and putting numbers to a change that many of them can already sense.    Everything was done using publicly available data on species observations reported to the Artportalen database, maintained by the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU).   This story was published by Sveriges Natur, Sweden’s largest environmental magazine, and picked up by other media including Sweden’s national broadcaster SVT. We are also proud that researchers at SLU have asked to use our results and the method we developed in order to do further analysis.    We feel this project achieved our goal, of turning climate change reporting into something tangible, innovative and data-rich. "," The bulk of the data analysis and visualisation was done using R. The actual observations we used came from Artportalen, where we downloaded all observations of butterfly species between 2005 and 2019.    We decided, in close collaboration with researchers, to focus on the northern border of each species’ range, comparing the 90th percentile of observations’ latitude in 2005-2009 with 2015-2019, to identify species which had moved north during a ten-year period.      We also depended on QGIS for some additional geospatial analysis. In order to avoid capturing changes in observers rather than butterfly ranges, we filtered out areas where no observations at all had been made during the first time period. "," One of the hardest parts was that we were using observational data for the first time, and that, as no similar analysis has been done in Sweden, there was no blueprint for how to proceed correctly.    We had to spend some time developing and refining a method for how best to analyse observational data, and butterfly movements, two things we were not experts on. The way we made this work was by turning to experts (always crucial in data journalism!). From the very start, we worked very closely with researchers, using their guidance both to develop the method, and interpret the results. "," The project serves as a use case of how a small team of data journalism experts can reach and empower local reporters. All the data used for the story was public, but not necessarily accessible for ordinary reporters or members of the public.    It also serves as a starting point for a broader conversation about how we can produce data journalism on climate change which actually engages people.    From a more technical standpoint, we could also use this project to introduce topics like analysis and mapping in R, or doing geospatial analysis in QGIS, including things like matrices and points-in-polygon analysis.a ",https://www.sverigesnatur.org/natur/fjariln-vingad-syns-i-norr-nar-klimatet-blir-varmare/,https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&sl=sv&tl=en&u=www.sverigesnatur.org/natur/fjariln-vingad-syns-i-norr-nar-klimatet-blir-varmare/,,,,,,,"Clara Guibourg,Katarina Lind", Clara Guibourg and Katarina Lind are Swedish data journalists.  ,

United States,"The Hechinger Report, The Associated Press",Big,Participant,How career and technical education shuts out Black and Latino students from high-paying professions,22/10/20,"Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," Once seen as a dumping ground for poor students of color, career and technical education has rebranded itself as a pathway to college. On the surface, there appears to be equity in who takes these career-oriented classes. But The Hechinger Report and the Associated Press dug deeper. Our original reporting and data analysis found that Black and Latino students were less likely than their white peers to take STEM and information technology classes – geared toward college prep and high-wage jobs – and more likely to take classes in hospitality and human services fields, which tend to pay less. "," This project, and the data behind it, is helping to shape conversations on education policy in communities around the country. Following publication, Sarah Butrymowicz, Hechinger’s investigations editor and lead reporter on the project, received requests for more information on the data from the Legislative Policy and Research Office of the Oregon State Senate’s education committee and from a Missouri nonprofit that helps legislators conduct research on policy questions. An advocate from the Education and Law Project at the North Carolina Justice Center also reached out, hoping to help state-level advocates advance equity in career and technical education in their own states. "," The data analysis for this project was primarily done in Excel. Butrymowicz first compared participation rates by race in individual career and technical education subject areas to overall statewide enrollment by race to establish that there were patterns of disparity. To ensure that those inequities were not owing to chance, Butrymowicz performed a statistical analysis. She calculated odds ratios comparing the number of students of each race who are enrolled in the career cluster to those who were not enrolled. She also calculated a 95 percent confidence interval for these odds ratios and identified the states and career clusters where statistically significant differences existed. These findings revealed clear patterns and served as the launching point for the article.   But Butrymowicz also wanted to explore potential reasons for these trends. She obtained lists of career and technology courses offered by high school for 10 states and merged them with school enrollment data to see if students of color had equal access to these classes. In some states, Black and Latino students attended schools with STEM and IT classes at the same rate as white students. But in others, such as Mississippi, the data indicated that Black students had less access in their high schools to these courses. Butrymowicz and AP reporter Jeff Amy explored this dynamic further in the story. "," Data gathering and cleaning was the most difficult part of this project. While states are required to track some career and technical education data and report it to the federal government, collecting course enrollment by race data only became mandatory this year. Beginning in 2019, The Hechinger Report and AP reached out to all 50 states asking for their data, the vast majority of which had never made it publicly available.   Ultimately, we were able to secure at least some data from 40 states, a remarkable accomplishment given the absence of federal mandates for sharing the data and the fact that states did not keep this information in a uniform way. Some reported information only on students who had taken two or more classes in a particular subject area, while others reported students who had taken a single class. Some collected data by broad categories, such as information technology, while others broke down the information by more specific career pathways, such programming, computer science and web design. It took dozens of hours to parse these differences and make the data as comparable and reader friendly as possible. "," This project shows why seeking disaggregated data is so important. Overall enrollment in career and technical education has become much more representative of student populations over the last several decades. Simply looking at that data would give the impression that the field had solved its equity problems. But digging into the data revealed the deep racial divides in who takes which classes and demonstrated that there is still a long way to go.   Additionally, the federal government will soon begin publishing data on career and technical education participation by race. This article offers a sneak peek at what that data will tell us and provides a foundation for journalists looking to report on the updated numbers.

The government especially The company requested people should start the plan to work in a different place, and advised the public to stay at home as much as possible without going out. We grab the MRT traffic data on march in recent years to compare the change of MRT traffic volume affected by the epidemic. "," The report compares the MRT traffic data on march in recent years, and we find that compared with the past 5 years, the number of passengers in march this year has dropped significantly, and the crowd is only 81% of the 5-year average. However, if we observe the changes in the number of people entering and leaving the station during commuting, the reduction is limited. On the other hand, the number of people entering and leaving the station during non-commuting hours and holidays has been significantly reduced. It can be seen that most people who originally take the MRT don't change their way of commuting, but during the non-commuting time, they can try not to take the MRT. "," We fetched the MRT data by Python script. The Python script crawled the MRT station data, and exported the csv files. We analytics the csv files by R, to make the traffic data for each station by hourly. And we make the charts by R ggplot2 library to visualize the traffic to understand how people move during the covid.

To do this we had to build our own dataset from the daily numbers released by the government in PDFs. We started when the first case was reported in March 2020 and visualised this data in a <a href=""https://mediahack.co.za/datastories/coronavirus/dashboard/"">dashboard</a>. The scrolly story was a way to use 7 months of data in a narrative format. We also made the data publicly available. "," The scrolly story, <a href=""https://bhekisisa.org/stories/coronavirus/"">How Covid-19 took hold in South Africa</a>, was not only published by Bhekisisa, but was also published by <a href=""https://specialprojects.news24.com/covid-19-took-hold-in-south-africa/index.html"">News24</a>, South Africa's largest news website. It was published shortly after the country emerged from the first peak in cases and it was the culmination of 7 months of work collecting and visualising South African Covid-19 data in a format that we tried to make accessible to the general public on the <a href=""https://mediahack.co.za/datastories/coronavirus/dashboard/"">Coronavirus in South Africa</a> dashboard. This dashboard had over a million unique visitors by the end of 2020, many of whom returned regularly, often daily.  We know this, not only from Google Analytics data, but also because we have received hundreds of emails from visitors to the dashboard making comments and suggestions, many people shared their own chart ideas.  Screen grabs from the dashboard are regularly shared on social media. We started a newsletter which quickly grew to have more than 9,000 subscribers. Through the newsletter we gave people updates on Covid-19 with additional data analysis and charts as well as links to stories written by Bhekisisa. Thanks to these newsletter subscribers, when we launched a crowdsourcing campaign to help us cover some of the costs of collecting the data, we raised our target funds in 30 hours - not the 30 days we had allocated. Bhekisisa commissioned the scrolly story as a way to turn the data into a data-driven journalism feature that show people through maps and visualisations how the virus had spread through different parts of the country at different times and how superspreader events had played a role. The data that we made publicly available was used by other media companies, eg, Al Jazeera and the BBC, as well as by some academics and other people interested in doing their own visualisations. ","  Google Sheets  for data collection. Data is collected daily in a number of different spreadsheets because it is easily done by helpers without specialised skills. The bulk of the national and provincial data is taken from PDFs published daily by the South African Department of Health. Other data, such as district-level data, is gathered from infographics published usually on social media by the provincial health authorities. This data is sometimes erratic and often contains typos, but there is no other source of district-level data that is publicly accessible.   R and R Studio  used to clean and analyse data.  SQL  - data is pulled from the spreadsheets into a SQL database.

Belgium,RTBF,Big,Participant,How do Belgian political leaders use Twitter?,20/11/20,"Infographics, Chart, Politics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, Json, Python"," We have released a Data Visualization article that analyses the Belgian political leaders behaviour on Twitter. Who is the most productive ? Who is the most popular ? What are the hot topics over time ? We answer those questions through an interactive article mixing dataviz and texts. The project was published in November 2020 on the RTBF website, the first french-speaking media in Belgium.     "," Every political journalist or data visualization fan in Belgium saw our work on day one. Unusually for a country divided into two separate communities, the story was shared and received comments from both French and Dutch speaking people.   This data visualization project was a first for us at RTBF. We wanted to show in-house what you can do with this technology. The first reaction we had from our colleagues was: how did you do that? How long does it take to create this? It looked like magic to them.    Audience measurements showed that our readers stayed for a longer time on such pages than average. They want to go deeper and understand every part of the story. This is exactly what we want: have the audience spend more time to understand a subject based on high quality content.   Ultimately this project added value to our brand. It gave us more credibility and visibility in a competitive information market. ", Data Acquisition : the tweets have been acquired through the official Twitter API.   Data Enrichment: we have used text classification techniques on the tweets. The classification algorithm was based on a word embedding model (word2vec - gensim) that has been trained on our full corpus.    Data visualization: The webpage has been developed in React (javascript framework). The visuals were custom made and implemented using the graphical library D3.js. ," The hardest part of this project was to find a point of view worth exploring for a large audience. There was no certainty about what we could find within this large amount of tweets. The combination of our 3 skills, i.e. journalism, text mining and data visualisation was key to come up with an interesting story.   Another challenge was related to the linguistic landscape of Belgium. The political leaders can write in French or Dutch, which complicates the automatic analysis of the text. To tackle this challenge, we applied a language detection algorithm on the tweets and we have implemented one classification model per language, with the same output classes. "," Telling a story is great. Journalists have been using text, sounds and videos for ages. But what’s next? How do you go beyond your usual job? Data visualization is a new challenge for us. Space is free on the internet. Use it!    We have to see the web as a playground where everything is possible. In this case, the audience wants to see what’s behind the day to day political storytelling and create their own content by interacting with Data. They are happy to understand. Dataviz is a great way to reach that objective.   The only way to make a success out of it is to understand what every member of your team is doing. Communication is key. What is technically possible and what is not? Is it meaningful for the story to show the data like this? Did the data scientist see a trend that the journalist was not aware of?    As a journalist, don’t try to do the job of the front end developer.

"," The hardest part of the mission of tracking and statistically reporting on COVID-19 in Egypt was the paucity of data over the pandemic. Therefore, I depended on the Ministry of Health's official numbers and built a database for the confirmed coronavirus cases. I used this database to establish connections between data and reveal indicators of the peak and the scale of the outbreak in Egypt. I also depended on alternative data sources in other stories such as a report that track the tours and visits of the Dakahlia governor. The governor was the first official the government announced his infection by the COVID-19. I followed his official visits and the officials he met before the government announced that he contracted the virus.

Switzerland,Independent,Small,Participant,How Flash games shaped the video game industry,22/07/20,"Arts, Culture","D3.js, Json, CSV, Python","A visual essay about how Flash games shaped the video game industry, with contributions from the creator of Flash and more than 20 former Flash game developers. The end-of-life of Flash in December 2020 marks the end of one of the most creative periods in the history of gaming. The essay illustrates a crucial part of internet history and what we can learn from it for building to Flash shaped a whole generation of developers. It gave people a voice and a way to connect with the world. The lessons we can learn from Flash for building today's platforms and"," As with all digital art, games have to be constantly maintained to remain playable, which is often not possible because the original developers don't have the time for it, or they are not alive anymore.   You can still listen to music that is more than a few years old. But with projects that are based on software this is not the case. Thus, for cultural evolution it is uniquely important to tell their story so that we can move forward instead of just remaking the same things as often happens when games are inaccesible and forgotten.   -----------   The article was widely circulated among game developers and people working with technology. It was retweetet more than 2000 times, featured on the hackernews frontpage as well as in popular newsletters such as Morning Brew, Internet Brunch, Benedict Evans newsletter, Stackoverflow newsletter and many more.   -----------   Flash games are often dismissed as low quality amateur games which are not ""real"" games. With this article I tried to shift the narrative by showing the impact they had on so many people's lives, the video game industry and the internet as a whole. ","  Javascript, HTML, CSS:  Used for building the main content of the article    D3.js:  Used for visualizing the bubble timeline of Flash games    Scrolllama:  Used for the scroll driven interaction    Python:  Used for scraping data on gameplay statistics from Newgrounds.com     "," Getting the pace of the article right was one of the most challenging aspects. I designed the story to have a clear emotional arc in a similar way that you would script a movie.   Two examples:   - To set the scene I open with a man escaping the destruction of his city. This connects with the imminent death of Flash theme and how the influence of Flash games on modern gameplay is inescapable.   - The main story was designed to follow the arc of the history of Flash games itself. The bubble timeline explodes into color and fades out into a tiny stream with a count-down timer at the end, after which a wall of credits rolls.       That kind of pacing may seem obvious in hindsight, but required a lot of iterations to arrive at.     "," The article was designed from the point of view of a game designer, which means that I asked many questions related to game design rather than from a journalists perspective when writing it.   What I did with this article that is often not done in articles written by journalists is asking how readers can find their own story in the article and letting the users decide which parts of the article they want to read. This allows for a much more personalized article and makes readers want to share what they discover.        A few examples of how readers found their own story in the article:    - https://twitter.com/joelgolby/status/1311586009084301312   - https://twitter.com/squuuidly/status/1286106329837457412   - https://twitter.com/warbears/status/1319624025266638849   - https://twitter.com/search?q=flashgamehistory.com&src=typed_query        A few examples of letting readers decide which parts to read:    - There are 20+ individual stories of game developers in the credits section.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,How Joe Biden won the presidency – a visual guide,06/11/20,"Explainer, Long-form, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics","D3.js, Canvas"," The Guardian’s UK and US offices collaborated on a scroll-based project, aiming to make sense of the election result.    Knowing that our results page would communicate the number of votes that each candidate gained, we focused on a different metric for our analysis: the swing from 2016. This would allow us to track how the American electorate changed after four years of Trump’s presidency.    Using arrows and beeswarms to communicate swing, while zooming into the key battlegrounds when the reader scrolled, allowed us to communicate the geographic and demographic trends that helped Joe Biden win the presidency. "," On the surface, this piece provided an instant analysis of the election results just minutes after Joe Biden was declared the winner. The maps show that the suburban vote was decisive and that many working class areas in swing states actually turned against Trump. But the piece also paints a picture of American polarisation, using this data as a snapshot of where the country is after four years of Trump. For example, our beeswarm charts show that the polarisation isn’t necessary on urban/rural lines. Rather, education level plays a much larger role in political stratification. More educated areas of the country swing heavily toward Biden, while less educated areas swung toward Trump.   Through visualisation, we were able to present these facts in a straightforward manner to our audience with clarity. Every county was individually presented in our graphics, meaning that there was a transparency in our communication of these trends - something even more important in an election where the result was inaccurately questioned. These factors helped facilitate a better understanding of the issue within our reader community. "," We used HTML5 programming languages as the core of the project, developed mostly through the d3 javascript library and CSS. For the maps, we knew that efficiency would be very important, in terms of serving a huge amount of arrows and geographical divisions. Therefore, we used Canvas which dramatically reduces the amount of information that needs to be served.   We also use a local database stored on spreadsheets to highlight and add all furniture related to the events - for example, annotations and highlighted counties - coming out of the results. Thanks to this external spreadsheet we were able to update both the text in a quick and efficient manner, responding to the latest news as quickly as possible, allowing the reader to understand the latest geographical and demographic swings as they were announced. "," If the US election result was announced on the night, with a landslide result, this project would have been easily launched without many hiccups as soon as the whole race was called. Instead, the whole team had to wait for several days as a handful of states - including the critical Pennsylvania - counted their votes. While the result was most probably going to be called for Joe Biden as mail-in votes swung counts toward him, we were unable to publish this analysis until most counts were finalised and the electoral college win was confirmed. In the process, much of our analysis evolved to be more nuanced. But this meant that our UK team - Ashley Kirk and Pablo Gutierrez - and our US team - Alvin Chang and Rashida Kamal - had to keep passing the relay baton between one another as teams slept while waiting for the result. While we were by no means unique in this regard, with many teams experiencing the same problems, it proved the importance of international collaboration and forward-planning in tackling data-driven visual projects that cover live - and often unpredictable - events. "," Preparation is key. Before the election, we planned out and researched a host of different scenarios for the result - including one where the result wouldn’t be known for several days - so that we limited the number of major decisions that had to be made during the pressure of covering a live event. This proved essential. In retrospect, doing even more would only have made our reporting even more effective.   In anticipation of drawn-out results announcements in which the picture could change over a series of days, we decided that the scroll-based stages of the piece would be driven in part by a spreadsheet, in which several journalists could easily select new states to focus on and input new analysis as results came in. This gave us the flexibility to easily change what we wanted to say as the results became clearer, without the need for several different people to go into the code behind the project.

Ukraine,NGO CHESNO Movement (chesno.org),Small,Participant,How MPs submit amendments and how they adopt them,20/10/20,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Politics","Scraping, CSV, R, RStudio"," The project is an online tool, where the stakeholders could find the information regarding the amendments of MPs' (how many amendments MPs propose and how many were succesful), information about voting activities of each MP and its faction or group, and an interactive network of MPs representing co-authorship amendments. It is also possible to download the raw data about mentioned activities to explore the activities more deeply.  "," Our project is the first online tool where journalists, analysts, and politicians could observe MPs’ activities and even detect anomalies in behavior. In Ukraine, the amendments are widely used amongst politicians to postpone or delay the bills’ passing in Parliament. For instance, this app can demonstrate who is trying to postpone the Land Market Law and other socially useful initiatives. It also helps the journalist pay attention to a specific bill if it was overwhelmed with amedments. Besides, we believe politicians and assistances use it as well.     Doing this project, I also paid attention to the problem with open data regarding MPs’ activities. The amendments activities and access to this information still is a problem. We are trying to do a small advocacy campaign regarding open data and transparent processes in Parliament. Moreover, it is very problematic to detect whose amendments have successfully passed Parliament. Our network of co-authorship helps to resolve this problem.   "," The tool is made entirely in R. I have built the interactive web application in a shiny library. I used shiny related libraries like shinythemes to improve my app's look. The MPs' voting activities are available as open data, and I downloaded it directly from Open Data Portal. It needs some wrangling and cleaning, for which I used dplyr, splitstackshape, tidyr and tidytext libraries.   Since the second needed part regarding the amendments submissions of MPs is not available as open data, I parsed it from the official web site of <a href=""http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/pt2/reports.dep2?PERSON=17993&SKL=10"">Parliament</a>. To get data from the static HTML pages of MPs, I used rvest and xml R libraries. Also, I used ggplot and ggplotly for visualizations and R libraries for cleaning and wrangling data.   Thirdly, I build a network, nodes and edges, based on bills' activities of MPs. I did an interactive network in networkD3 library, which is an integration of D3 into R. "," Firstly, I am very proud that I made this project from the beginning to the end on my own with a little help from an IT colleague who helped me deploy it. In the beginning, I wrote two articles about MPs amendments, and I even won an open data <a href=""https://www.chesno.org/post/4317/"">competition </a>on this topic. Afterward, I decided that it would be useful to have an online application where everyone could check and download amendments data.   Secondly, building application was quite challenging for me because I needed to learn a shiny library. It took me some time to draw the website's structure and ensure that it works smoothly for everyone. Nowadays, the app serves well, but, of course, there is always space for how I can improve it.  "," This project aims for Ukrainian stakeholders like investigative journalists, analytical and policy centers whose job is concentrated on political topics and corruption. Since not all of them can put time and energy into dirty process of gathering and cleaning data, my application helps them eliminate this work stage. The app can detect MPs' hidden behavior and voting activities, observe the most modifies by amendments bills, and look at the most successful MPs' initiatives and propositions to statements.  It does not always mean that the anomalies or interesting patterns could be detected at first sight.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,How much has the pandemic cost in government contracts?,21/10/20,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, News application, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Business, Health","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio"," With the covid-19 pandemic, governments across the world increased their spending on several medical equipment and services to fight the spread of the vírus. Portugal was no exception. But how much was spent? And which companies profited the most with the pandemic? No one seemed to know. Using the Portuguese Public tenders database and Machine Learning, we were able to give some answers. This investigation was done in collaboration with other european newsrooms, so we ended up being able to compare countries expenses (and their lack of transparency). "," This story was Publico’s front page and it was cited along all other portuguese media outlets.  The investigation, that resulted in three articles (published both online and in the print version of the newspaper) and a news app, was very impactful since it shed some light to the business side of the pandemic.  The fact that we also decided to publish a news application that allowed everyone to look at their local hospital/local government/school or any other public institution was also very important because it allowed people to scrutinise their local institutions.  Because this investigation was made in collaboration with other European journalists, we also found out that not every country has the same open data policies regarding covid-19 public tenders, being Portugal one of the few countries that decided to publish all the data. That was also very important to highlight a good policy regarding public spending. "," This was probably the longest and most ambitious data project I’ve ever worked on. The portuguese government was publishing an excel file with all the contracts, but I ended up realizing that a big amount of purchases related to covid-19 were not on this database. So I built a scraper with about 90 covid-19 keywords to everyday get the data from the public tenders website, do the consecutive data transformations needed, get information about those companies from other websites and put it in a shared spreadsheet that everyone collaborating in the project was able to access. I’ve used NLP and the tidytext to get the most used words on the contracts descriptions to find out more possible words to add to the scraper.  We agreed with the international partners that it would be useful to classify those contracts by kind of purchase (ventilators, masks, etc). Since most european countries were not publishing all the data, it was a doable task for everyone working on the project. But Portugal had about 16.000 contracts. So it suddenly became a very hard task. Using Machine Learning and the previous 5000 already classified contacts, I built a model that relied on tf-idf and other fields from the database to do those classifications. It was a very imperfect model (maybe someone with more experience in ML would do a better job at this) with only 70% of success. So we checked the model classifications everytime it ran.  For the news app, I’ve used vue.js to build the website and plumber R package to build the API for the app. All the other analyses were done using R. "," Dealing with so much messy data. The public tenders database doesn’t have a proper API, so I had to use the export params on the url to automate stuff. But the returned data was messy, and cleaning it to match the agreed data format with the international partners was hard.   But the hardest challenge was to read 16.000 contracts. Even though the ML model helped a lot, it still needed to be fact-checked. And because most of the contract descriptions were not explicit enough, we often needed to check the pdf files on the public tenders database to understand what that was, if it was related to the pandemic and what was the price unit of that product - that was the only way to get, for example, how the FFP2 masks prices have variated along the time. "," That Machine Learning can save your investigation. Without Machine Learning, it would take us ages to classify everything. Even though we had to fact-check the results provided by the model, M.A.R.A (the name of the model, named after the intern that helped me classify the first 5000 contracts) did the work for the easy to classify contracts, leaving us time to focus on the ones that were harder to classify.   But it also showed me that you can’t bindly trust ML. Maybe my lack of experience using ML was what drove me there, but, for example, M.A.R.A kept thinking that stuff bought by Madeira’s regional government was construction related purchases (Madeira can be translated to Wood in portuguese).

United Kingdom,First Draft,Small,Participant,How pro-mask posts boost the anti-mask movement,20/08/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Cross-border, Open data, Chart, Politics, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python"," A data investigation uncovering how Twitter’s trending algorithm boosted anti-mask movements and conspiracy theories about the pandemic, combining innovative data analysis methods with rigorous tracking of anti-mask movements online in the UK and Europe.    In July 2020, the hashtag #NoMasks trended in the UK suggesting there was surging anti-mask sentiment and distrust in coronavirus prevention measures. But our investigation of more than 30,000 tweets showed that while there was an increasingly loud anti-mask movement in the UK, the platform’s algorithm gave anti-mask misinformation a boost by dubiously presenting it as a widespread trend.  "," Prior to this piece, there were few robust examples of this and none in relation to anti-mask or anti-lockdown activism. Our story was revelatory, hitting a nerve and making an imprint on people’s understanding of social networks and how they present information. High-profile technology researchers and influencers shared and praised the findings, including specialist researcher and Syracuse University professor Whitney Philips who featured the story in her 2020 election course syllabus. During the reporting of this piece, we conversed with Twitter representatives, flagging our findings and suggesting the algorithm was fueling misleading reports. A few days after our story was published, Twitter changed their rules to include descriptions on trending topics.   The story had almost 10 thousand views on First Draft’s website and was shortlisted for the British Journalism Award for Technology Journalism in December 2020.     The story uncovered a little-known problem with technology platforms: algorithms often present topics and ideas as “trending” without any context or verification, which could give extra exposure to divisive topics, increase disinformation and make the public less likely to comply with scientifically informed government measures – causing more damage to democracy and society than conspiracy theories alone.     Through the use of data, the investigation served the public interest by uncovering the British public’s real sentiment around masks. This illustrated how Twitter’s algorithms created the false perception that anti-mask positions are more common than pro-mask views, promoting the idea that the majority of people in the UK opposed mask-wearing. In turn, the inclusion of the hashtag in Twitter’s “trending” sidebar exposed more users to anti-mask messages, potentially encouraging new audiences to flout the laws. The story visually presented the problem with social networks — that they don’t care what people share, just that they share — allowing a wide public audience to take knowledge away.  "," During our long-term monitoring of global disinformation narratives, #NoMasks trended on Twitter on July 14, prompting us to notice a lack of posts pertaining to the anti-mask sentiment. We used Python’s Twint to scrape over 30 thousand Twitter posts containing the #NoMasks hashtag in July 2020 and 1,660 posts with the French hashtag #StopMasques between July 20 and August 4. With Python’s Pandas, we analyzed shares over time, the most shared tweets and top accounts posting them.    We used Regex to parse out hashtags and tags in the tweets and accounts’ descriptions to select the most common hashtags associated with the #NoMask hashtag.   The next step of analysis focused on the tweets posted on July 14 — the day the British government announced that masks would be compulsory in shops — to track when, how and through which accounts #NoMasks went viral. After filtering out the false-positive tweets that contained US- or Australian-focused messages, we manually analyzed the 222 resulting posts that gained at least a little traffic — more than 10 retweets — on July 14. We then tagged whether they were “Pro-Masks” or “Anti-Masks” and analyzed both groups by top associated hashtags and by the total number of retweets and likes per hour. The data visualizations were built with Chart.js and Adobe Illustrator. "," As a new field, disinformation reporting is less developed than other areas and the impact of monitoring social media and consuming harmful posts long-term is not known. Vicarious trauma can be common amongst journalists focusing on social media. It was challenging to sift through reams of misleading posts and it can be overwhelming as a journalist to go through thousands of such messages. Alongside the investigation, we were also working on daily output, including newsletters and news reports, as well as long term case studies and features, so we also had to use our time stringently.   Finding ways to explore and analyze online disinformation data is also challenging. The work of a data journalist in this field is mostly experimental and exploratory. With limited access to the platforms' API, we have limited tools at our disposal and we always have to come up with innovative ways to collect data and research suspicious content in a comprehensive way. Therefore, developing an accurate methodology was the most delicate and time-consuming part, followed by hours of work to clean bad-formatted data and to make sure the sample of data was relevant and comprehensive. "," As part of our work of tracking social media trends and narratives day in, day out, we often rely on platform algorithms to inform our reporting and help shine a light on disinformation. However, we’ve experienced a lack of transparency and utility to many platforms and often grapple with bugs and flaws. Many journalists also rely on trends such as Twitter’s trending sidebar for news stories, so uncovering these shortfalls and an uncomfortable truth about how journalists do their work can be difficult.   Having developed a new and original methodology to dig into the Twitter data and the trending hashtag, other investigative journalists can be inspired and apply it to their own field of research.  ",https://firstdraftnews.org/latest/coronavirus-how-pro-mask-posts-boost-the-anti-mask-movement/,https://github.com/dottocarlotta/antimasks-hashtags-data-analysis/blob/master/README.md,,,,,,,"Carlotta Dotto, Lydia Morrish"," Carlotta Dotto is a senior data journalist at First Draft, leading investigations into global information disorder and developing pioneer techniques to research disinformation.

To explain to non-U.S.-citizens how a party, despite a majority of votes, can end up sending fewer delegates to parliament, we developed a game that allows users to tip the election in a fictional state. Subsequently, a scrolling element takes readers through some of the most absurdly shaped congressional districts in the U.S. - results of extensive gerrymandering practices. ", The project was published in German and English shortly before the election and was thus accessible to a wide audience. The playful approach was particularly well received by social media. We know from reader mails that some teachers in Germany used the application to explain the voting system in the USA to their students in a playful way. ," The project was mostly realized in Javascript, employing maps (with Mapbox GL js), scrollytelling and interactive elements.

Netherlands,RTL Nieuws,Big,Participant,How safe are our streets? The risk of a serious accident in Dutch residential areas,28/12/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Open data, Map, Environment, Health","Personalisation, QGIS, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, Python"," The number of people that are injured or die as a result of a traffic accident in the Netherlands is on the increase. The number of casualties is even twice as high as the government’s target. This needs to change, say experts. They argue that places where the risk of an accident is highest need to be tackled. But what are those places? That is something that data journalists of RTL Nieuws researched on the basis of extensive data analysis. By coupling accidents, traffic volume and lengths of streets they calculated the risk of an accident for 10,000 residential areas. "," The Dutch government has been battling with road safety for years. Targets to reduce the number of people that are killed or injured in accidents are by no means met. Moreover, figures by the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics reveal that 82 percent of all Dutch citizens experience traffic problems in their own areas at some point. Almost 1 in 3 even experience severe vehicle nuisance.   Experts speaking to RTL Nieuws are unanimous in their verdict: the trends are worrying, and the numbers need to go down. But how? According to experts it is important to identify places with the highest risk of accidents and target those locations. With that information in mind, data journalists of RTL Nieuws set about their business. The result is a large investigation in which data from various sources have been coupled in order to get a clear picture of the risk of a serious accident in almost 10,000 areas in the Netherlands. They not only looked at the number of accidents, but also at traffic volume. Ten serious accidents in a busy area pose less of a risk than the same number in a quiet area.   This is the first time anyone has looked at traffic safety in residential areas in the Netherlands in this way. A professor of Transport Policy at the TU Delft followed the investigation. The results have been presented in a tv broadcast and various online articles, enabling the public to see the scoring of area where they live. RTL Nieuws received a lot of reactions after publication. Both from citizens who recognized themselves in the results as well as from policy makers, traffic experts and researchers from universities who wish to use the results to address dangerous places. "," The great thing about data journalism is that you can process things in a hundred different ways with a variety of tools and techniques. In this investigation, many of those different tools and techniques were used. For the collection and organisation of the data with information about location of tens of thousands of traffic accidents we used R and Excel. We obtained data on road length and intensity from the databases of TomTom with 12 different GeoJSONs. This had to be done in different GeoJSONs as the annual intensity and road lengths of hundreds of thousands road sections of the entire road network in the Netherlands are too extensive to retrieve in one go. The files were organised in R.   Subsequently, the data from 12 files were combined in QGIS and both the locations of accidents as well as the number of accidents per location were added. These layers of data were compared to a map of Dutch residential areas by the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics. On that basis the number of accidents, road lengths and traffic intensity were calculated per area.   We then calculated the risk of accidents per area, according to an existing scientific methodology.   In order to present the data in a way that is comprehensible and attractive to the public we converted the risk of accidents to a star rating based on the deviation from the average. The data have been mapped per area with the aid of Flourish tools. Moreover, on the basis of all the data and with the aid of an editing robot, ADAM (Automatic Data Article Machine), that we ourselves developed, an article was written with the relevant results for those specific areas in all 2,500 municipalities in the Netherlands. A script was written in Python in order to achieve this. "," An investigation such as this is based on many different choices. Sometimes small and sometimes big, but every choice ultimately impacts the end result. With every step we make during this project, we have always asked ourselves if it was the right one. We were constantly updating and refining. Take for example the fact that national highways cut through Dutch residential areas without being connected to the area. The intensity on those roads is very high, while they have no impact on the traffic safety in that residential area. Therefore, we decided to not take national highways into account for our investigation, in order to create the clearest possible picture of all areas.   We are well aware of the fact that we are data journalists, not traffic experts. That is why we sought out professor of Transport Policy Bert van Wee of the TU Delft at an early stage. He served as back-up when decisions had to me made. This way, we could present and test the choices we made and the formulas we used as well as our calculations and interpretations.   We need to also mention the fact that we cooperated with a third party. Not every company is eager to share its data with a news organisation. For our investigation, however, it was crucial to be able to use valid data on traffic volume. City councils sometimes execute research on traffic intensity and that data is available, but it is limited to the specific locations that were assessed. TomTom navigation systems’ floating car data covers the whole country and also contains data of intensity for less busy roads in towns and villages. Thanks to a very detailed plan, we were at last able to convince TomTom navigation systems, after months of communicating, to share their data with us. "," Cooperate with other data journalists, but also experts. Together you can do more than on your own. By cooperating you reduce the risk of mistakes and only strengthen the investigation. Also, give your plan time to come to fruition in your head. As research journalists, we are able to spend more time than others on a particular subject. That is a privilege, but it should be handled wisely. Make sure to reach out to other parties in time and have a good story to tell if you wish to use their data.   The huge number of data that is sometimes available can make you lose sight of what is important. Make sure you conduct a thorough preliminary investigation. What is the problem? How bad is it? What is known about it already? What do experts say? What do I want to know exactly? These are all questions you need to ask yourself before you even start gathering, analysing or visualising data. They will eventually help you with your investigation.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,How the novel coronavirus has evolved,10/12/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart",Adobe Creative Suite," As the coronavirus swept across the world, it mutated into several major groups, or strains, as it adapted to its human hosts. Mapping and understanding those changes to the virus is crucial to developing strategies to combat the COVID-19 disease it causes.   Reuters unraveled and analysed over 185,000 genome samples from the largest database of novel coronavirus genome sequences in the world, to show how the global dominance of major strains has shifted over time. "," Although it wasn’t uncommon for a virus to mutate, few had described how and when the viruses changed. Reuters graphics delved into the laboratory samples to demonstrate how strains looked different from the one that had first emerged in Wuhan. We received a lot of attention on social media because of the granularity of the graphics that we published and how we shaped that into a narrative explaining the evolution.    "," We used Matplotlib and D3 to visualise the datasets.      Because the data form was relatively new to us, it took us a while to construct a full phylogenetic tree (the intricate node graphic). We had to use a javascript library called newick to parse the data and format it in a readable way for D3.    The visualisation demonstrated how complicated these mutations were. It showed in granular detail how the virus evolved and showed the origins of each mutation. "," The full genome samples were a myriad of details that we had to decipher and understand. By reading and sifting through the data, we developed a working knowledge of these strains mutated. ", The dataset was enormously complicated. Sometimes it would be easy to give up considering how monumental the task was. But members of our team persisted with their analysis and were able to report out how the strains had evolved.

"," The stories were able to illustrate the pandemic’s impact on some of the Philippines' biggest industries and conglomerates using financial datasets in a simplified manner.       With the government not providing enough data, and at some point even tried concealing them, the stories were able to flesh out specific details on the difficulties faced by companies.       The series gave Filipinos a better picture what jobs were lost, how businesses were recalibrating their operations just to get by, and just how little government intervention was.   It also exposed just how much space in Manila is allocated for consumerism, and how quickly it all turned to ghost towns amid the pandemic.     "," The data for these stories were processed through Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, and then displayed in graphs and charts cheated through Datawrapper.     "," Businesses in the Philippines, in general, are quite secretive in their financials.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,How the pandemic is evolving where I live?,27/04/20,"News application, Infographics, Chart, Health","Personalisation, Json, CSV, R, RStudio"," With the covid-19 pandemic impacting our daily lives, the media started to report on national numbers of cases. But, as a reader, I always wanted to check how the number of cases was evolving in the municipalities where people I cared about lived. The Portuguese government was publishing daily numbers by municipality and there were quite a few dashboards already. But could those numbers be turned into local personalized stories?  Using that data and contextual information about the municipalities, I built this news application that turned into a personalized news story about one of the 308 municipalities in Portugal. "," When I get excited about a new dataset that I’m going to explore, the mantra that I try to keep in mind is: it’s not data journalism if it’s not relevant to people.  National numbers of covid-19 are important news - and of course, people want to have a general view about how the pandemic is evolving. But people also want to know how things are going on where they live. There were already dashboards and a pdf file from the Portuguese authorities with that info. But just numbers don’t make journalism. That’s why this news application was useful - because people got to have personalized information without losing context.  We also decided to create custom links for all 308 municipalities to allow people to bookmark and share on social media the article about the place where they live. Our analytics tool showed us that was a clever move since we saw an increasing number of people accessing the page using those custom links.  But, in my opinion, what works as a true indicator that a news application is useful for our readers is when we get emails from them asking questions. In this case, apart from people that truly believed that the text was not automatically generated and sent us e-mails asking if we had information about a specific place inside that municipality, I got some people asking if we could update the data - I was running the script that exported the .json file manually and uploading it to our FTP server, so there were days that the data got updated a bit later than usual. When the Portuguese authorities stopped publishing local data daily, there were a lot of readers who sent me emails asking Why we stopped updating it. "," Since the data was being published in pdf files by the Portuguese authorities, I’ve used the tabulizer R package to turn it into a CSV. Because those pdf files also had some inconsistencies - for example, names of municipalities were sometimes abbreviated and other times not - that parsing needed to be manually checked daily.  Because I was the one developing the news application, I used R to transform the data into a .json file that fed everything on it. All the calculations, data joins and other data transformations were done using R and the tidyverse family of packages.  For the news application, we used vue.js and its reactive features to do everything on the browser. This allowed me to build a tone of “if-else” rules to build the customized text. The fact that I was the one doing the data transformation with R helped me because I was the person who knew what values the .json file was returning and how I could use them to turn the text more personalized.  For the data visualizations on the project, I’ve used the chart.js library. "," When you build a news application that aims to deliver a customized news piece for the reader, the biggest challenge is to generate a text that doesn’t feel robot-made. A ‘feel in the gaps” approach is not enough, not only because the text is only updated in the gaps, but also because data is messy, and things can get complicated. This was the hardest part - to write a compelling text that didn’t feel like it was generated programmatically.  To tackle this issue, I’ve used a complicated set of ‘if-else’ rules to turn every text a bit differently according to the data. To give you an example, in the first paragraphs the selected municipality gets compared with the ones that saw the biggest increase in covid-19 cases for the last 7 days. But when you select one of those three municipalities you need to highlight the fact that a specific municipality is indeed among the three municipalities with the biggest increases - closer to the other two. Because we often see text as a non-dynamic thing it’s hard to think about all possible outcomes that data can lead you to.  Adding to that you also need to take into consideration static and grammatical rules. For example, in Portuguese, almost every object has a gender - including municipalities' names. So I had to create a database just to know what word I should use to refer to a certain municipality.  But probably the hardest part was the end. Portuguese authorities decided to stop publishing data daily, which made all my code useless. To adapt the news application, I needed to write all my R and vue.js code from scratch. So we needed to stop updating it. "," I believe this work is a perfect example of how much personalized news can be meaningful for people. As I said before, readers let us know how important this piece was to them through social media and emails.  The covid-19 brought us a pandemic of dashboards - places with numbers and some data visualizations about the situation. I have nothing against dashboards and they can be very useful, but we need to take in consideration that people like to read the news, not to stare at dashboards. In an ideal world, a newsroom should have the resources to write 308 personalized news pieces about every single municipality - or at least have a strong local press that would do that. But that didn’t happen here and code was the solution. So we needed to at least make sure people didn’t feel they were reading a text that a robot just wrote.

Kyrgyzstan,azattyk.org,Big,Participant,How the parliament and government of Kyrgyzstan copy-paste Russian laws,26/06/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Politics","Scraping, CSV, Python"," In Kyrgyzstan people often said that deputies plagiarize Russian laws. I analyzed all the texts of Kyrgyz laws and found out that it's true. I scraped all 1277 texts of laws of the last's convocation of parliament (from 2015).  I removed technical documents such as audit results, reports or renaming of villages. I found that in 40% of 805 new and complementary laws there were articles that are similar to Russian laws.   There is also a chart that shows how many laws each deputie initiated and the average % of his/her copi-paste.   It's made in Instagram-story format with animated charts. "," People became more aware of how untenable was the last convocation of Parliament. Journalists rised more questions about why deputies copy-pasted Russian laws and how it affect on Kyrgyzstan.

For visual part I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AMP stories with Flourish charts. "," The hardest part were cleaning and finding plagiat in 911 712 words in 6248 articles. I made script that worked 2 days straight to pass that amount of text data using API. Due to the fact that laws are legal texts and are often similar, it was difficult to find a minimum percentage of similarity of texts to call it plagiarism. We decided to call the article from the law a plagiarism if it has more than 40% of similarity with the Russian article. Less were minor copies and were not included in further analysis.   I made all charts in flourish-story and used JavaScript to animate them accordingly the current number of the amp-story component. "," This project looks great on mobile and desktop, visual part was made using little JavaScript and AMP components that are similar to pure html tags. Beautiful charts were made without any coding.   Also it's not necessary to use machine learning, neural networks and NLP to find plagiralism.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,How the world lost 1 million lives to Covid-19,26/09/20,"Explainer, Long-form, Chart","D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV"," Eight months after China recorded its first death, more than one million people had lost their lives to Covid-19, a disease that has touched every continent and shows no signs of abating.    In an effort to convey how the virus spread across the globe and triggered waves of devastating deaths in different regions, we used a ‘stream graph’ data visualisation.    Guiding our readers on both mobile and desktop was not easy. We decided to use scrollytelling techniques to explain what was happening in each region at different times. "," Despite being a controversial data visualisation choice, we believe it was aptly suited to leaving a lasting and memorable impression while at the same time conveying the waves of death toll for each region as they occured at different times.    It was discussed by popular data viz experts, including Alberto Cairo and Javier Zarracina. This earned us recognition in the global data viz community, placing us alongside WaPo and El Pais for one million death coverage.    We were also approached to talk about this chart by Jon Schwabish of PolicyViz for a series he is launching in 2021 called “One chart at a time”. ", We used D3 and scrollytelling techniques to create the stream chart and smoothly tell the story over time. ," Getting the streamchart to work on mobile. Originally, we were going to use it from left to right across the page but quickly realised this wouldn't work for vertical screens.    Also, we were very concerned that the full impact of this chart wouldn't be the same on mobile. But, we think in the end, the narrow tip that is China's first wave leading into the enormous waves of deaths in other regions still has impact for mobile readers.    We also struggled to justify if this was the best chart option for what we wanted to show. We ended up choosing it because our focus wasn't on comparing deaths between regions but looking at the timing of the 'waves' of death which occured at different times throughout the year. "," Visualising lives lost: Data is the main focus for this piece as it aims to show the true context of how the world reached one million deaths. In one view, the reader can see which regions saw the heaviest losses.    Humanity in data: This is a tragic story. Sensitivity was paramount. We tried to use neutral yet informative language and add key photos to illustrate what was happening in each highlighted country.    Focus on Asia, in a global context: It was difficult but important for a paper like The Straits Times to explore the patterns of deaths for places in Asia and compare this with what was happening elsewhere.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,How to flatten the curve? What other countries experiences reveal,05/04/20,"Explainer, News application, Infographics, Chart, Health","Animation, Scraping, Json, CSV, R, RStudio"," Flattening the curve became probably the most influential and most important chart of 2020. At the beginning of the pandemic, everyone was using that term, but we at Público felt that people didn’t understand why it was so important. That’s why we developed this scrollytelling article where people could understand a little better what that meant and what the data across the world showed us about it. ", This story went viral on social media. Portugal had registered the first cases at the beginning of March and numbers were increasing in April. So the timing of this story - that using scrollytelling techniques explained the little we knew about Covid-19 and added contextual data about how the situation was going on in other countries. That helped people understand better what ‘flattening the curve” meant and what was going on in other places - like Italy and South Korea. ," To gather the data, I’ve used R and the Our World In Data dataset that provided the numbers for all countries. For the Portuguese data, and since the Portuguese authorities kept publishing the numbers in pdf files, I used the tabulizer package to convert the data into csv files. A few days after publishing this work, which we wanted to update daily, the Portuguese authorities changed the pdf where the data was being published and started using the data from a group that was transcribing the data by hand and putting it in a github repository.  The scroller relied on scrollama.js and all the charts use chart.js library.     Since I was the one doing the data transformation and the data visualizations, I used R to generate the json file that feeds the data to the charts. "," Getting the Portuguese data was hard because of the technical problems I’ve talked about before. Keeping it updated was hard because the data transformation needed from pdf to csv daily.  Since this was a scroller, it was also hard to keep information concise. "," This was one of my first interactive features at Público.

France,Le Monde,Big,Participant,"How, despite the travel restrictions, French top CEOs traveled in private jets to reach their resorts",14/10/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Breaking news, Cross-border, Database, OSINT, Satellite images, Business, Health, Crime","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python"," Le Monde had access to the flight data of some 800 aircraft transiting 50 of France's main business airports and some 15 foreign equivalents between the start of the French lockdown on March 17 and the end of travel restrictions on June 1.   Among those flights, we found out that several CEOs used their private jet to reach their resorts and thus not respecting the law. "," The autorities said they will do extra-checks on the travel reasons, after people were angry finding out the travel restrictions were not applied to CEOs.   Most of the top CEOs we named have asked not to be tracked anymore by the websites like FlightRadar, etc. (which we weren't using). "," Emmanuel and I used mainly Python and R, for the first part of the investigation : namely crossing the registration number of the jets that have flown during the lockdown with their registered owner (we scraped lots of national plane-owners registeries), or with other files (the Paradise Papers, Russian individuals and entities subject to UE restrictive measures, FAA Block list...).   After that, we also used Python and R to make a scoring of the flights that we should fully investigate : for instance flights that were leaving Paris on Friday and coming back on Sunday or Monday, suggesting someone was leaving for the weekend, or flights going to festive places like Ibiza or Cannes, flights that used jets (instead of big commercial aircrafts).   From the 800 flights we had at the beginning, we picked 20 flights to fully investigate (according to the scoring and the registered owner), and we investigated online (using osint, checking social medias of the people we thought were on the flight, findng witnesses who posted from the airport when an flight-of-interest was landing, using satellites images to check if the resorts were occupied by the owners, etc.) and offline (going in the field to find witnesses). This last step was necessary to check who was on the plane (because it's not always the plane owner). "," We found 800 flights to investigate. There was too many we could humanily check, so the main part of the work (and the most difficult) has been to find databases to cross the registration number of the planes in order to create a scoring that could help us find the ones that had the most potential to create a breaking news story. It worked, since, using this method, we found several top-CEOs using their jets to go get some fresh air during the lockdown, while saying they were travelling for important work reasons.   This kind of investigation would never have worked without open data (the radar data from ADSB-Exchange) and without our technical skills, since the private jet business is precisely selling its clients (top CEOs) the fact that no one will ever know the latter used their services. Human sources are very rare in this kind of environement. "," Other journalists can replicate our investigation in their own country, applying the same method as we did : getting data from ADSB Exchange, applying the same scoring method and then investigating each flight-of-interest using osint and field work.   The subject has not aged at all : the travel restrictions are more than ever in place. France just announced it would not welcome anymore most travellers from outside the EU, for instance.

Peru,Convoca.pe,Small,Participant,Impunity and Death in Large-Scale Mining Camps,18/12/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Audio, Environment, Health, Economy, Employment, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," The report shows a hidden truth in the mining industry in Peru, which bases its operations on the labor of workers subcontracted through outsourcing companies. In the last 15 years, more than 60% of workers who died in work accidents were subcontracted. The data analysis shows that the most important mining companies are in charge of the mines that concentrate the majority of worker deaths and are also the companies that violate labor safety regulations. In addition, after analyzing databases of the Prosecutor's Office, we found that the investigations into these deaths are archived without finding those responsibles. "," The report was highlighted by the Federation of Mining Workers of Peru and by the Federation of Mining Contractor Workers–—organizations that have taken our report findings to demand from government authorities and mining companies better safety-health and working conditions. This took place during the mining strike carried out in December 2020.   When confronted with the findings of this publication two government officials from the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Energy and Mines stated that outsourcing companies should operate within the framework of the law. Authorities also indicated that formal complaints are processed not only by the corresponding government departments but also by other entities that work in coordination with regional and local authorities.    In an interview on the local radio station RPP,  Presidential candidate and former congresswoman, Verónika Mendoza also criticized that large mining companies have their workers in precarious situations that put their lives at risk, for which she proposed a new regime that ""stops the abuse of outsourcing.""   Even though mining is an economic activity that moves millions of dollars, the majority of workers are still subcontracted through outsourcing companies—companies that ignore the precarious working conditions workers endure.     It’s also important to highlight that the mining industry exercises great control on the political arena and perhaps it’s one of the sectors that has the most lobbyists in Peru. Because authorities argued that mining was imperative for the economic development of the country, mining companies in our country never stopped operating during the pandemic even though the lives of  hundreds of workers were at risk.      This investigation has exposed for the first time an issue that the media has never covered. "," The research was based on the analysis of data that we obtained from Peruvian government entities in charge of overseeing and regulating the mining sector such as the Ministry of Energy and Mines (Minem), the Agency for the Supervision of Investment in Energy and Mining (Osinergmin) and the National Superintendency of Labor Inspection. By analyzing these data using Excel dynamic tables we identified information that gave rise to the investigation including the companies that registered the most deadly accidents in the last 15 years and the highest number of sanctions for violations of health and safety regulations.   With these data we were able to identify the number of accidents and their annual evolution. Subsequently, we added to this data files from Peruvian Prosecutor's Office that show where mining companies that registered the most fatal accidents are located. This information was then taken to datasets that allowed us to identify the status of each investigation. We found that the vast majority of cases were archived without finding the responsible parties.   Additionally, we interviewed family members of the workers that were victims of accidents, and we also contacted both government and company officials.    To visualize the data, we use the free Infogram platform where we try to portray the main research findings in the form of interactive bar and line graphs. "," This is the first time that a team of Peruvian reporters has systematically exposed government entities’ ineffective control and fiscalization on hundreds of fatal accidents involving mining workers in the last 15 years. This issue required an in-depth investigation to expose the magnitude of the social consequences as a result of one of the most powerful economic activities in the country and an absent government.    By applying investigative journalism techniques, going to the scene of events to collect testimonies, and analyzing several databased and officials documents, our team was able to expose a precarious situation that has resulted in hundreds of fatal accident and death involving mining workers.    The underlying goal of this project was to tell a compelling and powerful story in an effort to show the world how a system––where large mining and outsourcing companies and government officials are involved––continues operating at a great social cost.    We started working on this investigation during the Covid-19 pandemic, which hindered the work of our reporters that had to travel hundreds of kilometers from Lima to the Andean provinces of Huarochirí and Oyón where the Alpayana and Buenaventura mining companies operate. Yet collecting relatives’ testimonies was necessary in order to humanize data and collect more details about the incidents.    In addition, in the case of the information obtained from the Supervisory Agency for Investment in Energy and Mining (Osinergmin), Convoca.pe managed to deal with the secrecy of that entity that for weeks avoided delivering the information requested. After several attempts, however, we were able to obtain the data containing the list of the mining companies that were sanctioned for violating occupational safety and health regulations. This information was imperative to the project to confirm the profile of the mining companies that register the highest number of sanctions. "," Our work evolved as we were able to access data throughout the investigation. The first data we obtained was from the National Superintendency of Labor Inspection (SUNAFIL) where–after a process of filtering and cross-checking information–we found penalties for violations of labor legislation; some of them related to fatal accidents. This preliminary finding led us to access the records of fatal accidents in large mining companies in the last 15 years (2006 to 2020) through public information requests.   We also filed several public information requests from Osinergmin inquiring about the registration of sanctions against mining companies for violating safety and health regulations. After analyzing this information we found that mining companies with the most fatal accidents that had subcontracted workers were also the same companies that registered the highest number of sanctions for safety violations.   In the last stage of the investigation, we strengthened our data analysis work with information from the Prosecutor's Office on the status of investigations related to fatal accidents in mining units. We believe that it is important to make a progressive evolution in terms of data access in order to delve into the preliminary and last findings of the investigation.   After finding out about the foreign investors in the mining companies involved, our team decided to translate the investigation into English. Therefore, we also recommend that journalists should make the effort of translating their investigations in an effort to reach bigger audiences in the countries where mining companies headquarters are located in.

India,Business Insider,Big,Participant,Inside Kashmir's 'Invisible' Transgender Community,16/10/20,"Video, Business, Women, Human rights","Drone, Google Sheets", Kashmir is one of the hardest places in the world in which to be transgender. Not only does the community face discrimination but heavy restrictions imposed by the Indian military and now by the coronavirus pandemic are making life especially difficult.  , The video piece was largely produced and filmed for the United States audience so that the unheard voices of the transgender community from Kashmir can be told to the outer world.   The project had a great impact after it was released this year - many activists started talking on the trans issues and supported them in many ways which gave hope to the community despite they face discrimination and threats from the conservative society of Kashmir.  ," We used multimedia tools - like camera, recorders and got data from a solitary transgender activist who has been working on these issues for past many years.  "," This project was really hard to produce and film on the ground as Kashmir has been surrounded by the conflict for decades and with the coronavirus lockdowns it became very hard for us to film and interview the transgender members.        Apart from that, while filming we were stopped multiple times by the Indian military forces who keep harassing journalists and filmmakers in Kashmir as they want to suppress the voices coming out from Kashmir. Kashmir was last year put under a strict lockdown and all the means of communication were snapped. While filing the footage to our producers in London, it took us 3 days as we had no means to high speed internet and got a wired connection at a friend's house from where I filed the footage.  "," In the world, the transgender community have been neglected for years and journalists hardly report issues faced by the community.

United Kingdom,Birmingham Eastside (Birmingham City University),Small,Participant,Investigated: the UK construction companies in breach of the Modern Slavery Act,09/11/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, OSINT, Business, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, Python"," 'The UK construction companies in breach of the Modern Slavery Act' is a long-form investigation that explores how many UK construction companies do not comply with the Act, by not publishing a Modern Slavery Statement. The investigation includes the case study of one of the major hot spots of modern slavery in the construction sector: Indian brick kilns. The story also examines the poor quality of the statements that are published, and the failures of the Act to hold companies to account.  "," In response to a Freedom of Information Request, the Home Office acknowledged that their approach to organisations identified as not having published a statement was under active review and that they were also considering potential future changes to section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015. The investigation was picked up by NGOs such as Anti-Slavery International, Hope for Justice UK, Slave-Free Alliance, and Sustain Worldwide, among others.                                                                                                                                                                                   "," For this investigation, I gathered original data using automation and web scraping (Python), data analysis (R) and Freedom of Information Requests.    I wrote code from scratch to find and scrape the websites of these companies (over 1400 websites)  to check if they had published the statement, (as required by law), and if they had, to extract it and store it in a dataset.   The main problem was that I only had the name of the companies, not their website or any other data.     Task:    1- First, I needed to find their websites.   2- Then, if found, scrape the statements from their websites and store them.     Solution:    1- Automation combined with web scraping using Python (the code on Github: https://github.com/Liana1708/Web_scraping_companies)   2- Data cleaning and analysis of the scraper results using R, as well as data preparation for a second scraper.    Method:     The scraper imported a list with the names of the companies. Using Selenium, the loop iterated through each one of the company names, automating the following tasks:   1- Type the name of the company in the Google search box.   2- Look for the company's website and click on it.   3- Inside the company's website, it looks for the Modern Slavery Statement, and if it finds it, it will return the link. If it doesn't find it, it will print 'No document found'.   4- Return a list of company names, websites accessed and links to the statement, if found.       After the data cleaning and analysis in R and running a second scraper, I built a dataset with the links obtained.                                                                                                               "," I had thousands of textual sources (modern slavery statements), distributed on different platforms (two statement repositories and over 1400 companies websites), in inconsistent ways (different parts of the website, under links with different names, etc.). The automation process was not completely effective or reliable. On many occasions, it failed to find the company's website and scraped a wrong website instead, on others the statement was not where the law required it to be (in a prominent place on the page), and the scraper failed to extract it. Moreover, although companies are required by law to publish the statement on their website, there are two other repositories for these statements: TISC Report and Modern Slavery Registry, and many companies do not publish it on their website but in one of these repositories. In order to state categorically that a company had not published the statement, it was necessary to check that it had not been submitted to any of the three websites. In addition to the technical difficulties, there were legal limitations, such as the prohibition of scraping the TISC Report website. The first step to address this was to ask the organisation directly for the data, without success. The only possibility here was to manually enter the name of each of the more than 1400 companies in both repositories and build a database with the results for each company. Finally, I cross-checked both datasets -the results of the web scraper with the results of the manual analysis of both repositories- and obtained the final list of construction companies in breach of the Act.     "," Although time-saving is a major advantage -the scraper performed in hours a task that would have taken weeks-, the success of the automation process was partial. When faced with unstructured data, the technical difficulties can have a major impact on the investigation, resulting in inaccurate and unreliable data; which needs to be confirmed and complemented by the human. Without manually searching and cross-checking the information the data would have been unreliable. For some years now, there has been a debate in the industry about whether AI tools could jeopardise the future of the profession, by replacing journalists with news generated entirely by AI.  However, I believe that particularly in investigative journalism traditional reporting to obtain data as a complement to automated processes will continue to be fundamental, as well as the role of the journalist as an interpreter of the information once it has been obtained.   I conducted all the interviews from the UK using Zoom, adapting myself to the lockdown restrictions. The interviews with the workers rescued from bonded labour in India were the most difficult to coordinate and carry out. Firstly, because of language barriers (they only spoke Hindi and it was necessary to have someone else translating from Hindi to English). Also because of physical and technological obstacles: Amid the pandemic and lockdown in India, workers lived in remote villages and did not have smartphones. Collaboration with a local NGO that works directly with survivors was key. They contacted the workers and provided them with smartphones in offices near their villages in order to facilitate the interviews. They also functioned as translators.

Even after releasing data, statistical estimations from census data show the numbers are grossly"," ""It is true: even in death we are invisible"", told me after the piece was published a 23 Mayan teacher in southeast Yucatán. He participated then in the writing of a manifesto, gathering with other indigenous activists. They have not finished it but hard data evidence of structural racism is often needed by this kind of organizations.   The piece, written by me for Data Critica and edited by Quinto Elemento Lab, was selected as part of the best of Data Journalism by the Global Investigative Journalism Network in January. During that month in Mexico it was taken by national broadcasters W Radio, the Mexican Institute for the Radio, Radio Educación an in national television by La Octava. It was also later on published by NBC Universal spanish arm Telemundo and the spanish outlet ElDiario.es, in addition to the 8 mexican investigative and independent news outlets that originally published in Mexico.             "," I used the techniques of automated data extraction from the federal open data Covid-19 repository, which was updated daily; scripted in R, and then also using R I weekly compared the evolution of several proportion statistics, detailed below. I also used the technique of joining two databases based on location of the municipalities, which I got from a different census data, as it was not provided in the original Covid-19. Finally, with the guide of a statistician, I calculated an estimation of percentage of indigenous deaths by municipality using the indigenous population for each of the +2400 in Mexico.   For the two groups death rate (indigenous vs .the rest of the population) I calculated confirmed Covid-19 deaths crossing four different variables that informed about positive Covid-19 cases and the column that informed a death date. Then I used the only available indicator of ethnicity in the beginning, indigenous language spoken, to calculate the death rate comparably between two different groups (speaks indigenous language vs. doesn't) From the beginning death rate between indigenous speakers was higher, but not enough data to make an inference was possible until september.   By that time a Mayan nurse informed me of the case of his friend, which I found in the database using her description (as of course no name is on the database). I found that she was not registered as speaker of indigenous language (she couldn't speak because of a disability) and some months later a new variable ""appeared"", the one that officially records if a person acknowledges themselves indigenous, which legally in Mexico is enough to be considered so.   Data wrangling and cleansing, and interactive visualizations using Shiny were also used for the final dataviz outputs. "," The hardest part was to give up the initial finding about the higher death rate between indigenous languages speakers, because there was just not enough data, and then going beyond the database to its construction. I interviewed the government official in charge of this information who finally admitted to have been removing ethnicity data, using the argument that it was personal data (just as other demographics like sex, age, conditions, if the person speaks an indigenous language, it was not personal).   But again the hardest part was to go beyond the data, speaking to a statistician who suggested using the official percentage of indigenous population per municipality as proxy for the proportions of indigenous people that could have died in Mexico and comparing it with the unbelievably low official records.   Then explaining all of this, with its uncertainty limits, and threading it with the personal story of Luis Cauich, who saw her indigenous friend invisibilized from the database for 6 months after her death, was also hard. "," In investigative journalism it is of the utmost importance to restrain to publish the first finding that come right out the data, if we want to do justice to the real picture beyond the data. This I would consider the most important lesson. Then there are more technical capabilities that can be learnt, Mexico maps are not readily available in freemium software like Flourish and others, so coding the way up to geographic visualizations using R becomes a great solution to this visualization. The use of shiny Rmd documents also I want to teach to fellow journalists in Latin America.

Israel,Independent/Twitter,Small,Participant,Israeli Election Results - Mapped,06/03/20,"Explainer, Map, Elections, Politics","QGIS, CSV, Python"," Due to a unique data-related complexity, Israeli election results have never been mapped accurately beyond municipality-level. Data analysts have produced approximations and journalists have explored specific neighborhood-level stories, but only a combination of journalistic research into the election mechanisms and a painstaking analysis of the datasets - partly inaccessible to the publich - enabled the creation of a detailed, granular, and accurate results map. This project entails both the map, which was updated live as results were released, and a map-based story that introduced these results to international readers. "," The main impact of the project was the proof that such an analysis is possible. Journalists have used the map for their reporting or reported on the map. In the long run, this project will hopefully set a new standard for election mapping in the Israeli media, where this practice is still immature. More importantly, repeating it in three election rounds in 2018-2019, during which the authorities recieved the same inquiries over and over again, could lead to the understanding that the necessary datasets should be released to the public. ", The core of the project was data analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. For the production of the resulting map I used Plotly's Dash and deployed it as an independent Heroku site. For the story that presents the map and the political crisis that unfolded after the election I used Mapbox and its scrollytelling templates. ," The hardest part was processing the data. In fact, the simple result - in many countries banal - of an election map by neighborhood, hides a complex system completely unknown to anybody outside a small circle of officials managing the elections (who, interestingly, did not think it was possible to conduct this analysis).   In this system, votes can be mapped to geographical units, polling stations, and polling places (which often include several stations). Results are provided by polling station. Shortly before election day, in cases where there were big differences between the number of votes allocated to different stations within the same polling place, all voters' lists in that polling place were joined together and re-divided equally between the stations. (The purpose was to minimize queues.) This process is called ""balancing."" Since different stations within the same polling place can serve different geographical areas, these must merge on the map - because there is no way to determine where the votes in the joined list stemmed from.   This complicated process of reversing the ""balancing"" must be conducted recursively, since balancing occured in many polling places and led to the merging of several areas that were themselves already a result of merging, and so on.   Perhaps the only thing that was harder was to grapple with the results themselves, which left the country in a hopeless political deadlock... "," 1. To continue when they hear ""impossible.""   2. That a lot can be done by implementing projects that are common in one place and rare in another, like an election map.   3.

Botswana,The Midweek Sun,Small,Participant,Journalist Neo Kolantsho,14/10/20,"Investigation, Corruption, Crime",Microsoft Excel,"The story was firdt published in A former high ranking government official is implicated in a corruption saga worth millions. The man is accussed of using his power and status to benefit directly from lower structures he was overseeing without openly declaring his interests. Millions have gone missing and there is no guaranteee they will ever be recovered. Meanwhile the former boss has his finger prints all over the crime scene and the matter has been reported to the Directorate on Corruption and Economic Crime, Botswana. Paragraph 7 words in italics.Direct quote translation. ""Let us not be jealous of the"," The story opened eyes to those in power that there are consquences to abuse of power when in office.It also served as a warning to many others occupying high positions that irregardles of who you are, there is no excuse to corruption as it negatively impacts on country development.   Most importantly, the project  served as a reminder of what corruption in office does to the community. Projects remain stagnant and poverty escalates while money is gobbled up by those trusted with power to change lives for the better. The story has assisted other government officials to keep an open mind and device ways of ensuring that financial issues are handled with utmost care and transparency where possible. Loop holes at the particular organization have been identified that enable issues of corruption to easily crop in. This has led to the current boss at the organization admitting that there is need for policies to change in the near future to curb as it had now proven that there might be a deeper financial rot lying undetected.   Also the public has been sentisized on the worrying and increaing corruption issues that happen even at government level. This means stakeholders will in future hold officers accountable and demand transparency when it comes to governmemt funds. The relevant ministry will equally in future do a better job of detecting issues of funds embezzlement at the earliest time possible. The story has also through interviews conducted helped the law officers speed up their investigations on the matter as the story unearthed information which was not readily in their possession. "," I conducted several interviews to gather information for my story. The story sought to expose an alleged corruption rot at a high government office and many issues had to be taken into consideration. First and foremost the implicated persons were of high ranking and whose reputation could not afford being soiled without cross checking facts as the consequences would have been far reaching. Interviwing all those close to the matter gave insight on what could be true and what was false, this also gave me a chance to observe emotions and the atittude towards the corruption saga.  Finding neutral sources also came in handy as they had no reason to lie but present the truth. I also researched to find out more about the people I was interviewing or including in my story. I also familiarized myself with the law to know what is likely to happen should the accused be found guilty. All this was done by reading documents which spoke to issues of corruption and abuse of office when in power. This helped build a solid story that  did not only seek to expose but also educate. I also did an independent investigation by perusing the registrar of companies (CIPA) documents to see if indeed the accussed person and family was implicated in the financial rot and indeed I was able to uncover the truth which was cleverly hidden by creating many confusing but similar company names that threw investigations if not paying attention to details.   The acussed had intelligently taken advantage of the registering of companies systemm in Botswana to hide that he owned shares with the company that had been beneffiting from an organization he was heading without declaring his interests.     ","Gathering information from public officers is not an easy undertaking in Botswana. They are sworn to secrecy and not permitted to divulge any information to third parties without being authorized to do so. This meant finding smart but lawful ways of gathering evidence once the whistle blowers had whispered into our ears. All I had was allegations that needed verifications to prevent defaming the accused and even possible lawsuits. This meant strategizing on how best to get those with information to speak up, without connections or a close relationship with those that had information it was l This meant softening them up and getting them to trust that their identities will not be exposed at any point. It was not an easy undertaking as they feared for their jobs, all was a risk, this meant they had to be extra careful. We met at odd hours and strange locations to ensure that they are not seen exchanging envelopes with journalits. They also demanded on not being recorded or filmed, They were not comfortable with calls and opted to use separate phones for communication, not those linked to their day to day lives. This was to eliminate any chances of it all backfiring on them. This posed double trouble for me as i had to work harder to ensure that they are not selling me a fake story in persuit to destroy or soil the reputation of an innocent man. This meant having to dig deeper and cross checking facts with more than one source. I even had to sneak in at one of their meetings to get the information first hand. Though journalists are usually invited to listen in during some of their meetings, with this particular meeting that discussed the possible embezzling of funds, an invitation had not come"," I believe this story can help other journalists reliaze that the media is considered a watch dog. It is part of our responsibility to ensure that we guard against economic decay that go on to affect development in our country. Our country president speaks about eliminating corruption on a daily basis and is such stories that open his eyes and others of what is happening right under their nose. That even those trusted with power have to account for every single money poured towards organizations in an effort to improve the livelihoods of Batswana.   Also the media has of recent been accussed of accepting bribes to shelf stories which try to expose corruption and other ills. Reporting on this story and not bowing to pressure or intimidation was also a way of encouraging other journalists to write more of such stories that call for change and review of laws and policies.    As a young female journalist, my strory was also meant to send a message that women are equally capable of investigative reporting, a beat that is often associated with men because of its risks and complexity. Women are often abused by story subjects both emotionally and physically.  It also never easy to face off with a highly ranked official especially when presenting them with allegations of corruption that directly implicates them.

Botswana,The Midweek Sun,Small,Participant,Journalist Neo Kolantsho,06/11/20,"Politics, Women",Microsoft Excel,"The story of a young female politician who is trying to make it in the dog eat dog political space. She is bashed on a regular basis for her approach to issues of empowering women. She one of those fighting for women to be recognized, she advocates for women to be heard and even see them occupy leadership positions even at parliament level. She has been labelled a feminist, an empty vessel and a whore, Acussed of sleeping her way to the top but she remains rooted to politics. She once spent a night in a holding cell but still","The story was trying to reach out to women and even men to create an environment where women can freely join politics, a field that has for the longest periods been associated with men. Kgosidintsi's political ambitions are testimony that women are capable of joining politics, Despite the harsh environment, there is need for women to be represented at both parliament and cabinet level to enable them be part of decision making processes. During the 2019 general elections, only three women were elected to parliament, this was not a case of them losing but because only a few had contested for the elections. Despite winning and making it to parliament, female politicians are constantly bashed and ridiculed, they even cry abuse on several occassions. This is casting fear that more women will continue to shun politics, labelling it brutal and a man;s world. Kgosidintsi's story is meant to encourage other women to fight for what they believe in and not be intimidated by obstacles encountered. Her story is also meant to inform those in power what it is they need to do better to help women rise. This comes at a time that Botswana is trying hard to achieve gender equality and do away with issues of denying women equal access to jobs, sexual violence and exploitation. Traditionally, a girl child is expected to stay home and take care of the home, cook for her husband and bear children. The story spoke to Kgosidintsi's parents to learn how thry raised their child. Why she is so outspoken and not 'reserved' like women are expected to. This has also assisted other parents learn that they need to raise a confident girl child who is not afraid to speak their mind and not deemed disrespectful. not talking has resulted in women being"," When gathering information I conducted interviews with my story subjects. I also tried observing emotions when addressing the issue of women joining politics. I also did telephone interviews with my sources.Once the story was out it was posted/shared on social to enable it reach more people. I also researched to see what has been happening with women wanting to join politics and using that to prepare questions for the people I interviewed.   I also watched live procceedings of the daily parliamentary proceeding to get a feel of what happens in parliament and how people are responding to comments, subtractions and opinions coming from female politicians versus male politicians. "," Kgosidintsi is labelled controversial. It was not easy getting her to open up and talk. She has had her own share of bashing and she is not blind to it. On several occassions she is forced to check if she is not overdoing it because she has dreams of one day becoming a leader. Although she has a bold character, she also has to stop and introspect first. Thus it was not easy for her to speak her mind, she was forced to watch her tongue or hold back information which she felt might subject her to further public scrunity. It took much convincing to get her relaxed and let her true self speak. Her parents were also skeptic to comment, wondering if they will not be opening up another can of worms by having her life splashed on newspapers like that but they understood that it might actually do them good than harm. Many people are confused when it comes to the role of media in society in Botswana, journalists are seen as enemies who are quick to splash people's dirty linen in front pages, thus, it is very hard to do interviews locally,  just the mention of being a journalist has many walking away. "," There is need to have more stories similar to that of Kgosidintsi out there, there is need for aggressive efforts to ensure that women are actively involved in politics. Journalists should learn to refrain from portraying women as sex objects or pretty faces and actually try engage and interview those who have newsworthy stories to share. The media should strike a balance and try divorce the notion that for a women to be successful, there has to be a man behind her.    It is true sometimes  that women get alarmed by journalists's choice of words and pictures used, one example is that of one female politician who was referred to as a castrated bull here in Botswana. The newspaper used a picture of a bull but used her head instead and showed the castration detail. Meaning she is behaving like a man but the only difference is that she does not have what they regarded as an important detail that defines  a man.   Moreover there is also need to have more women reporting on politics, currently there is only one or two females reporting on politics countrywide. This adds to the worrying numbers of women shunning politics while men continue to make decisions for them.

The recall vote marked the first special municipality mayor to be successfully recalled in Taiwan's history.    "," This project served as a live vote results and analysis page for Mayor Han Kuo-Yu's recall vote. As the vote was being reported, this project became a highly visited and shared website for people following the vote results. In the topmost section, Commonwealth Magazine published the two conditions for recall, the most important information to our readers. Following the vote results, we included a map breaking down the votes by district, and then further compared the results with Han's electoral results from his previous elections.   Because Mayor Han achieved notoriety in his bid for the presidency six months earlier, Commonwealth Magazine realized that this vote would also be of interest to a more international audience. Thus, Commonwealth Magazine was also able to reach both a domestic and international audience by publishing in both Chinese and English.   In 2020 alone, Commonwealth Magazine ran four different live vote trackers, quickly establishing a name in Taiwanese media for reliable, quick, and clean elections results reporting online.    "," This project was powered by a live data API provided by Taiwan's Central Election Commission. Commonwealth Magazine built a live elections pipeline to connect the data to our readers, allowing readers to see results on their devices as soon as they were updated. Open source tools including D3 were used to create the maps and charts on top of our internal Svelte.js interactive graphics library which Commonwealth Magazine has developed for visual storytelling.    "," The hardest part of this project was planning the information and analysis would be most informative to readers as the vote was being tallied while being completely unsure of how citizens of Kaohsiung would vote and turn out. This challenge prompted us to work closely with our politics reporters in order to understand the small nuances and potential implications of each vote result. Ultimately, voters who turned out voted overwhelmingly in support of recalling Mayor Han, consequently rendering our district map completely yellow and thus not a very useful display of information.    "," One of the big lessons from this project is that live vote tracking requires not only technical and visualization skills, but also a strong collaboration with the political reporters within the newsroom. If the team responsible for creating the live vote results doesn't collaborate closely with political reporters, it's easy to create a page that displays the results but may not be as useful to the reader. Because elections usually represent some underlying political issues, it's important that election reporting, including live results pages, consider these political issues and how they may affect turnout, geographical differences, etc.    ",https://web.cw.com.tw/recall-han-en/index.html,https://web.cw.com.tw/recall-han/index.html,,,,,,,"Rebecca Lin, Johann Tsai, Chen-Hua Chen, Andy Lin, Daniel Kao, Yu-Ting Huang, Yu-Hsin Lee"," The team consists of one product manager, one data journalist,  one front-end developer, and two web designers.

We analyzed the company’s annual reports from 1996 to 2020, used leaked audit reports that the public had never seen/heard off. The documentary is timely as there is legislation in Kenyan parliament to nationalize the airline. "," Some of the major corruption, mismanagement and embezzlement the documentary uncovered include; the purchase of airplanes through a Special Purpose Vehicles registered in Cayman island a popular tax haven, the directors/owners of the company are unknown as the SPV’s are owned by another company which is owned by ‘unspecified charity organization’. One of the SPV was used to purchase 10 Embraer Jets at increased cost of over 400,000 USD each, costing the airline 40 million USD.   The documentary also revealed how one finance officer colluded with officers from Dubai bank to embezzle funds from Kenya Airways through repatriation of foreign currency without authorization. The officer and his wife benefited from the deals as the bank deposited a total of 22 million shillings to their personal accounts.     We also revealed the unbalanced joint venture between Kenya Airways and KLM Dutch Airlines, where KLM had 2 members on the board of KQ who had veto powers in. This led to KQ buying old technology from KLM among them two planes at a cost of 2 billion shillings which KQ sold after 5 years at a combined cost of 210 million shillings.

We then used Microsoft Excel in analyzing the data, creating a time series and visualizing bar charts of the data. We also used Datawrapper to visualize the graphs.     The other technique we used was interviews with various individuals among them former and current staff members of the airline, financial analysts and aviation experts       ", The hardest part of this project was access to the data as some of the financial reports were not public and some were hard copies scanned and saved as pdf by the company. Collection and analysing that data was a daunting task for the team.   The other major challenge we faced was access to Auditors Reports that we understood coud give us explanations for some of the loopholes that we were noticing from the financial reports.   ANother challenge was getting people to speak about the issues we had raised from the analysis of the financial reports of the company , Our major basis of this investigation stemmed from analysing the financial reports of the company from 1996 to 2019 and through that we learned a lot of factors such as mismanagement and embezzlement in the company which led to our investigations.

Apart from the 20 judges, one constitutional judge resigned because of his ties to Marian Kocner, one bankruptcy trustee, three lawyers and four other people were arrested.          Slovakia’s police chief and the head of its financial crimes unit both resigned following <a href=""https://www.occrp.org/en/unfinishedlives/questions-linger-after-indictment-in-slovak-journalists-murder"">media reports</a> that information about Kuciak in police databases had been accessed prior to the murders. As an indirect impact of the project, eight top officials including two police presidents were put into custody.          A prosecutor was suspended after footage leaked to OCCRP appeared to show him setting up a camera in what looks like his office with someone who appears to be Kočner. He was later charged with abuse of office. Slovak Office for protection of private data threatened investigace.cz with 10 000 000 eur penalty if they wont reveal a source of the footage.  ","  We set up a room in Bratislava with five laptops with immutable operating systems that would have access to the data located on a remote server. After we’d managed to upload all the material, we made a cleanup copy of it, unpacking all contained evidence and removing unnecessary and system files. We started a process of identifying key pieces of evidence in the folder hierarchy, linking them into an easy-to-use reporter’s desktop and documenting the meaning of the material as we discovered it in a wiki. Eventually we indexed key portions of the material into OCCRP’s data platform, Aleph.

That need for accountability resulted in particular from the presence of sensitive personal information of the victims and the accused in the data, as well as the existence of unpublished political kompromat (e.g., video of the minister of finance making back-room deals).         The volume and nature of this data forced us to study and apply multiple digital forensics techniques in order to make the material accessible to reporters. It has also given us a more systematic understanding of how experts in related fields — especially law enforcement — handle evidence.          Another challenge was coordination of the team of journalists from various competing media. At the end, the team coordinated deadlines, shared their findings and helped each other in unprecedented ways. The impact of publishing the investigative stories in all major media at the same day multiplied its effect on audience and really created public pressure for a change.

Hungary,"ATLO, Átlátszó",Small,Participant,Koronamonitor - A járvány adatai grafikonokon (English title: Coronamonitor - Tracking the pandemic through maps and charts),13/03/20,"Explainer, Database, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," Based on the relatively limited daily data published on the Hungarian pandemic website koronamonitor.gov.hu, Koronamonitor aims to point out correlations and information laying in hindsight that the Hungarian government fails to do themselves. Updated every morning, Koronamonitor is an ongoing project of Hungarian two-person data journalism team ATLO. First published days after the virus appeared in Hungary, it has gone through several changes, with diagrams added as the pandemic changed or new information became available. It includes not only informative charts, regional maps and international comparisons, but an interactive virus simulator developed specifically for the site, as well. "," Since the Hungarian government's pandemic-tracking website offers little to no analytical information, to many citizens, Koronamonitor became the number one source of daily data about the pandemic, offering descriptive and analytical charts based on the text-based data appearing on the governmental website each morning. Many of the changes on the site over time were based on the feedback of our active follower base. During the first wave of the pandemic, the need for understandable and easily-accessable data was vital. This was also visible on the numbers: the site reached one million downloads by the end of June 2020. Altogether, the site was accessed a total of 2245000 individual times, averaging at a daily 10-11 thousand visits.   Internationally the site was considered one of the ten most impactful and important data visualization project related to COVID-19 of 2020 by datajournalism.com. We have been honored to be mentioned among legendary newsrooms such as Financial Times, The New York TImes or The Washington Post.  "," The site itself is largely based on easily accessible and user-friendly online tools such as Flourish or Tableau. Many of the main charts are created in Flourish, utilizing the tool's automatic data-updating system when connected to and external Google Sheet document. After the daily data is published on the governmental website, they need to be manually put into the Sheet document, that Flourish recognises and updates the charts accordingly.   There is also a more analytical, in-depth tool utilized at the beginning of the site (called ""Explorer""), one based on the app by Vizzu. That chart offers an easy breakdown of the changes of infected, recovered patients and victims. Moreover, it is offers user interactivity, allowing changes to the chart such as addig or subtracting certain categories.   A bigger development on the site's history was the addition of a custom-made interactive virus simulator, that is capable of predicting the actual peak of the virus based on complex mathematical calculations from the available data. It also offered user-interaction, allowing them to change parameters using the sliders, that can affect any variable such as number of victims based on the lethality ratio of hospitalized patients. "," The site compiles data that is published on the official governmental website tracking the coronavirus pandemic (koronavirus.gov.hu). Unfortunately, the official data is infamous of being incomplete, not sharing data that was investigated multiple times to be available to governmental bodies but purposefully hidden from the public. The official site is thus incomparable to any of Hungary's neighboring countries (such as Slovakia), where governments handle the pandemic with transparency, and share downloadable datasets presented on interactive charts.   Based on this problem, the hardest part of Koronamonitor is the amount of data available. Many of the calculations had to be made by our team in order to get a better understanding of the situation. Still, there are information that can never be calculated, simply because they are not accessible to the public. To mention one, the governmental site updates regional total cases (by counties), but does not do the same with either regional active cases or does not break it down to a more detailed level of cities and settlements. These data were gathered manually from locally shared data, which gave a partial picture on the situation, but later the magnitude of the second wave made it impossible to compile this data.   It is vital to mention that ATLO, the creator of Koronamonitor is a two-person project. ATLO being established by Attila Bátorfy in 2019, it is now run together with Krisztián Szabó, who is a data journalist. The minimalistic size of the data team is nevertheless very much influential in the Hungarian data scene, with high user interactivity and many collaborative projects with bigger companies (such as the Municipality of Budapest, the capital city). "," From its easy-to-consume style to its critical thinking, Koronamonitor is a popular site among readers (based on the number of views), critically acclaimed (based on the datajournalism.com list we have been included in) and a personal achievement for the ATLO team as well. We learned a lot about reader interactivity, how to handle and incorporate user feedback, which most of the time was beneficial for the site. Thus, creating a sense of community. A critical acclaim was an elevating ending to an otherwise stressful year, giving us international feedback that the work we had done was very much so worth it. For the team personally, the daily task of updating charts and data taught us endurance and vigilance, as data was sometimes incorrect on the governmental site, and with the help of our community, we were able to shine light on these discrepancies. Our task was to be a beacon in the darkness, crated by the pandemic and worsened by the government's resist of making data available.   Hungarian journalism can learn from the site, and see that data visualization stories can be told simply yet in a powerful way, be stylish while retaining a minimalistic approach. As this field of journalism is not as well developed as in the West (such as in the U.S.), we hope to be a good example to those newsrooms who are slowly incorporating charts to their data-based articles.  ",https://atlo.team/koronamonitor/,https://atlo.team/koronaexplorer/,https://atlo.team/koronaszimulator/,https://atlo.team/nemzetkozijarvany/,https://datajournalism.com/read/longreads/covid-19-data-journalism,,,,"Attila Bátorfy (main), Krisztián Szabó (main), Tamás Nepusz (simulator), László Horváth (simulator), András Kangyal (Vizzu Explorer), Péter Vidos (Vizzu Explorer)","  Attila Bátorfy  is a journalist and data visualization expert working at Átlátszó, the first crowdfunded, independent investigative journalism center in Hungary, and head of project of the graphic team ATLO.

What kind of money? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,24/06/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Chart, Corruption, Health","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV"," The government of Kyrgyzstan was planning to spend $645 million on the COVID-19 crisis. Almost all that money is either international aid (both grants and credits) or voluntary donations. However it is offering no detailed information on where the funds are going. Officials say they do not have opportunities to track where do they spend money for COVID-19.   Compounding the issue, the country’s public procurement law was quietly changed in the middle of the crisis to ensure still greater secrecy.   This project is an attempt to understand how the Kyrgyz state authorities spend money to fight against coronavirus. "," The main impact is that Kyrgyz authorities have started to report information about the spent money. They started to publish information about received state body, purpose of payment and etc on the website covid.kg (there are still not enough details, but is already a good step).   After a while, a commission was created, which began to monitor the distribution of money received to fight the coronavirus. The commission concluded that the money was not used for its purpose and had been stolen. "," The only technology was writing script by programmers to scrap the help.covid.kg site. All other things (design, data viz) was created by free online tools.  "," The most difficult thing was to get a response from the authorities.

The area has been one of the focal points for the war on terror and continues to suffer from the effects of the conflict and years of neglect before that. Due to the operation in 2014 alone, about 929,859 people from north Waziristan were forced to flee their homes, becoming Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). After the conflict. Those returning to the area, felt the stark difference in connectivity is leading to deaths. "," After covid-19 hit Pakistan the situation of internet services in tribal areas got highlighted, students were campaigning on social media to highlight connectivity issues at that time, I took my journalistic responsibility and gathered data on issues faced by tribal women under covid-19 tribal areas do not have proper hospitals, with staff overburdened in the limited health facilities that do exist. <a href=""https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30284241/www.tnn.com.pk?p=eyJzIjoiMHFMMl9MRDBwUDNPTVl3ZUlGS1NBR3ZESlRrIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDI4NDI0MSxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy50bm4uY29tLnBrXFxcL3NvdXRoLXdhemlyaXN0YW4taG9zcGl0YWwtaW4tbGFkaGEtd2l0aG91dC1iYXNpYy1mYWNpbGl0aWVzXFxcL1wiLFwiaWRcIjpcImM3NzhkYWY2NmE2NzQ2ODE5NmVkMGM1MjNiZWQ0N2QwXCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiYTg2MWQ1ZjcyZjFlZWUxNzdlODhiNTIzYzA0OWQ4MjI2MDRlNjBlYlwiXX0ifQ"" target=""_blank"">News reports</a> over the years have documented the difficulty most residents have in reaching healthcare in cases of emergence, poor communication infrastructure makes it even more difficult for residents to call for health care service I interviewed many people including local journalist Raziya Mehsud she revealed that   “The whole world is using different techniques to fight with COVID-19 through the internet but many of the tribal women do not even know about COVID-19, If a woman dies of COVID-19, she or even her family don’t know what has happened to her.”   Raziya added that where people in other countries are using the internet to innovate during the pandemic, find solutions to social, medical or political problems that have risen as a result of lockdowns, people in Waziristan are still looking to the government for basic connectivity.   The article was published in Digital rights monitor followed by a live session, which created enormous response people of Pakistan started asking the government about health facilities in former fata and other tribal areas, which weren’t having internet facility to be able to held government responsible in the time of pandemic. The article made rounds on social media which pressurized government think to for tribal people, medical teams and kits were dispatched for tribal areas in a very short time. I humbly state that this article saved many precious lives in Pakistan which were vulnerable in covid-19. "," I used data wrapper to create visualization while editing this particular piece for Digital rights monitor. I visualized group of people who left Waziristan and then become IDPs. I also used investigative dash board, data bin and zup these technologies were quite helpful regarding data investigation.  "," In Pakistan A few hundred kilometers from South Waziristan’s capital, Wanna, lies the small town of Ladha. A picturesque mountainous area, it’s not the sort of place where one would expect to find proper roads and health care facilities. Ladha’s green mountains and snow capped peaks, could be the envy of many, but like other places in the former tribal areas, very little is known about it. There are no cell phone towers or internet connection that would make it easier for residents to connect to the country or the rest of the world. For women this makes voicing themselves, even more difficult, due the cultural and social constraints they already live with. When pandemic hit Pakistan At first I tried to connect them through cell phones to record their narrative but it wasn’t possible for me to reach them so I took a drive of almost two days and reach there but interviewing them was another hurdle. Women have no voice patriarchal society haven’t left them voiced it took me a month convincing them to speak. The area is still with military so I was under observance too which was another hurdle, I reported daily to the in charge of that particular area, Waziristan was occupied by Taliban before operation in 2014 so being there as journalist was risk to life, travelling was also very challenging as roads weren’t carpeted and people do live in higher mountains so in order to interview women of the area I also hiked for hours. I hold prestige of recording the voice of the area where no other journalist went under pandemic. "," I am data journalist but I didn’t rely on data provided by internet only, I chose to investigate the reality by minnig in field that also endangerd my life, I know it looks silly specially in Pakistan where recently a women journalist got killed, but this is our profession and it is the way it is. The story of the pain I took for this specific piece dosen't ends here, Pakistan is under strict censorship, so I also convinced the publication to publish the piece which told the world that, The gender digital divide can have fatal consequences for women, those living in areas without cellular coverage or internet cannot at time seek basic healthcare, and now I have curatted data for other data journalist.

Lab tests showed that 25% of the fish was not good quality: the fish was so old the rotting bacteria levels had grown over the limits. Another big problem we encountered, was that it’s really hard to find out when the fish was catch. When asked, the sellers often told the day they received it. Time between catching and receiving can be anything up to 10 days.

We FOIA’d lab tests the nation health inspectors had done to supermarkets to test the quality of fish the previous year.

The collection was made daily and diligently.No other vehicle in the country, the second most affected by Covid-19 in the world, has managed to give the dimension like that map. More than 100 journalists were involved, in a kind of task force that became the G1 brand.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Participant,Mapping COVID-19 in each Spanish municipality,09/04/20,"Breaking news, Database, Map, Health","D3.js, JQuery, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio"," Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, data about cases in a local level has been arduous to reach. At elDiario.es, we created an exclusive database of COVID-19 cases in each municipality of Spain and presented the data as an interactive map that is updated once per week. To build this project we collect the data from each of the 17 regions (more than 5000 municipalities) Spain has, who publish the data in different formats. This publication is performing a public service  that neither the government or other media outlets are doing.    "," During the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, only six Spanish regions were activly publishing the data of coronavirus cases registered in their municipalities. The  publication of our map, our persistence calling each regional goverment everyday and the request of our readers for more data influenced the goverments to start publishing this dissagregated local data.   The publication of our map works as an early warning systema for citizens and authorities, who can notice if the situation in their city is dangerous before all its region is affected or the global indicators published by the government can portray the danger.  Moreover, the data is published in an aggregated way and this allows comparisons between cities. The weekly ranking of coronavirus incidence in the main Spanish cities is one of our most shared charts week after week (even by other news media, as seen at link 3). Even city council members has shared the publication to raise awareness on the the situation in their cities or are surprised by the data we published because their local goverments are not delivering the information as fast as we are doing it.      "," Every region publishes the data in a different format and they even change it over time, so we had to design different ways to gather and convert it. Some regions make the data accessible using xlsx, csv or pdf files, but others publish it on visualizations (charts or dashboards), so we must get creative to find the source of the data and extract it from the code behind. As we do the same process each week, we designed a reproducible way to collect, clean and check the data and we centralize the results in a shared spreadsheets book.  We use the weekly collected data to obtain incidence rates per inhabitant (to be able to compare between municipalities) and to calculate the change in time, using our database built in the previous weeks. We even have used this timeseries to publish other articles about the evolution of coronavirus in a local leves, as can be seen in link 2.  The main result of our data collection process is a map created using Mapbox and D3.js, which shows in different tabs the absolute number of cases, the cases in the last 14 days per 100.000 inhabitants and the evolution of the pandemic in every municipality. We also publish a chart ranking the coronavirus incidence in the top 100 most populated cities and a table to ease the search.    "," The main importance of this project is that this collection of data can’t be found anywhere else. Neither the government makes it publicly available nor other media publishes it. And, despite each individual figure that we publish for each municipality can be found on the regional sources, nowhere else other than our map can the data be found in an aggregate and comparable way.  Behind the map and the different charts there is arduous work to find the data sources, collect, clean, aggregate, analyse and visualise that elDiario.es’ team has been performing every week since April 2020. In the meantime, we also kept asking the regions that didn’t publish the data to do it and even the government who, despite having this data, is refusing to publish it.      "," Persistence is maybe what defines this project better: during 2020 we have updated this map nearly 40 times. Thanks to this, every week more and more people (including other journalists) were waiting for the new data and relied on our map.   To be able to repeat the process every week, organization and a reproducible workflow were basic. It included annotations on changes and on the specificities for each region and also verification steps.    ",https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/mapa-casos-confirmados-coronavirus-covid-19-espana-municipio-26-de-enero_1_1466396.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/casos-bajan-estabilizados-2-3-municipios-consulta-evolucion-incidencia-covid-19-localidad_1_6444577.html,https://twitter.com/raulsanchezglez/status/1248170841638141953?s=20,https://twitter.com/raulsanchezglez/status/1301523737070776320?s=20,https://twitter.com/raulsanchezglez/status/1331342277340520450?s=20,,,,"Raúl Sánchez, Ana Ordaz, Victòria Oliveres"," Raúl Sánchez: Spanish data journalist covering stories of inequality, gender, corruption and Covid at elDiario.es.

We focused on the Irrawaddy dolphin, an endangered species that inhabit the Balikpapan Bay and the Mahakam River. They have faced threats over the past decade, including oil spills, increasing ship traffic, and fishing activities. Through interactive charts and maps, this project explains and visualizes the threats that the Irrawaddy dolphins have faced and how the new capital will threaten their habitats even further. This project was funded by the Indonesian Data Journalism Network and the"," This project helped to increase awareness to Indonesians about the Irrawaddy dolphin population and how the development of the new capital needs to be more sustainable and take into account the habitats of the Irrawaddy dolphins and other marine and freshwater animals. It generated a lot of interest on social media, because it's the first time that anyone has ever done a comprehensive, interactive and very visual explanation of East Kalimantan's most beloved icon. While the Irrawaddy dolphins are very well-known in East Kalimantan, many Indonesians aren't aware of their endangered status. Since we were able to get the project published in Kompas, one of Indonesia's largest national newspapers, we brought awareness to this issue to people outside of Kalimantan. In addition, we are also working on an English version of this story to be published very soon on Internews' Earth Journalism Network, one of the organizations that awarded the grant for this project. "," We gathered data from various sources. One of our main data sources was from the Rare Aquatic Species of Indonesia (RASI) foundation, which was the only organization that has a comprehensive dataset of the Irrawaddy dolphins and other aquatic species living in Kalimantan. They do frequent surveys and sample counts, so we were able to get GPS data from their surveys to plot on the map. After plotting the coordinates, we were able to find several communities surrounding the dolphin habitats for a reporter to visit and get first-hand accounts. RASI also provided us with other datasets such as recorded aquatic deaths in the Balikpapan Bay and Mahakam River, which is important to show how industrial activities are a huge threat to their habitats.   We also wanted to map the most recent major oil spill event that happened in 2018 and how much damage it brought. Thankfully, we were able to get shapefiles from satellite imagery from Indonesia's national space agency (Pusfatja LAPAN). Then, to show just how close the proposed new capital is to the dolphin habitat, we also mapped the three proposed zones for the new capital. Finally, we requested data from MarineTraffic for ships coming and going through Balikpapan Bay and Mahakam River. All the geospatial analysis was done through QGIS, and the presentation was done through Mapbox and its scrollytelling map template. We also visualized other data such as causes of deaths and using D3.js. The whole page was built using The Texas Tribune's data-visuals-create kit which works well with ArchieML-formatted Google Docs, where the text lives.     "," One of the hardest parts of this project was working remotely in the middle of a pandemic. This was a collaboration like no other, made possible by a reporting grant from the Indonesia Data Journalism Network (IDJN) and Earth Journalism Network (EJN). Two of our team members, the reporters are based in Samarinda, East Kalimantan, so they were able to do on-the-ground reporting. The designer/developer is based in Jakarta, so we did all the work virtually and have never met.    The second challenge was in gathering the data from different sources, since there are no comprehensive datasets yet other than RASI's surveys, and we wanted to gather more data on the habitat threats. Keeping track of the different sources we talked to was a challenge. And once we did get the data, it required lots of processing and cleaning since some weren't in a very clean format. It was also hard to do everything within a month, which is the deadline given by IDJN and EJN for the project's completion.      "," Collaborations like these are so important, especially in a country like Indonesia. We have reporters everywhere in the country, but we don't often collaborate with each other on a cross-city cross-island basis. In this project, we were able to pool skills from everyone in the team, and it didn't matter where we were based. It's also important to have reporters on the ground to verify our data reporting. We had one reporter travel to Balikpapan to the communities surrounding the bay to verify what we're seeing in the data. And finally, visuals matter. So many stories had been done on the Irrawaddy dolphins, but none have been as comprehensive, complete and visually appealing as ours.

Mexico,NoSinNosotras.com,Small,Participant,"Mexico is not ""pro-life"": It's machist and pedophile - #TheHardData",22/05/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Breaking news, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Business, Culture, Women, Health, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel"," Pregnancy termination is such a stereotyped issue that 59% of the mexican population would incarcerate women who have had a miscarriage… in a country where 14 out of every thousand women have had a miscarriage.   This happens because we have built a distorted image around chosen reproduction and sexual freedom; however, when we subject the pregnancy, marriage, contraception, and birth indicators to statistical analysis, we find a reality of fewer ""irresponsible women"" and more about ""male rapists"".   And that's where we have to look when we speak of abortion: at men. "," After applying big data to the 32 criminal codes of the Mexican Republic, as well as to all open government information on the exercise of maternity/paternity in the country, we found that Mexico still legally allows men to establish sexual relationships with girls up to 12 years old and to marry minors.   This cuases that 1 in 6 pregnancies are the product of a rape, women make up 78.28% of the people who are forced to live as a couple during childhood, and 1 in 3 male adults force the first sexual encounter with minors, highlighting the problem of the pedophilia.   The debate on abortion then ceases to be an ""ethical"" issue to become one of social security, legislation, criminalistics, and health, which is why at least 126 national and international organizations have already incorporated the findings of this study into their information records after they were published.   Likewise, when disaggregating the main myths around the chosen reproduction and all the causes that criminalize abortion in the 32 states of the Mexican Republic, we discovered that there are territories where saving the mother's life is paid with jail, only 3 of every 100 men have a vasectomy, and about 32 adoption requests are made in Mexico, per year.   Therefore, the ""pro-life"" discourse falls apart, resulting in this research going viral until it reached 505,360 impacts in just a few weeks. "," The most complex of these investigations was to analyze the 148 crimes contemplated by the National Census of State Justice Procurement, with victims and perpetrators, for 32 states of the Republic and full national compilation, generating a total of 9,768 variables.   Taking into consideration this volume of data, I generated an Excel formula that allows us to automate the exact disaggregation of men and women who are accused of crimes in the Mexican Republic, their degree of kinship with the person attacked, and the numerical proportion on territories with the highest crime incidence (per crime).   Once I automated these figures, it was quite easy to apply the principles of UN Women, Oxfam International, and CIMAC Press to build narratives with a gender perspective, modeling the indicators under a simple but powerful reading that directly impacts the language:   Because it is not the same to say that ""33,981 women are sexually abused every year (as if they were asking for it)"" to express that ""31,558 MEN are raping young girls and women in a yearly-basis"".   Subsequently, I modelized the data with a non-sexist perspective using Adobe InDesign for distribution on social media, allowing me to generate master degree research’s in less than a week after the story exploded on the agenda-setting, maintaining novelty, temporality, and validity among digital communities to the extent that some of this data was used in iconoclasm and local protests all around the country. "," Much of the debate on the legal interruption of pregnancy in Mexico focuses all reproductive capacity and responsibility on women, who, although they can procreate once a year, are the most criminalized group of people for the exercise of their sexuality.   The main challenge of the study was to direct, for the first time, the gaze towards men that abandon their children, men who ask to “legalize those of 16”, men who do not use contraceptive methods, and men who are exempted from the sentence due to abortion, all in a simple manner that could be interpreted in an agile way by the general population.   By bringing this large volume of statistical data and legal case records closer to the public, it is possible for us to build up actions from within the empathy and offer an accurate panorama that is based on facts (not opinions) to exercise free and informed sexuality, promote safe and legal contraception, and stop pedophilia by making it visible and palpable. "," If the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to do something, it is to learn new skills and abilities to “do more with less” in record time.   It is not necessary to have large newsrooms, budget increases, state-of-the-art technology, predictive tools, neural networks, and machine-learning protocols to tell stories that captivate our audiences, encouraging them to make the immediate transition to an increasingly just, empathetic, and informed world.   Very humbly, I allow myself to invite all of our invaluable information professionals to dare to “make things happen” and, from the powerful platform that social media provide us, launch in-depth investigations in real-time that will serve the public that really needs us: common men and women who are truth-thirsty in a country that ranks second in the world of #FakeNews distribution.   If a team of only one person can do it from a living room apartment, zero budget, and one-week deadlines with half a million impacts, I am sure that my colleagues, with much more preparation than myself, will be able to generate even more robust results.   Let's make it digital, let's make it simple, let’s make it quick and, most importantly, let's make it useful.

That's how many passports Russian authorities issued to foreigners between January and March in 2020. It's more than twice the number that the country issued during the same period in 2019. In April 2020, President Vladimir Putin also signed a dual-citizenship law that estimates suggest will attract up to 10 million new citizens. Why? According to the most pessimistic scenarios, Russia's population might drop by 12 million in the next 15 years and Putin has made reversing the country's demographic crisis a major priority. "," The project helped our English speaking audience to better understand the demography crisis that Russia is dealing with. When Russian President Vladimir Putin assumed office, Russia was losing around half a million people each year. While the country has been trying to boost fertility rates and implement special programs for families, perhaps the most successful strategy has been attracting migrants, whose arrival helps Russia to compensate population losses. According to some studies, Eastern European countries are among those with the least-accepting attitudes towards migrants, yet inviting people from other countries seems to be working for Russia. The microsite reached more than 100k people on our Facebook page and it was later translated to two other languages (Kazakh and Tajik) so it reached an even bigger audience.

Everything was published from March 17 to December 29, 2020. "," Following the release of our story on exploitation and illegal gravel mining from BiH rivers, the private companies involved in these activities did not have their contracts extended.  Based on facts presented in the stories, the competent inspectors announced pressing charges and launching the investigations of the Ministry of the Interior.   Following our story about illegal construction and illegal land clearing in the BiH Olympic mountain Bjelašnica approved by the local municipal government for the purpose of constructing a sports center, the Sarajevo Canton Government stopped co-financing od the project worth EUR 1.3 million. The competent inspection authority fined and pressed charges against the company which not only conducted clear-cutting but also illegally sold the timber logs.   According to collected data, in the period 2015-2020, owners of the private power plants have been paid at least EUR 100 million in incentives for power generation from renewable energy sources. The huge sums of money monthly paid by citizens through their electricity bills have turned power generation from RES into a lucrative business with little investment and a lot of harm to the environment. The investigation revealed that citizens are not at all aware of the fact that they have been paying these incentives through their electricity bills. Following the release of the story, citizens launched an initiative on social networks calling a boycott against the payment of these fees. "," Invoking the Free Access to Information Act, our journalists collected thousands of information about the topics they investigated.  The information was analyzed and used in developing the stories. They visited nearly one hundred locations relevant for the topics they covered and did dozens of interviews with relevant parties.  For five video-stories that were released in support of the same number of investigative stories, we taped materials at the relevant locations using cameras and drones, and well as photos that are presented in 4 photo galleries. Also, each story is supported with info-graphics providing a snapshot view of relevant information, while one for one story we produced a video i.e. graphic animation.  All the material we collected was pooled in two publicly available databases used for the development of investigative stories.   The stories, video-stories, and animations were developed using available databases as well as on-line real estate registers in BiH and countries in the region.   The database titled “Incentives for power generators from RES” provides data on incentives paid to generators of electricity from renewable energy sources. It is a searchable database that enables querying data using filters to find specific information on the period and amount of incentives. In the same way, one can find information about the name and type of plant that received incentives, their owners, and the amount of energy generated.   The second database titled “Protected areas in BiH” provides data on all 39 protected areas.  Along with the descriptions, there are also specifics on each area, activities that are allowed and forbidden, documents and photographs of protected areas as well as the description of their current state and illegal and harmful activities being performed in them. The database includes an interactive map of BiH with the marked locations of all protected areas. "," CIN reporters are investigating stories by looking at all aspects of the topic, trying not to leave any important question unanswered in the published text. The investigations take several months and the large body of data collected is published not only in the stories but also in other formats such as databases, video stories, infographics, photo galleries, and short videos. When investigating and analyzing the collected data, journalists use all available technology tools.   All published data underwent rigorous fact-checking, and each claim and piece of information undergo multiple verifications. In the 16 years of its existence, CIN published nearly 1,000 stories covering very sensitive topics, but not a single defamation, false or misleading information claim against CIN resulted in a final court verdict against it.  CIN journalists persistently fight for free access to information because institutions often deny access to the requested public information. CIN journalists are unique in that they sue institutions and exercise the right to access to information through the courts. So far, CIN won 12 cases against institutions that failed to comply with the Freedom of access to information Act, the last one being that in 2020. Also, journalists spend a lot of time in the field and are often the target of verbal and physical threats and various pressures from the parties involved in the story.    Hard, dedicated, and professional work does not go unnoticed. Based on CIN’s stories, four investigations were launched in 2020 alone. Four persons whom we proved to be involved in corruption were remanded in custody, three indictments were filed and 6 persons were replaced, suspended, and sanctioned. Convictions were handed down in two cases. "," In the course of the investigation, CIN reporters collect a huge amount of data and not all the data ends up in the final investigative stories. This is why CIN publishes them in various forms. CIN has published a total of 20 databases, of which two as part of this project. They contain thousands of verified information and authentic documents that institutions try to hide from the public. These databases contribute to the transparent work of government and public bodies and preventing corruption.   Also, they are being used by fellow journalists from other newsrooms as a relevant source for writing their stories, news, and TV stories. Data from the databases developed as part of this project have already been used by citizens, environmental associations, and fellow journalists in their activities, which is a great example of how an important topic for society remains active long after its initial publication.   Similarly, CIN tells stories through photo galleries that contain dozens of photos that tell their story and testify and draw public attention to targeted issues. In the same way, our video stories make sure that the topics we cover reach a wider audience. Our video stories are being aired by TV companies or adapted to their information and other shows.   With currently available on-line tools, fellow journalists can also tell their stories through infographics, a format particularly useful in presenting the complex topic.   We know that our colleagues in BiH and the region are tied up in defamation lawsuits, which dulls their edge because they spend time, money, and energy on these cases. CIN regularly promotes fact-checking as something that not only protects journalists and media against this problem but also gives them credibility.

United States,NA,Small,Participant,My Little Crony,09/11/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Corruption","Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio", My Little Crony is an interactive visualization of the connections between Tory politicians and companies being awarded government contracts during the pandemic. Users can explore this interlocking web for themselves and click through to read the underlying investigative reporting. ," While there had been a great deal of excellent investigative reporting on the procurement scandal -- typically by small outlets like Byline Times and OpenDemocracy -- it was receiving relatively little coverage by the larger newspapers and by broadcast media. I think that the main impact of ""My Little Crony"" was to bundle these stories together into one simple conclusion: this is cronyism.   ""My Little Crony"" was covered by the <a href=""https://metro.co.uk/2020/11/13/my-little-crony-map-shows-deals-between-government-mps-and-tory-donors-13587900/#metro-comments-container"">Metro</a> and <a href=""https://www.cityam.com/labour-calls-for-probe-into-covid-deals-between-government-and-tory-donors/"">City A.M.</a> and discussed on BBC Radio 4 and LBC.

I wrote op-eds for <a href=""https://bylinetimes.com/2020/11/13/what-i-learnt-about-the-great-procurement-scandal-building-my-little-crony/"">Byline Times</a> and the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/21/tories-covid-contracts-public-trust-government"">Guardian</a> describing how I made the visualization and why this procurement scandal matters.    Valerie Vaz, the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons, <a href=""https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-11-12/debates/D99D4A22-85F6-4297-8FF6-87EDCF67647D/BusinessOfTheHouse?highlight=little%20crony#contribution-FA294117-62BF-4B93-BDBA-86274981214D"">cited ""My Little Crony"" in parliament</a> and told her opposite number, Jacob Rees-Mogg, that it was ""well worth a look"". Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, <a href=""https://twitter.com/RachelReevesMP/status/1330553180065832960?s=20"">wrote on Twitter</a> that the visualization ""raises far too many links for the government to ignore"".    I encouraged users of ""My Little Crony"" to sign a <a href=""https://twitter.com/sophie_e_hill/status/1325810085055127554?s=20"">petition calling for a public inquiry</a> into public contracts awarded during the pandemic. While I can't make any strong claims about a causal impact (!), the petition crossed the 100,000 signature threshold a few days after ""My Little Crony"" was launched, meaning that it will be debated in parliament.       "," The first step in creating ""My Little Crony"" was to manually create a spreadsheet of the most important connections: firms owned by Tory party donors that won Covid contracts. I relied on excellent investigative reporting by outlets like Byline Times and OpenDemocracy to establish these links, as well as using data directly from the Electoral Commission and Companies House. Next, I began to flesh out this map by adding further links that give the reader important context: for example, the fact that Kate Bingham, the chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, is married to Jesse Norman, a Conservative MP and minister.   Once I had assembled this data, I created the visualization in R using the package ""visNetwork"" and deployed it as an interactive app with Shiny. The main challenge at this stage was trying to ensure the map was visually legible, even as I added more and more links. I experimented with different ways of conveying information in the visualization, like using icons to denote different categories of organization, color-coding the lines depicting contracts and donations, and scaling the width of the lines to indicate the value of the contract or donation.   I wanted the project to be completely open-source, so I made the underlying data and the code publicly available on <a href=""https://github.com/sophieehill/my-little-crony"">Github</a>. This allowed users to make suggestions about additional links that should be added to the map by filing a pull request on Github.   As the map grew larger and larger, I worried that it might become overwhelming to first time users who might not know where to begin. So I experimented with creating <a href=""https://twitter.com/sophie_e_hill/status/1325945290298417153?s=20"">short screen recordings</a> to highlight particular stories (a sort of low-budget animation!). "," For me, the hardest part of this project was the logistics. As a full-time PhD student, I originally decided to create My Little Crony as a fun side project -- and a useful distraction from nervously watching the results of the 2020 US Presidential election come in!    I certainly did not anticipate the reaction that this site would get -- in fact, the site went down several times in the first week when the server got overwhelmed. As an ""amateur"" data journalist, there were many important issues (like accessibility, mobile readiness, and potential legal exposure) that I hadn't given full consideration to. It was also difficult to balance maintaining the site with my day job of teaching and researching!         "," I'm not certain that I'm qualified to answer this question since I am not even a journalist myself!    But I think one important feature of ""My Little Crony"" was the idea of telling a  cumulative  story -- where users are first confronted with a visually striking map indicating significant overlap between political donors and recipients of government contracts. With this context established, users can then zoom in to view particular cases or hop from one node to another to explore the map. I think that this type of open-ended interactive visualization is very useful in allowing users to feel more in control, especially when faced with complex and somewhat abstract issues.

Bulgaria,"Bellingcat, The Insider",Small,Participant,Navalny's poisoning and Russia's Clandestine Chemical Weapons Programme,23/10/20,"Investigation, Breaking news, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, OSINT, Politics","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","By using open source information and the Russian black data market we were able to uncover the FSB team that poisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, the structure of the operation all the way to the top, and the clandestine chemical weapons programme of the Russian government. For this purpose we analysed large amounts of data - phone records, traveling information, et al., and revealed - perhaps in an unprecedented manner, certainly more widely then ever - the capability and the dangers of free flowing data, as well as the ways this information is used and sold by corrupted officials."," The story has been on the forefront of the world news and has major ramifications for Russia.    The project led to several calls for further investigations and sanctions. Our team has been called to testify in the British Parliament, The Council of Europe, and of the leading members of the US Congress has expressed a wish to summon us after the pandemic. The European Parliament has issued a motion where our investigation is explicitly mentioned as the cause for further action against Putin's regime. The latter has also commented on the story calling it a ""legalisation"" of ""foreign intelligence"" - on one hand proving its veracity, on the other unwillingly complementing our data gathering efforts to be at the level of an intelligence service.           "," Due to porous data protection measures in Russia, it only takes some creative Googling (or <a href=""http://yandex.ru/"">Yandexing</a>) and a few hundred euros worth of cryptocurrency to be fed through an automated payment platform, not much different than Amazon or Lexis Nexis, to acquire telephone records with geolocation data, passenger manifests, and residential data. For the records contained within multi-gigabyte database files that are not already floating around the internet via torrent networks, there is a thriving black market to buy and sell data. The humans who manually fetch this data are often low-level employees at banks, telephone companies, and police departments. Often, these data merchants providing data to resellers or direct to customers are <a href=""https://meduza.io/en/feature/2019/04/26/russia-s-stolen-data-industry"">caught</a> and face criminal charges. For other batches of records, there are automated services either within websites or through bots on the Telegram messaging service that entirely circumvent the necessity of a human conduit to provide sensitive personal data.    While there are obvious and terrifying privacy implications from this data market, it is clear how this environment of petty corruption and loose government enforcement can be turned against Russia’s security service officers. A few hundred euros could — and does — provide you with months of phone call data for an FSB or GRU officer, allowing investigators to trace the intelligence services’ operations, identify the colleagues of research targets, and follow the physical tracks of spies across Russia and abroad. "," Tugging on one thread will unravel an entire tapestry of cross-referenced data, eventually revealing how Navalny’s or Skripal's poisoning was planned and carried out by a team of chemical weapon experts and secret service operatives. Much of this data is available due to the negligence of the Russian government — it’s hard to imagine an entire city’s vehicle registration database with passport numbers, addresses, license plate numbers, and other data to be leaked online annually for anyone to find in Germany or Canada — as well as the sloppiness of the security services themselves.    That being said, those investigation put the journalists, as well as the main characters of our story - in this case Navalny - at great risk. The Russian security services may be sloppy, but they are nevertheless brutal in their vengefulness.  "," To underscore our credibility, Bellingcat employs a show-your-work approach, <a href=""https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/"">publishing exhaustive reports</a> that walk readers through exactly where our investigators got their data — including leaked records of private information — and how we analyzed it.   In many Western countries, the idea that you could shell out a couple of dollars in cryptocurrency to an automated messaging application and obtain someone’s passport number, cellphone metadata and vehicle registration seems astonishing, however not unprecedented as the phonehacking scandal with News of the World alluded to.    Journalists in Russia, however, have increasingly turned to the data market as a reporting tool, but the data they obtain doesn’t always tell a clear-cut story. The unreliability of such data is one reason Bellingcat does rigorous cross-checking, preferably connecting to a source we’ve obtained earlier than we started the investigation, before anyone has had the idea to poison the data. In the case of the Navalny plot, Bellingcat analysts turned to previously verified offline databases to back up their new findings.    Those methods of research, hypothesis, finding proof, cross-checking, analysing is extremely useful for every investigative journalist and most certainly holds the keys to the future of the profession.   ",https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/,https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2020/12/14/navalny-fsb-methodology/,https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/10/23/russias-clandestine-chemical-weapons-programme-and-the-grus-unit-21955/,,,,,,"Christo Grozev, Aric Toler, Pieter van Huis, Yordan Tsalov, Roman Dobrokhotov"," Christo Grozev is lead Russia investigator with Bellingcat, focusing on security threats, extraterritorial clandestine operations, and the weaponization of information.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,New normal: How far is safe enough?,01/07/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Health, Employment",Adobe Creative Suite," As the pandemic has reshaped our lives, an enduring effect is how we use and move through public spaces. Parks, restaurants, theatres all pose hazards for virus transmission, and governments are setting out new restrictions to make these places safer.   How big a change that is from our normal routine, though, can vary, even within the same country as personal space can differ depending on age or culture.   Reuters took a deep look into the science, research and data that experts were considering when designing the policies that will determine the new normal. "," More than half a year later and we are still wrestling with how the “new normal” will unfold.  Though many countries eased some restrictions we are still constantly negotiating what is and isn’t safe in each interaction, and each move through a public space.        The data, research and information in “The new normal” is just as important in negotiating each of these daily interactions now as it was in the first days emerging from lockdown.

United States,"The Appeal, The New Republic",Small,Participant,No Choice but to Do It: Why Women Go to Prison,17/12/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Women, Crime, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," For this piece, I conducted the first-ever national survey of women in prison for murder and manslaughter and learned that at least 30 percent are incarcerated for defending themselves or a loved one from physical or sexual violence. I interwove my findings and analysis with a deep investigation into the case of Tanisha Williams, a Black mother of three serving 20-40 years for taking part in a murder while her abuser held a gun to her head. "," My statistical analysis showed that a majority of my respondents had been abused, found evidence of racial disparities in sentencing, and showed that revictimization – both by partners and the state – was prevalent. I also uncovered deep trauma histories and identified patterns of systems failures long before the women were criminalized. Most notably, my initial numbers showed, for the first time ever, that, at minimum, 30 percent of those held in women’s prisons on murder and manslaughter convictions had been convicted for the act of protecting themselves or loved ones against physical or sexual violence.   My 8,000-word piece, published in December 2020, was widely circulated, and featured on Longreads, Longform, Politico, The Marshall Project, and Bloomberg News, among others. Law professors and attorneys wrote that they would be citing me, and the American Bar Association included the piece in their newsletter and on their site. The journalist Pamela Colloff called the article “groundbreaking,” and the activist and educator Mariame Kaba called it “a real public service.” Several people reached out to speak with me, including government officials and advocates in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, and New York. Through my reporting, the piece’s main subject secured pro bono legal representation by one of the top clemency lawyers for incarcerated survivors  in the US, as well as support from several organizations, including the Michigan Women’s Justice & Clemency Project at the University of Michigan, Survived & Punished, and the American Friends’ Service Committee’s Michigan branch. In January 2021, her lawyer submitted her clemency application, along with my article, to Governor Gretchen Whitmer. "," Through years of reporting, I learned from attorneys, educators, and advocates that abuse often played a role in the crimes of incarcerated women; and that a significant portion were serving time for defending themselves or a loved one. But there was no research to show the numbers. In order to find them, I decided to reach out directly to women in prison. In January 2019, with the guidance of a Yale political science professor, I designed the first-ever non-priming nationwide study of women serving time for murder. It was a simple 16-page survey that included 16 questions, as well as an area in which the respondents fill out their name, state, age, and race. For the purposes of the article, I gathered and analyzed 608 responses from a total of 5098 surveys sent to all women serving time on murder and manslaughter charges in 22 states. I read each survey and assessed abuse and trauma, as well as demographics, legal situations, etc. I coded everything by hand, and then entered those codes into an extensive Excel spreadsheet. I then hired a person with statistics experience to help run the data. He cleaned the data first, then ran correlations through STATA to look at relationships, and any promising correlations, then performed regression analysis. The method of analysis depended on how the dependent variable was coded.  "," The research for this piece was exhaustive, a nearly two-year process. As an independent journalist, I did not have a research assistant or the resources of an institution: I FOIA’d nearly 50 states on my own, followed up with them for months, printed surveys in batches, hand-addressed envelopes, hand-wrote the salutations, and signed each letter. For the purposes of this article, I sent out over 5000 surveys and received over 600 lengthy responses, often pages long -- because I did not prime the respondents, much of the key information was contained in their writings. I coded them by hand, and entered them into a spreadsheet; I had the statistics run by four different data scientists and fact-checked. For Tanisha Williams’ story, I FOIA’d the Michigan Attorney General, and then spent months combing through nearly 3000 pages of trial transcripts, as well as lengthy police files and background documents. I interviewed witnesses, family members, attorneys, experts, educators, and organizers.    No government entity keeps this data, or even necessarily recognizes the existence of such cases, and this population is regularly “disappeared” into prisons, their voices silenced and experiences erased by the state. This is the first-ever research project conducted to understand the depth and breadth of criminalized survival in women's prisons. Not only did it unveil the sheer quantity of women serving time for surviving, it amassed an immense amount of qualitative data about their lives and pasts. It was intended to be narrative, but also to be useful, and can be employed to shift policy and public perception. "," Data is not just for the people with polisci degrees or institutional backing, and data journalism doesn't have to be extremely high-tech or involve elaborate graphics; data can be used. Any journalist can learn how to employ data, as I did with this project. It is an especially important tool for helping tell the stories of marginalized people, who are so often dismissed, and for demonstrating the existence of an entrenched widespread issue. In my case, I was dealing not only with abuse survivors, who always face skepticism, but with incarcerated people, who are systematically denied their own narratives. There is strength in literal numbers, and so I was able to utilize data as a form of storytelling, as a way to support a larger argument, as a way to expose a structural issue, and as a way to center the voices of the silence.    This piece of work shows how a reporter can blend traditional, rigorous reporting and fact-finding with a unique approach to gathering information that is typically hidden or out of reach (especially when it comes to those who are incarcerated). It also demonstrates the possibilities for using data gathering in fresh ways, to bring forward new voices, to better center suppressed stories, and to make systemic arguments, all without relying on the permission of government officials or on larger institutions. The piece, which interweaves research and human stories, also shows how a deeply-investigated and beautifully-written narrative can humanize data, create a propulsive and emotional story arc, and expose the nuances and intricacies of entrenched injustices.  ",https://newrepublic.com/article/160589/women-prison-domestic-violence-survivors,https://theappeal.org/criminalized-survivors-survey/,,,,,,,Justine van der Leun," Justine van der Leun is an independent journalist, an author, and a fellow at Type Media Center.

The students are assigned duties and they go to school before school hours and do the cleaning work. Many girls drop out of school because of this and their education is suspended. This was a major problem for students in educational institutions which needed to be addressed. ," The purpose of highlighting this project was to draw the attention of the government to this issue so that the government would appoint a cleaning staff in the primary schools and not to take such cleaning work from the students. Pay attention, not only to reduce the dropout rate of girls, but also to protect them from the harmful effects of cleaning work on their health. However, in some schools, teachers have appointed cleaning staff with their help. The positive effect of resolving this issue will be that on the one hand, they will not work in primary schools. And the school environment will be better in education. There will be an increase in the focus on education so that girls can get education with confidence and on the other hand hundreds of illiterate women will get employment which will increase per capita income and will also have a good impact on the national economy. "," To highlight this project ۔ I collected government school data from various websites and found out the number of students 3. Information on the budget allocated for education in the province budget and especially for girls education was obtained from the official budget copy. I met with various stakeholders and sought their views and opinions ملاقات Met with students, parents, teachers, government officials, representatives of teachers' associations, provincial minister of education, representatives of government and social organizations working on education and took them on board. For all of this, I used various government and non-government websites ۶ WhatsApp group collects male information ٔ حاصل Get their pictures with the help of photographers All this information and data and typed in Urdu page (our national language) on personal computer بھیج Sent to Karachi head office for publication via email and WhatsApp "," The problem I had in this case was that the girls did not want to speak against the teachers or the school while they were in school, they were afraid that they would be expelled from the school or they would be beaten. And the parents didn't want to get involved. It was difficult to persuade them and talk to them on this issue. Even the teachers working in the schools were hesitant that we are employees of the government and their jobs should not be harmed if they speak against the government. Therefore, there were difficulties in incorporating opinions and data collection while the entire province consisted of 35 districts and for this purpose it was difficult to cover the entire province and collect data from different areas. It was a very important issue and it was very important to solve this problem because the future of this country depended on it. Was necessary   And a better solution was that when I tried to get his opinion from the provincial education minister, he made a commitment that he would look into the matter and that cleaning staff would be deployed in government primary schools. It was a great achievement that one of my stories would solve the problem of millions of female students and increase the percentage of education, especially for girls.

Nigeria,AFP Fact Check,Big,Participant,"Not all of Nigeria's external borrowings were paid off in 2007, as claimed, and neither was it totally debt free",02/01/20,Fact-checking,"Google Sheets, CSV","  Nigeria's debt is a common topic among critics in Africa's largest economy as the country faces growing debt to fund key projects following a recession in 2016.     This project checks the veracity of factual claims about Nigeria's debt by highly influential individuals in the country, including former president Olusegun Obasanjo; his vice-president, Atiku Abubakar; former aviation minister Femi Fani-Kayode; and former central bank deputy governor Obadiah Mailafia.     The report matters because   the amount of accumulated debt is often used to compare the performance of different political administrations in Nigeria.  ","  1. My fact-checking report exposes as false the claim by former central bank deputy governor Obadiah Mailafia that Nigeria had more than $7 billion debt in 2015.     Mailafia has since acknowledged this fact. In an article he wrote and published on Nigerian daily newspaper ThePunch, Mailafia stated that Nigeria owed $63.8 billion -- more than $7 billion as he earlier claimed -- in June 2015.      “Today, we face a rising debt burden. According to the Debt Management Office, as of June 2015, our total national debt was N12 trillion (US$63.8 billion),” he said.     https://punchng.com/the-revenue-crisis-and-challenge-of-government/ (15th paragraph)         2. The report raised the voices of Nigerians who had doubts about the claims by the four high-profile Nigerians but could not conduct verification or did not have the platform to disprove him.      ","  My report presented the evidence against the claim with the use of an infographic to compliment the written debunk. Infographics help to give a better visualization and understanding of data-driven stories. In the pictorial analysis, there are five sections addressing the major claims made by the public figures on Nigeria’s debt.     First we used an area chart model to depict the progression of Nigeria’s foreign debt including those owed to the Paris and London Clubs of creditors. Clearly,  we observed that while both debts borrowed from the two clubs terminated at some point in the chart, there is no trace of the external debt hitting zero (horizontal line), making the claim that Nigeria paid off its external debt (or entire debt in Atiku's case) false.     The same chart also shows Nigeria’s external debt reached a peak in 2004 when the nation owed $35.94 billion in debts -- this is way lower than the $83 billion external debt burden both Obasanjo and Fani-Kayode attributed to the country as of 2019.     Other sections show total public debt, debt accrued by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration based on different currencies and origins for insights. And for context, we included a section of the implication of growing debts using international debt sustainability standards of comparing debt amount to the economy size and also to revenue generation.  ","  The hardest part of this project was collating the debt data from Nigeria's Debt Management Office (DMO) from 1985 to the first half of 2019, and also presenting it in a digestible format.     The National Bureau of Statistics releases debt figures on a quarterly basis, making it difficult to monitor the trend over a number of decades and drawing reasonable conclusions from the dataset. I had to extract and compile these rough debt figures for Nigeria  in a sheet before proceeding to applying some features on the Infogram tool  to improve visualisation.     I think the project should be selected because it does not only expose the falsehoods about Nigeria's debt but also adopts a creative approach to telling a data-driven story.      ","  Other journalists can learn data visualisation as an alternative way of telling complex data-driven stories. They can also learn how to make data more appealing to readers by using tools such as Infogram, Infographia, Flourish and many others. These tools have different features that could help to capture most of the messages you're trying to pass across in one chart. It becomes very interesting when the reader can interact with the charts just as we have it in the project, it builds loyalty and makes stories more compelling to read.

Brazil,UOL,Big,Participant,O Oscar deles,09/02/20,"Database, Arts, Culture","Google Sheets, Python"," Based on the construction and analysis of a database on the biggest awards in world cinema, this report shows how Oscar has always had a predisposition to favor actors, instead of actresses. Over the weeks, the UOL report took on the mission of analyzing the winners of 91 Oscar editions in the categories of best film, best actor and best actress, in order to identify who were the protagonists of the long winners and what kind of role they played men and women the most coveted awards in cinema. "," With data, we show that the Oscar has always valued men more: an analysis shows that of 91 films that won the Best Film award, 62 had a man as a protagonist, while 19 were protagonists of both genders and only 10 were only a female protagonist.   In addition, we showed the occupations / professions of the awards for best actor and best actress and found that most actresses played women without any occupation in a film.   Another curious fact was to discover that 3 women who win the award for best actress did not speak in their films. Another 3 were victims of rape and 1 was a victim of psychological abuse.   After the publication of this report, Oscar announced goals of racial and gender diversity at the awards. "," For the construction of the database with names of the winners in the categories of Best Film, Best Actress and Best Actor, a data scraping was carried out on the Wikipedia page of each category using the Python Pandas library.

The Express-News spent a year (on and off because of the pandemic) investigating maternal health care and found that in 2019, more than two-thirds of the women who gave birth at one Texas hospital underwent a cesarean section or an episiotomy. These procedures can save the lives of mothers and babies. But when surgical interventions are performed at rates that are off the chart, experts say something is wrong. "," The project’s publication spurred community activists in Laredo to call for renewed talks to establish a public hospital system in the city, where the only two hospitals that deliver babies are for-profit.   The hospital has not publicly responded to our reporting, but internal communications among staff members suggest that it is considering hiring a laborist. If that comes to fruition, we will be reporting that.   The searchable database and reporting was widely circulated among birth workers and moms’ groups on social media. We heard from several folks who were especially thankful that the searchable database was finally made public. Prior to our reporting, no such tool existed where women could search those measures for hospitals on a centralized website in both English and Spanish.   It should also be noted that Doctors Hospital of Laredo’s reduction of its episiotomy rate happened concurrently with the Express-News’ reporting process. Marina Starleaf Riker first began to inquire about its C-section and episiotomy rate in February 2020, when she began requesting to speak with medical staff and hospital quality administrators. By the time the hospital granted an interview in September 2020, the hospital said it cut its episiotomy rate in half (it would not share that data with us, which was not yet made public by the state health department). "," Using hospital billing data known as the Texas Hospital Inpatient Discharge Public Use Data File, Christian McDonald analyzed numerous hospital quality measures by hospital, county and year, which included:   <ul>    The <a href=""https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/"">Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</a> Inpatient Quality Indicators: <a href=""https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Modules/IQI/V2020/TechSpecs/IQI_33_Primary_Cesarean_Delivery_Rate_Uncomplicated.pdf"">IQI 33 Primary Cesarean Delivery Rate, Uncomplicated</a> and <a href=""https://www.qualityindicators.ahrq.gov/Downloads/Modules/IQI/V2020/TechSpecs/IQI_22_Vaginal_Birth_After_Cesarean_(VBAC)_Delivery_Rate_Uncomplicated.pdf"">IQI 22 Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) Delivery Rate, Uncomplicated</a>       <a href=""https://www.leapfroggroup.org/"">The Leapfrog Group's</a> episiotomy rate measure, which was calculated using measure specifications from their <a href=""https://www.leapfroggroup.org/sites/default/files/Files/2020HospitalSurvey_20200413_8.1%20%28version%201%29.pdf"">2020 Leapfrog Hospital Survey</a>       Based on conversations with hospital administrators and health data scientists, McDonald also calculated total cesarean rates; the percentage of Medicaid coverage for all births, and of cesarean births; the average number of deliveries per week per doctor; hospitals' annual number of deliveries; and the portion of births that involved cesareans or episiotomies.    </ul>  The analysis was performed using R, an open source data and statistics language.  You can view McDonald's analysis and all of the documentation for his calculations by visiting <a href=""https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://utdata.github.io/thcic-pudf/__;!!Ivohdkk!yaZ-rqeNMXzX5RI8fea6roq_HC94ZkMyFmph6U-7tPi7ypDiCBpDv1ZEvdysVMnfrCjKwY6y$"">https://utdata.github.io/thcic-pudf/</a>.

Additionally, Riker used Excel to analyze <a href=""https://wonder.cdc.gov/"">CDC WONDER</a> birth data by county.   To help aid our investigation and build relationships with sources, we also published an online Google Form asking mothers in South Texas to share their childbirth experiences and tell us what they wanted us to look into. More than 170 responded, and later in the year, we heard from another 100 about their postpartum experiences — a topic we're still investigating. "," The Texas Department of State Health Services does not compile rates of surgical intervention by hospital (with the exception of a few inpatient quality measures that it analyzes for hospitals in metro areas). Instead, the agency sells the Texas Hospital Inpatient Discharge Public Use Data File, which is billing data that can be used to calculate rates of procedures and diagnoses on a hospital level (it does not include hospitals, such military hospitals, that aren’t overseen by the state health department).    The four years of data used in this analysis normally would cost in-state media $8,500 and out-of-state media $17,000. That’s why the Express-News formed a partnership with McDonald, who as a faculty member at a state university was able to obtain the data for free. He wasn’t allowed to show or share the raw data with anyone but was able to share and publish aggregate figures.   It should be noted that this hospital discharge data is more expensive in Texas than in most other states. A handful of states offer similar data for free or waive fees for journalists and researchers; others charge a couple hundred dollars per year; and some, like Texas, charge thousands of dollars for a single year of data.

Without the fellowship's support and guidance, our newsroom would have faced signficant difficulty producing these stories in the middle of the pandemic.    Lastly, let your audience guide your reporting. The nearly 300 Texas mothers we heard from helped informed our decision to create a searchable tool that allows mothers to look up rates of primary C-sections, episiotomies and vaginal births after cesareans at Texas hospitals. Their feedback was critical to our reporting and understanding of the complexities of patient-provider relationships.

"," The story performed brilliantly online, with the highest engagement score of any article published in the magazine the weekend it was published and an average read time of nearly six minutes across 22k unique visitors.    Readers loved our deep dive into the bowels of the ship: ""Great article, fascinating snapshot."" ""Best Article I've read in month's, gripping, informative and factual"". "," Detailed geolocation information was obtained from the ship tracking and global maritime intelligence company MariTrace to illustrate the exact route taken by the cruise ship. This enabled us to track it from Singapore — where it set sail on January 6 — to Yokohama where it docked on February 3.    The data came in a JSON format. We converted data into CSV files, then processed (translate easting/northing into latitude/longitude) and visualised them in QGIS. We annotated our final maps in Illustrator.    To give more context to our readers, we also mapped the location of all other cruises around the world that had registered Covid-19 cases at the same time the Diamond Princess was docked in Yokohama. This involved matching each vessel’s name to its International Maritime Organization number (the data was again provided by MariTrace) and then manually extracting the geolocation coordinates on the day the Diamond Princess was docked. A map was created using Datawrapper before being annotated in Illustrator.   We illustrated the official deck plan of the ship, allowing readers to understand the actual size of the cruise liner but also helping them visualise some of the smallest rooms passengers were forced to quarantine in.   Finally,  a bespoke timeline was put together to contextualise how the drama on board the Diamond Princess unfolded in the frame of an evolving global pandemic.

Katie Glass's words were already really powerful and deserved the strongest bespoke visual package to run with online.    The first crucial point we discussed was how to visualise the ship's route. On the one hand we wanted to be as accurate as possible. This is why we got in touch with the company MariTrace to get hourly positions of the cruise. On the other hand, we wanted to create a strong visual map that brightened up the data, keeping our readers both interested and informed. We had to find the right balance between data and illustration, between detail and clarity.    It was a really interesting and thoughtful creative process that involved different expertises coming together, a great example of collaboration across the newsroom.

Spain,Civio,Small,Participant,On the edge: this is how thousands of Spanish public contracts avoid competitive tendering,22/01/20,"Investigation, Database, Corruption","Scraping, D3.js, Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL"," Spanish regulation prevents public administrations from splitting up large contracts into minor contracts with the intention to avoid competitive tendering and thus award directly to a single company. We exposed that, in the first seven months of 2019 alone, more than 6,500 public contracts failed to comply with this regulation. That is more than 5% of minor contracts in national, regional and local administrations published on the Platform for Public Procurement, amounting to more than €53 million. "," This investigation registered more than 30m media impacts and follow ups by other newsrooms, mostly local-focused. As a result, it significantly impacted the local politics in some Spanish municipalities, such as the Ourense County Council (Galicia), Ames (Asturias), and others.    We identified Orense County Council as Spain's public authority with the highest number of suspicious contracts to its credit, some 55 contracts. This finding became a major political issue for months after the opposition parties demanded an inquiry. A process that was eventually blocked by the president of this regional council.   On a national level, political party Ciudadanos registered in Congress a battery of questions to ask the Government to estimate the cost for public administrations of ""malpractices and possible illegalities"" in public procurement, based on our findings.   Moreover, we shared our database and guide of the main issues detected to some twenty public procurement and anti-corruption control bodies at all levels national, regional and local. Our goal was to help them improve their control and even sanction those responsible, saving them precious time with our list of suspicious contracts. "," We downloaded all minor contracts published on the Platform for Public Procurement from January 1, 2018, until July 31, 2019, the date when we started to analyze them in depth. A total of 346,726 contracts. First, in order to create the dataset, we scraped the national procurement portal, using Ruby to gather and parse a collection of XML and HTML files. The results were placed in a PostgreSQL database, where we ran queries to detect outliers, identify gaps in the data and extract samples to be reviewed manually. The main analysis of the investigation (i.e. identifying clusters of public bodies and companies evading legal procedures via contract splitting) was done in PostgreSQL using SQL. Relevant subsets of the data were extracted files to be cleaned semi-automatically by journalists, using Open Refine and Excel spreadsheets.   On the frontend, a number of data visualizations were done using the Vue.js Javascript framework, together with the D3.js visualization library. The resulting visualizations are then embedded in the main Civio site, which runs on Jekyll.   The visual design of the visualizations was done using Adobe Illustrator and parts exported as SVG to be used in the visualizations. Illustrator was also used to create a number of additional infographics that complement the articles. "," The hardest part was creating a database to detect possible suspicious 'fragmentation' of contracts. The first step was the hardest: the team cleaned the data, amended mistakes (duplicated contracts, contracts mistakenly classified as minor) and reclassified those that were under the wrong category (goods, services and works contracts). Following this, in a second phase of analysis, we looked into contracts tendered to the same company by the same administration, which when cumulated together exceeded the legal threshold allowed for minor contracts. Later, we checked those contracts that met the previous requirements and were tendered on the same day. Additionally, we also reviewed those contracts under the same issue, tendered the same year, that on accumulation exceeded the legal threshold. It must be clarified that not all of the contracts reviewed might be illegal, but they are all suspicious and have to be analysed to see if they were chopped up with the intention of evading the law.   Civio conducted an in depth research on the topic, studying the law and consulting existing independent control agencies like OIReScon and Agencia Antifrau. We have also consulted Civio community members, experts on the topic, and other specialists. "," First of all, the journalist can learn from this project how specific risks, red flags, may indicate a potential non-compliance with public procurement regulations. We focused on one or two of them -splitting public contracts up to avoid competitive tendering-, but there are many more.    When working with a huge procurement dataset containing tens of thousands of contracts, looking at each of them's fine print is not an option. However, journalists can use red flags to surface those tenders with suspicious features and then study those in further detail, as we did. A red flag does not mean a contract is corrupt or illegal, just a hint that a closer look may reveal irregularities. And the more red flags, the stronger the suspicion.   Unfortunately, sometimes the necessary information to detect these malpractices is not publicly available or not with high-enough quality, a prerequisite for automating the red flag analysis. To answer the most complex questions, journalists would need to go beyond the procurement datasets and cross-reference them with other sources, such as the company register -an essential one- or a list of donors to political parties. If enough information is available, we will monitor more complex scenarios. It is just a matter of having extra datasets and putting some extra effort ",https://civio.es/quien-cobra-la-obra/2020/01/22/illegal-division-of-below-threshold-contracts/,https://civio.es/quien-cobra-la-obra/2020/01/29/the-invasion-of-minor-contracts-of-14999eu/,https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https://civio.es/novedades/2020/02/03/los-datos-de-civio-sobre-contratos-menores-sospechosos-ya-estan-a-disposicion-de-las-entidades-anticorrupcion/,https://datos.civio.es/collection/contratos-menores/,https://datos.civio.es/dataset/contratos-menores-servicios-y-suministros-superan-umbral/,https://datos.civio.es/dataset/contratos-entre-una-administracion-y-una-empresa-que-superen-sumados-el-limite-de-los-contratos-menores-y-que-hayan-sido-adjudicados-juntos-el-mismo-dia/,,,"Eva Belmonte, David Cabo, Carmen Torrecillas","  Eva Belmonte.

The story also discussed the little effort made by the present state government to pay up, but the billions on ground can be cleared"," Four weeks after the publication of the <a href=""https://www.icirnigeria.org/osun-state-government-commences-payment-of-pensioners/"">report</a> the report that exposed the travails of the retired Osun pensioners, the state government commenced the payment of owed salary arears to all the primary school retired teachers in the state under the Contributory Pension Scheme. "," I used 4 data reports from Pension Commission(PenCom) on pension remittance compliance by states.   Based on the state in focus, I also check the Nigerian Debt management office website to understand the heavy debt hindering the state from paying salaries and pensions for 5 years.   I also used media reports to track Paris Club funds given to the state government by the federal government. Through field fact checking, I checked all the uncompleted, bogus and irrelevant State project.   Then, I made this into infographics for better understanding to the public.   The result was that, I was able to expose how the state is sitting on debt time bomb which her citizens aren't aware of. The infographics later became more popular.   Also, I interviewed over 20 affected retirees across the 30 local governments in the state and made a short documentary video of their interviews.   I wrote a script for my designer and he used Figma app to design the engaging infographics. While I shot the video myself, my video editor used Adobe Premiere Pro to edit the video.   I used Google sheet to sort all my got data and cleaned them to expose what I needed. This made debt tracking so easy for me and to tell data story in a human angle way.

Brazil,Gênero e Número,Small,Participant,Open Box da Ciência,12/02/20,"Database, Open data, Infographics, Map, Women","Scraping, D3.js, JQuery, R"," Open Box da Ciência (Science Open Box) is a project to unveil the faces and the investigations of Brazilian female scientists. Our organization picked 250 of them, according to a methodology based on the Lattes Platform, Brazil’s main curriculum database for scholars. Our methodology aimed to outline top scientists in five areas of science, according to very objective criteria based on their production and contribution. This project converges data analysis, data journalism, and data visualization to promote science based on women’s perspectives and work.  "," Data analysis, data visualization, and stories on some of the leading scientists in Brazil shed a light on the crucial issue of gender and racial inequality, and privileged access to education. Figures helped to measure the gap between women and men and to highlight the underrepresentation of black women in Brazilian science. They are just 23% among the female professors in Brazilian universities (women are 46% in this universe, versus 54% of men). Black women’s access to scholarships is also very limited: only 2,6% of black female professors can count on any kind of funding, versus 12,3% of white women. The 85,1% left is held by men, the vast majority of those who receive financial help for their investigations. Black women are the largest demographic group in Brazil: 28% of the population.     A couple of months after the project was launched, these numbers also helped us to track four black female professors leading investigations on covid-19. Open Box da Ciência was featured on main Brazilian news outlets, including on the cover of one of the most notorious newspapers in the country (O Estado de São Paulo). The project was also praised by the main Brazilian universities and science institutions.   "," A Python script downloaded the data from the Lattes Platform base. Over 271,000 resumes from female PhDs were downloaded and converted to .xml. Another Python script interpreted these files to structure a database with tables to organize each information on the curriculum, such as awards and publications by each listed scientist. This same script inserted the data on a Database Management System (DMS) managed by MySQL.     The next step was to use R to read the data inputted in this MySQL DMS. To design the interactive visualizations, data was organized on json, using Vue.js, a Javascript framework. On the main data visualization, JQuery was used on the platform’s front-end to select data according to the users’ preferences. The data was designed to be shown in HMTL and CSS.   "," The hardest part was to work with an unfriendly public database (<a href=""http://lattes.cnpq.br/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">http://lattes.cnpq.br/</a>), which comprises the curriculum from all investigators. The Lattes platform was used to compile data before we developed the first open database in Brazil about female Ph.D. and share part of it as special data visualization related to narratives. The process required combining female name databases and data extracted after the mathematical rule was created since the public database doesn’t allow to find terms by means of classification by gender. As it is a robust database - all researchers at the doctoral level included - it required a lot of refinement. "," Launched one month before WHO declared the covid-19 pandemic, Open Box da Ciência highlighted the role of female scientists in Brazil, the gender and racial inequality among researchers, and the lack of funding that affects their work. Those issues would be deepened by the health crisis, which has killed over 224,000 Brazilians by now. In the following months, other media and academic works have focused on the impacts of the pandemic on female researchers regarding their capacity to meet the deadlines, publish articles, and their overall productivity. Two black women were the first Brazilian scientists to map the novel coronavirus genome in Brazil; their stories had a common ground with many of the P.h.D portrayed on Open Box da Ciência and described throughout the data compiled in the Open Box platform. This project also gave a departure point for journalists to craft similar stories and shed a light on race and gender inequality in science.          ",http://www.openciencia.com.br/,About the Open Box methodology: https://youtu.be/iLn-yW59SSE,"On Estado de São Paulo: https://ciencia.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,plataforma-online-divulga-perfil-de-250-pesquisadoras-brasileiras-de-destaque,70003195509",On Folha de São Paulo: https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ciencia/2020/02/plataforma-que-une-jornalistas-e-pesquisas-ineditas-do-brasil-e-lancada.shtml,Black female scientists and covid-19: http://www.generonumero.media/negros-pesquisas-covid-19/,On the biggest university in Brazil: https://conexao.ufrj.br/2020/03/09/projeto-open-box-da-ciencia-destaca-13-pesquisadoras-da-ufrj/,,,"Giulliana Bianconi, Marília Ferrari, Natália Leão, Vitória Régia da Silva, Marianna Kuraoka, André Feliz de Sousa"," Giuliana Bianconi founded Gênero e Número in 2016, as the first media organization in Latin America Latina to make data-driven journalism based on race and gender.

Kyrgyzstan,School of Data Kyrgyzstan,Small,Participant,OpenData COVID-19 Initiative,17/04/20,"Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","  Opendatacovid.kg was created with one main goal in mind – to provide one-stop access to COVID-19 data with the purpose of informing the public and the data-users (journalists and researchers) on the outbreak of the pandemic in Kyrgyzstan.      Our team branched into doing data-based research and collecting data-stories about people’s experience with COVID-19 and the lockdown. In just four months, Opendatacovid.kg had it all – access to open databases, stories based on data, educational resources and much more.  ","  When the pandemic reached Kyrgyzstan, it was clear that the government was not prioritizing open data access which was essential for the public and journalists.      Therefore, using the limited information access we had, we were able to communicate to the public, alongside local media outlets, that we do not have enough data to make a truly data-driven decision on the COVID-19 measures and assess implemented ones.      Then, we pointed our attention to the long-standing pre-pandemic problems that were not fully addressed or researched before. Together with our community, we initiated crowdsourcing of data on the noise levels during and after the lockdown, and this resulted in data stories into urban problems that usually go unaddressed.      After the strict lockdown measures have been lifted, we noticed soaring levels of misinformation due to the novelty of the virus. Our team partnered with local media to create data-driven media products, which were aimed at clearing up some myths that were circulating through channels such as WhatsApp and other messengers, by providing data literacy insights.      In March, schools in Kyrgyzstan shifted to online education. Our team conducted a study and collected data on the impact of distance learning on Kyrgyz schoolchildren and teachers in order to assess the consequences of imposed measures. We identified multiple obstacles they faced, such as a lack of technical and psychological support from the authorities.      Most importantly though, our aim was to facilitate a culture of data-driven decision-making and transparency through open data access and for our public to be informed & have an access to dashboards and analysis that was provided only through our website. We made sure that the data on our website was open, reliable and accessible to all, for which we created a database that could be used by media outlets, researchers, government agencies etc.              ","  Our project was built using various tools ranging from scrapers to web-building platforms. First, we used Python to scrape the data from the press-releases on the website of the Ministry of Health. Then, we arranged the data into Google Sheets, cross-checked it with published data sources, and made the document (our “database”) available to the public. For our interactive dashboards that updated every day at a certain time, we used Tableau and other visualization tools. Data from the dashboards is also open and available for everyone to download in CSV and XLS formats.      We then used a website-building platform where we laid out all our data and findings for easier access. Once we started collecting stories and doing research, we published it on our website and to date, it contains all data-driven stories on COVID-19 in Kyrgyzstan published by various media outlets in the country. In order to inform the public, we created visualizations, animations using Illustrator and other instruments.      Instruments: Tableau, Datawrapper,  Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Animation, Scraping  ","  The available data was insufficient to understand the full picture of the pandemic and its impact on the country. There was no access to data on key indicators measuring COVID-19 cases in the country, such as the number of hospital workers, the number and characteristics of the infected hospital workers, how many people were tested per day and what kind of tests were used, data on the hospitalized people, such as their age, gender, location etc. In other words, there was not enough data to assess the scale of this crisis in Kyrgyzstan.      Members of the public, the media and the researchers needed more open data from the Ministry of Health and more diligent ways of spotlighting the situation.      Nevertheless, the government authorities were unwilling to cooperate and did not pay attention to calls for more comprehensive data on the situation. Instead, they shut down all access to COVID-19 data mid-July, putting not only the information channels at risk (such as our website and the media channels that used the data for their stories), but actual lives of Kyrgyz people.     Our team took the initiative and wrote an Open Letter addressed to the Ministry of Health pointing their attention to our constitutional rights to have access to information and open data. The letter provided not only a list of key indicators necessary to measure COVID-19 cases in the country, but also an explanation on how this data could be used for the benefit of ordinary citizens and for better handling of the pandemic. The Open Letter was signed by multiple media outlets, academics, and even ordinary people who shared our values.   ","  Other journalists can learn that at the major crisis it is essential to have an access to data and government have to make it available as it is our first right to make informed decisions. Transparency and openness helps to combat myths circulating around, even if it is the most basic data, like in this situation in Kyrgyzstan. That being brave and standing up to the government officials through writing an Open Letter to the Ministry of Health and the government to call for more data is our responsibility as a part of civil society.   ",https://opendatacovid.kg/,,,,,,,,"Altynai Mambetova, Savia Hasanova, Banu Bagheri","  School of Data Kyrgyzstan is a public fund and a member organization of the global network School of Data committed to advancing data literacy in civil society.

United States,Bloomberg Industry Group,Big,Participant,PFAS Cleanup Backers Face Unexpected Foe: Water Utilities,09/06/20,"Long-form, Politics, Environment, Health",R," For this story on PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” John Dunbar and Christina Brady used a novel way of analyzing lobbying records by focusing on search terms rather than often-misleading overall lobbying figures. That data analysis formed the core of the article and helped pinpoint a key insight: that water utilities were outpacing other groups, such as chemical companies and the air travel industry, in lobbying Congress. That lobbying, including from publicly owned utilities, largely focused on weakening certain provisions to clean up the toxic chemicals from the nation’s water systems.   "," While the piece did not result in any new laws being passed or changed, it did impact how water utilities were seen in the eyes of reformers when it came to efforts to clean up the forever chemicals, known as PFAS. That was made possible by the enormous effort that went into the data analysis. We let it be known that it was water utilities—not the mega chemical corporations and their trade associations—that were most active in lobbying the PFAS cleanup bills and that they were more often than not on the side of industry. This was a surprise to everyone and a resulted in a paradigm shift among those who work on these issues. "," We used R to download the lobbying disclosure database from the Senate website, process the data and save it. We use a PostgreSQL database to store most of the data while saving the lobbying issues section to an Elasticsearch database.   Once the data is processed and saved, we used R to search the Elasticsearch database for terms related to PFAS. Then, we matched those issues back to the registered lobbyist and the client. We analyzed the data in R and categorized the industry of the companies hiring lobbyists manually. "," The lobbying disclosure database is full of amended forms, potential for double counting, inconsistencies, and ambiguity. It is also difficult to parse and process.   Forms are often amended and it is important to look at only the latest amendment. However, there is no ID number matching amended forms to their original forms, so we had to get creative and use the registered lobbyist, client, report type and report period to link forms and find the latest form.   It is also important to know that both outside law firms and the company hiring them may submit overlapping forms as both entities must report lobbying. The company reports may also include lobbying by in-house lobbyists. Thus, it is necessary to scrutinize the reports to ensure you are not double counting.   Next, there limitations to using the issues field. On one extreme, some people are more detailed and clear when completing this section. On the other extreme, some people leave it blank. Furthermore, it is impossible to link any one individual to any one issue because they are often all listed together. Understanding these limitations are essential to not misusing the data.   Finally, the xml files in the bulk download cannot be simply uploaded to a single table in a database.

It explains in detail how the Uganda Wildlife Authority was able to team with the local community to fight poaching when it engaged them and introduced appiary as an income generating activity, uses data on the increasing number of wildlife coincided with reduction in illegal activities to show evidence of result, discusses the limitations to appiary as a solution including destruction of beehives by the wildlife themselves and poor colonisation due to harsh environment, offers insights on ways to minimise some of the challenges and justifies why this strategy", This project earned me an invitation from World Wide Fund for Nature- Kenya to participate in the East African Community exchange conference for journalists reporting on illegal wildlife trade. It drove new readers to the West Nile Today website that was only clocking ten months last September where readership per article had hardly exceede 500 clicks. It sparked renewed public debate on local radios and in social media about the need to establish better facilities to  reap from the untapped tourism potential of Ajai wildlife reserve. , Flourish Studio data tools were used to create an interractive visualisation the link of which was shared in the article under the infographic subheading while the graph was also uploaded as a photoshot for the benefit of readers who do not have much time to spend on interracting with the visualisation. Google documents were especially useful in the drafting and presentation of the article. While Web Harvy allowed the extraction of the data after its uploading on Source Africa back into the story for citation. , Finding the required data on the changing trend of animal population in Ajai wildlife reserve was the most challenging part of the project. This was particularly so due to the poor data ecosystem in West Nile and Uganda where most information is kept in printed form in the office shelves and where bureaucratic impedments complicate accessibility to public documents. These had to be made available online for scraping and citation through the Source Africa open data portal. ," It is possible to create interesting stories out of less popular and often neglected topics such as wildlife conservation in remote areas with a solutions focus. This can inturn influnce the policy discourse or offer lessons that can be replicated elsewhere. It is also possible to track and find data that can support news reporting with scientific evidence especially if the data is presented and analysed in simple and understandable format. Journalists also learn that geojournalism and data journalism expand the scope of innovative storytelling.

Egypt,It is an individual project that I published on my personal website (alhadaqa.com),Small,Participant,"POMPEII,  THE ANGRY FACE OF NATURE",15/11/20,"Explainer, Illustration, Chart, Map, Environment","D3.js, CSV, R, RStudio"," The relationship between nature and human has always been one of the most complex relationships that can be understood, despite its inevitability. Despite the care and tenderness Nature gives to human, but she may revolt and get angry at them. We saw this anger in the past, so the Pompeii disaster is unforgettable example, and this anger is still repeated in different forms until the present day, This work analyzes and presents the most significant natural disasters that have occurred on the planet earth since 1900, which collectively caused the deaths of more than 33 million people. "," To see the big picture of the history of natural disasters of all types and the deaths they have caused as a basic indicator of the extent of their violence, a matter that calls for rethinking and reconsideration, and opens the door for more questions, the most important of which are what might anger nature in this way, and is this anger or part of it nothing but a response of what we humans have done in terms of wrong practices, constant attacks, and a disrespect for their sanctity.  And wondering about the forms of this anger, how often it occurs, and what are the most catastrophic areas.   The project has achieved good resonance since its publication, and the reactions of readers and specialists have been very good. The project has been promoted by the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DataVisualizationSociety/posts/192931262302531"">Data Visualization Society</a> (DVS) through its Facebook channel as well as the <a href=""https://gijn.org/2020/11/19/data-journalism-top-10-simple-google-searches-covid-contracts-mining-indigenous-land-nashville-hot-spots-blackstone-in-berlin/"">Global Investigative Journalism Network</a> (GIJN), where it was considered one of the top 10 projects that were circulated globally during its launch week. It was promoted by the South African <a href=""https://nakeddata.org/2020/11/20/scrollytelling-disaster-in-a-good-way/"">Naked Data Newsletter</a> as well as by the German platform <a href=""https://tibs.at/content/fundstueck-datenvisualisierung"">TiBS,  Tiroler Bildungsservice</a>. "," The data was collected and merged from two sources: Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The data were combined, cleaned, analyzed, and some initial graphs were produced using the programming language R. Then the main concept and idea were developed in form of freehand sketches. Then the final production was developed was using JavaScript and D3js as a main library.   Regarding the story of the POMPEII disaster, it was based on historical sources that mentioned the history of the city and the details of the disaster, as well as some documentaries that documented the moments of revealing some of the secrets of the stricken city.   Finally, the illustrations that accompanied the story were produced using Procreate and Affinity Designer programs. "," During work on the project, there were several challenges, but the biggest of them was the balances that were placed in the initial conception of the project, such as:     A story that links the past to the present, relies on data without losing sight of emotion, combines historical facts and does not overlook human feelings.   A story that sheds light on and balance between the human right to live on Earth and the nature right to survive and continue, so we do not oppress nature as the only culprit, and do not view man as the victim along the way, as he may have gone beyond his limits without noticing that.   The balance between building up data visualizations that reflects what the numbers say, but at the same time it carries the spirit of nature and the randomness it contains.   The balance between explanatory storytelling and Exploratory freedom for the viewer to explore and discover more while reading the story and talking about numbers, So the decision was to make all disaster points discoverable when hovering over them with the mouse in all data visuals.   "," I think that the most important thing that can be learned by any viewer of this work is the big picture of the most significant natural disasters throughout our recent history and the direct impact which basically represented by the number of deaths in various places and over the years.   But for journalists, the most important thing that can be learned is to focus on the following basic elements and ensure their presence in the journalistic work, which helps the reader to use his total brain power to fully understand the presented content:     Story   Empathy    Image or Illustration   Data Graph   Exploration   ",https://www.alhadaqa.com/pompeii/,https://www.alhadaqa.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pompeii_v2.html,,,,,,,Mohamad Waked," I'm an independent awad winning data visualization designer with background in engineering and data science. I have an extreme passion towards analyzing data, exploring its dark sides, examining it from different angles, breaking it down till roots, understanding the connections between its small dots, discovering and uncovering its deep secrets, then summarizing those findings in a graph that is pleasing to its viewer. I founded ALHADAQA which is my personal DataViz studio where I am expressing part of my passion towards data exploration and data visualization.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,Portugal at half-speed. What changed in a suspended country,02/04/20,"Long-form, News application, Chart, Map, Environment, Lifestyle, Culture, Health, Economy, Employment","Scraping, Json, CSV, R, RStudio", A national lockdown was something new for everyone. Everyone felt that the country was changing. But what exactly was changing? We turned into data to figure it out.  What started as an idea to explore the pollution levels in the country snowballed into a longform data-driven article about how Portuguese society had changed in just 15 days. We ended up combing about 20 different data sources that showed us expectable things - such as the fact that pollution levels dropped - but others were really surprising - like the fact that people seemed to be listening to happier songs. ," This article was pretty successful among Público readers because data was able to capture the  zeitgeist  of that moment where everyone was staying at home.   By combining such amount of data sources, everyone felt represented in the numbers. Some data reflected stuff everyone could see with their bare eye - like the fact that the number of car accidents dropped instantly with the lockdown or that people rushed to buy cans of food and toilet paper. But other data seemed pretty intimate: like the fact that the number of websites to quit smoking saw an increase in web-traffic or that people were watching more porn online.   Even though this is an educated guess, I believe that, in this case, data helped people understand the world around them in such weird times. Being able to see that, like them, other people were afraid to go to the hospitals, were trying to quit smoking, stopped googling about wedding dresses, or stopped streaming music that made them dance made everyone feel less of an outlier. "," Because of the diversity of data sources used on this project, I had to be flexible. I’ve used R as the main programming language for web scraping and doing the data analysis. This implied several R packages, mostly connected with the tidyverse family. For some API data, such as Spotify’s API, I’ve packages that facilitate connecting with the API.   This ended up being a big project with multiple files that did different things like scraping or did data cleaning. A final file was responsible to export all the data used into one big .json file.   Because I was also the web developer for the project, I’ve used R to export the .json file that fed all the charts in the article. The fact that I was the one in control of all processes was exhausting - coding in R and JavaScript at the same time can get confusing when you use pipes in your .js code - but gives your control over how you the data you are getting in your browser is structured.   Since I’ve used chart.js as the main library to create the interactive charts, it was pretty useful to get the data on your json file just as you need. "," The hardest part of this work is also what makes it unique: the fact that I had to be creative in getting the data. Doing data journalism gets easier when there is official data published. But when there is not, you have to go through the process of thinking about where such indicators could be available and how could I get that data. And then go through the process of getting it.   One dataset that took us too much time to get was the pollution data. I wanted to give the possibility to the reader to see the levels of pollution in their city. The data is published hourly on a Portuguese government website, so I built a scraper that got there every hour to collect the data. But the past hourly data was only published in .jpeg charts and we needed the data from at least January. Because OCR worked awfully on them, we turned it into an excel file manually.   Another example that reflects the need of being creative was the employment indicator. Official employment statistics are not published in 15 days - and we were not even sure if they would immediately reflect it. But with everything closed, it surely would be harder to get a job. So we turned into a popular job posting website, scrapped the number of job postings (the company kindly gave us the data since the beginning of February) and we found out that not only that number of job posts dropped, but that the kind of jobs being offered was different.   Even though some companies provided us some data, this work demanded a lot of code for scrapping and analyzing all the data. "," I think there are two lessons to be taken from this work. The first one is something that most data journalists are already familiar with but that it’s good to always keep in mind: be creative about your data sources. Most of the time there is no “official data” about something and you need to be creative. For example, as I was talking with Mapbox to ask for the car traffic data, I remembered that civil protection authorities in Portugal log on their website every time firemen, ambulances, or police cars are needed. Normally, as a reporter, I use that data to report about weather conditions or wildfires. But I remembered that ambulances and police are also required when there are car accidents.   The second lesson it’s the kind of advice an ambitious data journalist gets from his editor: sometimes you have to say “it’s enough”. This work started to be only about pollution. But suddenly new ideas appeared: ‘let's check out the number of books sold, let’s check out the number of arrivals at the airports, let’s check out what people are tweeting about, let’s check out if people are listening to sadder songs’. And new ideas could keep coming if I didn’t set a deadline for the work. If I had more time to do it, I’m sure I would find more than 20 data sources for it.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,Portugal bought hundreds of thousands of masks without quality assurance,07/07/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Health, Crime, Economy","Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio"," A collaborative effort between Público and other 15 European news organizations, coordinated by OCCRP, found out that the European market was being flooded with fake and faulty FFP masks.  Using a data-driven approach, I’ve found out that Portugal has bought at least 627 thousands of FFP masks that had a fake or dubious certification. Some certification companies that were not allowed to certificate FFP masks started to issue documents that looked like certificates and fooled public institutions that were not used to buy this kind of product. "," This international investigation made local authorities act across Europe. In Sweden, the local authorities demanded masks delivered to several hospitals being returned. In North Macedonia, the Health Ministry called for an investigation.  But things happened a bit differently in Portugal - a country where, the data collected showed that at least hospitals, the Marine, and even the Health Authorities bought some masks with dubious certification. After several questions, the Ministry of Health didn’t confirm if there was an investigation happening because of these public contracts.  According to the Attorney General's Office, only one company that sold this kind of equipment was being investigated. "," This investigation was born while I was working on another investigation about public spending during the covid-19 pandemic. I’ve used R to scrape the Public Tenders website from Portugal to get all pandemic related contracts. After going through the description and pdf contracts of about 16 thousand contracts, I’ve identified 232 public contracts that specified purchasing FFP masks - I’ve used NLP and machine learning approaches here to help me identify possible FFP contracts.  Because most of those 232 didn’t provide additional information on the public website, our team called all buyers and all sellers asking for the certification of the masks bought/sold. Most of them refused to give the documents and, by the date of publishing the investigation, we had 50 certificates of those masks.  While doing it, across Europe other journalists were doing the same and checking with experts in the area the validity of those documents so that we could end up with an international database of fake/dubious certificates. That way, we found out that more than half of the certificates provided to us from public contracts provided this kind of dubious certification. "," The hardest part of this investigation was navigating the sea of data. Since we had around 16.000 public contracts that were related to the pandemic, finding which ones were about FFP masks was hard - especially because most of the contracts were vague and simply stated that “masks” were bought (not specifying the kind of masks). Automation and data journalism techniques helped here, but when there are missing data, nothing works better than using the phone. But calling all the buyers and sellers asking for a document was hard and involved a lot of people and a lot of hours by the phone. "," This is probably something that all investigative journalists say, but since this was my first time taking part in an international investigation, it was the first time I felt it: international collaboration is key to tackle international issues.   Without the collaboration of the other 15 newsrooms (and OCCRP) it would be impossible for a single data journalist in Portugal to know about this issue, to have some background about the companies that were issuing these certificates, and to be able to check if a new certificate was ok or not.

The research showed that the most important cities of the country cities segregate immigrants into their poorest neighborhoods. The investigation revealed that urban planning and immigration policies have brought racial discrimination in access to housing for millions of migrants in Spain.    "," This project was one of the most read of the year in elDiario.es and also one of the one that made most people suscribe and pay for eldiario.es during the year, according to our statistics. Several NGOs that work with the migrant population in Spain shared the article, highlighting the excessive segregation of migrant population in Spain. After the publication a lot of inmigrants in Spain started to shared their own stories on how they were discriminated when they tried to rent or buy a house, there where thousands of stories shared on social media that showed racial discrimination to access housing. For example: one woman reported that a person did not want to show her a house to rent because of her accent over the phone.                             "," R, Rstudio an Excel for data compiling and data analysis. We cross-checked the national census foreign-born population databases with the median income in each census section to see if there was a correlation between higher income and higher foreign population. We used Mapbox, Javascript, and Flourish for mapping and data visualization. We created a map that allows the reader to change easily between the foreing population and income view. This way, the reader could see very clearly where both maps match. "," Even this investigation had thousand of registers to be analyzed the most dificult part was to create a visualization that explains this phenomena in an easy format that allowed used to understand the main pattern of the story: the higher the income level, the lower the proportion of foreign population. Of all the options we looked at, we found the one that we thought was the clearest for any reader. A slider that allowed you to see where the poorest neighborhoods were in each city and also in which building blocks there was the most migrant population. ", This project can inspire journalists from other countries to cross census foreign population data and income data to see if this to see if this pattern is repeated in other countries. Most of european governments announce big policies to accept migrants in their countries but analizing this data in more countries could show that this policies are not doing enough to integrate migrants into the society where on basic human right as housing is being blocked by racial discrimination.     ,https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/renta-marca-concentracion-inmigrantes-espana_1_1053178.html,,,,,,,,"Raúl Sánchez, Gabriela Sánchez, Icíar Gutiérrez, Pau Rodríguez, Emilio J.

United Kingdom,The i paper / inews.co.uk,Big,Participant,PPE Chaos Revealed,05/08/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Open data, News application, Fact-checking, Mobile App, Politics, Health","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, CSV","Our e PPE Chaos Revealed investigation broke open the opaque processes of the UK's PPE supply chains and showed the extent to which NHS executives battled with national PPE shortages that medics said were putting the lives at risk. Over two months, our reporters Cahal Milmo and Dean Kirby trawled through more than 500 spreadsheets of hospital and ambulance trust spending data in search of PPE Covid-19 codes – the ad hoc payments made by frontline trusts for protective equipment. The investigation revealed how NHS trusts have spent vast sums with often unproved suppliers as the central system struggled to"," Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said the investigation showed the “desperation” that hospital managers faced in sourcing supplies. He said: “As doctors and their colleagues continue to care for Covid patients we must have guarantees from Government that the failures of the first wave will not be repeated and that they will be properly protected going forward.”    In December 2020, the Public Accounts Committee opened an inquiry into PPE shortages and faults in the early stages of the pandemic.    In a validation of the issues uncovered by our investigation, the committee has heard evidence of the extent to which hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries struggled to cope with shortages, including evidence from a director of nursing at a London hospital, who revealed that she opened a box of gowns to find it crawling with insects, while face masks were supplied with rotten elastic that broke when staff put them on.    In what was described by the public accounts committee chairman Meg Hillier as “jaw dropping evidence”, nursing and doctors’ leaders revealed that some supplies also had new expiry dates covering up old ones, fuelling safety concerns for staff dealing with Covid-positive patients as the first wave hit in March and April.    One nursing director described how the NHS supply chain “just never appeared… it just fizzled out as March went by” and how staff came within three hours of running out of PPE altogether.    Our investigation was praised by Politico London Playbook as a “superb investigation”.  "," Each of the 223 hospital trusts in the UK is supposed to keep and publish a record of payments they have made each month over the figure of £25,000. Sampling a few of these open-source spreadsheets published among the financial reports on their websites showed that, during the Coronavirus pandemic, many of them have been using a cost code of ""Coronavirus"" or ""Covid-19"" to account for spending they have had to make on the pandemic. We were then able to see how much the trusts had spent on personal protective equipment for their staff and the suppliers who were providing it. Over a period of two months, we downloaded spreadsheets from each trust covering the first five months of 2020 - where available, that could mean five spreadsheets per trust. We very much did this the ""old fashioned way"" by using XL files and pivot tables to find suppliers that sounded unusual, logging the payments and then researching and contacting the suppliers online.  We showed that the desperate spending by NHS trusts to plug the gaps in supply included £1.1m spent by one trust on PPE from a costume jewellery supplier, with other trusts making large payments to firms including a luxury travel agency, a coffee supplier, a gin school, and a company specialising in wreck salvage and sales of abandoned cargo. We also revealed how an ambulance trust in the North East of England had to make six round trips of 150 miles to obtain alcohol-based sanitiser and face visors from a fashion outfitters in Manchester.        "," The scale of the project was daunting. As discussed above, we downloaded and searched through more than 500 spreadsheets. These were in different formats and used different cost-codes. In some cases we used Tabula to turn pdfs into spreadsheets. While more advanced data handling tools may have helped, our project has shown the value of using the human eye - and basic journalism skills - to search through and find unusual things in data and that data stories do not need to be about the latest gadgets. In all, we searched through more than 500 spreadsheets to produce a front page story of major significance for our newspaper.  "," Financial spreadsheets are dry and opaque sources, but are generally open-source information that does not need to be requested under Freedom of Information laws. Taking the time to look through them, particularly when this is done on a large scale can provide a window into how health trusts and other bodies are coping within a pandemic.

And they also said they would assign our investigativeanalysis to their students. I believe scholars who hope to study the gap between what the Chinese Communist Party promises on gender equality and the reality will benefit from our investigation. And hopefully, China’s governments and the Party will improve the situation for female officials in the future as a result of my reporting and its influence overseas.   Although ChinaFile is banned in China, the story has <a href=""https://www.douban.com/people/214788284/status/3222781664/"">made its way into China</a>, sparkling discussion of women and politics Chinese social media. I hope this article will inspire young women to challenge gender norms as they advance their careers, whether they are in politics or not.  "," Aportion of the research for ""<a href=""https://www.chinafile.com/node/52901"" target=""_blank"">Pretty Lady Cadres</a>"" draws on a dataset that ChinaFile constructed, consisting of biographical information about the top Party and state leaders at the provincial, municipal, and county levels of China's government. Each administrative level has both a Chinese Communist Party Secretary and a head of government (a governor, a mayor, or their equivalent, depending on the level and the specific province or region). In the administrative hierarchy, there are multiple municipalities under each province, and multiple counties under each municipality.   This information was hosted in fairly complete form on a <a href=""http://ldzl.people.com.cn/dfzlk/front/firstPage.htm"" target=""_blank"">government website</a> maintained by the Party's flagship newspaper,  The People's Daily , until sometime in 2018 when the site was overhauled, eliminating information about county-level leaders. Thus, to construct our dataset, ChinaFile relied on the <a href=""https://archive.org/"" target=""_blank"">Internet Archive</a>, a non-profit that archives select webpages over time.   By scraping the Internet Archive's records, we were able to obtain information about the top government and Party leaders at the county, municipal, and provincial levels. Though we were unable to reconstruct the entire database, our dataset includes nearly 4,300 county or county-equivalent localities throughout China.      "," 1. Of the roughly 9,900 leaders listed in our dataset, about 2,900 did not include gender information. For these entries, we turned to the existing program ""<a href=""https://github.com/observerss/ngender"" target=""_blank"">ngender</a>,"" which uses historical name data to make guesses about the gender of a person based on their name. The program also gives a ""confidence rate"" for each of its guesses. Running ngender against leader data for which we already had gender information, we determined that the program guessed correctly in nearly 93 percent of cases, and tended to make more accurate guesses for names we knew to be associated with men. The average confidence rate for correctly-guessed female entries was 85 percent. We then ran ngender against those entries for which we did not have gender information, manually checking any guesses which had a confidence rate below 85 percent. It took a months to finish the manual checking of hundreds of government officials' gender.   2. As the Chinese government continues to clamp down on freedom of speech, citizens in China are increasingly afraid to talk to foreign media. It took me months to find and establish relationships with Chinese government employees who were willing to speak to me. Fearing repercussions for giving unauthorized interviews, all government employees interviewed for this story, agreed to speak on the condition that only her surname be used. In order to ensure their safety, I had to be extremely careful in handling their personal information and make sure their identities would not be exposed at any point in the writing and editing process.     "," At a time when China expels an increasing number of international journalists, denies visas to scholars and silences its people, it’s harder for analysts and journalists outside of China to understand the country and its cultural, social and political issues. Going forward, using publicly available data and Chinese-language information that lives on Chinese social media and government websites is one of the few means left for the rest of the world to make sense of the country of 1.4 billion people.   As for the project itself, other journalists can use our data as authorative figures to illustrate the lack of gender equality in Chinese politics. They can learn the gender dynamics in China's officialdom and within the Party as well as the general situation of Chinese working professionals. They can also conclude that the gap between what the Chinese Communist Party promises about gender equality and the reality by citing our article is wide. I linked all of my sources in my article, so that journalists interested in the topic can access the exact government policy papers, guidelines, laws and regulations from the original government/Party websites. We also created an interactive map showing the number of women in the top two positions at the provincial, municipal, and county levels of governance, which will give fellow journalists a good sense of regions and places that do relatively well or bad in terms of promoting women to leadership. We didn't really look into the geographic differences when it comes to women in top leadership positions, but I think this will be a great follow-up project to work on if other journalists are interested.  ",https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/features/pretty-lady-cadres-china,https://www.chinafile.com/pretty-lady-cadres-china-methodology,,,,,,,"Shen Lu, Jessica Batke"," Shen Lu is a journalist and former ChinaFile Fellow based in the United States.

"," The project highlighted how online fandoms can have the same, if not bigger, scale and connectedness as online propaganda networks, making them ideal channels for information cascade online. While most fandoms isolate themselves from conversations outside their interest, there have been several instances when they step into the realm of politics, and with sheer volume, dominate the conversation.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,Participant,Quebec's budget explained with Lego blocks,11/03/20,"Explainer, Politics","3D modelling, Three.js"," What better way to understand a government’s budget than with construction blocks? In this 3D dataviz, each block represents 5 million dollars. Governments' budgets could be boring for the general public, but they are very important from a democratic perspective. With this project, I tried to transform a boring topic into an interesting and colorful experience. And since half our readership consumes news on mobile phones, I optimized my code and the experience for both big and small screens. "," This project was published on the same day that Quebec's budget was released. The idea was that the general public would see how different it was compared to the other reports, traditional text articles, and TV/Radio reports. And it worked! It's one of our most shared projects in 2020. In the end, I ask the readers to tell me how they found the 3D experience. I received hundreds of emails! A lot of the messages came from teachers who used this dataviz to explain how the government spends the taxpayers' money. "," I created a React (javascript library) custom template to keep the visualization visible at all times, while the user presses on the arrows on the side of the screen (or the arrows on its keyboards) to move from a scene to the other. On mobile, I coded the template to use the swipe gesture, which is more natural for touch screens. For the 3D universe, I used ThreeJS (javascript library) to create the lego blocks and to animate them. Behind the hood, it's using the WebGL technology. "," Two things made this project particularly challenging. The first one was the 3D. I had to learn how to use the ThreeJS library by myself. It's mostly used for commercial purposes or video games. But I couldn't find great examples for journalistic data visualization purposes! So I had to figure out many things by myself. The other big challenge was the publication date. I had to precode the project in a general and abstract manner as much as I could because I wanted to publish it as soon as the budget was released, even if I didn't know the budget content! "," With this project, I think other reporters can learn how 3D dataviz could help to explain complex topics to the general public. 3D scenes have an extraordinary potential for immersive experiences. On top of it, it uses WebGL technology which makes the dataviz very efficient, even on mobile phones.

Brazil,Aos Fatos,Small,Participant,Radar Aos Fatos,25/03/20,"Investigation, Database, Fact-checking, Politics, Human rights","AI/Machine learning, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, PostgreSQL, Python"," Radar Aos Fatos is a real-time monitoring system built to fight disinformation. Its public facade consists of a monitor that automatically detects potentially misleading contents that are trending on social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and WhatsApp. Everyday, publications are swept by an algorithm that maps language patterns and classifies them according to their informative quality. Thus, it is possible to observe the evolution of disinformation campaigns and how they are amplified. By doing this, it analyzes an average of 200.000 publications weekly applying a methodology that combines linguistics, social and data science. "," In a country where the most prominent politicians use disinformation as a political tool, Radar Aos Fatos produces relevant journalism that makes those in power uncomfortable. Since its launch, in March 2020, Radar's reporters have already published more than 30 stories showing that the most pernicious disinformation campaigns in Brazil come from the top: president Jair Bolsonaro and his allies are the most common misinformers on social media.    This work motivated multiple lawsuits against Aos Fatos from bolsonaristas, such as one brought by federal deputy Bia Kicis (PSL) and another one by the public prosecutor and right-wing influencer Ailton Benedito. Aos Fatos' team has been doxxed and attacked in social media provoked by Bolsonaro's allies.   Besides that, Radar's editorial branch published high impact stories, shared by over 20 media outlets, including Folha de S.Paulo, O Globo and Veja. For instance, we found out that a representative who was being considered for Secretary of Health was the biggest disinformation spreader about the pandemic (https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/cotado-para-saude-osmar-terra-e-congressista-que-mais-difundiu-desinformacao-sobre-coronavirus-no-twitter/). After this story, his name stopped being considered for office.   Radar Aos Fatos won the 2020 Gabriel García Márquez award on innovation and the Digital Media LATAM 2020 for best digital project. "," To build Radar's algorithm, we started by identifying patterns of misinformation on longform texts. It was needed to develop a parser to apply linguist rules such as alarmist text (alarmist words like “urgent”, “calamity”), exaggerated or generalistic text (“the best”, “100% cured”) and texts strings that frequently appears on misinformative texts (“vaccine from Israel”, “hidroxycloroquine with azithromycin”).   Then, this set of rules was applied and a total score was calculated. To create a more approachable score, two statisticians translated it to a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 means low quality and 10 is high quality content. For the purpose of Radar, we only display texts that scored 5 or less.    The same process of recognizing linguistic patterns was applied on posts on Twitter, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. We used their public APIs to collect text with a scrapper written in Python, using a Django web framework and a Celery task manager. Data is being saved to a PostgreSQL database, which also helps us filter content we need.    Even though the data scraping is pretty much the same, each platform has its set of rules to recognize potentially misinformative patterns.   During this process, we created a dataset of websites (over 400 websites that published at least one misinformative piece), Twitter handles (over 7,000, containing politicians, official governmental profiles), Facebook’s public pages (over 600 that have ever shared a content debunked by Aos Fatos), WhatsApp public groups and YouTube channels (over 650). This is an ongoing process and we rely on Aos Fatos daily debunking and monitoring.   Aos Fatos also created an editorial branch for Radar. Previously planned for the second semester, Covid-19 demanded a change of plans, and a team of journalists and data scientists was hired in March 2020. "," A project this complex lacks references. It’s unique from backend development to frontend render. This specificity becomes extra challenging during a pandemic, because it forced our whole team to work from home, hindering creative and collective construction processes.   Also, Radar's monitor aims to garner attention from audiences from different backgrounds: regular Aos Fatos' readers, data scientists, scholars, journalists, political analysts. That's why it is designed to provide an unique but also granular dataset about mis/disinformation in Brazil. The tool itself provides general numbers of our dataset, as well as a broad overview on over 200.000 publications in small charts. Radar invites new users to dig deeper in each social network and explore, by themselves, the different modulations of potentially misleading, low quality content.    This simple yet unique dataviz demands a deep understanding of our own dataset and our abilities to collect, analyze and display a large amount of data that is updated constantly. Plus, since it’s an ongoing project, both layouts and database needed to be planned for reasonable growth, which means more storage and processing power, a flexible layout and programmable charts. Yet, the tool need to fully load within 5 seconds, otherwise we will lose our readers. "," By having access to sophisticated analysis about the landscape of broad political mis/disinformation strategies, Aos Fatos' editorial team and other journalists now have a tool to act faster against fraudulent content campaigns. By looking at most common searches and cross-monitoring viral content in many platforms simultaneously, it is easier to detect misinformation patterns and act against it. As a broader result, the accuracy of disinformation investigations are higher, and so is their impact.  ",https://www.aosfatos.org/radar/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/aos-fatos-launches-real-time-monitoring-system-against-misinformation/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/como-desinformacao-sobre-cloroquina-se-multiplicou-no-twitter-apos-aval-de-bolsonaro-droga/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/cotado-para-saude-osmar-terra-e-congressista-que-mais-difundiu-desinformacao-sobre-coronavirus-no-twitter/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/politicos-brasileiros-seguem-mais-de-1400-contas-que-divulgaram-teorias-da-conspiracao-qanon-no-twitter/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/deputados-governistas-lideram-desinformacao-sobre-covid-19-entre-parlamentares-no-twitter/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/facebook-exibiu-anuncios-de-drogas-sem-comprovacao-contra-covid-19-ao-menos-39-mi-de-vezes-em-2020/,,"Tai Nalon, Carol Cavaleiro, Bruno Fávero, Bárbara Libório, Thamyres Dias, João Barbosa, Luiza Barros, Milena Mangabeira, Débora Ely, Bernardo Barbosa, Marina Gama Cubas, Rômulo Collopy"," Tai Nalon  CEO and co-founder at Aos Fatos.

Tanzania,End Water Poverty,Small,Participant,Realising rural communities' rights to safe water in Tanzania,27/10/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Breaking news, Documentary, News application, Podcast/radio, Audio, Politics, Environment, Women, Human rights","Personalisation, Adobe Creative Suite"," This news story is based on a Claim Your Water Rights project campaign organized End Water Poverty.   This is a global mobilisation campaign that aims to awaken people to the injustice of their situation and spur them to claim their human rights to safe water and sanitation.   People have the power to take on governments and contracted private companies who do not provide safe, affordable water and sanitation services.   You can read more: https://www.endwaterpoverty.org/Claim-Your-Water-Rights-FAQ "," On February 13, Media for Community Empowerment (MECE) aired a radio show on Pambazuko FM, which is based in Kilombero, Tanzania. This marked the beginning of our #ClaimYourWaterRights campaign, in which we used local radio to raise awareness of people's human rights to water and sanitation.   MECE produced and aired five radio shows in five different villages, one of which was Kikwawila. We met Alfonse Michael Gwawa, a 72-year-old man who since 1982 had been using dirty water from a well he dug himself.   Alfonse said water is scarce, especially in the dry season, forcing him to wait until spring. Even then the water he uses is not clean or safe. He drinks it with his family because they have nowhere else to get water.   Now six months after airing the radio show, the local government at Kikwawila village has managed to drill water for their citizens.    On October 19, MECE visited the village after being informed by Mr. Kondo Magengele who is the village chairperson, said that the village now has a well that is ready for people to use. During the interview, Mr Hamadi said that they had successfully dug a well after allocating village government funds, following a discussion at the village assembly.   He said that, three days after the radio show aired, village residents started bothering him by asking when the local government will dig a well as they realised that water is their human right after listening to our radio broadcast.   The chairperson said that 37 households are benefiting from the well while the village government tries to secure further funds to dig more wells in sub-villages. "," One of the tools I used to accomplish this news project is to establish interview guidelines. This guidelines shows order of operation/production of the radio programs.   It also guides the sub format of the program and the possible sources to interview and their questions. The sub format like profile interviews, group discussion, vox pop, and one to one interviews with local government leaders.   The guidelines offer suggestions rather than instructions. Not included questions specific to gender, race, and social class for instance.   But listening and responding to people’s answers is far more important than following a set of guidelines.   I was using the techniques of asking more follow-ups questions. Since I have listening skills, the technique of listening during the interview can make people express their needs effectively and the radio program can be more interactive.   Another technique was being flexible during the interview. Some sources are hard to speak of. Being flexible by asking strategic questions like: CAN YOU SAY MORE or HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE SITUATION can make the source speak.   The technologies used in this project were radio stations, especially community radios based in rural areas. Many people who are living there prefer to hear their recorded voices get answered from their government leaders.   But also local media plays a crucial role in delivering credible, helpful information to the citizens. Critically, local media also gives communities a voice to communicate their concerns to local authorities and express solidarity with one another.   Other technologies used in this project were audio recorders to capture voices of the people during the interview. Camera for taking pictures and sharing through social media, as well as recording min videos. "," One of the hardest parts in this project is to reach people who are suffering from the water crisis. In order to get ​the real voices​​,​ I have to travel a lot. I use a motorcycle to get to the villages, passing on the rough road. It takes 45 kilometres to reach the intended village.     In village towns, I have to go direct in areas where people are fetching water whether in wells, ponds, rivers or springs and it can take 10 kilometres.   So I can spend more than 50 kilometers to follow the voices of the people who are facing water challenges so as to raise them and the government can take action. So going back and forth takes over 100 kilometers on a motorcycle. Sometimes the risk is too high. I hire an unknown motorcyclist and pass in the middle of the forest.   The other hardest part is: As a journalist I can't carry water in a bottle and take it to a village where they don't have that service. I feel very bad. So I have to drink the water they drink from the well. "," I believe learning is the process. Speaking with experience in my country, many journalists like to think of themselves rather than thinking of the problems that the community is facing.    We have been worried to raise the voices of development challenges that the citizens are facing. Many journalists raise the voices of leaders, financially people, musicians, politicians and others knowing that they will make money.   I believe there are journalists who raise the voices of society, but not many. I would like to see the number increase. I know many are afraid of being arrested by the government, but when you provide accurate and reliable information, you are in safe hands.   Journalists must be tough in rough conditions. I would also like journalists to learn to be creative. I reviewed the 17 sustainable development goals and decided to work on goal six which is: Ensure access to water and sanitation for all.   Through that goal, I can now produce interactive radio programs that engage people who are facing water challenges, amplify their voices and asks for government response.  We now have ten years left to reach the sustainable development goals.   So journalists have a responsibility to ensure sustainable development goals are achieved in order to leave no one behind.

This prompted the government to almost exempt residents of poor villages - or to symbolically pay the value of reconciliation - and to reduce the value of reconciliation in all governorates of Egypt. "," Initially, I used tools to scrape data from images and pdf, Google Docs, and Tabula.   Microsoft used Excel and Google Sheets to collect, clean, and analyze data.   I used the Flourish app to design interactive charts.   I chose the charts based on the answer I want to get out of the data.   Vertical parallel chart for comparison of minimum and maximum reduction.   Bubbles, to compare the most regions and governorates that have requested payment.   The vertical chart to compare the value of reconciliation - per meter - in all governorates, and use the filter in an easy way to move between all types.   We calculated the value of reconciliation if the citizen has a property of 100 meters in all governorates, and we compared it with the average annual income of the citizen in all governorates.   And then calculate the ratio of the tax value to the average annual per capita income, through the integrated columns.   And we humanized the story, with the true story of an Egyptian young man who set aside for years to buy an apartment, and postponed his marriage in order to pay for reconciliation. "," The project relied entirely on data, its comparison, and its analysis.   The data was not easily available, complete or clean.   While collecting and scraping data from more than one reliable government source, I cleaned and analyzed it.   This topic is very thorny in Egypt, and it is considered within the red lines, and that was the only story that was able to criticize the reconciliation tax on building violations, through open government data, by revealing the relationship between the value of reconciliation imposed by the government and the average actual entry of Egyptians.   This was better, of course, and safer than criticism sent, which could lead to arrest.   And of course, it's data journalism skills that take credit.     "," You can routes forbidden areas via open and available data.   You can prove the unproven by analyzing the data.

Brazil,The Intercept Brasil,Small,Participant,REPORTS SHOW THAT TAURUS MODIFIED WEAPONS WITHOUT ARMY AUTHORIZATION - AND PISTOLS FAILED,25/11/20,"Investigation, Cross-border, Politics, Corruption, Business, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights",Google Sheets," Documents obtained exclusively show that Taurus, one of the largest arms producers in Latin America, “sneaked” modified weapons sold to Brazilian police forces. The defects caused by the changes caused several accidents and even deaths. Army classified document and an action by the Public Prosecutor of Paraíba and the Justice of Goiás show that the company was not punished for defects and continues to operate. One of the president's sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, is a federal policeman, knew of the flaws, and did nothing, despite saying he advocates for the cops cause. "," Taurus weapons have been failing for decades, but only now are classified documents showing the failures and their consequences. But due to the legislation on controlled products, which prohibits the importation of weapons without the authorization of the Army, the Brazilian military and police are obliged to buy weapons from Taurus, which makes them “captive” customers of the company.   It is not possible to know the total number of people who sue the company, as it has made individual agreements, with confidentiality clauses, preventing people from giving interviews and talking about the subject.   The actions are confidential and this prevents victims from having access to each other's reports. This precludes jurisprudence. But with the publication of the reports, the victims can better serve themselves in their defenses against the company.   Furthermore, the President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, was elected campaigning for more weapons. Since he took office, he has been changing the law to meet his goals.   The Armed Forces, of which Bolsonaro is a part, tried to work to improve the sector's oversight - its responsibility. In early 2020, the Army published rules to improve enforcement, but Bolsonaro revoked these ordinances. The general who signed the measures was exonerated and left office defending the measures. The Army later admitted that it repealed rules under pressure from the government and social media. Now, prosecutors are investigating Bolsonaro's decision, which goes against what is defended by control bodies, and calls for the restoration of ordinances.   In this way, Bolsonaro's decision to put more weapons on the streets will also spread arms problems. These reports will be important for more people. "," To do this article I used traditional methods of investigation as part of work. I contacted military sources, former ministers and legislators specializing in armaments and analyzed about 5,000 pages of documents.   These documents were sent to me in confidence by 3 different sources. "," The most difficult part of this work was getting people to comment on the subject. Taurus is a very powerful company, which finances several elected politicians and has a strong lobby in the ministries of defense and public security. I tried to contact 3 different ministers, explained the serious complaint, and none of them agreed to speak on the record.   Since the company has been making deals with people who sue them and establishing confidentiality, I have lost many of my sources.   The armaments sector in Brazil is not transparent and there is little public information on enforcement and processes.   So, my challenge was to seek, over the course of four years, new sources that would help me prove what everyone suspected: that the company changed weapons models previously approved by the army and that this caused deaths and damage.   As Jair Bolsonaro and his allied base's mission is to increase the supply of weapons to the population, it is necessary to show that these weapons already have a factory defect - a deadly one. And whoever should oversee this sector - the army - does not. Politicians who should change the legislation to reinforce punishment, are elected with campaigns financed by the lobby of this company. "," As the arms sector in Brazil is not transparent and there is little public information about enforcement and prosecutions, journalists need to be extremely persistent.   People are afraid to speak. A lot of time needs to be devoted to cultivating sources and building trust.   Despite these difficulties, the arms and ammunition sector is today central to the Bolsonaro government. Journalists need to be aware and not give up.   That is why it is also important that journalists publish full documents whenever possible, so that other colleagues can build their stories.

United States,San Diego Union-Tribune,Big,Participant,Returned,24/02/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Immigration, Human rights","D3.js, CSV, R, RStudio"," ""Returned"" reveals the dysfunction of the U.S. asylum system through data analysis and human storytelling and explores ways the system could be reimagined.   The second and fourth installments of the four-part series include extensive data analysis. All of the installments were published in 2020. The final part came out on December 27, 2020.   We are including a link to the full series for judges to explore for context, and we will use the additional links to call out specifically which pieces of the series have a data focus. "," Through a year-long data analysis, international reporting trips to Nicaragua and Honduras, review of court records, public records requests for immigration documents and interviews with myriad experts who interact with the system on a regular basis, the reporting team immersed readers in the asylum system in a four-part series.   What the team revealed was an asylum system plagued since its creation by shortcomings, biases and disparities, a system that granted life-saving protection to some while returning others to their deaths.   It is the first piece of journalism to show systematically how various factors can influence asylum outcomes and weave together to create a capricious and unjust system. And, it is the first to create an interactive way for readers to experience those disparities.   The statistical analysis is the first since a 2007 academic study to show a correlation between judges’ work histories and their asylum decisions, and it is the only known journalistic endeavor to independently verify this finding.   The robust data analysis and human details of individual cases in “Returned” makes understanding the system much more accessible for all.    Immigrant rights advocates told lead reporter Kate Morrissey that they used “Returned” in conversations about asylum and the border with President Joe Biden’s transition team. Those conversations led to policy changes and legislation introduced on the first day of his administration.   “Returned” has been welcomed by professors of law and political science who are now using the series, and its interactive component based on the data analysis, as a teaching tool.   “My students and I found your work humane and rigorous, detailed and big picture, and it really brought home the enormity of the asylum process in such a vivid way,” Andrés Besserer Rayas, a New York-based professor, wrote to Morrissey after using the piece in his class. "," Using R, data reporter Lauryn Schroeder and lead reporter Kate Morrissey constructed a database from the immigration court data posted by the Executive Office for Immigration Review on its FOIA Library website.  Morrissey and Schroeder also built a database of immigration judges' biographical information based on records published by the Executive Office for Immigration Review as well as information available in news clippings, judges’ online profiles and in some cases phone calls with judges themselves.   Schroeder also used R to run the statistical tests necessary to look at discrepancies in asylum outcomes among many different variables.   Programmer Ruby Gaviola used D3 to create an interactive graphic embedded in Part II to allow readers to explore asylum outcome discrepancies among a variety of factors including the case’s location, the asylum seeker’s nationality and the year the case was decided. The visual movement of dots in the graphic as they regroup based on the reader’s selections helps the reader understand just how different these outcomes can be.    Gaviola used Twine, combined with Javascript, to create an interactive experience of the U.S. asylum system that allows readers to make decisions and see how their cases might turn out. This piece, called ""Where will you end up?"" uses gamification techniques in a way that is respectful of the seriousness of the topic.   Schroeder also used R to analyze data from the United Nations about forced displacement for the series' fourth installment. The results are available embedded in the piece in several interactive graphics created with Flourish. "," The data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review included more than 50 million rows of records and was rife with errors and missing information. Officials with the Executive Office for Immigration Review refused to provide any guidance on the database’s contents.   Few journalists have attempted to do their own analyses of this immigration court data, and fewer still have been successful.   The majority of the code has been published on GitHub so that more journalists can feel empowered to work with this data. Morrissey and Schroeder detailed the extensive issues they found in the data in the side bar “Asylum data stymied by errors, missing information.”   The task of gathering biographical information for immigration judges was also an intense effort because of the number of judges. There are hundreds who heard cases during the decade of data analyzed.   Programming the interactive experience that allows readers to make decisions and receive different outcomes was also complex. Each location, including cities, states and detention centers, where asylum seekers could end up had to be mapped to the correct immigration court, and each court had to be mapped to its possible pool of judges. The Twine infrastructure had to be modified to include randomization of certain aspects and to store readers' selections along the way in order to determine where they would end up.   In reporting the stories of asylum seekers, the reporting team had to take great care not to cause harm to their sources.   That included strategic planning for fact-checking the asylum case of a young woman from Nicaragua who worried the Ortega regime would target the family members she left behind. "," Morrissey and Schroeder published much of their R code and analysis files on GitHub to empower other journalists to work with immigration court data from the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The reporting team believes strongly that more journalists working with this data will only lead to more accountability from a government agency that, for the past four years, has manipulated statistics for political propagandizing.   Beyond this service to the furtherance of data journalism, the series also serves as an explainer for an incredibly complicated federal system.   The immigration system is one of the most complex legal systems in the country. And asylum is one of the most complicated parts of immigration law — the primer published by the American Immigration Lawyers Association to guide attorneys through asylum cases is 1,680 pages long.   Many are not aware of exactly how it works even if they have interacted with the system themselves. Government officials, lawyers and journalists often make mistakes when describing how the system operates.   ""Returned"" also serves as an example of how to cover asylum in a way that is respectful to asylum seekers and refugees. Many reporters sensationalize their stories and portray them as stereotypical victims rather than as human beings with full lives and agency. ""Returned"" is very careful not to do this.  ",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/returned,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/story/2020-08-23/who-gets-asylum-even-before-trump-system-was-riddled-with-bias-and-disparities,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/story/2020-08-23/asylum-system-interactive-experience,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/watchdog/story/2020-08-23/asylum-data-hindered-by-errors-missing-information,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/story/2020-12-27/how-could-asylum-system-be-reimagined,,,,"Kate Morrissey, Lauryn Schroeder, Ruby Gaviola, Michelle Guerrero, Nelvin Cepeda, Michelle Gilchrist, Celina Tebor, Alejandro Tamayo"," Kate Morrissey, originally from Atlanta, came to The San Diego Union-Tribune in March 2016.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,Reuters COVID-19 Global Tracker,08/09/20,"Database, News application, Chart, Health",Node.js," Getting timely information about the spread of the coronavirus and putting the mountain of statistics the pandemic generates in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. The COVID-19 Global Tracker gives readers a key tool to filter down the firehose using custom algorithms to anticipate the headlines and responsibly mark milestones, progress and resurgence in a global and local context in five languages. The tool transparently explains the statistics and the limits of the data and ultimately gives readers in 213 countries a way to hold their governments to account for their handling of the pandemic. "," The Global Tracker has become a key tool for our readers to understand the pandemic by providing a reference point for each of the 213 countries we create tracking pages for.        As the project continues, the audience has consistently grown to millions of readers every month, with especially strong growth among Japanese, French and Spanish-speakers.       The tool helps direct our global newsroom’s coverage by highlighting important developments in every country we track, especially those where local media may be less well positioned to keep track of the daily statistics.       As we move into a new phase of the pandemic, the project has a strong, consistent audience watching the rollout of vaccines in their own countries, and new data we’re currently developing will give readers key information about their access to those programs, locally. "," The Global Tracker is built entirely using serverless cloud technologies to make the project easy to maintain, especially given the scale of the data it analyzes and presents. The pages and underlying data are republished automatically many times each day to keep up with rolling data collection in Reuters newsrooms across the globe. Those pipelines are built with strong safeguards to make sure the data we’re publishing is as accurate as it can be and also helps identify irregular reporting in our original sources for our newsroom.       In terms of our analysis tools, ours was one of the first trackers to heavily promote percent of peak metrics that helped clearly identify and locally contextualize the growth of second waves of the pandemic during the autumn and winter. We’re also the only newsroom using a wide array of simple algorithms to survey data from 213 countries and highlight statistically significant developments in all of them in the dynamic headlines generated on the homepage of the project. Behind the scenes, a complete readout of those headlines and custom trend projections helps direct our newsroom’s coverage of the pandemic, and can be controlled when we know we’re getting bad or incomplete data from a primary source.       Beyond the technologies we benefited from, we created some of our own, too, and open sourced a few tricks that helped us handle sticky parts of the project like translation.       Behind the public pages, we used new static site building tools to generate hundreds more individual embeddable charts from the project, which our media partners have used to inform their audiences around the world, connected directly to our live data feeds. "," There are dozens of intractable problems that had to be overcome in the production of this project, but this was our team’s moonshot during the pandemic and the scale of the effort given the size of the group developing it may be what’s most remarkable.       The dev team was just three people. They designed and built the data visualizations, developed the statistical algorithms and smart texts that detect and explain critical daily news, led translation of the project in 5 languages, built and tested the backend pipelines and scrapers that manage a near constant feed of data and helped direct our COVID data team’s work and troubleshoot frequent reporting issues around the world.       This was also just one project during that small team’s year, and they continued reporting on critical news, COVID-related and otherwise, while maintaining the project and making sure it continued kicking over 24-hours every day. "," The pandemic is the biggest story of 2020 and newsrooms with larger graphics and development teams have clearly invested a great deal in tracking it to great effect. We like to think, though, that our project makes the case for what newsrooms with fewer resources but just as strong ambitions can accomplish using open source technologies and by making smart decisions on how to scale their efforts.       From a technical point of view, that meant establishing new development patterns for complex data pipelines; using cheaper, lower-maintenance technologies to build an immense news application with over 1,000 individual live-updating pages for our readers and media clients; and writing the questions we brought to the data as journalists into simple, auditable algorithms that could detect their answers and translate them quickly for readers in all the languages we produced.       From a project management perspective, our team was spread across countries and continents. The coordination between the core dev team (in 3 different countries), the data collection teams both in-house and at third party organizations, and the production and editorial teams at Reuters was full of practical lessons for newsdev and graphics teams attempting a project at this scale.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,Revealed: the areas in the UK with one Airbnb for every four homes,20/02/20,"Investigation, Database, News application, Map, Economy","D3.js, QGIS, CSV, Node.js"," For this exclusive analysis, I cross-referenced a database of 250,000 Airbnb listings across Great Britain with official housing stock figures to identify places where the rate of listings to homes was disproportionately high. Static and interactive graphics in the story showed readers the national picture and let them explore the figures for their local area.   The analysis was then followed up with on-the-ground reporting from hotspots in England and Scotland, which revealed that the high proportion of short-term rentals drives up property prices, disrupts local communities and often leads young locals to leave the areas in question. "," The main article made the <a href=""https://twitter.com/guardian/status/1230613097934663682?lang=en"">front page of the print paper</a> and was viewed more than 200,000 times online. Following publication I was invited on two national radio shows to discuss the findings of the analysis. The broadcasters also invited people living near Airbnb hotspots and property owners to call into the show which led to some very interesting debates.   Our investigation also sparked renewed political calls for more regulation for short-term rentals in the UK. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/21/airbnb-call-english-councils-powers-regulate-caroline-lucas"">Prompted by our exclusive story</a>, Green MP Caroline Lucas said local councils should be given the power to impose a 90-day cap on homes let out on Airbnb and similar platforms.   Our story was also picked up by <a href=""https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18251729.concerns-raised-out-control-airbnb-expansion-edinburgh/"">local media in Scotland</a> where we identified the highest Airbnb rates in the country. "," Listings data was provided by activist project <a href=""http://insideairbnb.com/index.html"">Inside Airbnb</a> which regularly scrapes the Airbnb website.   The figures were then cross-referenced with official housing stock figures at a very small geographic level -- so called Middle Super Output Areas in England and Wales, and Intermediate Zones in Scotland. This allowed me to calculate the rate of Airbnbs at a neighbourhood level, using QGIS and Node.js.   I also ran various quality checks on the data. For example, Airbnb claims that the exact location of apartments on its website can be falsified by up to a few hundred metres for privacy reasons. To see whether this could distort my data analysis, I randomly shifted each listing by a few hundred metres myself and ran my statistics again, which didn't materially change the local figures or the list of worst-affected areas.   Static maps were created in QGIS and Illustrator and the interactive embed was created on the basis of QGIS exports. The interactive embed also features a postcode lookup (try inputting  NW54DE,  for example). "," As mentioned above, one of the most involved parts of the project was checking the vast source dataset for all kinds of potential flaws. These challenges ranged from defining ‘active’ Airbnb listings to confirming the geographic accuracy of our analysis. Another challenge was merging separate housing figures for England, Scotland and Wales.   Overall I believe the project should be selected because it was the first time anyone conducted this kind of investigation at a national level, because we approached the source data with a healthy amount of scepticism and worked hard to rule out potential problems in the headline figures, and because we followed up the data analysis with powerful on-the-ground reporting.   Finally, a lot of work went into designing both static and interactive graphics that would enrich the storytelling experience. I ended up with a very straightforward static map that could go near the top of the piece, while the interactive 'postcode finder' embed was designed to be fairly small in its collapsed form, making it easily skippable for people who just want to read the national story. This concept of initially following a journalist-driven angle before allowing the reader to explore the data interactively is sometimes referred to as 'martini glass' format. "," One of the main takeaways from this project for me was how powerful the combination of data analysis and on-the-ground reporting really is.   Sometimes traditional journalists fall into the trap of talking to a handful of people and trying to extrapolate a wider ‘trend’ from very anecdotal reports. In data journalism we sometimes have the opposite problem -- we analyse a large national dataset and write extensively about places or population groups that we haven’t actually visited or spoken to first-hand.   This project was a great example of combining the two steps. After identifying (and double-checking) the top 10 Airbnb hotspots in the country, news editors assigned reporters based outside of London to visit two of the worst affected places on the list -- Edinburgh and north Devon. The <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/20/summer-rentals-to-pay-off-the-mortgage-the-village-changed-by-airbnb"">article on north Devon</a> in particular painted a very nuanced picture of the local situation and communicated the scale of the issue so much better than a purely data-driven article written from our London office ever could.  ",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/20/revealed-the-areas-in-the-uk-with-one-airbnb-for-every-four-homes,,,,,,,,"Niko Kommenda, Helen Pidd and Libby Brooks"," Niko Kommenda is a visual projects editor at the Guardian, using data and interactive graphics to cover issues from environment and health to inequality in housing and infrastructure.

In this investigation, Emma revealed significant new information about deals done by the UK government to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing equipment. She exposed details of huge contracts being handed to dormant companies – and one £186m PPE deal awarded to a firm whose multi-millionaire owner is listed as a speaker for an influential pro-Brexit lobby group associated with cabinet ministers in the UK. "," Emma’s rigorous reporting exposed allegations of cronyism and a lack of government transparency, and prompted demands for a public inquiry into the UK government’s spending under emergency Covid-19 procurement powers. This investigation revealed previously hidden information about one of the most significant areas of public spending for decades, placing scrutiny on the government. The story led Apple News’ coveted top story spot and had among the highest readership figures seen by HuffPost UK for an investigation of this type: almost 750,000 page views.

Influential watchdog the Public Accounts Committee has since criticised the government over this lack of transparency, vindicating Emma’s work.    A High Court legal case is currently underway in the UK challenging the government over its alleged repeated failure to publish details of these coronavirus-related contracts, collectively worth tens of billions of pounds. The case claims this failure was unlawful and in breach of the government’s own transparency rules. "," Emma initially submitted Freedom of Information requests to the UK government to try to obtain data about Covid-19 spending. Even though these contracts should be published within statutory deadlines, which had passed, the government refused these FOI requests. So, instead, Emma sought out and worked with an independent data provider to produce a dataset of deals done by the government under emergency Covid-19 procurement powers. These powers have proved very controversial in the UK, not least because of the lack of transparency surrounding this spending.    The data provider, Tussell, aggregated data on government contracts from disparate sources through a mixture of web scraping and APIs. Its sources included Contracts Finder, OJEU, FTS, Public Contracts Scotland, Sell2Wales and over 70 local portals. Tussell then algorithmically matches data to company information and aggregates it into a clean, searchable dataset.   Emma worked with this dataset in MS Excel, using sort functions and pivot tables to identify trends such as which companies had received the highest spends. Emma then cross-referenced this data with other public sources to identify significant lines of reporting.  "," Emma doggedly pursued details of these contracts but the data was difficult to obtain and took months of work. When the government refused FOIs, she approached an independent data provider who worked with HuffPost UK to reveal the billions in public money spent on PPE and testing. She then forensically cross-referenced the data with Companies House records, hospital trusts' spending records, and other public information to identify deals that raised red flags.   The investigation focused on a very technical area of government procurement. Emma had identified there was a problem with public records and transparency about this spending during her earlier reporting about contracting for the Nightingale hospitals in the UK.    For this earlier story, she persistently asked NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care over many weeks to name the private contractors that built the Nightingales. As they stalled, Emma scoured public contracts databases but could find no record of the spending. She then challenged the failure to publish these contracts within statutory deadlines, highlighting that the government was potentially in breach of the law.    Emma spoke with legal and procurement experts to better understand what information should be in the public domain and where the government was potentially in breach of the law. Once she had done this, she set about trying to establish how many contracts had been issued under these powers, which was the starting point for this broader investigation. "," This investigation shines a spotlight on the scale of government spending during the coronavirus pandemic. It puts data into the public domain that other journalists can benefit from, with a searchable table of the Top 50 deals included in the article. But over and above this, the journalism highlights an area of government spending that continues to be a rich seam of reporting within the UK. Anger over alleged “cronyism” is still very much at the forefront of public concern around the UK government’s pandemic response.   The journalism also shows tenacity and persistence in seeking out data from alternative sources if it is not being made available by governments. And finally, Emma places this spending data in context, clearly highlighting why some deals are controversial, identifying trends within the data but also comparing these huge deals to other areas of public spending so that the multi-million pound figures hold context for the reader.

Japan,Nikkei Inc.,Big,Participant,Satellite data shed light on massive sinkhole in Tokyo,17/12/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Documentary, Database, Illustration, Chart, Video, Map, Satellite images","Animation, Sensor, D3.js, QGIS, Canvas, CSV, Python, Node.js","<h1>Satelite data shed light on deep underground</h1> <h3>A section of road collapsed suddenly in a quiet residential area of Tokyo. By analyzing satellite Interferometric SAR data, Nikkei found that the ground level around the sinkhole warped soon after deep underground construction work took place. The cave-in happened following these movements in the surface.    In Japan, companies can develop the “deep underground” space without the consent of landowners above. This is the first time that detailed data have indicated that deep underground construction may affect residents’ daily lives. The day after Nikkei’s report, the highway operator acknowledged impact of the construction.</h3>","<h2>Impact on Japan's infrastructure</h2>  Residents protested and demanded explanations from the highway operator. The Outer Ring Road that related to the incident is a highway designed to cut traffic congestion in the metropolitan area, but construction is halted because of the accident. No one knows when the construction will be completed. The maglev bullet train project, which will connect Tokyo and Osaka, has been forced to review its safety measures because it too plans to use deep underground space.  <h2>Blind spots in the law revealed</h2>  On December 21, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism said, ""It is regrettable that the shield tunnel construction has caused damage to residents."" In Japan, in 2001 it became possible to develop ""deep underground,"" which is deeper than 40 meters, without the consent of the landowners. The goal was to effectively use underground space. However, the impact on the earth’s surface became apparent for the first time in 20 years, forcing Japanese society to rethink the safety of this measure.  <h2>Compensation may grow</h2>  After the news broke, the highway operator acknowledged the impact of the accident, apologized, and announced a policy of compensation for residents. Before construction it had said ""the ground surface will not be affected."" The company, which did not have Interferometric SAR data, announced that it had confirmed a pinpoint subsidence using a ground survey after Nikkei’s report.   Nikkei’s analysis confirmed a wider range of depressions existed in the area, ranging from directly above the tunnel site to the other side of a nearby river. The highway operator had not been able to find the ground swellings that Nikkei showed. Members of the panel of experts investigating the accident have called for new investigations using Interferometric SAR, which may grow the compensation beyond the highway operator’s assumptions.  ","<h2> Half a year with   Interferometric SAR </h2>  Nikkei analyzed Interferometric SAR data of an area around the collapse that measured 530 meters east-west, and 870 meters north-south. Changes were analyzed and visualized in millimeters every 11 days starting from April 8, when tunnel construction had not yet begun underground.   Some of the Interferometric SARs that are used for commercial purposes can only measure fluctuations of several centimeters or more. In this analysis, Nikkei worked with TRE Altamira of Italy to employ a technology that can measure the ground plane in millimeters by accurately using the position and orientation of satellites.  <h2> Visualization on a map </h2>  Using deck.gl (a library that visualizes geographic data created by Uber), we created an analysis tool that displays changes on a map. At first, all the data was put on the map, but after consulting with the engineers and the reporters, Nikkei eliminated erroneous data. Nikkei indicated depressions of 1 cm or more with red dots, and uplifts of 1 cm or more with blue dots.     <h2> Expressed by animation </h2>  By showing an animated time-series of the changes, it became clear that the ground began sinking soon after the machine passed deep underground. Prior to that there were almost no changes for half a year. The condition of depressions and uplifts is also represented on the chart. It is clear that the maximum subsidence depth exceeds 3 cm. A 24-second video showing the overall impact of the construction and what happened in chronological order helped readers to understand what the events. Based on the analysis, Nikkei spent a month verifying the accuracy of the data. Visualizations and videos were completed in almost one day.  ","<h3>We opened a new page for investigative journalism by publishing a more thorough report than that of the highway operator and the government in a shorter amount of time. Using millimeter-scale fluctuation data instead of satellite images to uncover facts is a world-leading example of satellite journalism.</h3>  The hardest aspect of this project was the verifying the accuracy of the data.  <h2> Show data to the parties </h2>  We showed data to multiple government officials and members of the expert committee examining the incident to confirm whether there were any discrepancies with the highway operator’s investigation results. The various parties endorsed Nikkei’s results, saying, ""This Nikkei investigation cannot be denied. You can present it with confidence."" Nikkei also received an inquiry as to whether it could sell the data.  <h2> Speaking with 100 households </h2>  We visited about 100 households and received detailed accounts from half. Nikkei noted these accounts and inspected cracks in buildings and surrounding structures. Residents felt vibrations and heard noises at the same time when the data showed depressions and uplifts occurring. In addition, Nikkei confirmed that manholes had risen up, utility poles were tilted, and walls were cracked in areas where the data showed the greatest depressions.  <h2> Survey with experts </h2>  Nikkei also showed the data to experts in geology and tunnel construction who have no direct interest in the accident investigation. They confirmed the possibility that the analysis results were plausible considering the surface conditions in the area. Furthermore, Nikkei went to the area with one of the experts and confirmed that the data and the actual ground surface fluctuations were linked. ","<h3> This project demonstrates the possibilities for satellite data usage in journalism and the importance of teamwork. </h3> <h2> Usefulness of alternative data </h2>  The use of satellites in journalism has focused on images, but we have demonstrated that millimeter-scale data from Interferometric SARs can also be a powerful tool. Interferometric SARs can visualize changes that the human eye overlooks and help find the truth behind them. It is a new step in reporting using alternative data.   Interferometric SAR is used, for example, to measure the ground subsidence due to excessive oil excavation at oil drilling sites. The technology of capturing changes using fixed point observation fits well with journalism, which seeks the truth in a timely manner regardless of the weather.   Because it is satellite data, measuring equipment does need to be installed on the ground, and fluctuations can be verified retroactively even in dangerous places that people cannot enter . Alternative data extends the horizon of data journalism.  <h2> Gift of teamwork </h2>  Fortunately for our team, Nikkei’s R&D department had an established hotline with an Italian company that had satellite data for that area. In addition, the R&D department and reporters have been collaborating on a daily basis to grow Nikkei’s innovative initiatives. Through these collaborations, the data to be analyzed was accessible the day after the sinkhole occurred.   In addition, Nikkei assembled members from the permanent investigative journalism team and the local news section immediately. They gathered reporting from all directions simultaneously, including field interviews, meeting with experts, and contacting the relevant parties.   No matter how good data analysis is, a story that neglects on-the-ground voices and those of the concerned parties cannot be persuasive. It is important to go back and forth between the site and the data many times to reach the truth.

Germany,none/student project,Small,Participant,Search and Rescue missions in the Central Mediterranean,15/01/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Cross-border, Open data, OSINT, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Immigration, Human rights","Scraping, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, OpenStreetMap"," In 2019, despite fewer total crossings, the Central Mediterranean route was deadlier than any of the previous four years: more than one in 20 people migrating from Northern Africa to Europe on this route died at sea. Combining graphics, sonifications and analysis, our project presented this data in the context of efforts from different governments to stop Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in the area. By reconstructing different vessels' historical operations, we could show that political decisions led to a decrease in NGO-run SAR vessel presence. We put the increased death rate into a context no data existed in before. "," As a student project, it did not have a large reach or impact. However, we received feedback that it had inspired fellow students to use simple tools in ways they had not thought of before, especially in increasing the accessibility of data visualisations for blind consumers.   As offered in the Sigma Award Rules, we would like to be considered for a ""Young Talent"" prize (but couldn't find a designated field to indicate it in this online form) "," We retrieved data on the operational status of vessels for each month from January 2014 until December 2019. Sources included news reports, position data from a marine position data portal, reports from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, updates from the NGOs' own websites and social media posts featuring information or images of the vessels in question. For data on numbers of crossings and deaths, we scraped numbers from the IOM's missing migrants dashboard.   Using D3.js we created graphs of both the deadliness figures as well as the monthly numbers of vessels by operational status. The latter we also translated into a data sonification instead of just a visualization, which we created with TwoTone and added annotations with a voice-over. Also, using Adobe Illustrator we created illustrations of each SAR vessel, based on photographs and scaled to size using marine registry information about vessel sizes, to create a gallery of all ships that were active between 2014 and 2019. Lastly, we created a custom map of the area with Adobe Photoshop, based on Creative Commons map tiles. "," A large part of the project was manually researching and gathering data on the operational statuses of the vessels. We created an original data set of monthly data on more than 20 ships covering five years, and did so by looking for records of each vessel in different open and closed sources, like social media and news reports, but also location data from a marine traffic platform.   Another challenge was finding ways to present the data in a non-visual way to make the content available to blind people and people with low vision, something that data journalism often fails to attend to. Firstly, we embedded the data underlying graphs as structured html tables for screen-reader users to scan themselves (embedded in the page as to avoid the extra-steps of downloading and having to open another file). The more complex line graph, which features two data rows and annotations for historical context, was turned into a data-sonification with voice-over. We also included the quite detailed annotations of the linechart as a text-based timeline.   Because (for us), it wasn't possible to include the information for screenreader-users into the layout with visual graphics, we decided to provide two separate versions of the website - one with visuals, and one optimized for screen-reader users. As visual hierarchies of elements, e.g. by vibrant colors, don't influence the order in which screen-readers translate the content of a website, it was important for the element which should be read first to sit (discreetly) at the very top of the website. These things we figured out through an iterative process with constant feedback from our team member who uses a screenreader, and we would love to see this kind of process be a normal part of developing projects in the industry. "," This project shows that data journalism should not limit itself to reporting statistics that are ready and openly accessible, but that there is value in gathering data and creating relevant datasets ourselves if needed. It is also an example for expanding the idea of data journalism beyond data visualizations, including other forms of representation like sonification and audio narration, which is currently hardly seen outside podcasts. Lastly, we think it shows that even with very limited resources and skills (as we were just a group of three students on our first data journalism class with no organizational support from a newsroom) it is possible to communicate a complex topic in an interesting and engaging way, when using tools creatively - as we did with including decorative-informative illustrations and the sonification. The project also shows that where there is a will there is a way - and even without any resources or examples of screenreader-accessible graphics we managed to find solutions by researching, improvising, testing and iterating.

Ireland,"The Business Post, Noteworthy.ie",Small,Participant,Selling Our Genes,04/10/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Infographics, Chart, Health","Animation, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap","Selling Our Genes is an investigative collaboration taht u into private sector access of public sector researchers and patient DNA by two national Irish media outlets - the Irish community-led crowdfunded platform, Noteworthy.ie, and Sunday newspaper, the Business Post. Concerns had been raised by patient groups about issues with consent and data ownership, in particular in relation to one study that intended to collect genetic data on over 9,000 brain tumour patients without consent. Our project was the first to delve into the controversial public-private partnership, reveal the extent of the connections and highlight concerns by patients, researchers and policy"," The investigation showed the extent to which a private company has developed a network of arrangments that give it access to a vast amount of publicly-held genomic data in Ireland, which is in turn used for commercial gain.   By trawling through publicly available information and submitting numerous freedom of information (FOI) and press requests, the investigation revealed that Genuity Science, the main company involved in DNA sequencing in Ireland, has at least 25 links to facilities around Ireland. These include funding and collaborations with major hospitals, universities, research facilities and charities.   The state took action against the company's plans to harvet genomic data from 9,000 patients by increasing the scope for patients (and their families) to opt out of this research.     The investigation also highlighted policy gaps such as the lack of Government policy and adequate regulation resulting in private companies having no limit on how long they have exclusive access to the data they collect from Irish patients.   The findings of SELLING OUR GENES were discussed by influential politicians, researchers and patients groups following publication. For example, the leader of one of the main Government opposition parties, the Social Democrats, said that SELLING OUR GENES was “a really important piece of in-depth journalism about how a private sector company got access to vast amounts of our DNA”.     "," Records gathered via Freedom of Information requests and information supplied by hospitals, universities and charities were translated into visualisations on Flourish:   https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/3833445/   https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/3834713/   The information is available open access to all members of the public so it can be used to show how Irish patient data is being used by private companies for commercial gain.   Google Drive was also used to make documents obtained via Freedom of Information requests available to the public. "," The investigation took more than three months to complete.   The main obstacle we faced was gaining access to the publicly-held documents due to push back from state organisations, hospitals, universities and charities. Many of these groups that had links to private sector were reluctant to release the data held on file that should be released through Freedom of Information laws. We contested decisions by certain bodies that sought to restrict our access to records on file and eventually secured access.   Once we had received the documentation and records we required, the next big obstacle was translating all this data into a format that would communicate our findings to the reader and a compelling narrative that explained a complex topic. "," Journalists who read our project, which involed gathering a lot of data, records and files, would learn from how we explained a very complex narrative to the reader.    Rather than honing in solely on the particulars of the contracts, deals and arrangements a private company has cut to gain access to Irish patient data, we used the data we gathered as a starting point to tell the stories of those affected by the grip the private sector has over Irish genomic data. Our approach meant our reporting was grounded in solid data, but showed the true effects of what we uncovered.   Additionally, any journalist who reads our project would also likely see our project as ripe for replication in their own country. The use of genomic data for commercial gain is developing in many countries, and it is a largely untold story.   ",https://www.noteworthy.ie/selling-our-genes-5219781-Oct2020/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gnAhZSoq_QKKTBDxWZj3IEziGA_IU4NI/view?usp=sharing,https://www.noteworthy.ie/selling-our-genes-ucd-agreement-5220753-Oct2020/,https://www.noteworthy.ie/selling-our-genes-public-project-5220771-Oct2020/,,,,,"Maria Delaney, Barry J Whyte, Killian Woods"," Maria Delaney is an investigative journalist who is a health specialist with experience in the pharmaceutical industry.

United States,Reuters,Big,Participant,Shielded: How an obscure legal doctrine called qualified immunity protects police accused of excessive force,08/05/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Video, Politics, Crime, Human rights","D3.js, R, PostgreSQL"," In an unprecedented, data-driven analysis of some 1,000 U.S. court decisions, Reuters revealed how a legal doctrine called qualified immunity insulates police from having to compensate victims of brutality. A 50-year-old creation of the Supreme Court, the legal defense is meant to protect government employees from frivolous litigation, but Reuters found it shields cops even when judges think they used force that could be considered excessive. The Reuters analysis of some 1,000 court decisions also found that the doctrine is applied unevenly, depending on where the victims live and that the obstacles to justice are especially pronounced for Black citizens. "," The series had political and legal impact in the months after it published as the United States grappled with widespread protest over police tactics. U.S. Reps. Ayanna Pressley and Justin Amash introduced the “Ending Qualified Immunity Act” in June.  In a press release announcing the new bill, Pressley cited our findings.    Our work was cited in the first congressional hearing that examined racial injustice and police brutality following George Floyd’s death. Sherillyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund highlighted Reuters’ investigative findings in written testimony.   Our findings have been cited in multiple petitions at the Supreme Court, a Supreme Court amicus brief, an appeal before the 10th circuit, three university law journals, and a legal textbook.   Our work also was cited by dozens of news organizations in the U.S. and elsewhere, including the Australian Associated Press, BBC News, and France’s Le Monde. The New York Times newsroom, opinion page and Editorial Board all separately highlighted our findings.   John Oliver referenced the series in a segment about police reform. SCOTUSBlog, a well-read site that probes the inner workings of the Supreme Court, profiled our reporters and their work. <a href=""https://www.scotusblog.com/2020/05/ask-the-author-reuters-on-the-consequences-of-qualified-immunity-for-police-officers/"">LINK</a> And the Washington Post interviewed one of our reporters for a video explainer about qualified immunity. "," We compiled three databases, to understand how qualified immunity plays out in all three levels of the U.S. judicial system – district courts, appellate courts and the Supreme Court -- ultimately recording facts about more than 1,000 judicial decisions.   For each judicial decision in our database, reporters recorded dozens of facts about the case, such as whether the civilian was armed, the type of force officers used, and whether the civilian was injured or died in the encounter with police. We also recorded whether the court granted qualified immunity and some specifics about that decision.   Our reporters used R and SQL Server to analyze the data and tested all data findings against a binomial logistic regression model to confirm that our findings were statistically significant, robust, and could not be explained away by variations in other details about each case. For example, the increase in qualified immunity grants over time was significant and could not be attributed to other differences, such as which circuits heard the cases.   Our visual editors dived into the data, as well, sorting it in ways that enabled us to explain the courts’ rulings.   To create a process diagram, we used R to categorize the information into tranches and a custom drawing algorithm to generate the Sankey lines. Svelte was used for the scrollytelling interface,   D3 to make visualizations in canvas.   We also used police video as data, editing lengthy camera footage down to significant seconds in time. Those were integrated into the story to make fluid pauses, allowing readers a window into the moments when police brutality was captured on tape. We used color to link videos and data. We also used Datawrapper, Illustrator and AI2HTML. "," The primary obstacle was the lack of structured data that could reveal insights into how qualified immunity plays out in the court system. We had to build our own by reviewing more than 1,000 lawsuits claiming excessive force by police.   While we were able to reasonably identify relevant lawsuits at the appellate level, there was no standard way to identify cases at the district level. We received raw docket listings from Westlaw, another Thomson Reuters company. That data, with more than 90 million entries, has no field or code that signifies a case involved qualified immunity. Because of that, our data reporters went through a tedious process of identifying potential cases and building queries that would flag likely suspects.   From there, the team read and reviewed thousands of cases to whittle our universe to hundreds of relevant opinions. Because court documents are unstructured, we had to create our own structured database, where we coded dozens of elements for each case to allow for quantitative analysis. This process was extremely time consuming and difficult, as individual lawyers and judges structure arguments and opinions differently. Relevant information was often buried deep on the docket, requiring reporters to read multiple documents and dig through exhibits for each case.   After analyzing the data we amassed, we then had to explain the workings of a complex legal doctrine to readers. By working closely with our visual editors, we were able to develop an engaging, easy to follow animation that accomplished that without the need for dense text. "," Our project offers several important take-aways for other journalists:   1.      If people are bemoaning a lack of data, that can be a great opportunity for data journalists. This project got started when Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor, in a written dissent, faulted her colleagues for overwhelmingly favoring police petitions for immunity in excessive force lawsuits. Justice Samuel Alito shot back that Sotomayor had no data supporting her view. That’s where we stepped in.   2.      Don’t be dissuaded by a lack of structured data. It’s a lot of hard work, but sometimes unstructured data – court opinions in this case – can be reviewed, categorized and turned into tables for analysis.   3.      Think creatively about presenting complex concepts and findings. It would have been very hard for readers to grasp ours if we had not produced our animation that stepped through the process judges follow in deciding cases and showed how the Supreme Court’s rulings resulted in cops winning immunity more often.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,Shifting smoke,17/09/20,"Explainer, Illustration, Infographics, Satellite images, Environment, Health","Animation, D3.js, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite"," Reuters visualised smoke released into the atmosphere during the fires across California in late summer. The smoke contains a substantial portion of fine particulate matter known by the particles’ size as PM2.5, which can have a major impact on people’s health. The animation built from millions of data points clearly showed the smoke travelled thousands of miles east, turning skies from New York to Washington D.C. hazy and reaching as far as the skies above Britain. "," It was shared widely on social media and received high readership traffic. It also showed the extent of how far the fires affected the world. Readers assumed the problem was restricted to far flung California, but in reality, the impact of the fire was affecting countries on different continents.  "," This project drew on a range of techniques from satellite derived data work to reporting over the phone and talking to experts. We wanted to accurately map and show readers exactly where this smoke was going and explain why.   For the main smoke map animation, we downloaded hundreds of data files from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office and filtered out any unwanted pollutants. We visualised only atmospheric organic carbon, or basically smoke from fires. We were able to plot gridded data showing the density of smoke in the air. Each frame was exported from QGIS and styled in Adobe After Effects.   Smoke from the fires has also pushed the limits vertically, reaching altitudes previously unseen, according to NASA. When extreme fires generate enough heat, it is propelled into the atmosphere creating thunderstorms.   That happened on Sept. 7, when huge storm clouds – known as pyrocumulonimbus – rose to a height of more than 15 kilometers, punching into the stratosphere.    We illustrated this by downloading, reformatting, and plotting data from a NASA satellite called CALIPSO. This satellite sends laser pulses to measure light scattered back to it from particles in the atmosphere. Our visualization shows a cross section of the atmosphere on that record-breaking day and explains what the particles are, such as aerosol smoke, clouds, or ice particles. "," Extracting and making sense of the often confusing raw satellite-derived data files was a challenge. This data did not arrive in a mappable or plottable structure so it had to be reformatted.    Tying all of this complicated data together in a story and making it understandable to regular readers proved to be difficult. However, the piece turned into an immersive visual project which is one of the most in-depth explanations and analysis on the smoke from the fires in California. "," One of the strengths of this piece is how it uses such complex data, yet visualises and explains the subject in an understandable and easy to digest way.

For this project, we gathered some 20,000 listings over two years on rent.591.com.tw, one of Taiwan’s top online real estate agencies, to study changes in the shopfront rental market in the country’s six major municipalities. "," Beginning in March 2020, one could easily detect an increase in the number of “To Let” signs in the streets of Taipei, Taiwan’s capital. We sought to verify what we saw by using concrete figures and expanded our outlook toward other five major cities around the island. Our goal was to help readers get a comprehensive view of the climate in which Taiwan’s shopfront rental market found itself and feel the impact of the pandemic on Taiwan’s economy.    "," We used Python, the popular web crawler, to retrieve data from one of Taiwan’s largest online rental agencies and turned it into charts and graphs.    "," In the past, discussions about rentals in Taiwan tended to focus on the residential part of the market. The release of data and discourse on shopfront rentals have been few and far between. After obtaining the raw material, we were able to categorize according to the size of the premises to let or the number of days each shopfront was available for example, and cross analyze the information in order to present aspects lacking in previous news reports.    "," As rental data used to be provided only by real estate agents, the fact that we used a computer program to retrieve and analyze data from a rental service website means that, in a way, we were able to regain control of data and the right to its interpretation instead of using second-hand information interpreted by others.     ",https://www.cna.com.tw/project/20200520-inauguraladdress/,,,,,,,,"Lee Yi-ying, Sung Yu-tai, Lin Chi, Chen Ying-yu, Huang Shu-fang"," The Central News Agency launched its Media Lab in July 2018 to cope with new challenges that come with the digital era.

Reuters produced a novel storytelling graphic to depict and contextualize just how large this area actually is and give readers a true sense of scale for the fires. "," Nearly every Australian summer, the country’s landscape is engulfed in bushfires. But the scale of how big these fires are rarely truly shown. Coverage can sometimes be skewed towards California’s perennial problem, which receives a lot of attention. We were able to bring the issue to mainstream attention and show, purely based on size, Australia’s problem dwarfs that of California’s.    This project was shared widely on social media and received high readership on Reuters platforms.    The novel format of stacked scrolling squares has since been replicated by other news organisations covering fires. "," We used Ai2html, an illustrator plug-in to create this graphic.

The report presents numerical data and evidence on the subject while attempting to illustrate the different paths used by smugglers to deceive the authorities. all stakeholders have been called upon to address the issue in a comprehensive manner and with unique and relevant data.  "," This report motivated more aggressive decisions by the national authorities which ended up undoing the structure of the main place for the sale of smuggled alcoholic drinks in Maputo which is the Estrela market which, for many years, everything that happens in the place was ignored by the authorities. There was also a greater tightening of the tax stamp on imported alcohol bottles, while the tax authorities saw some improvement in their conditions and means of combating smuggling, especially across the Ressano Garcia border.  "," Technically speaking I didn't need much to do the report because I just had to use my tape recorder and have it constantly recording, and the fact that I was a journalist belonging to a public media to try to see if I could convince the different actors to talk. Of course, sympathy and insistence are indispensable factors to be able to get any information from state officials.  Clearly, the other actors, especially the analysts who were called upon to give their opinion, were attracted to speak for the relevance of the issue to be addressed.  "," In Mozambique it is almost impossible to obtain testimonies from customs officials because any matter is delegated to the spokesperson of the entity to pronounce, although he is not the person on the ground who is directly involved with the problem. I had to travel a distance of more than a hundred kilometres from Maputo to the border area, where for two days I managed to convince the security force agents to talk about their daily lives in the fight against smuggling.   "," As a lesson to be learned from this report I can say that perseverance is very important in order to achieve plausible results. it is always important to look for relevant data and try to translate the numbers to ensure that people do not just listen to numbers but have a clear idea of the real impact of a certain loss on their life and on the real economy of the country. Numbers are important but their importance is only visible if they are humanised. I have also noticed that with this work I have been able to push for a visible change in some of the realities favourable to smuggling in Mozambique.  Another important fact is that the greater the reach of your information channel, the greater the impact caused by the information conveyed by the same channel.

Brazil,Revista AzMina,Small,Participant,Specialized Women's Police Stations Map in Brazil,20/10/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, Infographics, Map, Women, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap"," Domestic violence is a big issue in Brazil: in 2020, one woman was killed each <a href=""https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2020/10/10/uma-mulher-e-morta-a-cada-nove-horas-durante-a-pandemia-no-brasil"" target=""_blank"">9 hours</a>. One of the public actions to fight it are the Women’s Specialized Police Stations, where women can seek specialized support to denounce violence and have access to protective measures. The project checked which are the Specialized Stations really working in Brazil, contacting each one of them, and created a map for women to have easy access to it. It led to the information that only 7% of cities in the country have at least one .   "," The project had great repercussions in national  media, being mentioned in more than 30 publications, in journalistic sites and television, leading to more awareness of the population about the real importance of the police stations and also about the problem of the lack of their implementation.     About one month after the publication of the project, a Law Project was presented to the Congress by Congresswoman Elcione Barbalho requesting that women facing domestic violence can have support in the public defense in the cities where there are no Specialized Police Stations.    And the map has been helping women access the help they need, when it is available. More than 2,5 thousand women used it on our website. And it is also available in the app Penhas, which helps women facing domestic violence and has around 5,5 thousand users. And the database, which is open and available for free online, have been used by other initiative that help women in Brazil, like Mapa do Acolhimento. "," Before the beginning of data collection, our data specialist organized the methodology and set up an excel table for the survey.    We started with public information requisition to all the 26 brazilian states governments, requesting the number of specialized police stations, their addresses, hours of functioning, and special measures taken during the pandemy.    Three reporters then called all the 429 stations indicated by the government, at least three times and in different periods of the day. The policers were asked a series of questions to confirm the information given by the State. All the calls were recorded and the data gathered set on the excel spreadsheet.    After all the calls, we analysed the data and compared it to other statistical data of the country, like numbers of population, number of cities and violence against women numbers.    The table was then transformed in a map, via wordpress and google maps, and the analysed data became the journalistic report and infography and panphlet with QR code to access the map which was distributed to be displayed in public areas.   "," Brazil is a continental country and it has no centralized organization of public information. There is nowhere women can find easily information about public services available and there was almost no data about Women’s specialized Police Stations. At the same time, domestic violence numbers are high and specialists, government and media are always saying to women to seek help. But where can they seek help? And is this help really available?    The purpose of the project was to answer those questions and make information accessible to everyone.    The verification process was complex and involved four journalists and one data specialist. We had to call all the 26 states, and then all the 429 stations, resulting in more than 1000 calls. Besides, the information sent by the governments was not accurate: many of the numbers and addresses were wrong - 29 of the stations that we were able to reach weren’t even specialized, but regular police stations.   The project united data journalism and service for the community, denouncing one problem of public service, which enriched public debate and led to the discussion of solutions, and at the same time, giving women tools to deal with their problem.     And at the end, we made all the information available for anyone who would like to use it: organizations that help women and journalists who cover the theme. "," First, we believe that doubting of information offered by the State is one of the lessons learned. Government may say they offer some service for the citizens, but it is the hole of journalism to doubt and check it. Another lesson is that good data journalism is transparent and makes everything - methodology, processes and data gathered - available for anyone who would like to see and use it.    Finally, it is not enough to verify some data and transform it into numbers and analysis - it is important to remember that the data may be useful for the population in other forms. It's important to tell that only 7% of cities have a Specialized Police Station, but it is also important to let people know what those cities are and all the information about the stations. And, if possible, transform it in something everyone, not only specialists, can understand and navigate, like a map.  ",https://azmina.com.br/reportagens/so-7-das-cidades-brasileiras-contam-com-delegacia-da-mulher/,https://azmina.com.br/projetos/delegacia-da-mulher/,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dzztJ_rt5eKEUEHzXGGdXxG9b1Ozjf0HWzBsjC80bl8/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,,"Helena Bertho, Gabi Coelho, Rayanne Moura, Thais Fôlego, Larissa Ribeiro, Carolina Herrera, Carolina Oms"," AzMina is a independent  no profit media organization, launched in 2015 with the purpose of fighting gender violence with inforamtiona and technology.

To guarantee accuracy, we had to extensively go through official government websites as well as press releases, documents and papers for fact checking. After getting all the data, the problem became how to categorize it. Since countries having taken some similar measures, we could categorize them as one type of category, such as school closure. However, measures like lockdowns were pretty different from country to country. Therefore, before categorizing, we standardized the definition of each measure, which have been explained at the end of the project page. "," We believe the technique of dealing with timeline is the most valuable lesson we’ve learned from this project.

Public documents obtained by the transparency of the bodies were essential to understand and give weight to the reports. "," 1 - The State Attorney for Children and Teenagers of the State of Amazonas opened an investigation officially about the complaints against the swimming coach and president of the local Swimming Federation.   2 - The principal technician denounced in Brazil withdrew his candidacy for his re-election as president of the swimming federation for another four years. The series of reports was published 10 days before the vote and he was the only candidate.   3 - Show other victims what sexual abuse is and encourage them not to accept undue advances and report, as the interviewees did.   4 - Shed light on the matter, since the reports had a great repercussion and forced the authorities and even parents of athletes to debate the problem and stay alert. "," The series of reports resulted in two documentaries with more than 20 minutes each and 10 written reports: one about the reality in the USA and the one in Brazil. In the first part we show the cases of ""predated coaches"" condemned and suspected of abusing their athletes, how it opened the eyes of the authorities on the problem and, thanks to the transparency of public bodies, such as the FBI, judicial courts and police stations, we were able to obtain unpublished documents showing the rape charge against a Brazilian swimming coach, which led to his banning by USA Swimming - the Brazilian press was unaware of the fact. What was made possible by criminal historys backgrounds provided by authorities, which were the starting point for locating whistleblowers and showing that there is a predatory modus operandis: A coach is accused of abuse by one or more swimmers, then changes clubs or cities and the criminal situation is repeated. With this, we were able to set up a framework of suspicious cases and that the investigated coaches form a possible support network, for working together. In the second part, even without the same transparency of American documents, we show that there is an evident underreporting of official reports of abuse in Brazil, by showing the report of eight former athletes who say they were touched in the private parts and harassed by the coach of swimming and president of the Federation of Aquatic Sports of Amazonas, the maximum representative of the category, in the north of the country. "," During the Covid-19 pandemic, in which guidelines only addressed this issue, being able to produce two documentaries with more than 20 minutes each (one without being able to enter the USA due to the sanitary barrier) and another series of 10 reports written for the Digital about the cases, in a recently inaugurated TV station in Brazil, was a real challenge. The subject is very delicate and we needed a lot of credibility, sensitivity and to be well documented to show that it was possible to do the project and, mainly, to convince the victims to talk to me something that neither their parents knew. There has never been a series of reports with such depth in Brazil about the problem in Brazil and at the same time that the pandemic and the search for documents in the USA dictated the pace of the investigation, I was able to analyze the whole project and see where it could expand. I had never done an investigation in the USA and I had to learn how organ structures work, locate the right people to get the papers, know how to order what I needed and where to find it in the hundreds of pages. Detail: I was not able to dedicate myself exclusively to this subject. I had to run this project in parallel, as I had other investigative reports done. "," Other colleagues can learn (and make their future reports better) that despite the difficulty of obtaining documents, official data and statistics, there are stories that need to be told in the middle of swimming. I believe and hope that if journalists continue to compare how other countries leave their data open, the authorities in Brazil can be encouraged to do the same.

For 11 years living in São Paulo. Since then I have been producing journalistic documentaries and large-format investigative reports for brazilian TV and I've been working with some of the greatest brazilian journalists.   Between 2009 and 2019, I was as an investigative producer-reporter on the weekly award-winning program of journalistic documentaries on open TV SBT: ‘Connection Reporter’. During that period, I was invited to be part of the Nucleus of Special Reports, on Record TV, the second largest in the country, where I stayed for a year and a half and was invited to return to my previous job.   In January of this year, CNN Brazil was inaugurated and I had the great honor of being invited to be part of the initial team. I was hired as an investigative journalist and in addition to producing and making reports for TV and Digital (more participations in podcasts and radio).   From recent work, with three more colleagues, I highlight a report showing documents obtained exclusively by the Brazilian Access to Information Act (the Brazilian Freedom of Information Act) that revealed that the Brazilian Army laboratory did not formally contest this increase in price od the hydroxychloroquine, the imported input for the manufacture of chloroquine, a drug widely publicized by President Jair Bolsonaro as the treatment for Covid-19, even without scientific proof. And only demanded written explanations from the company after the purchase, already completed, became the subject of an investigation by the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU). I also showed how a candidate for Minister of Education of the Bolsonaro government was a partner in companies with millionaire contracts with the same government. He was disregarded for the dispute.   Between March and December 2020, I had dozens of special reports aired on CNN Brazil and more than 100 reports published on the website, including one made on CNN International about how the Brazilian indigenous peoples were affected by Covid-19, with data four times greater than those released by the federal government.

Trump vs Biden,02/11/20,"Explainer, Long-form, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Elections","Scraping, Microsoft Excel","  Swing States project was born as part of the Trumpland media special reports covering the USA elections. The goal was to show the swing states from a different angle and bring in the Covid-19 element. More and more people were showing interest in voting early either via email, in person or online. Because of that, most of the states had to adapt their regulations. The final result was a clean dataset and visualisations that were providing different insights to the users for them to reach a final conclusion or identify patterns.   ","  By analysing, cleaning and comparing data from several sources, we identify a pattern during the last three presidential elections. By comparing each state’s law, the number of early voters during past elections and the final results, we were able to identify that a lot of Americans had already voted two weeks before the Election date and who were more likely to vote early (democrats or republicans).      The impact of the project was to provide, in real time, an update on the number of people who already voted, to which party and identify the number of eligible voters who could already participate in changing the overall picture. It was the first time where data regarding early voters could potentially be used to determine whether a state would turn blue or red. A week before the Election’s date, some swing states were already showing the americans’ preference and providing some first insights on how the voting process had to rapidly be adapted to a new situation instead of postponing the elections.   ","  Data visualisations were designed both in Illustrator and Photoshop. The web editor used was Atom and in order to control the scroll states the chosen tool was Scroll States. For other visualisations, we also used DataWrapper to bring this element of interactivity. The last one was specifically because we had tons of data and we didn't want to make any conclusion for the reader. Because of that, we cleaned the dataset from several sources and we presented it as it was, in a visual manner, for the reader to filer by party, elections, type of vote, etc and reach a specific conclusion or insight by themselves.   ","  Data from early voters was available in several sources, as well as data from eligible american voters (meaning the americans who said that wanted to vote before a deadline). Once this data was cleaned, it had to be adjusted to the total population, all this for the last three elections. On top of that, we also had to merge this with the final results by states to identify if there was an interesting pattern to highlight. All this work was done through Excel tables and forms until a clear picture was reached before moving to Illustrator or Datawrapper.   ","  On a reportering note, the ability to relate two newsworthy topics (such as the american elections and the Covid pandemic) without having to go to the most obvious element (such as the number of covid cases).          On a creativity note, the ability to combine several data visualisation tools depending on the elements of interactions and data gathered. While static infographics are less manejable, these also highlight on a quick overview what needs to be transmitted. SImilar to short calls to actions. For interactive graphics, it makes more sense when there’s tons of data and, instead of providing a final statement, you let the user play and decide.

Taiwan,CommonWealth Magazine,Big,Participant,Taipei Lockdown: Three Containment Models to Flatten the Curve,07/04/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map","Animation, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Python"," As of April 2020, nearly half of Taiwan’s confirmed COVID-19 cases were concentrated in Taipei City and New Taipei City. In ""Taipei Lockdown"", Commonwealth Magazine collaborated with Professor Wen from National Taiwan University to analyze and model how the virus would spread through communities in Taipei City and New Taipei City. Given the high population density and high human and economic activity of these two northern Taiwanese metropolises, what different containment strategies would most effectively contain the virus to prevent large-scale community spread? "," Commonwealth Magazine published ""Taipei Lockdown"" as cases were still rising in Taiwan and serious containment measures were being planned by the Taiwanese government. Worried about a potential lockdown, residents of Taipei City and New Taipei City began stocking up on toilet paper and rubbing alcohol while looking to the government and the media for information and guidance.    After Commonwealth Magazine published this report, many other news organizations also picked up this story, allowing various epidemiologists to discuss potential lockdown strategies. Our charts appeared on various websites and television news programs, and Professor Wen was also contacted by the Taiwanese government to advise on potential lockdown measures. Although a lockdown never came to fruition, ""Taipei Lockdown"" served an important role in the discourse and preparation of Taiwan's pandemic response. "," In the reporting of ""Taipei Lockdown"", Commonwealth Magazine started with research done by Professor Wen at NTU. Through his research, Professor Wen modeled different containment strategies and identified that dividing Taipei and New Taipei into twenty-six containment zones would be most effective for combating the spread of COVID-19. Commonwealth Magazine combined the data and models from Professor Wen's research with transit data from Taipei's MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) to create interactive charts and maps of different lockdown strategies.   Python was used for data cleaning and analysis, and dynamic maps were created with D3 and open source cartography tools such as QGIS. All of this was built on top of our internal Svelte.js interactive graphics library which Commonwealth Magazine has developed for visual storytelling. "," The most difficult part of ""Taipei Lockdown"" was the framing of Professor Wen's research. Because all three models Professor Wen simulated were hypothetical scenarios based on epidemiological theories, it was important to Commonwealth Magazine that the reporting was relevant to and easily understood by our readers.    In order to increase comprehension of how the containment districts in Professor Wen's model were established, we visualized the transit patterns of people on the MRT, allowing readers to understand that the most effective containment districts would be based on how people's daily patterns.   We also spent a significant amount of time discussing how to best disseminate the SIR epidemic model in our report, and ultimately settled on a visual, animated representation of how many cases have occurred at a given time, and made the comparison between different lockdown strategies very apparent.    "," Other journalists can take this project as a model for collaboration with academic researchers. Oftentimes, data-related stories may use modeled or hypothetical data for a variety of reasons, requiring the input of a subject matter expert to help guide or supply the data for a visualization. Under such circumstances, academics play a valuable role in making our projects more holistic and rigorous.    ",https://web.cw.com.tw/covid19-taipei-lockdown-en/index.html,https://web.cw.com.tw/covid19-taipei-lockdown/index.html,,,,,,,"Chen-Hua Chen, Daniel Kao, Yi-Wen Lin, Yu-Hsin Lee"," The team consists of one product manager, one data journalist , one front-end developer, and two web designers. CommonWealth Magazine was founded in 1981 and has actively invested in digital transformation since 2016.

Taiwan,READr,Small,Participant,Taiwan Trasitional Justice:How the government systematically turns people into political prisoners,31/10/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Documentary, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Human rights","Scraping, Canvas, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Node.js"," The Taiwan Transitional Justice Commission established online database which has records and photographs of victims of political persecution during the White Terror Period.  In order to figure out how the victims were oppressed and who the oppressors were,we analyze the data such as gender, years of birth, residence and the trial process.  Moreover, we interview 4 people who were arrested, interrogated, charged, or imprisoned during the martial law period.They share their stories about the life in jail and afterward. "," 1949, the Kuomintang Party was defeated by the Communist Party of China and moved the central government to Taiwan. To consolidate its authoritarian rule, the government promulgated the Martial Law and a brutal repression ensued, with tens of thousands of intellectuals, social elites, and dissidents believed to have been secretly tried, jailed, or murdered.   The Taiwan Transitional Justice Commission collected a large amount of data which revealed information about victims and those who took part in the persecutions and what they did.   However, the online database is too complicated to use because most people don't even know the victims' name, so they have no clue to search for anything. Therefore, we analyzed all the data by different subsets, such as gender, charge, and other details about the victims.   For example,  according to the database, both Taiwanese and Mainlanders were political criminal, with Taiwanese accounting for 55% of cases and Mainlanders 45%.  This feature tried to use data to make the history of White Terror Period more easier to learn and provide diverse research perspectives. "," This project is divided into two parts: data section and character section.   First, Data-Section in this project is made by Svelte and Pixi.js to implement a scroll-telling story with sprites of butterfly, scroll-telling is a well-known story form which is better for producing chart-based story, due to the chart is fixed on the main position of the web page, and each section of the story only have one main position, and is easy for implement in the year 2020 due to we can just using the ""sticky"" CSS position value. Moreover, by using sprite feature of the Pixi.js, we can easy integrate the data of the project with visualization which have the great amount of elements with custom image in the web page, but stay in the better performance. All these features creater a better experience when reading a numerous page elements, scroll-telling story.   On the other hand, Character-Section contains 4 interviewees' detailed stories, which have large amount of text. So a fixed navigation bar on the screen top, and character's thumbnail/info fixed on the screen left are needed. Not only can lead the readers focus on certain screen area, but also improve their user experience.   Mosaic-peeling-off-animation is made with Pixi.js. Divide a large mosaic image to thousands pieces via Pixi’s Sprite feature, add dropping animation in random direction, velocity and fade-out speed on each of pieces. This special “fading” effect not only brings out the story of the four characters, but also shows the historical significance of the White Terror Period. "," There are more than 10000 victims' files in the Taiwan Transitional Justice Database. Every single detail of the data is about a man or woman that has gone through, so it's so hard to classify all the information by using Rstudio. Therefore, we used R to clean the raw data at the beginning and spent plenty of time identifying the data manually. For instance, the former president Chiang Kai-shek sometimes commanded to aggravate the victims' sentence even though he approved the judgment. As a result, it's necessary to double check whether the classification is correct or not. "," During the White Terror Period, hundreds of thousands of people have suffered extremely because of unreasonable military justices. The feature should be responsible to provide the picture to the public to have a better understanding of the cases and help further academic study, as well as providing names of individuals and their actions during the trials.

South Korea,"KBS, Korean Broadcasting System (Seoul, Korea)",Big,Participant,Tax Justice: Delinquent Taxpayers in My Neighborhood,29/01/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Audio, Corruption, Business, Economy","Drone, JQuery, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python"," 'In this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes'.   This witty quote from Benjamin Franklin shows that people can’t run away from the duty of paying taxes. But it might not be true as always. There are some taxpayers who fail in their duty. In other words, there are tens of thousands of delinquent taxpayers who owe more than \200,000,000 (about $180,000) in South Korea only. We, the KBS Data Journalism Team, focused on this issue gathering, analyzing, and visualizing data about delinquent taxpayers to show who they are and what is taking place in our neighborhood. "," A change started off just with an interactive map. Since the Data Journalism Team at KBS provided an interactive map showing ‘How Many Delinquent Taxpayers Are in My Neighborhood’ in January 2020, people could get to understand who delinquent taxpayers are. For instance, people just going to the map, immediately come to know there are about 800 delinquent taxpayers in Gangnam district, Seoul. After publishing the map, people began to pour their shocking experience of knowing that there are so many delinquent taxpayers in their community, even in their rich community. With the viral, more and more people visited the online map. Around 10 months, more than 2 million people had visited the interactive map.   And then, one of the organizations surprised by the huge response from the map was the National Tax Service of Korea itself. In the first place, the Tax Service got no interest in the map provided by the Data Journalism Team at KBS. But the Tax Service soon noticed the potential of the map. The National Tax Service had acknowledged this kind of map would be helpful to slow the spread of delinquent taxpayers. So the Tax Service decided to introduce its own version of map delivering who delinquent taxpayers are and where delinquent taxpayers live. This could be a turning point because it is the National Tax Service that has all kinds of information about delinquent taxpayers. Technically, the Tax Service could make a more detailed map than a public broadcasting company. And the Tax Service also announced to update the map every year.   So a trial of making a map showing delinquent taxpayers from KBS resulted in making a map from the authority itself. As a result, good taxpayers have come to know easily much better about neighbors who don’t pay taxes. "," We used web crawling methods to get data about delinquent taxpayers from the list. And then we did data cleaning to analyze them.   At the same time, we used the FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act of Korea to get the information about how delinquent taxpayers got out of the list. We have figured out most of them who dropped from the list could escape not because they paid taxes, but because ‘statute of limitations’ had expired on tax. It means many delinquent taxpayers could get out of the public list with the help of extinction of tax obligation   And we relied on the techniques or technologies of HTML5, jQuery, Javascript, Kakaomap API to make an interactive map. "," The list of delinquent taxpayers is so heavy that it leads to 1,900 pages on the web. The number of people under the list was about 38,000. With these overwhelming figures, good taxpayers used to feel that it is not easy knowing who delinquent taxpayers are, where they live and what they do. After getting the data of more than 38,000 delinquent taxpayers, we had to spend quite a time cleaning the sources. Data cleaning was the first barrier for us to overcome.   And as said before, we relied on the Freedom of Information Act. We also contacted tax authorities to get further information about tax delinquency. However, it would take a long time too to get what we wanted because tax authorities didn’t understand what we were doing in the first place. And the paperwork wasn’t good enough. We should meet delinquent taxpayers in person. We had to track them based on the tips from the list. That meant we had to work both online and offline. What we have done was unambiguously data journalism but it was also a field report. Doing both data job and field job great for a better data journalism might be the hardest part of this project "," The Republic of Korea National Tax Service usually offers kinds of information about name, address, occupational or professional licenses, and amount owed. The Tax Service says that it’s a great way to encourage delinquent taxpayers to pay off their debts. Moreover, a businessman, a local resident, or a senior citizen can happen to know that delinquent taxpayers around him or her have hidden assets. In that case, they could report these habitual evaders to the authorities. For these reasons, other tax authorities in the US or Europe do the same thing, making the list public.   However, most tax authorities across the globe just provide the information in the form of texts. We think if an interactive map of delinquent taxpayers would take effect in the Republic of Korea, these kinds of maps would go into effect in other developed or developing countries as well.   The following is the map designed by the Data Journalism Team at KBS: As the National Tax Service introduced its own version of a map, it appeared that we didn’t need anymore to update our online map. So we closed our map. But if you go into the following link, you could get to face how we made the map of delinquent taxpayers.

Brazil,The Intercept Brasil,Small,Participant,The ‘sausage car' and other mass killings on wheels that wipe out the periphery and the government ignores,26/10/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, Illustration, Video, Map, Corruption, Crime, Gun violence, Human rights","Animation, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," In Rio de Janeiro the press always reports that ""occupants of a car shot"" at a target and made victims - treated as ""isolated case"". For the first time these cases were tabulated throughout the year, a ""social cleansing"" standard was established, which takes place in areas that are being disputed by traffickers and militiamen.   The story was told through a slaughter that took place on the west side of Rio, in a dispute between militia and trafficking, on a video. In 2 years there were 91 attacks, which left 128 dead and 115 injured. "," The story of the video was told through a massacre that took place in the west of Rio, in a dispute between militia and trafficking. At a bar party, 4 people were killed and 13 injured when people fired from a car. The target was a militiaman. We talked to a boy who was a regular at the place and who was shot but survived.   It was the first time that these crimes were reported as serial cases, by the Fogo Cruzado platform, which accounted for shootings in Rio. The police were asked about the progress of the investigations of 91 attacks and did not respond to us.   We asked the prosecutor if there is any specific investigation into this type of crime and they said no.   Despite the example being from Rio, we found that this model of ""slaughter under wheels"" happens in several states of the country and that people know them with names like ""ghost biker"" and ""silver car"".    It is a common tactic that criminals use this tactic to ""clean an area"" and ""send messages"" to residents: whoever does not obey, dies.   Most of the mapped crimes occurred in the Baixada Fluminense, the region where Rio's death squads were born decades ago. And through the way the attack is carried out - car color / model and virulence - it is possible to know who attacked.   As this is a subject of popular knowledge, but not accounted for by the authorities and unknown to the population who lives far from the peripheries, we chose to present the subject - dense and violent - in the form of a video explainer, to facilitate understanding, but without being too hard. And worked. The video went viral on the internet and the subject was popularized. "," As the subject is very violent and happens in areas that do not arouse the interest of many people, as they are poor and marginalized regions, we chose to present the subject in a video with motion, to try to soften the theme and generate empathy at the same time.   The narration is made by one of the authors of the story, who is presenting data of the dead and wounded on a map, merging with clippings of real militia action videos, audio of victims and also a clip of a shooting attack that ended in a massacre.   The data were collected in the Fogo Cruzado API and analyzed in detail for ""reason of the action"", which allowed us to detect the attacks on shots. In a spreedsheet, we analyzed the number of victims and locations, and then identified who, at that date, was the armed group that dominated the regions.   We exported the raw database to a map, to identify where the crimes took place, which allowed us to see that they are mostly concentrated in the Baixada Fluminense, where the majority of the population is black and poor. We also listed in the press all the news about these attacks in these two years, to have access to all the details of the stories and better meet the standards.   To illustrate the story, we mixed real videos with animation, to soften the violence of the theme. "," One of the most difficult parts of that investigation was finding a victim of the attack at the bar party, who agreed to talk. The fear of those who live in these areas is great.   After a while, we found it. But he was afraid and of course, he didn't want to identify himself. After working in trust with the source, he talked and we agreed with him to voice his voice to protect him.   The other steps of the investigation were laborious, since they were data and research from 2-year, but common to journalistic work. We had a lot of crimes to map, see which ones were more expressive of the armed violence that affects Rio de Janeiro and work on a popular way of telling the story to generate empathy. We use popular language, with slang and everyday expressions - But at the same time bringing tragic data and sensitive images, showing that this is the daily life of many people in one of the largest cities in Brazil.    We also show that despite being numerous, there is no investigation into the cases, that occurs where the majority of the population is black and poor. And more: those responsible for investigating or predicting crimes often do not even answer questions. Through the narrative of the video, we show that for the Rio government, black lives do not matter. "," The history of the ""sausage car"" has been common and commonplace in Rio de Janeiro for many years. But these data needed to be compiled and show that they are not eventualities. It's method.   For this, we use the Fogo Cruzado database, a platform that maps shootings in Rio de Janeiro, with geolocation. The data itself, raw, was already shocking. But as violence in Rio de Janeiro is a common issue, depending on the approach taken, it becomes just one more number.   To make a difference you need to humanize the numbers, give them a face and history, show that despite the fact that those crimes took place a little far from your home, it happens in your city and affects the lives of your neighbors or coworkers - people who you can know.   Thus, it is possible to make people empathize in matters that usually they would not be interested in. Faced with a repetitive scenario of violence, it is necessary to reinvent journalism, invest in new forms of approach and seek new sources of information - in addition to government databases.

It is networked and we are failing to understand how existing communities online have been hijacked to become vectors for mis- and disinformation. Using the ‘great reset’ conspiracy theory as a case study, we looked at the extent to which online communities have been used to become spreaders of disinformation following a decentralized approach, providing evidence on why disinformation travels quicker. "," The piece had a meaningful impact on the debate around new approaches to fight online disinformation and the role of fact-checks. It was shared by high-profile journalists, disinformation experts and researchers in the field, and its findings were cited in related articles, including by the leading Brazilian news website TAB from UOL, with 100 million users per month and 7.5 billion page views per month. The reaction to the piece was overwhelmingly positive and stimulated conversations around the role of pre-bunks and debunks in fighting disinformation.    In 2020 disinformation has become more pervasive than ever. The piece proposes an innovative approach to a crucial issue that has a large impact on our daily life. Using data to find evidence of the power imbalance between conspiracy theories and the fact checks, our piece highlighted how often disinformation and conspiracy theories like the Great Reset have substantial structural advantages in the way they travel compared to quality information: instead of following the top-down or linear model of the mainstream media and fact-checks, they are shared across networked, participatory, and alternative information ecosystems.     ","  We used CrowdTangle’s API to collect 11,808 posts from Facebook groups and unverified Facebook pages that mentioned “great reset” or “greatreset” between November 16, 2020 and December 6, 2020. We then filtered for posts that included outward links to other websites and social media platforms.      To understand the potential impact of fact-checks on the conspiracy theory we also identified all the URLs from reliable news organizations that debunked the conspiracy theory and ran those URLs through CrowdTangle’s links endpoint to gather all the Facebook posts that shared them.      These two datasets, which included a total of 7,775 posts, were then merged for analysis using Pandas and Gephi. In Gephi we re-sized the nodes based on the in-degree values in order to highlight the URLs that were most frequently shared in this set. URLs with more shares are represented by larger nodes. We used the «ForceAtlas 2» layout to bring accounts that frequently share among each other closer together.       "," The most challenging part of the project was the development of a new methodology to accurately analyse how pieces of information travel across different communities online. We decided to look at networked data to illustrate the dynamics that reinforce conspiracy theories such as the Great Reset, with an eye on the impact of fact checks and debunks published by trusted sources. The use of network analysis tools like Gephi can be time-consuming too.         "," Understanding how disinformation travels is crucial to develop tactics to deal with its spread. Our research proved that we need to move beyond thinking of disinformation as something broadcasted by bad actors down to unquestioning readers: false and misleading information circulates and evolves within robust ecosystems, where uncertain users collectively participate in a new sense-making. This suggests that instead of “chasing"" misinformation and individual pieces of misleading narratives, we should instead focus to pre-empt its emergence, creating initiatives and participatory strategies with existing communities.   In an another point highlighted in the article, we mention the “data deficits,” situations of crisis in which there is a high demand for information about a topic but the supply of credible information is low. These deficits are quickly filled up by misinformation and conspiracy theories as people try to make sense of the situation. Identifying and preventing the emergence of this lack of information could be an important tool for journalists to prevent the spread of disinformation.

From that sad episode, we thought we had to give perspective to our audience and dimension the real loss of the biggest tropical forest on earth. What do we really lose when a ""football-pitch of forest is lost every minute""? What is damaging the rainforest in each of the 9 countries that is spread across? Since our audience is based in LatAm, we believed that mission was crucial. The result was a two-part in-depth data-driven project on deforestation and degradation - its silent-killer cousin - and the specific human activities that are causing"," The audience response was fantastic. Engagement time was above average in both BBC Brasil and BBC Mundo, with pick readership times of 5 minutes. It sparked great discussion on Facebook and all the graphic and infographic material was widely shared across social media, especially on Instagran. A special mention for our infographic on ""what can we find in an hectare of the Amazon"", we did in collab with Jos Barlow y Alexander Lees.   Also, most of the main Environmental and Climate organizations in Latin America – both NGOs and organizations linked to governments in some cases – praised and shared links to our story in their social media outlets. Some of them as a response of our seeding campaign, such as Greenpeace or WWF Colombia.   The project had a special impact in Brazil.   Our work was quoted in the country’s Regional Justice Courts and circulated among unions of public servers of the federal courts in Amazon states. It was also the basis for academic papers in discourse analysis of the Brazilian government’s policies regarding the Amazon and it was also cited in the book  Modern Brazil: A Very Short Introduction,  by King’s College London Professor and director of the Brazil Institute Anthony W. Pereira. In the education front, the project was used in school tests in the Brazilian public school system, for 7th year students: shorturl.at/kCU46   We were also asked by Brazil’s School of Data to explain our process of collecting and processing the data, as well as our insights about the projects. RAISG, the only monitoring organization of the Pan-Amazon and one of our sources, invited us to be in a debate about the new deforestation and degradation data released in 2020. We were the only media outlet invited to debate with the experts: <a href=""https://youtu.be/XvpMaoMeDGU"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/XvpMaoMeDGU</a> "," We used spreadsheets (Excel and Google sheets) to work with different sets of data, such as the cumulative deforestation between 2002 and 2019 among the 9 Amazonian countries. We visualised the result with D3 for accessibility and that way would be easier to adapt in other languages.   All our country charts were built with D3 to which we added some annotations to give further context. We also built some expanders to break down the jargon and/or to explain scientific concepts that we tend to see in reports.   Map wise, we used QGIS to process the data and build some of them, such as the one on illegal mining in Venezuela. QGIS allowed us to work with a big chunk of georeferenced data.    In the second part of the project, the menu was an invite to the user to navigate at his or her own leisure through the countries, given a bit of “choose-your-own-adventure” feel.     Visually, we opt for infographics (combining data, photography and illustration), moving galleries and GIFS to add motion to the project and translate that sense of deterioriation.   All in all made it more acurate, informative, attractive and fun to consume. "," The hardest part of the project was to curate the amount of information and data we were working with, which potentially could have turned this project into something unmanageable (considering we are a multidisciplanry team of five) and/or too overwhelming for the audience.    The latter is the reason why we split the project in two parts.   Also, we thought it would be beneficial for SEO purposes, since each part would have its own headline and that could increase the chances of discoverability and shareability.   Editorially, it made sense to focus first on the crucial role of the rainforest and the phenomena of deforestation and degradation. The challenge there was to choose among the different ways of measuring these and make it relevant to the audience. We opted to work with data sets from the World Resource Institute and collaborate with diferent institutions and scientists. They all were super generous and their help was much appreciated.    Having a second part allowed us to dive in each one of the Amazonian countries, breaking that sometimes-prevailing view that the rainforest spreads only across Brazil. Exploring 9 countries brought challenges in itself, one of which was to make it palatable for the audience - so we kept it concise, visual and fluid.   We think the result was a comprehensive project that gives good sense of the real role of the rainforest and a great understanding of what it means to lose it. ​ "," Questioning common preconceived ideas about the Amazon and ""diving in"" the data showed us new angles and new possible stories.   For example: the idea that Brazil is the main responsible for the Amazon might prevent us journalists from questioning the authorities about the lack of cooperation among the countries in the interest of conservation. But the data actually shows that all the Amazon countries have the same patterns of deforestation and that the activities responsible for it have established an illegal network among these same countries. We should be looking into that.

United States,"Better Government Association, Injustice Watch, DataMade, the Chicago Reporter",Big,Participant,The Circuit,22/10/20,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Infographics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Python","For decades, the Cook County courts have functioned as a government body that is inaccessible to the public. Everyone familiar with the system knew it was a mess because of sloppy and inconsistent record-keeping. But a group of newsrooms asked themselves what would happen if they could extract, clean and reorganize that data so it could be usable to the general public? That was the spark that launched an unprecedented journalistic collaboration we now call ""The Circuit."" Reporters used the data to spot troublesome trends from two veteran judges. They also created a visualization of 20 years of criminal charge","  For the first time, access to systemic data in the Cook County court system is now available to the public. Our project standardized a massive amount of information so that it could be used and analyzed by researchers and reporters. We visualized trends in criminal cases over nearly two decades and presented it in a way that made it useful for those inside and outside the legal profession. It made information that was hidden from the public available for all to see.     While other agencies in Illinois have reports and data sets that showcase the events in the judicial system, the data from the clerk’s office provides the most complete picture of what goes on throughout every level of the court.      Though the work has taken a great deal of time, there remains much more work to do going forward and the work of The Circuit will continue. In the coming months, a key component of The Circuit’s plans will be to engage other news partners, from large organizations and small, as well as community groups to continue analyzing data, working on stories and unraveling the mystery of the Cook County court system.  ","  PostgreSQL, Pandas and Dedupe libraries in Python, Git, and R Studio were all used as part of the analysis for the project.     Editors at Injustice Watch gained legal access to the Cook County Circuit Court’s mainframe information system. Injustice Watch hired the Chicago civic technology company DataMade, which used software that emulated a mainframe terminal and allowed access to much of the same information available through the public terminals — but from a personal computer.     The state legislature sometimes revised statutes, which changes the statutes mapped to a UCR category. To adapt for changes to the liquor control act and driving under the influence, for instance, we had to widen two categories and used the wider UCR offenses for “Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol” and “Illegal Possession of Alcohol by Minor.”     Once we had a method for counting cases by charge, we needed to decide which cases to count. A person who is arrested for a felony typically has two cases associated with the arrest. They start with a case in a municipal division, where a judge holds a preliminary hearing of the police’s criminal complaint. At this hearing, the judge determines whether the police had probable cause for the search and arrest and whether there is sufficient evidence to move forward.     If a case can move forward, the state’s attorney’s office will usually file its own charges, which will start a new case in the criminal division. We needed to avoid double counting felony cases that have a municipal division and criminal division phase. To do this, if a criminal division case and municipal division case are associated with the same central booking number, a number unique to a single arrest, we only counted the criminal division case and did not count the municipal division case.  ","  Criminal charges and statutes in the database were entered manually by clerks. For example, there were hundreds of different ways a clerk could enter a crime like aggravated assault or possession of a controlled substance.      In order to analyze the records, they had to be counted consistently. It took reporters more than a year to get the data consistent for a systemic analysis.      Beyond the hurdles required to analyze the data, the legal system also has factors that hinder reporting on issues. Cases cannot be filmed, and participants in the criminal justice system are often reluctant to speak about their experience for many reasons. Reporters also had to be especially careful when reporting on issues of sexual abuse, where emotional and psychological damage can linger far beyond the time of the crimes or the trial.  ","  Our launch of stories in October 2020 was just the beginning of this unparalleled collaborative journalism investigation that explores and exposes decades of overlooked data and their connecting patterns buried in the files of the Cook County courts.     Much of the data we extracted from the court system was complicated and disorganized, but we were able to arrange it in a usable way to answer long-standing questions about a court system that serves 5.2 million residents. At a time when the local media is shrinking across the nation, including in Chicago and Cook County, we hope our collaboration serves as a statement that despite our organizations’ varied missions, we share similar core values and goals to achieve a greater good: exposing institutional failures that obstruct justice, confronting racial and economic inequality, and providing greater transparency to make the court system more accountable.     Partnering with the University of Chicago, whose focus is research and education, allowed the journalists and academics to pool resources that were mutually beneficial. Other organizations could use this process as a model for future projects.

Chile,Independent and Collaborative Project with the unique name as 'The City as Text',Small,Participant,The City as Text [La Ciudad como Texto],21/08/20,"Investigation, Documentary, Database, Open data, News application, Mobile App, Politics, Arts, Culture, Economy, Gun violence, Human rights","JQuery, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," The Chilean social outbreak in 2019, was a major political event.   The City as Text   project: Documents, classifies and displays a large number of graphic interventions (visual data) made by citizens in the face of imminent government censorship. The project is a georeferenced register during the hardest days of revolt. A virtual tour of 2.4 km made by hundreds of photographs and hosted on a website, allows people from all over the world to live the experience of walking through those streets as an echo of social demands. This material represents a free, innovative and unique ‘National Memory Data Archive’. "," Days after the website launch some impacts began to present visibility. Today, after four months online, we can establish that:   - First, participate in a cultural and political movement to establish a counternarrative about the appropriation of the public space by citizens, in the context of a government trying to impose the discourse of internal war, and public enemies. The president himself said during a public speech on October 20<sup>th</sup>, 2019<sup> </sup>: “ We are at war against a powerful enemy ” referring directly to the Chilean people.   - Another outcome was mainly in the international arena. Since the dictatorship, exile created a Chilean diaspora spread throughout the world. People who had discourses against the Chilean development model imposed during the dictatorship a continuous to this day had found refuge in other countries. One of the unexpected effects was to connect people of the Chilean diaspora with the streets of Santiago resonating with their long-standing social demands and the fight against human rights violations.   - In the field of Journalism: Reinterpreting photography as geodata, going beyond the common perspectives of photojournalism and opening a medium to new uses and experiences in the Chilean media. In the same way, this Archive collects information that has contributed to generating Data Activism as an echo of social demands. Finally, it has allowed the development of an alternative Data Journalism to the traditionally dominant ones (Telecommunications) that have contributed new studies. This specific data from a particular moment of crisis in Chile, provides accurate information by merging the quantitative with images (qualitative) opening boundaries in Quantitatives Journalism.    - Due to the use of the platform as a Memory Archive, many research, webinars and articles have been published not only in Chilean universities and media, but also internationally giving more visibility and support to the crisis. "," The techniques were planned according to the different scenarios and contexts, here are the main procedures:      <ul>   Data Capture:  Due to the fact that protests took place daily in the streets and police repression was very violent, dangerous and constant. The only possible way to do this register was doing it by walking with a handheld camera, very early in the morning and without any special supply as a tripod or a 360º camera. Multiple violations of human rights and the threat of whitewashing the walls as censorship of the social crisis by the government required a lean, invisible and tactical approach.  </ul>     <ul>   Data Processing:  Hundreds of digital pictures were indexed and later digitally retouched using traditional editing programs. Because of the special geography of Chile and the pathway of the record it was impossible to merge all the pictures directly in digital. The photographs were printed for manually reconstruct completely the journey georeferencing each point. The first prototype of the 2.4 km and generated by using hundreds of photographs in an analog montage of twelve meters long. This mock-up was used later as a guideline for the digital version.  </ul>     <ul>   Data Display:  The main criteria was to create a different experience, approach and access to the data for different types of users. Although hundreds of records were viralized, not one allowed to georeference and have a continuous experience. The virtual walk later became more necessary and assertive due to the lockdown of people all over the world because of the COVID.  </ul>      This process was carried out during three months nightly online work -after traditionally jobs- using Jitsy Meet for the communication between the designer and the web programmer. Mockups and interfaces were designed using Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign and then translated using HTML, Javascript, CSS3, Openseadragon and JQuery. "," There are three relevant aspects to consider in this project. The first is related to the rapid reaction, the assertive register and subsequent website execution, due to the need for censorship in the midst of crisis. The constant protests in the streets didn’t allow to stop and realize what was happening, because it was  happening . Police violence, constant clashes between protesters and the Armed Forces, toxic gases that were breathed in the public space, made impossible to have an overview of the demands. Hundreds of records were published on social networks, but none are addressed in a panoramic or georeferential way, much less experiential. The record was completely subject to the journalistic experience itself, with the risks involved.       The second is related to the pandemic that have direct consequences with demonstrations. When people are in the streets demanding their rights, the confinement seems to play against the so-called ‘justice’. When protesters are locked up, only the police is allow to be in the public space and by order of the government they erased the messages from the walls. This project ‘uses’ precisely the lockdown and its digitality, to enhance the transmission of this Memory Data Archive. The online work of almost fifty people who make up this initiative continued for five months of confinement and then, the free access platform did nothing but broaden the spectrum of expected visits. Thus, not only people from other regions of Chile but also people abroad could feel part of this social crisis.       The last point refers to the completely collaborative and self-managed essence of the project. No economic transaction was made for the development of this online experiential archive.   The project is precisely in tune with what arises in this crisis, which is collaborative work and solidarity between people to achieve radical changes. "," There are different approaches of the  “City as a Text”  project. Due to the transversality of the documented data during an important crisis in Chile, including a Plebiscite that will completely modify the Constitution. Various disciplines can use this Memory Data Archive to deepen research, activism and cultural works, because of its digital nature and free access. Focus in the journalism field we affirm that: Along with the “in your face” political violence exercised by a state grasping to hold power, there are other forms of violence that need to be covered by medias. What was signaled as vandalism by some political actors was really a Meaning Map of concerns, desires, rights, rage and hopes. The register becomes Data that embodies the citizen demands in a specific moment that could contribute to build alternatives imaginaries. It transits in a parallel dimension to official history, news and academic articles. It is built by citizens in the public space, situated and overflowing in its own materiality and immateriality. As an anonymous, collective and popular authorship registered and exposed as an alternative documentation. Beyond the official front page news, there is the need to create and explore alternative media to narrate this stories that includes so many silenced voices. Also, data is usually seen as a way of grasping clear and univocal reality. However, we are everyday surrounded by valuable unstructured data (like graffiti) that should be recorded, indexed and processed in the context of the larger narratives of social changes. Journalism must capture and try to reflect the essence of events, and what more ‘real’ than the voices of citizens themselves demanding changes. This free online website made by the documentation of the city, represents an alternative database as an input for research and open the door to the Data Activism.

Data are derived/estimated in the case of states that only report percentages by races, not counts. We also compare the data we collect to the time-lagged and often suppressed CDC data on the same topic; in the few cases where the CDC data is found to be more robust (and in the case of the two states not yet reporting these data, North Dakota and West Virginia), we supplement our data file with the CDC’s offerings. Deaths of unknown race are removed for uniformity across states and importantly, population denominators are aligned with each state’s method of reporting ethnicity (whether overlapping or distinct Latino group) and race (alone, or alone or in combination with other races).   We then calculate mortality rates per 100,000 by race and ethnicity for all states and aggregate the states’ data to construct figures for the nation as a whole. Finally, for each release, we calculate the latest national age-specific mortality rates and apply it to each state’s population data by race and age, so that we can indirectly age-adjust the mortality rates. This accounts for varying age distributions across racial groups and states. This results in even larger mortality disparities observed between Black, Indigenous and other populations of color relative to Whites, who experience the lowest age-adjusted rates nationally. Age-adjusting also elevates the mortality rate for Latinos over its actual (crude) rate more than any other group—revealing that COVID-19 is stealing far more Latino lives than we would expect despite this group’s relative youthfulness.  "," One challenge has been presenting such a wealth of data and complex methods such as age-adjustment in an accessible manner. We have sought to make our findings highly readable, highly visual and highly actionable for all who are seeking them out.   From the beginning, we were challenged by reporting discrepancies by state health departments. We contacted numerous states in the first two months of the work to request clearer or more comprehensive data, and our data advocacy succeeded in some cases. However, the lack of uniform reporting means is still challenging; e.g., some states do not uniquely identify Indigenous people or Pacific Islanders. Others report Pacific Islanders jointly with Asians.   Treatment of Hispanic ethnicity also varies across states and in some states, has changed over time. All of this unevenness in the data has required an extra degree of care by our team, to select and align the proper denominators at the state level to accurately calculate percentages (of total deaths and population share) and mortality rates. We have observed that other reporting projects that now exist on this topic have not exercised the same degree of caution. The result, however, is the most robust aggregated portrait of COVID-19 mortality by race and ethnicity at the national level.   The most significant challange has been bearing the weight of this knowledge and he trauma and tragedy that each one of these numbers represent. Feeling the human cost of these data has been difficult to process.  "," Not only are jouranlists accross the globe using this in real-time to inform their reporting on the Coronavirus pandemic and health equity, and draw a fuller picture of key real-time events -- journalists and media organizations thinking of doing this kind of work in the future can takeaway the impact and importance that this kind of quality meaning-making of complex data can have for audiences and issues of great world importance. This work helps democratize data that is available but is not accessible to the general population and connects dots that are not otherwise being connected in the collection of these data.

Miners have their eyes on protected reserves that have been officially demarcated for 15 years and are inhabited by isolated indigenous peoples. The report also reveals an explosion in requests since 2019: applications to mine on indigenous lands in the Amazon have increased by 91% under the Bolsonaro administration.  ,"  Mining in indigenous territories is currently prohibited under <a href=""http://www.mpf.mp.br/pgr/noticias-pgr/mpf-reafirma-posicao-contraria-ao-pl-que-pretende-regularizar-mineracao-em-terras-indigenas-em-evento-na-camara-dos-deputados"">Brazil's Federal Constitution of 1988</a> and goes against the will of many indigenous peoples. Indigenous territories are protected by law and considered to play a major role in preserving the Amazon rainforest. Still, president Jair Bolsonaro has publicly announced on multiple occasions that Brazil's indigenous territories should be opened for mining and other resource exploitation, justifying such a move as a boost for the economy. In february 2020, he went as far as proposing a bill that would regulate the activity - which still hasn't been voted. This journalistic project managed to show the real implications of the president's discourses and policies on the environment and the local population as well as who would benefit from such a move. This piece has been republished by 34 news websites, in portuguese, spanish and english, being featured in important national and international outlets such as <a href=""https://brasil.elpais.com/brasil/2020-03-02/a-mineracao-em-terra-indigena-com-nome-sobrenome-e-cnpj.html"">El País Brasil</a>, <a href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2020/05/the-mining-map-whos-eyeing-the-gold-on-brazils-indigenous-lands/"">Mongabay</a> (US) and <a href=""https://ojo-publico.com/1690/exploracion-minera-en-amazonia-crecio-durante-gobierno-de-bolsonaro"">OjoPúblico</a> (Peru).

","  We used the National Mining Agency (ANM) mining requests database and cross-checked the data with the FUNAI Indigenous Land Mapping (TIs) to identify areas where the requests overlapped with indigenous territories. Private individuals and companies must request authorization through the ANM before being allowed to engage in exploration of minerals or any other subsoil resources in Brazil. We also made use of the Internal Revenue Service's CNPJ [an identification number issued to brazilian companies] and company partners database, supported by Google searches for addresses and news articles on these companies. We used free data analysis softwares such as Libreoffice, Open Refine, QGIS and graphic design programs such as Illustrator and Photoshop to create the visualization pieces.  ","  The databases we used for our analysis came from different government agencies and had distinct formats. The data from the National Mining Agency did not clearly specify the names of the people responsible for the mining requests, so we had to examine lists of business ID numbers (CNPJ) and partners of companies and make decisions among several duplicate data or with incomplete information. Federal agencies do not answer questions or requests for more information, even though it comes to public information.  ","  This journalistic investigation sets an example of how to arrive at new information by crossing different databases, and how it can lead to the accountability of public authorities and big businessmen on matters of social and environmental impacts.

India,Stories Asia,Small,Participant,The Curse of Living in a ‘Remote' Village in India,17/09/20,"Investigation, Long-form","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," In a distant village of hilly state of India, <a href=""https://longform.storiesasia.org/the-curse-of-living-in-a-remote-village-in-india?source=share-storiesasia"">Poonam</a>, a mother of three was trekking back to her home. On that trek of 10 KMs, she met with an accident. She could have survived but couldn't as there were no roads.   This data journalism story attempts to find out what went wrong with India's rural roads scheme, launched in 2000, to build a network of roads to enable connectivity in all seasons, across the country. Twenty years later, only 4,000 kilometres of the planned 60,000 kilometres of the road has been built, as the data for 2020-2021 shows.  "," Hope has sprung in a dim and distant village Badhhu in Mandi district of the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. After the death of a mother of three and <a href=""https://longform.storiesasia.org/the-curse-of-living-in-a-remote-village-in-india"">my coverage in StoriesAsia</a> of how the inaccessibility of this village was responsible for the fatal accident, the state government has finally <a href=""https://www.storiesasia.org/a-village-in-himachal-pradesh-state-will-no-longer-be-remote/"">resolved</a> to finish the construction of a bridge and build a road to this community of mostly Dalit people, considered outcaste in India.  "," The prime requirement of the story was interpreting the vast format of government data available in the public domain and through the Right to Information applications. For that, I used MS Excel, high charts.com and various other platforms to understand and formulate the data and study it. The primary requirement of data was to understand where the scheme was lacking and in which states the performance was poor. The data was to substantiate the claims.  "," The hardest part of this project was to find the data, classify it, understand and tabulate it. The central government’s rural roads scheme entered its third phase last December. But 46 per cent of the targets <a href=""http://omms.nic.in/"" target=""_blank"">remained unmet</a> in 2019. None of the northeastern states was able to meet even <a href=""https://theprint.in/india/modi-govts-rural-roads-scheme-enters-third-phase-but-many-states-yet-to-meet-past-targets/337686/"" target=""_blank"">50 per cent of the targets</a> under Phases 1 and 2 of the PMGSY. And a fund crunch has led to work moving at a snail’s pace in Jammu and Kashmir region. The poor connectivity is a disappointing standard in most of rural India. Consider this data for 2020-2021. In Arunachal Pradesh state, only one out of the 95 target villages has a road. In Meghalaya state, 3 out of 175 villages are connected. In Jammu and Kashmir region, 25 out of 327 villages are connected. In Uttarakhand state, 20 out of 300 villages are connected. In Chhattisgarh state, 4 out of 572 target villages are connected. To carve out this data, understand it and substantiate it was the most difficult part of the story.  ", A very important aspect to take out of this story was how Covid19 pandemic inturn affected an otherwise a slow scheme. 2020 as a year was very slow for the construction of the road because of nationwide lockdown imposed in the country. This story and data produced here also give an insight on to how Covid19 dwindled the growth of the scheme where the targets remained unmet.  ,https://longform.storiesasia.org/the-curse-of-living-in-a-remote-village-in-india?source=share-storiesasia,https://www.storiesasia.org/a-village-in-himachal-pradesh-state-will-no-longer-be-remote/,,,,,,,Srishti Jaswal (Sole Contributor)," I am a 24-year-old independent journalist.

We draw on <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKmaV_JiWcG8XBoRgP8b4e9Eopkpgt7FL7nyspvzAsE/edit#gid=0"">data from Fatal Encounters</a> and put it in conversation with information about the governance of the places where these deaths occur. "," Police brutality is a rampant and significant issue for many communities across the United States.  Complex and sensitive in nature, this issue is even further obscured by the lack of government transparency surrounding issues of police brutality.  There currently are not any government led initiatives that provide clarity on who is being killed by police when and where.   In light of such government failures, academic efforts have resulted in national databases about police killings.  In an effort to put this novel open source data to good use, our article attempts to shed light on the issue of police brutality through a visual narrative of storytelling that allows the reader to explore the data for themself.   In publishing this work, we have received an honorable mention at the Pudding Awards for best visual stories.  Regardless of this success, our project has had the important impact of illustrating fact from fiction surrounding issues of police violence. "," The main tools used for this data journalism project were the Python programming language, the D3.js Javascript Framework, and GitHub.  The Python programming language was used to collect, clean, and wrangle data from multiple data sources (i.e. fatalencounters.org, 2016 county presidential election returns data, police employment and population data).  With the Python programming language, exploratory data analysis was also conducted.  The D3.js Javascript Framework was used to manipulate the data with the Javascript programming language in order to build interactive web visualizations.  In particular, the final beeswarm visualization of this article was produced using the D3.js force layout.  Finally, GitHub was used to not only manage this project, but to also host the associated article webpage for this project. "," Police brutality is a sensitive, heart-wrenching subject that can be very difficult to report upon effectively.  For this reason, we spent a considerable amount of time planning and discussing the narrative, storyline, and accompanying visualizations of this piece.  While we wanted the article to be engaging, we also wanted to ensure that the piece was presented in good taste.  We strived to guarantee that while exploratory in nature, the seriousness and gravity associated with the piece was not lost.  Ensuring a balance between exploration and seriousness was difficult in completing this project. "," First, this project is a good example of how to work with unique and unconventional data sources. The Fatal Encounters dataset documents a reality that is quite literally not documented anywhere else, and the data is presented as it is collected. It was a challenge to sort through all of this information and decide, by ourselves, which part we want to focus on, how we want to analyze it, and how we want to present it. Similarly, it was a challenge to put different datasets in dialogue with each other. Yet, while these decisions were challenging, they allowed us to write a meaningful and substantial story.    Further, this data on its own is malleable – it can be interpreted in different ways, and used for different purposes. It was important for us to not simply ""let the data speak for itself"", but to give a strong historical and political context to the numbers. Beyond providing essential information to understand the data, it also explains why and how we came to certain interpretations and conclusions.    Lastly, this article provides valuable insight on data visualization. The visual presentation of data undoubtedly has enormous impact on how well it is understood or assimilated by readers, and we were extremely careful in our choice of visualizations; our goal was for the visuals to give clarity to the numbers, not to change their meaning. The article also exemplifies how the D3.js Javascript Framework can provide a profound contribution to the coherence and clarity of a data-driven story.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Participant,The Economist's US election forecasts,11/06/20,"Chart, Politics","D3.js, Canvas, R"," We created a novel election-forecasting model to combine public polling, past election results, and demographic data to predict the 2020 US House, Senate and presidential elections. Our approach combined recent innovations in machine learning, Bayesian statistics, political science and polling to provide a reasonable estimate of the range of uncertainty in the election, with a desire to see through the noise of constant campaign coverage. We visualised the forecast with sophisticated interactive data visualisations on a custom-built website. Although polls this year revealed another pro-Democratic bias, our presidential model nevertheless finished first among media outlets for predicting state-level vote shares. ","The project was a massive undertaking completed by a relatively small team of 5 people (three visual journalists and two data journalists) in a very short period of time. Cumulatively, the 2020 forecasts pages added up to the most trafficked Economist.com page ever, with 20 million views over a period of five months. The forecasting models also represented The Economist's most sophisticated statistical modelling efforts ever. Our team made several advanced contributions to the public conversation about polling, including identifying the ultimate cause of the year's polling error long before it occurred. Because of our data team's constant dialogue with the survey research, political science and academic statistical communities, we were able to include an explicit modeling adjustment for polls that had too many Democratic or Republican voters in them, which helped our model perform better in states with biased samples. No other outlet so openly acknowledged polling's weakness to so-called ""partisan non-response bias."" In developing our forecasting models, we made a number of contributions to academic forecasting efforts and open-science. One of our data journalists co-authored several academic journal articles about the forecast, which used a newly-developed and very sophisticated programming language for fully Bayesian statistics. This allowed us to formally acknowledge more sources of uncertainty from the polling and non-polling data. This is both a valuable methodological step, and also enables us to give readers a more honest representation of our very complex and often unpredictable world. In a first for any media outlet, we also published the full data and code behind our presidential election model on GitHub. This allowed researchers to download the model and run it themselves, sending any feedback directly to our data team. The GitHub repo has over 1,200 ""stars,"" 167 ""forks,"" and dozens of issues where our team has engaged with the"," Our modeling efforts used several state-of-the-art machine learning and Bayesian statistical algorithms to predict the election results. In coming up with election predictions from the so-called “fundamentals” — economic and political indicators that have a record of predicting election results — we used several R packages to train regularised regression models and run cross-validation techniques to tune out noisy indicators and fully explore the potential error of predictions made for the future. To integrate the polls, we trained a fully Bayesian statistical model with markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the Stan programming language. This allowed us to make adjustments and add uncertainty for virtually every variable and every step in our modeling design — from our “fundamentals” forecast, to whether polls were conducted online or via telephone, to the demographic similarities between states when simulating possible outcomes.   We created the website using Next.js, a JavaScript server-side framework for web applications based on React. The graphics were written from scratch with D3.js, using SVG and Canvas. The website team integrated the Economist login and ad services to have a seamless transition between the main site and our project, which lived on a separate domain.   The text of the site was updated through Google Docs with a custom version of ArchieML that ran on the Google App Script platform. This added an option on the Google Docs menu bar to upload the new copy directly to the CDN, without having to run command-line tools. We also added support for some Economist typographical conventions like small caps and paragraph flourishes.   The models, running on an AWS instance, fetched the polls and generated new data at 7:00 AM, noon, and 6:00 PM with a cronjob. The CSV files were synced to the CDN and made available to the frontend minutes later.    "," Our modeling efforts took a lot of time to get right — and even after hundreds of hours of collaboration, design, and training and testing models, they were still imperfect. This represents an overall weakness of election forecasts when they are removed from contextual journalism: what do we really learn from simply predicting the outcome of the election? We recognised this issue early in our conversations about strategy and accordingly worked hand-in-hand with our US political correspondents to embrace and explain the models to readers, but still may have fallen short in fully explaining what we were predicting, and why.   Getting the message of uncertainty across was also a very challenging part of the project. We experimented with different charts and displays to make the concept of the prediction more approachable, avoiding too many numbers in the copy and showing the electoral votes with 60% and 95% confidence intervals instead of the raw prediction by default. The main histogram has a “dartboard mode” that animates and displays the result of thousands of simulations at once, another novel innovation by our interactive visualisers. Additionally, we tried to show the inner workings of the model with a map that shows the correlation between states, or how their vote intention moves together. Packaging all this information in a way that the average reader could understand was challenging, but nevertheless worthwhile.    In the end, we believe that we developed a suite of data-journalism products that (i) clearly explained how polls work, especially how uncertain they inherently are; (ii) allowed us to focus only on real movements in public opinion, rather than fluctuations from outlier polls or other narratives; and (iii) fostered transparency and academic collaboration in a series of groundbreaking firsts for a data-journalism department in a large mainstream publication.    "," First and foremost, we would recommend that other data journalists partner with academics and statisticians to explore opportunities for collaboration. Our partnership with a renowned statistics professor and a graduate student at Columbia University proved very fruitful when creating our advanced models and exploring new ways to push the boundaries of election prediction and data journalism. We are confident that partnerships in other subjects would improve coverage and benefit readers.   If a team is entertaining future election-forecasting models, they should know that our efforts allowed us to meet several important goals in polling aggregation, election reporting, and data journalism:   First, given the performance of the polls in 2016, we wanted to create a forecasting model that explored a larger range of uncertainty in pre-election polls than popularly acknowledged. We also wanted to incorporate other sources of information that could help us predict the outcome. Because the polling industry is undergoing such massive technological and methodological changes, these steps are necessary to explaining how polls work, and how accurate we can (or can’t) expect them to be.   Second, we found that our model’s ability to identify key states long before the election itself was a valuable tool in allocating reporting resources and avoiding the constant noise and distractions of the news cycle. In this way, newsrooms should view forecasts not only as public-facing investments, but also as internal ones.   Finally, The Economist has strived to lead the industry in embracing standards of transparency and open science. This was a clear weakness of election forecasting in 2016, plausibly contributing to the public’s misunderstanding of election forecasts and polling. Our public discussions with a community of coders online at GitHub.com have improved our journalism, and we recommend all outlets follow suit in releasing their data and code wherever possible.    ",https://www.economist.com/us2020forecast,https://github.com/TheEconomist/us-potus-model,,,,,,,"G.

"Hong Kong S.A.R., China",individual,Small,Participant,The Evolution of Putian Network,01/02/20,"Investigation, Health, Economy","Animation, Scraping, D3.js, Json, Microsoft Excel, CSV, Python"," Although Putian is a small city in China, Putian families are well-known for their dominant power in running private hospitals. In recent years, Putian families have been entangled in medical malpractice scandals. However, while being tagged as cheater or butcher on social media, Putian families are rarely investigated and remain mysterious for most people. To unveil Putian families, we investigate the business empires of 3 most known families: Zhan, Lin, and Chen. After drawing an overall portrait of Putian hospitals, we dig into each of the 3 Putian families by visualizing and analyzing the evolution of their business networks. "," This work is the second report of Putian Network Series. We started to pay attention to Putian families and their business network since 2017. As far as we know, we are the first one to investigate Putian families through the lens of business network and analyze the network with data visualization. Our work has offered a fresh viewpoint of understanding Putian families and has promoted people’s knowledge around Putian families' business practice and how their medical empires are developed over years. We published this work on both our personal website as well as the platforms of Chinese news agencies such as thePaper.cn. The work has raised public attention about Putian families and received a lot of positive comments from readers. We received invitations from medical investment teams such as ByteDance to share our findings about Putian families. We were invited by journalism schools to share our experience in data investigation. This work was also included in the shortlist of PacificVis 2020 Visual Data Storytelling Contest and showcased to the visualization community. "," We start with a name list published by China Business News. A total of 441 private hospitals controlled by Putian families are on the list. We then gathered the business information of 368 out of the 441 hospitals (73 could not be searched) from Tianyancha.com (a vast repository of Chinese enterprise information), including their registration time, registered capital, stakeholders, administrative penalties and lawsuits. We collected and cleaned the business data with Python and Excel. To visualize the data, we first draw an overall portrait of the hospitals using an animated sankey diagram where hospitals are grouped according to a set of categorical variables (e.g., location, number of lawsuits) with D3.js. Next, we take a closer look at 3 well-known Putian families and visualize the evolution of their business empires by combining node-link diagrams with timelines using Echarts.js. To further readers’ understanding about the networks, we draw stream graphs with RawGraphs and Adobe Illustrator to summarize the business patterns of the 3 families. "," First, it is hard to collect the data about Putian families. To analyze the business network of them, we should collect both business data and kinship data. The business data we gathered is more or less unstructured, so we put a lot of efforts into cleaning and structurizing the data. As for the kinship data, we manually searched and confirmed the family relationship between the stakeholders of the companies. To do this, we referred to five different sources: (1) new reports about Putian families, (2) the websites of the hospitals we investigate, (3) the website of Putian Medical Business Organization, (4) local government websites of Putian City, and (5) a local temple donated by Putian families where they carved their names on a donor wall (we went there physically). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one to reveal the family relationship under Putian business network systematically. Second, understanding the evolution of Putian network in-depth requires a lot of domain knowledge about China’s medical industry. In order to put the data into historical and cultural contexts, we read a lot of news, reports, and papers to gain more insights into the data. Third, it is not easy to keep neutrality towards Putian families because public attitudes to Putian-related topics are usually very negative - in China, “Putian” is almost equal to cheat and greed. Instead of judging Putian families emotionally, in this work, we try to be neutral and let the data speaks. As shown by our analysis, the Putian network never stops evolving and is becoming more and more diversified. New business patterns are emerging and some high-quality hospitals are substituting low-quality clinics... We hope such findings can make Chinese people judge Putian families more objectively. "," There are three issues we would like to share with other journalists: (1) How to deal with finance or economics-related topics in journalism: Financial or economical reports are often data-driven but can be boring for many readers. How to deliver data to the audience without confusing or overwhelming them becomes an important question. By doing this project, we found that business network is an interesting angle to observe how capital and people are organized. Also, we found that network visualization may be a viable way to engage readers (compared to common statistic charts shown in financial report), since people show high interest in exploring who and who are related and who is the big boss; (2) How to explore and visualize network data: This work mainly deals with network data. To analyze and present the data, we tried some commonly-used metrics in network mining, such as ""degree"" and ""betweeness"". We also designed the visualizations specially to encode multidimentional data such as temporal information (we use timelines and animation to show temporal changes), categorical information (we encode the category of nodes using color), and textual information (we use tooltips to present textual descriptions for the nodes), thus resulting in an ""enriched"" network visualization; (3) How to collect qualitative data and cross-validate the credibility of data: We collected a large amount of qualitative data from various sources in order to confirm the kinship between Putian people. To dig out as much useful information from these materials as possible and make sure the information we get is credible, we need to cross-check the information iteratively and confirm the information using multiple sources.

"," From the very start of the pandemic, misinformation regarding its origins was rife. This article aimed to provide a coherent, clear and fact-based narrative of how the virus spread across the world. The 3D rendering was chosen to highlight how quickly Covid-19 transmitted across borders and oceans, and to emphasise how seriously the UK should approach it.

We settled on the idea of a spinning globe very quickly but then had to figure out how to get it to work.    We hadn’t produced a 3D globe before, especially one with so many data points.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,The Guardian: US election visual projects,03/09/20,"Explainer, Quiz/game, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections","D3.js, JQuery, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","  The Guardian Visuals team created a series of data-driven projects ahead of the US presidential election. In a controversial campaign where polls were treated with scepticism, we felt it important to produce visuals that explained exactly how the US elects a President.      In our “build your own election result” interactive, readers could choose how swing states voted to see who they could get elected.      Meanwhile, “electoral college explained” piece used data and graphics to outline the facts of the system and how, in recent history, it has benefited the Republicans.  ","    Our “build your own election result” interactive had one of the highest engagement times of any of our team’s pieces in the run-up to the US election. This proves that our community was engaged in the content and wanted to understand just how either candidate could win the election. We can see that thousands of people engaged with this content, showing that we were able to facilitate a better understanding of how the electoral system works. While our straightforward guide to the electoral college was used to supplement our readers’ understanding, it was the interactive that proved the real success with our audience.  ","  In our  “electoral college explained” piece, we used an in-house chart tool to generate the more basic bar charts, before adding annotations and refinements in Adobe Illustrator and using an ai2html script to embed them in our CMS. D3.js was used to generate the main structure of the proportional circle map and the tower chart, the latter of which involved assigning the width and height of rectangles by different variables and then lining them up next to each other. Once the basis of these visualisations was generated, annotations were again added in Adobe Illustrator.         The “build your own election result” interactive was built in Javascript, and the structure was initially based on a previous project in which user’s tried to get Theresa May’s Brexit deal through Parliament by assigning who voted ‘For’ and Against’. Additional features were then added, such as animations to iterate through electoral votes as states were added, and switch the portraits of the candidates as one of them surpassed the majority. The project was built to draw its data from a Google Sheet, in order for it to be easily updated as changes were required, without having to edit code and re-deploy the project.   ","  The hardest part of our “build your own election result” interactive was deciding on the best way to structure the piece; balancing the provision of enough context to guide the user to their      decision without overwhelming them with information, and allowing enough flexibility to choose how different states voted without too many clicks before you reach the finish scenario.          We decided early on that one of the most important elements this piece should include was additional information about US states to help the user choose plausible scenarios, and avoid the creation of highly unlikely election result maps. After several iterations, we arrived at a solution that presented a lot of information in a uniform manner for each swing state, combining data in our historical voting indicator with text snippets providing extra context.         For the “electoral college explained” piece the hardest part was working out how best to demonstrate with data and graphics how the system currently favours Republicans. This involved emphasising the value of states with the most electoral votes, how large margins mean little under the winner-takes-all system, and how uneven population distribution across the country affects outcomes. Our upside-down tower chart which sizes states in two dimensions allowed us to tackle the first two of these ideas in one graphic, and delving deeper into key demographic groups in swing states helped us demonstrate the third.  ","  As someone new to journalism, the most important thing I learnt in creating these projects was to really consider what the reader wants to gain from them. The explainer’s main purpose was      to provide a factual overview of the electoral system through which readers would gain a better understanding of the election that was taking place. This meant using jargon-free language, providing examples of previous results to explain complex dynamics like winner-takes-all and the popular vote, and using carefully thought out visuals to highlight imbalances in the system.          As a more technically demanding project, the “build your own election result” interactive required close attention to tiny details that would affect the overall user experience. Before publishing, we had several members of our team look over the project and test it out. From visual journalists who could point out that a smaller sticky header on mobile would make a big difference, to US political correspondents who made suggestions on language that would better suit an international audience. These small adjustments that came from having more eyes on the project made the final piece easier to use and understand, and ultimately a more enjoyable experience for the reader that likely played a part in its success.

Japan,Nikkei,Big,Participant,The hard truth for an aging society,22/09/20,"Investigation, Open data, Map, Health","QGIS, Python"," This was a series of visual stories focusing on Japan’s experience in the super-aging society. Japan faces obstacles in many areas like healthcare, housing, pension, etc. In the article on the housing problem, we analyzed that people need to continue mortgage payments until 73 years old on average because the average age of new borrowers is rising. In another story, we pointed out that we could face a shortage of doctors in some suburban areas due to the aging of doctors. We demonstrate the inconvenient truth by simulating the future and encourage immediate action. "," The article on housing problem attract high engagement from our readers and was one of the most read article last year with more than 300,000 viewers. Engagement from financial industry is especially high and we received letters from our readers. One said that lenders need to consider the risk of own behavior to solve the excess lending problem.

For visualization, we used the scrolly telling techniques to enhance a better understanding of our readers. "," We tried to access the comprehensive data on mortgages including large and small financial institutions. We asked many banks to provide their loan data, but banks were reluctant to provide their own data. The mortgage loan is a cash cow for banks under the ultra low-interest rate and they don’t admit their responsibilities for offering a large amount of loan to the aging society.   Throughout many interviews, we realized that mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are a good source of loan data and we finally collected the comprehensive data for our analysis.

We went there and talked to farmers who use irrigation systems to save their crops from droughts. We collected data on companies that have permits to extract water in Ukraine and info about and groundwater reserves. We found out what the state is doing to facilitate the process of obtaining permits for the construction of irrigation systems. "," We became the first team of journalists in Ukraine to study the relationship between global warming and its consequences for the country's agricultural sector. With the help of data collected from various sources (scientific articles, state registers, etc.), we showed a general picture and forecast of the situation for the next ten years. We explained in the simplest and most interesting language, on the example of living stories, how the irrigation system business works and what hinders its development. Since the publication came out in the last days of 2020, we are confident that the impact on the audience will be felt in the near future. "," As a primary analytic tool, we used python programming language with libraries for scrapping (bs4, requests) and data analysis (pandas, matplotlib). Additionally, we have done geoprocessing with qgis. We utilized vector tiles to represent ten thousand points on the map.   We used those tools to obtain data about water usage from the governmental data portal and get insights into the irrigation and water security in Ukraine. This helped to figure out that the entire industry is monopolized and could be affected by Russian citizens.    Along with the purely technical tools, we used investigative journalism techniques for collecting information from official sources, interviewing businesses, experts, and the local population in the region of interest.

First required detecting patterns in the varied and disperse data, including information from the national registry of water users, historical weather records, business data, and agriculture export statistics. Second, working with local communities, businesses, and officials to shed light on how communities in the regions most affected by climate change in Ukraine support and develop their irrigation facilities. And how these facilities help them to maintain traditional agriculture activities.

Indonesia's economy is only one level below Vietnam's economic growth. However, this is a challenge because the absence of a total quarantine in early 2020 has made Covid-19 cases continue to increase.

Ben & Jerry's even recognized the project, tweeting ""these folks may know more about our own ice cream than we do!"".

We wanted to find the best way to tell an engaging, joyful story, but had to balance that with creating a user experience that worked across devices and browsers. We had to rework sections multiple times in order to enhance performance and remove any bugs that could occur from user's interacting in unexpected ways. For example, we used a circle for each of the 98 flavors. We wanted to transition the position of the circle between each section. However, we noticed the performance lagged occasionally and scrolling too fast would break the visualization.

Mexico,NoSinNosotras.com,Small,Participant,The myth of fake calls: #TheHardData,08/06/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Breaking news, Open data, Fact-checking, Illustration, Infographics, Women, Gun violence, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel"," When thousands of women point out the same man for violence, the rest of the men question the credibility of all those voices and defend the rapist with tooth and nail.   Even if he has a history and we don't even know him by sight, we shelter him in command because, deep down, we know the length of our own tail.   One of them was President Andres Manuel López Obrador, who, in a press conference and before the whole country, argued that 90% of the calls for gender violence to 911 were fake. But what does the hard data say? "," In a context of pandemic and in which many women were forced to live with their aggressors during the isolation protocol, for the first time in the history of Mexico we were able to generate an accurate report of the “not appropriate” complaints, breaking them down into silent calls, non-emergency calls, incomplete calls, prank calls, insult calls, test calls, transfer calls and FAKE CALLS.   By disaggregating all the contacts to the 911 hotline, I identified that less than 0.58% of the calls were apocryphal, which places our country below the world average and helps to avoid both stigmatization and re-victimization of people attacked in am Mexico where 9 out of 10 crimes are not reported.   The study was replicated by national organizations such as ""Me Too Mexico"", ""We have other data"" and ""Ni Una Menos Mexico"", reaching up to 48,580 impacts (measurable and verifiable) that allowed to ratify that 1 of every 2 cases of violence against women emanates from the men they live with.   The most interesting impact of this report was that it received a cyber attack by organized machi-trolls and anti-rights groups on Facebook, which allowed me to identify 1,017 of those hate-inciting groups, causing them to permanently removed from the social network.   Likewise, it was possible to dispel the main myths expressed by López Obrador during the press conference and disprove a viral publication that circulated throughout Latin America during the pandemic entitled “Patriarchy? No little female friend, in Mexico there is no patriarchal society and I will explain why ”. "," The most complex of these investigations was to analyze the 148 crimes contemplated by the National Census of State Justice Procurement, with victims and perpetrators, for 32 states of the Republic and full national compilation, generating a total of 9,768 variables.   Taking into consideration this volume of data, I generated an Excel formula that allows us to automate the exact disaggregation of men and women who are accused of crimes in the Mexican Republic, their degree of kinship with the person attacked, and the numerical proportion on territories with the highest crime incidence (per crime).   Once I automated these figures, it was quite easy to apply the principles of UN Women, Oxfam International, and CIMAC Press to build narratives with a gender perspective, modeling the indicators under a simple but powerful reading that directly impacts the language:   Because it is not the same to say that ""33,981 women are sexually abused every year (as if they were asking for it)"" to express that ""31,558 MEN are raping young girls and women in a yearly-basis"".   Subsequently, I modelized the data with a non-sexist perspective using Adobe InDesign for distribution on social media, allowing me to generate master degree research’s in less than a week after the story exploded on the agenda-setting, maintaining novelty, temporality, and validity among digital communities to the extent that some of this data was used in iconoclasm and local protests all around the country. "," The biggest challenge in this story was to create the Formula to cross the data of four different reports in an automated way: the National Statistics of the Number of Attention to Emergency Calls 911, the Information on violence against women (Crime incidence and emergency calls 911 ), the National Census of State Justice Procurement and Local Mobility Report on COVID-19 in Mexico, prepared by Google Inc.   Subsequently, it was required to structure a table of contents that would allow us to understand the increases during the pre-pandemic period and the increases generated during the ""National Sana Distancia Day"" until obtaining a single image that condensed three years of information in a single graph of pastry.   As stated in the Information Request 4010000000519 before the National Transparency Platform, not even the Mexican National Institute of Statistics and Geography has identified the existence of ""crimes with convictions of women and men for false accusations after the acquittal/file of the denounced matter"".   And of course, consolidating this hard information, simplifying it for the general population, and without losing neither the instructional nor the methodology required, the manufacture of at least three Formulation Tables in record time (and even so, we published late). "," If the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to do something, it is to learn new skills and abilities to “do more with less” in record time.   It is not necessary to have large newsrooms, budget increases, state-of-the-art technology, predictive tools, neural networks, and machine-learning protocols to tell stories that captivate our audiences, encouraging them to make the immediate transition to an increasingly just, empathetic, and informed world.   Very humbly, I allow myself to invite all of our invaluable information professionals to dare to “make things happen” and, from the powerful platform that social media provide us, launch in-depth investigations in real-time that will serve the public that really needs us: common men and women who are truth-thirsty in a country that ranks second in the world of #FakeNews distribution.   If a team of only one person can do it from a living room apartment, zero budget, and one-week deadlines with half a million impacts, I am sure that my colleagues, with much more preparation than myself, will be able to generate even more robust results.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,The Race Gap,13/07/20,"Explainer, Database, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Lifestyle, Health, Crime, Economy, Employment","Personalisation, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite"," Reuters collected metrics across 11 stages of life, from maternal health to educational attainment, wealth accumulation and life expectancy, to illustrate how the systemic discrimination and disenfranchisement of Black Americans plays out over a lifetime, more than 150 years after slavery was abolished.    While there has been progress, gaps have widened in the years since the civil rights victories of the 1960s, proving immune to decades of laws and policies meant to address them.    Taken together this breadth of data reflects what many have labeled systemic racism, pervading every aspect of Black American life from birth to death. "," Amid the mass protests that followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May of 2020, there were national discussions about aspects of the plight of Black Americans, particularly around police brutality.    Investigations, data-reporting and the unraveling of a complex history of legislation were vital for the understanding of each individual disadvantage. But while as a society we have attempted to understand these metrics in isolation, it’s looking at them in a broader context.

Greece,"AthensLive, Documento",Small,Participant,The rent is too damn high,29/01/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Economy, Employment, Human rights","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Python"," There isn’t a single neighborhood in Attiki where someone earning the minimum wage for a 40-hour workweek can afford a two-bedroom home at market rent.   As part of AthensLive’s investigation into rent affordability, we looked into rental prices across the region of Attiki, acquired from the national E-Real Estates network, and captured details of more than 17,000 rental properties that were advertised on spitogatos.gr — one of Greece’s leading real estate websites — on a single day. By mapping these against Greece’s minimum wage, we found that 0% are actually affordable. "," The story was published in English on AthensLive and in Greek in the print and online editions of the leading investigative newspaper Documento, reaching an international audience both in Greece and abroad, extending beyond Europe. It also had some of the highest reader engagement. The story has placed the question of the right to adequate and affordable housing at the center of the political debate concerning the financialization of urban space and of our cities.   Readers took to social media to share how they have been affected by the housing crisis in their cities/neighborhoods; housing experts, lawmakers, and activist groups have shared and commented on our findings; academics reached out to say that they have cited the project in their papers and that they have been using it for educational purposes; and other journalists got in touch to ask if we wanted to collaborate on future investigations. In words of  Maeve McClenaghan of The Bureau of Investigative Journalism  in the UK: ""This is a great/shocking investigation - shows what a huge issue access to affordable rental properties is in Greece.""   The long-term impact on the organisation, and part of our long-term commitment, was in strengthening our capacity to bring diversity, authenticity, new voices and data journalism into the public sphere in Greece and thereby make an important contribution to the democratic process.   Our freely accessible dataset gives open access to basic information on the characteristics of each unit. All cases can be tracked and counted so that anyone can oversee what is going on in the rental market of Athens while generating new knowledge and empowering affected communities. "," To calculate rent affordability in Athens and understand the impact of the crisis on housing   ,  we combined past and present rental prices we acquired from the national E-Real Estates network with our snapshot of all available properties for rent in the greater area of Attiki, advertised on spitogatos.gr - one of Greece’s property search engines - on a single day.   First, using the Beautiful Soup library in Python we looped through all the pages returned by Spitogatos with the available rental properties across Attiki in order to get their URL and dig into their details.   Second, we looped through each URL we acquired from our first scraping in order to get the details of each unit, including the type of the unit (i.e. apartment, detached house, maisonette, studio flat, villa, building, loft, apartment complex, other), the neighbourhood where it’s located, its price and size, year of construction, number of bedrooms, the floor it’s on etc.   After we collected all the relevant information from spitogatos.gr, we converted our lists of results into a dataframe in the Pandas library in order to start the cleaning and then the analysis. We cleaned our dataframe using regex and then we analysed it in Pandas.   Because we pulled down results for each neighborhood and then combined them in one database, we sometimes had the same property listed multiple times. Therefore, it was important to detect and remove any duplicates in the list. To do this, we checked for any duplicate URLs.   We also obtained the shapefiles from the government’s GEODATA.gov.gr to determine which neighborhood is the most expensive and how many two-bedroom apartments are available.   Lastly, we visualized our findings as well as poverty and exclusion data from Eurostat using the plotting library matplotlib and edited our graphs in Adobe Illustrator. "," Our goal is to enhance the capacity for journalism that fosters a healthy public debate and democratic participation. We believe that thoroughly documented, data-driven investigations are vital for exposing wrongdoing, enhancing transparency and civic engagement. Our work brings direct attention where there is apathy or ignorance. When the public don't see, with our stories, we make them an eyewitness to a human rights crisis.   However, there are essential limitations to accessing data in Greece, and most importantly raw real estate data. That’s why we decided to generate our own data, by scraping spitogatos.gr, and share it with other people and organizations.   The combination of global capital, government policies designed to kill off social democracy and failures in housing supply, especially at an affordable level, are reconfiguring Greece’s big cities and sit at the root of a host of social problems, from poverty and homelessness to educational disparities and health care. That means understanding the unreasonable increase in rents in Athens is critical to effectively addressing these problems and reducing inequality.    One of the biggest challenges was finding the balance between openness of the data and guidance to particular findings or patterns that are interesting to our audience. With datasets like this, it can be tempting to either leave it totally open or guide people through a carefully curated path. We wanted to find a middle-ground where we can our community understand the data, through our story, but then also explore it and build their own, locally-relevant narratives with it, through our open resources.   First and foremost, using data and dataviz helped us better understand - and then tell - the difficult and complex stories of exclusion, household debt, and social segregation in Athenian apartment buildings due to increased poverty and austerity. "," We see housing as a fundamental human right and believe that a stable, affordable home is central to human flourishing and economic mobility. Accordingly, understanding the prevalence, causes, and consequences of housing insecurity is foundational to understanding poverty in Greece.   For the poorest folks, affording adequate housing has long been a challenge. But in Greece, it has become a middle-class problem, too. With many economists arguing that housing costs of less than one third of household income can be considered ‘affordable’, it appears that €637, which is the minimum net wage in the country, can’t pay for a two-bedroom apartment built before 2004 anywhere in Attiki. In fact, there were only 11 one-bedroom units available for up to €212 — which is the 33.3 percent of the lowest net wage — none of them on a higher floor than the ground floor. It is not so much about supply and demand, but rather the fact that the city no longer serves its people, forcing them into intolerable conditions or out of the city altogether.   Through this project, AthensLive has made region-wide rentals data publicly available and accessible. We hope this data is used by policymakers, community organizers, journalists, educators, non-profit organizations, students, and citizens interested in understanding more about housing, the Greek crisis, and poverty in their own backyards. You can map rental prices across the region of Attiki, compare properties of different neighborhoods, and adapt our technical methodology in your own work to generate custom reports about other cities and states around the world.   Overall, we believe the relationship between journalism and civil society can be strengthened and supported by creating a visual grammar to make data more understandable; designing open tools to enable data exploration; and packing know-how into guides in order to spread knowledge.

United Kingdom,Reach Data Unit,Small,Participant,The State of Football Finance,02/07/20,"Investigation, Database, Chart, Sports, Business, Economy","JQuery, Google Sheets",  The State of Football Finance project takes key club financial data and makes them more accessible to fans. The project aims to democratise the information so fans can more easily see how their club is performing off the pitch and how it compares to others in the division.  ,"Football finances don't get the hearts of many fans racing - but that doesn't mean that they aren't important. In 2019, four historied clubs went into administration, two of which (Bury and Macclesfield) were eventually liquidated and no longer exist. Their plight showed that what happens in the boardroom can be as important as what happens on the pitch. Clubs publish their accounts every year to Companies House as PDF documents. But while these are technically publicly available to fans, the format and jargon means they're not particularly accessible to the average fan. The State of Football Finance project was designed to make the account information more easily available to fans. The first step, carreid out by david D was to go through four years worth of accounts for every club to have played in the top two divisions of English football in that time, pulling out the profit/loss and revenue information from each. That worked out at over 200 sets of accounts. This data was then fed into a gadget created by the Data Unit's developer, Cullen Willis. The gadget lets readers easily see their club's key financial data and compares it to other clubs in the division. Financial data for English clubs has never been collated and made comparable in this way before. Having all this financial information available has allowed the Reach Data Unit to massively improve the scope of the sport stories we produce. Whenever a club releases its accounts we can use the data and the gadget to show how they compare to previous years ad to other clubs. The data also showed how second division clubs spend more than they earn on wages, and means we've also been able to use it to find out what the financial impact of covid-19 will be on"," The data was collected by manually reading 232 sets of club accounts from Companies House. This data was then added to Google Sheets.   The data was added to an SQL database for ease of use. The front end interactive used a combined set of languages and libraries, such as; - PHP, Javascript, JQuery, and Flotchart.   The design was created using photoshop.  "," We had the idea to make financial data more available to fans, but no one within the Data Unit had any experience in reading company accounts. The first, and perhaps hardest step in the project was to learn how to read company accounts. There was then the task of reading through 232 sets of accounts in order to get all of the data. this wasn't especially tricky, but it was very time consuming.      "," That going through hundreds of records on Companies house takes a long time and is really, really boring. But sometimes it's just got to be done.  ",https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/stoke-city-accounts-finances-ffp-4287338,https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-missing-out-over-18956460,https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/hull-city-finances-laid-bare-4291991,,,,,,"David Dubas-Fisher, Cullen Willis, Kelly Leung","  David Dubas-Fisher is a sport data journalist for the Reach Data Unit.

Well, until today we see great impunity and corruption in the 84 municipalities of Hidalgo ... And NOTHING HAPPENS????'   I wish, if my friends and reader of the Journalism Concertation to Reflect Magazine allow me, to be able to analyze some strawberries of a man and his concert of the philosophical one that Lic.

Quote by Benito Juárez     "," That today the media must be in the vanguard on the laws and legal regulations, to know the obligations that all public officials have, but at the same time it would be so that the people are more informed with fundamental data that they should know about how the budget is spent and that the media should never shut up for only having a resource to shut up the journalists.   Quote by Benito Juárez   There is no doubt that in Mexico, being an investigative journalist is a synonym of annoyance to the rulers, that living in impunity and corruption will cause some journalists to have repression, oppression and even criminal complaints ... depending on how it affects their behavior. .   It is here where once again we leave this phrase that Benito Juárez left behind.   My duty is to enforce the law not only with measures of the spring of authority, but with the example to attack those who with unfounded scruples were retracting from using the benefit that the law granted them.

United Kingdom,JPIMedia local and regional newspapers,Big,Participant,The Threat to the UK's Precious Natural Wonders,21/01/20,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Map, Environment, Agriculture","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," This investigation into the state of the UK’s Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) involved the analysis of more than 26,000 official inspections - some of which had never been published before - to reveal the poor conditions of some of the UK’s protected sites. SSSIs are chosen because they are home to rare plants, species or important geographical features. This story revealed thousands were in a poor state - with half of official inspections finding conditions unsatisfactory. Some sites were destroyed. Many sites had also gone unassessed for years, leading campaigners to fear the situation could be worse. "," Ranging from national to local newspapers, the investigation was featured in approximately 90 JPIMedia newspapers/websites across the UK. The story was produced centrally within the JPIMedia Data Unit and shared across all newspapers. This allowed local newspapers to take their own unique approach to the story and share an exclusive with their readers - it was the frontpage splash on multiple newspapers. I also produced my own UK wide version which was featured on all JPIMedia websites (project link 1).    While looking at the state of the UK’s SSSI on a national scale made an impact in its own right, at a hyper local level it meant the readership of our local newspapers could directly see what the situation was like in their immediate area. For example, the Edinburgh Evening News reported on how “lack of remedial management” meant grassland at the iconic Arthur’s Seat park was in an unfavourable state. The Portsmouth News also reported on how the Portsmouth Harbour and parts of the water near Lee-on-the-Solent were seeing no improvement. The Edinburgh Evening News spoke with the body which manages the land who confirmed they were addressing the issue and the Portsmouth News spoke with a local environmental charity to shed more light on the situation. These are just two examples of how a wider data driven investigation brought action at a local level. "," To produce this investigation I used standard data analysis software. I predominantly used Excel to clean and analyse the larger datasets, while Google Sheets was used to share the data across our newspapers. I also used visualisation software, Flourish, to map the results across the UK.  "," This investigation involved bringing multiple datasets into one story. Sourcing equivalent data for all four UK countries was one of the biggest challenges of the project. While the Scotland data was publicly available there was no such information for Northern Ireland. This didn’t stop me accessing the information though and after contacting a government department I was given the equivalent, unpublished data which meant I could provide an exclusive story for our newspapers in Northern Ireland. The data for England was far more complicated to analyse though. It involved cleaning a messy dataset from an official government website and then merging and cross referencing the SSSIs with data from another official environmental site to ensure the sites were linked to the correct areas and regions.  "," I think an important point of my story for other journalists to take away is that you don't need to always follow the newscycle to produce an important piece of work. While the state of our environment has never been more appreciated, SSSIs and our local environment don’t always receive the attention they deserve. The investigation highlighted hyper local issues in a national context.   Another important point to take into consideration is that despite the shocking figures, it was only after speaking to a farmer that we could appreciate the difficulties faced by landowners when it comes to managing land which is also home to a SSSI. The interview brought a whole new dimension to the story as we could get a better understanding about the challenges faced by landowners.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Participant,The tragedy of the nursing homes in Spain: one of each ten elderly died during the pandemic,22/06/20,"Investigation, Database, Fact-checking, Chart, Health","D3.js, JQuery, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic that shacked Spain in March and April of 2020, there was a segment of the population that was specially wounded: the elderly residents on nursing homes. News about clusters and deaths due to COVID-19 in these residences were daily and the Government wasn't publishing any dataabout mortality this phenomena. elDiario.es compiled these data from each one of the 17 autonomous communities in Spain, harmonized them and analyzed them for first time, this was the data that provees what all the news were saying, elderly people in nursing homes were dying and were"," The main contribution of this piece of information was to shed light on a highly profund and maximun interest topic for the society: deaths due to Covid-19 in the nursing homes in Spain. To understand the value of this research it is necessary to have into account the context in which it took place: almost everyday we read news about new Covid-19 clusters and deaths in nursing homes. The months passed without the Government providing any data about it, alluding to the lack of information from the autonomic governments*. At the same time, some autonomous communities -which are responsible for the management of the nursing homes- blamed on the central Government for the situation in their care homes.  In this context of opacity and cross accusations among administrations, the Data team of elDiario.es carried out an investigation based on public service. This work served the people to get a quite approximate idea of the situation in the nursing homes in Spain and in each autonomous community, one of the segments of the population more deeply wounded during the pandemic.  *In Spain, the autonomous communities have the competencies to manage their own health systems. During the pandemic, autonomic governments must communicate their Covid-19 data to the Ministry of Public Health. Finally, is the central government who unifies and provides all this information.    "," Although this is a piece of information based on data, it was not elaborated through data mining, downloading databases or other similar techniques. Due to the lack of public and accessible data, the Data team of elDiario.es made information requests directly to the autonomic governments of each community. The information obtained was transferred to a collaborative database, in this case from Google Spreadsheet. With this same tool we cleaned up the data, we standardized them in order to make them comparable among them, and we crossed them with other datasets to go in depth in their analysis. Finally, we translated these analyses into interactive visualizations created with Datawrapper and D3.js.    "," The hardest part of this research was the process of compilation, cleaning and harmonization of the information provided. Because of the lack of official public, accessible, actualized and unified data from the Spanish Government regarding the situation and deaths in nursing homes during the pandemic, elDiario.es’s data team compiled all this information by itself.  In order to do so, elDiario.es made public information requests to the government of each one of the 17 autonomous communities. This very first step already means a difficulty by itself, for the area responsible for the management of the nursing homes depends on each autonomous community.  We asked for the same information in every case: number of deaths (with confirmed Covid-19, with suspicious Covid-19 and due to other reasons) in residential centres for older people, from the beginning of March to June. We also asked for the census of elderly residents in retirement homes at the beginning of March (before the beginning of the first wave of the pandemic).  However, due to the absence of standards for counting and collecting registers, the information obtained from the autonomous communities was not homogeneous and, therefore, comparable. The casuistry was significant (all the details about it in the methodological note at the end of the article). To all this, we must add the delay of the answers or even the absence of response of some administrations. Only the information compilation process took more than two weeks.    ","   This project is a good example of what data journalism can achieve through information requests. We asked for data to 17 different administrations in order to obtain and unify an information of public service that the central Government would not make public after months, and we created attractive and interactive visualizations to show in an easy way a complex information. Good coordination and fluid communication among the members of the Data team was indispensable to make possible this precise scoop.    ",https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/ancianos-residencias-fallecieron-crisis-coronavirus_1_6058018.html,,,,,,,,"Raúl Sánchez, Ana Ordaz, Victòria Oliveres"," Raúl Sánchez (28 years): Spanish data journalist covering stories of inequality, gender, corruption and Covid at elDiario.es.

The bigger picture however, was the illegal trade of the pangolin and how African countries have contributed to this trade.

United States,Spectator Publishing Company,Big,Participant,The U.S. and Ivy League schools were late to respond to COVID-19. Data shows international universities did better.,13/04/20,"Explainer, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Health","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, R, RStudio, Node.js"," In mid-March 2020, universities in the United States shut down in light of Covid-19. Spectator graphics reporters compiled and analyzed Covid-19 case data against university-related announcements and mandates from Ivy League administrators, U.S. public health officials, and foreign governments to conclude the U.S.’ delayed response to the pandemic and the ripple effect across the Ivies. "," The project held Columbia University and the broader Ivy League administration accountable for their response to Covid-19. By doing basic but essential collection of data and information, we put quantifiable numbers to the delay and lack of unification in responses by Ivy League universities. These inadequacies—reflecting nation-wide under-preparedness for the pandemic—resulted in inconsistent messaging to students about university plans, the persistence of misinformation and biases, and general disregard for preventative measures. As colleges across the nation looked to the Ivies to determine their courses of action, the poor response by the U.S. government extended to Ivy League universities in exacerbating Covid-19 transmission and death tolls. In comparison, countries like South Korea, Italy, and China saw timely, coordinated, and resolute responses from schools and universities. Following this story’s publication, Columbia students saw greater transparency from the university regarding Covid-19 plans and a greater commitment toward protecting the health of students, faculty, university affiliates, and the surrounding community. "," While we used R and RStudio IDE to sketch the global number of coronavirus cases (compiled by the <a href=""https://github.com/datasets/covid-19/tree/master/data"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a> at Johns Hopkins) and national coronavirus data (compiled by the <a href=""https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/us-counties.csv"" style=""text-decoration:none;"">New York Times</a> for their Covid Tracker database), the brunt of the data reporting was more qualitative and required a simple tool: manual reporting.    We looked through several United States, Chinese, Spain, Italy, and South Korea’s government websites to timeline university announcements, and later compare this data to the coronavirus case/death quantitative data. The same reporting was done at a more granular level across the Ivy Leagues and state cases. We originally attempted to compare against county data, but later decided not to as state-level comparisons were more significant and well-reported.   The data is only as good and the story only as compelling as it is presented. For this story, the interactive visualizations and frontend technologies were a large part of its effective reporting. We spent an additional two weeks developing the interactive lede visuals in d3.js and Scrollama (React.js), a scrollytelling library. The in-body graphics were developed using Adobe Illustrator to generate SVGs and HTML that we could manipulate with Javascript in order to continue the scrollytelling effect. The article lives on a web page template different from our standard articles, which runs on Node.js and other backend, server-side technologies. "," As student journalists and specifically graphics reporters, we don’t usually pursue stories with the extent of reporting this one required. This project also challenged the conventions for standard data reporting and how such reporting works in tandem with editorial judgement and story shaping by traditional graphics reporters.   The hardest part of this project was determining the framing and scope of the story. As this was relatively early in the pandemic and there was little previous reporting about university responses, we had to determine the key points of the university response and what Covid-19 case metrics to compare them to.   We originally wanted to compare Ivy League University response rates to each other, but determined the response rate was near identical across the majority of universities. Though, at this point, we could have dropped the story, we pushed the needle a little further by expanding the scope of the story to international universities and grouping Ivy League university shutdowns in response to the pandemic as a collective national response. This required weeks of extensive manual reporting that our graphics reporters did not have experience with in prior projects: searching foreign government websites, translating, comparing against Johns Hopkins reported Covid-19 case and death numbers, etc.   From there on, the challenge was how to represent the data accurately despite nuances and lack of context in foreign responses. This was the first story of its kind by a student paper who knew its value. Bigger newsrooms weren’t as focused on university shutdowns across the globe and contextualizing early/late responses and preparedness. Student journalists telling this story—despite the challenge of retaining accuracy and delivering truth—is remarkable and groundbreaking. This is a story that our Graphics team is truly proud of to this day. "," When this story was published, the Spectator Graphics team was a ten-person team within a 250+ person organization. Our team wanted to do reporting that we owned, instead of supplementing other news desks, and this was our first project doing that. We are students inspired by real-world newsrooms, but trying to challenge conventional student journalism and the traditional role of graphics reporters. Student journalists should know that they can tell far-reaching, impactful stories too—and while they might not see full or deserved recognition—they are telling stories valuable to their communities. Professional journalists, specifically data and/or graphics reporters who work for larger newsrooms, can see that their roles are not solely confined to web scraping, querying within databases, or doing just front-end web development and data visualization. They can also work along the spectrum to do qualitative reporting and sourcing in order to conduct in-depth investigations and contextualize their data. Practicing these skills allows you to feel connected to your story and its impact. It makes the data real, and it allows greater nuance in the narratives we present. Finally, journalists can also look toward projects like ours—student journalism—to build the foundation for larger stories, since student journalists are usually focused on hyperlocal reporting. Local coverage and community issues are generally indicative of larger underlying city, state, national, or even globally spread systemic issues that should be told. These are the stories that drive public discourse and reveal truth.

As stories from women's perspectives are often underrepresented, it helped to balance reporting from events in Belarus. I believe that the story of Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a stay-at-home mom who became the leader of the Belarusian opposition in just a few short weeks, may have motivated women not only in Belarus to demand democratic rights. The project was translated to other languages including Hungarian, Georgian, and Ukrainian to reach even bigger audience. "," Over the course of several weeks, it was necessary to sort out photos, videos, and other materials from the protests in Belarus. The graphics were produced using Adobe Illustrator, the microsite was designed and developed using HTML and CSS. "," The hardest part of this project was keeping track of all the events that were being organized in Belarus, deciding which protests to involve and which visual features are the most important ones.

United Kingdom,Huffington Post,Big,Participant,Tier 3: The Areas That Could Face The Toughest Covid Rules,25/11/20,"Open data, News application, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Health","Personalisation, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","We, G were tasked by the Huffington Post to use the latest Covid-19 data to analyse if areas were going to move into tighter restrictions. The background to this was the announcement of a new tier system after the end of the second lockdown. The article was published the day before the government announced which areas would be placed into which tier. We produced numerous data visualisations which covered the brief we were given. We looked at the following: coronavirus cases in England's regions, case rates in local authorities, the R rate, and weekly positive tests for age groups over"," The first impact was that we were able to educate and inform readers of what tier their area could be placed in. One of the ways we achieved this was by producing a searchable table. Users could look up their local authority and compare case rates from the previous two weeks.    Not everyone has the capabilities to either access this data or understand it. We were able to simplify the information and display important trends in the data. The data journalism profession revolves around communicating complex data to the public. We achieved this by keeping the visuals simple and effective.    Furthermore, we focused on the criteria that was used to determine what tier an area was placed in. That is why we kept the visualisations focused and conveyed each measure the government stated would influence the tiering system.   In terms of the overall accuracy of the piece, we successfully predicted which areas would go into what tier. In addition to showing figures nationally, we were able to also show the areas with the highest rates. These areas were facing inevitable alterations in restrictions.      "," Instead of downloading the data from the government coronavirus dashboard, we decided to query the API in the programming language R. We made this decision due to the API being faster than downloading the CSVs manually. This was important as the editors at the Huffington Post wanted to publish the story before the government’s announcement. Otherwise, it would have lost all newsworthiness. We cleaned the data in R and then filtered for cases from the relevant time frame. This allowed us to compare weekly rates and highlight changes.   Huffington Post wanted case rates in counties to be displayed on a map. To get the case rates for each county, we had to look up which local authorities form a county as well as then work out the case rate per 100,000 population. We used the population estimates from the ONS for this.    A second map that we produced was to visualise the changes in the R rate. We made the editorial decision to use the Huffington Post colour palette. It was accessible for colour blind readers and showed which areas in England had the highest reproduction rates. Text annotations also supply complimentary details to aid the interpretation of the chart.   We used Datawrapper to create the maps and Flourish for the multi-chart and tables. Flourish allowed us to make the visualisations more interactive and incorporate animations.  "," There were a plethora of challenging aspects to this piece. Firstly, time constraints. We both were completing this article whilst carrying out our academic studies. Not only did this add to the pressure, but the tight deadline set by the Huffington Post meant we had little room for error. Ideally, we would have prepared using previous releases. However, on this occasion, this was not possible.    Within the short amount of time we had for this article, we had to familiarise ourselves with the five areas Huffington Post wanted us to explore. These were:   <ul>    Case rates in all age groups       Case rates in the over-60s       The rate at which cases are rising or falling       Positivity rate (the number of positive cases detected as a percentage of tests taken)       Pressure on the NHS, including current and projected occupancy    </ul>  This gave us an idea, but only from looking at the actual data, could we decide how to best visualise it. (Due to a colleague working on another story about hospital bed occupancy, we didn’t look at this data to avoid duplication.)   Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we were working remotely. Therefore, the communication took place on Slack. This is a different way of working that we both had to adapt to. Progress is harder to track and any technical problems are harder to fix.    This was the first time that we had looked at testing and case figures which made the process even more challenging. But we were able to help each other out whenever we came across any obstacles.  "," Other journalists can learn to focus on the core message which was what area could be placed into which tier. There are so many ways Covid-19 data can be visualised. So it is important to be selective and emphasize the most relevant angles. Whilst the pandemic has shown the need for data, it is necessary not to overload the user.     Journalists can also learn the importance of giving readers a chance to interact with the visualisations. A less author-driven approach stimulates greater engagement. You can see this in the tables that we produced. They were searchable which added a sense of relatability to the work that we were producing. Displaying this information on a map would have been too much detail and would have made it harder for the readers to find the local authority they are interested in.     It is also important to contextualise the data. We achieved this by giving a more representative time frame of trends. Only showing the case rates of one week could be misleading as they would only present a snapshot. Disseminating a trend requires showing data for more than one week.     ",https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/covid-rules-tier-system-2-december-lockdown_uk_5fbe508bc5b63d1b77083a8c,,,,,,,,"George Willoughby, Vanessa Fillis, Jasmin Gray (producer of text)"," We are both MA Data Journalism students at Birmingham City University.

Nikkei aims to analyze data to reveal facts that governments and companies were not aware of and to encourage changes in their policies. Today, Datawatch has become one of the most popular weekend contents of Nikkei.  ","  Datawatch is one of the pioneers in Japanese data journalism in Japan.      Each of the articles sparked debate on the internet, gaining attention from political and business leaders, as well as investors. Policymakers have repeatedly commented on how the stories have helped them formulate policies.     For example, Nikkei analyzed and reported about Covid-19 using data; in March 2020, Nikkei became the first Japanese media to report how the number of people in the cities declined due to the pandemic and mobility restrictions by using satellite data, cell phones as well as restaurant reservations.     Nikkei analyzed Covid-19 data obtained through scraping and APIs. An article in May 2020 revealed the fact that the total cases in emerging economies have surpassed that of the developed countries, and pointed out that the fragile medical systems in emerging economies pose a risk to the global economy.     Another story published in May 2020 examined the number of new cases in each of the U.S. states while comparing the mobility restrictions. The article had an impact on the decisions of the Japanese government, which was then considering lifting the state of emergency as well as reopening the economy.  ","  In data journalism, Nikkei utilizes latest technologies. For example, in an article about Japanese convenience stores, data journalists in Nikkei used scraping to identify locations of the stores across the country. Nikkei discovered that many stores were not capable to maintain their 24/7 business hours and warned that there is a risk of excessive competition in the industry. Statistical analysis software such as Python were used to analyze these data.     To discover changes in trends before official statistics are announced, Nikkei actively used alternative data such as satellite images, traffic information, and restaurant reservations. In April 2020, when the price of crude oil fell to a record low, Nikkei utilized artificial intelligence to analyze satellite images of oil tanks around the world and discovered that the storage capacity would reach its limit in two months.     Nikkei also created charts and graphics so the story is easily understood on mobile phones, an increasing trend for subscribers to read articles.     Nikkei also developed a method to link the articles on newspapers and website by introducing an augmented reality system that allows subscribers to view videos on their smartphones.  ","  Dozens of Nikkei staffs, including reporters, editors, designers and engineers, were involved in each article to report the data journalism articles. Coordinating the team which goes beyond the boundary of traditional journalism was the most difficult part, as well as publishing the stories every Sunday on the front page.

Supporting the needs of the development sector, Devex collates information on funding announcements, new programs, tenders, contracts and more. COVID-19 funding information was extracted from this database and presented in a publicly available Tableau interactive. For over a year, this database has continued to be updated. And each week, weekly funding insights and other funding articles drawing attention to the changing funding trends for more"," The Devex funding database does not provide complete information on COVID-19 funding responses globally, and due to the way funders announce and report on their activities there is the chance of some duplication. However this database has been critical in providing information on who the funders are, how they fund responses, where they fund responses, the funding mechanisms they are using to create impact, and how priorities are changing along with the impacts of the pandemic. Organizations are using the <a href=""https://www.devex.com/news/interactive-who-s-funding-the-covid-19-response-and-what-are-the-priorities-96833"">Tableau funding interactive and reported analytical insights</a> to understand who they can partner with, and identify gaps in responses targeting particular development issues and regions.

The COVID-19 funding database and the Tableau interactive has also highlighted the massive issues surrounding transparency in funding. While funders are keen to make a big splash in announcing new money, seeing how this translates into programs, tenders, grants, contracts and more is a challenge. Government and private sector announcements in particular are very difficult to track through a funding and spending cycle. Funders are also keen to tag funding as being in response to COVID-19. This may be new funding, pivoted funding, or existing funding with a COVID re-brand, but announcements and systems do not clearly distinguish this. These transparency challenges identified through the database have been used by the OECD in their <a href=""https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/development-co-operation-report-2020_f6d42aa5-en"">2020 Development Co-operation Report</a> which aims to encourage better funding information for future crises.   Devex continues to update the database weekly, with the intention of providing a source of information that can be of value to researchers now and into the future. "," Funding data collected by Devex comes from a wide variety of funders and sources -- with their own ways of delivering that data. The sources and methods used to extract data can depending on the funding type. Funding announcements are commonly made through media releases and speeches requiring manual entry while tenders, grants and reported contracts are often are advertised through reporting systems which allow enabling data to be scraped or extracted through an API. This is colleted into a Metabase database and published throught he <a href=""https://www.devex.com/funding/r?filter%5Bstatuses%5D%5B%5D=forecast&filter%5Bstatuses%5D%5B%5D=open&sorting%5Border%5D=desc&sorting%5Bfield%5D=updated_at"">Devex Funding platform</a>. From the database, funding activities specific to COVID-19 are extracted and analysed to determine if they can be classes as funding in response to the global pandemic -- some announcements are for programs that would have occurred regardless of the pandemic and are excluded. Airtable, Google Sheets and even Excel have been used to support data cleaning over the past year.   The processed data is then added to a Tableau workbook that has been designed to allow users to drill down by donor, region, and focus area. But they can also seen how data is moving beyond the initial funding announcements into action on the ground. Programs, grants, tenders, open opportunities and contracts awarded by the donors can viewed and demonstrates large gaps in funding transparency that exists.   The Tableau interactive is available as a <a href=""https://public.tableau.com/views/COVIDFundingvisualisation/COVID-19funding?:embed=y&:toolbar=no&:display_count=no&:showVizHome=no#"">desktop tool</a>, as well as a version that can be <a href=""https://www.devex.com/news/interactive-who-s-funding-the-covid-19-response-and-what-are-the-priorities-96833"">embedded into Devex articles and supports mobile view</a>.

"," Pulling together funding data on COVID-19 is a challenge. There are a range of funders, funding mechanisms and ways of reporting on that funding. Collating this information is a difficult and gaps exists. However the health and social impacts of the pandemic meant that it was important to provide as much information as possible to support better responses. Devex has aimed to be transparent about the data challenges through articles, presentations and in supporting contributions to the <a href=""https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/development-co-operation-report-2020_f6d42aa5-en"">2020 Development Co-operation Report</a>. Development of the <a href=""https://www.devex.com/news/interactive-who-s-funding-the-covid-19-response-and-what-are-the-priorities-96833"">Tableau interactive</a> has also focused on this, providing access to individual records as well as dividing funding into different categories which shows how funding may move from announcements to action through tenders, grants and contracts.   But this was not a one-off project. Each week since March 2020 the funding database has continued to be updated with <a href=""https://www.devex.com/news/interactive-who-s-funding-the-covid-19-response-and-what-are-the-priorities-96833"">new insights being reported</a>. It has been able to show an overwhelming focus on economic responses. It has been able to show shifts in vaccine funding -- from research and development to securing vaccines and vaccine campaigns targeting disinformation. It has been able to show that the private sector has been a minor contributor. And it has been able to show that globally transparency surrounding funding needs to improve.   This Devex work will be an import resource for a long time to come.         "," Through this long-term project, journalists can learn about the importance of developing data projects that have more than one goal. The COVID-19 funding database has supported multiple articles, and a range of angles to investigate changing priorities in pandemic funding. It has been and continues to be a massive investment in time and resources, however the work is supporting improved insights into funding as well as building awareness about the gaps.   As pandemic funding has changed, the <a href=""https://www.devex.com/news/interactive-who-s-funding-the-covid-19-response-and-what-are-the-priorities-96833"">Tableau interactive</a> has also been able to evolve and incorporate new categories of priority for funders.   Throughout 2021, more insights will continue to emerge. And the database will continue to be updated to support longer term objectives of Devex as well as researchers that can use the database to support their own work.

United Kingdom,The Sunday Times,Big,Participant,Trees in our cities,12/09/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Environment","QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio"," ""I found a database of all 8.3m trees in London!"" And so our project on the UK's urban forests began.    We spoke to individuals and groups working in their free time - often unpaid - to help preserve and manage our trees and stories of their efforts delighted readers.    Using detailed open source data we looked into the most common species in different UK cities, revealed the greenest and explained how council budgets have shrunk over time and the impact that is having on our ability to maintain our urban forests. "," This project aimed to tell an important story while offering our readers a visually compelling article to lift spirits during the first national lockdown, at a time when the news agenda was dominated by daily Covid-19 updates.    Trees were on our minds during the lockdown. Whether it was the comfort of nature or simply having the time to stop and look, we flocked to urban parks. Treetalk.co.uk, a website that creates personalised tree walks around London, saw a sixfold increase in users as the lockdown wore on.   Even before this there was a growing acceptance that city trees play a vital role in physical and mental health. Studies have found that access to trees and grass reduces violent crime and domestic aggression, and that students who walk for 45 minutes in an arboretum perform 20% better than those who walk on urban streets.   Combining the data visualisation skills of Anna Lombardi, Anthony Cappaert and Julian Osbaldestone with Rosie Kinchen’s reporting we were able to explain why our need for city trees is deep-rooted, the important role trees play in our physical and mental health and investigate whether we are doing enough to keep them safe for future generations.   The illustrative skills of Julian Osbaldestone enabled us to bring the story to life in a way befitting of the topic, with data and line drawings combined in a style rarely seen in the digital or print pages of the Times and Sunday Times.    The article scored highly on our engagement metrics, received a very positive feedback from our readers in the comment section and over-performed with our target audiences (women and younger readers). It performed well on social media too. "," We gathered open source data on the exact location, species and type of tree in five major UK cities: London, Belfast, Bristol, Edinburgh and Sheffield. CSV files for each city were imported, cleaned, made consistent and analysed in RStudio.    For each city we identified the most populous trees which were then drawn four times – once for each season — so readers could identify them throughout the year. A watercolour technique has been chosen to give a fresher touch to it.   Next we ran a bespoke R script that allowed us to convert the details of each trees’ geographic position into geojson files. This data was then imported into the mapping tool QGIS along with shapefiles of each city’s boundaries. The two were then merged to create a map locating every tree to a specific point.    A colour was then applied to each tree type before the map was annotated and finessed in Illustrator. "," Open data is crucial for journalists and researchers to investigate and explore a variety of issues and topics. Very often, though, it’s difficult to find homogeneous datasets for different areas, making a national comparison impossible. One of the most difficult parts of this project was to find comparable data sources of public trees for various UK cities.    It all started when we came across a huge dataset featuring every tree in London, which definitely had some potential to be turned into a nice visual project but we wanted to expand our horizons outside the capital.    We got in touch with several local councils and got hold of data for a few other cities (namely Bristol, Belfast, Edinburgh and Sheffield). From councils, we also gathered information about tree maintenance regimes, budgets and diversity planting plans. One of the strengths of this project is its unique mix of meticulous digital analysis/mapping of granular geographical data and in-depth reporting on the ground, which is what really brings it to life.    We spent quite some time discussing the best way to visualise the data so that readers could get key information while enjoying such a long visual piece. We wanted to add an artistic touch to our usual visualization style, aware that getting the right balance between data and illustration was going to be crucial.   It has been a really interesting and thoughtful creative process that involved different expertises coming together and the experimentation of a new style rarely seen in the digital or print pages of the Sunday Times before, a great example of collaboration across the newsroom.  ","<ul>  Using a programming language such as R to analyse data allows you to work with a clear script that can be easily tweaked and re-run for last minute changes in the data   Don’t rely on one software to create visuals as a mix of tools often leads to the best results (in our case it was RStudio, QGIS, Datawrapper and Illustrator)   Data-led investigations are hugely powerful, but even more so when combined with more traditional mediums for reporting. It was the discovery of the dataset locating every tree in London that kickstarted this project, but Rosie Kinchen’s reporting and Julian Osbaldestone’s illustrations that really brought it to life   </ul>    ",https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/our-need-for-city-trees-is-deep-rooted-can-we-keep-them-safe-for-future-generations-pcqzvtkdd?shareToken=5766fa6ddb3121ffea4ed0bd8e55a1c4,,,,,,,,"Rosie Kinchen, Anna Lombardi, Anthony Cappaert, Julian Osbaldstone, Sam Joiner"," Rosie Kinchen: senior writer at the Sunday Times.

"," This in-depth data visualisation provides Al Jazeera's global audience with a complete visual interpretation of the notable documents that have featured in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   We accomplished this by condensing over 100 years of historical agreements into a single, searchable experience. This strategy proved effective, bringing over 100,000 visitors in English and 50,000 visitors in Arabic to one of the most politically complex stories in the region - and in the world. The story qualitatively changed viewers' ability to navigate and understand difficult issues, providing them with historical references, analytic tools and bases for comparison that have largely been absent in traditional news coverage of this story.  "," The text analysis was performed in R using topic extraction and sentiment analysis. Particular attention was spent on highlighting the contextual meaning of key topics including ""occupation"", ""refugees"", ""settlements"" and ""Jerusalem"".    The interactive experience was built in React to allow readers to quickly sort and discover keywords and main concepts.

For example,  people felt that the government's epidemic prevention needs to be strengthened, also while the early stage people also ignored the epidemic.  "," We collaborated with academic institutions to get more than 5 millions tweets about covid-19 from the end of January to the end of March 2020.  This was the first report in the world to extensively analyze what people in different countries have experienced and cared about COVID-19.

But in Canada, some health regions are very big and others are very small. So I decided to create a 3D data visualization of the country in which spikes coming from the health regions would represent the data. With this approach, the readers would be able to recognize the country areas. In the same, they would see and understand the data. "," This project is one of our most-read and shared stories of the year. The readers loved this visual approach to explain what happened in the country during one of the worst health crisis of our time. From the emails I received from many readers, they liked the aesthetic of it and how clear the visual the representation was. In the project, I also ask them their postal code to identify their health region. With this information, part of the text is dynamically generated to give the users the situation in their health region. They enjoyed this feature as well. "," I created a React (javascript library) custom template to keep the visualization visible at all times, while the user scrolls on the page. For the cartographic functions, I used D3. For the 3D universe, I used ThreeJS (javascript library) to create the 3D scenes and to animate them. Behind the hood, it's using the WebGL technology.

In order to help the public understand the potential impact of the proposed reform, we visualized open data made available by the NHI so that  readers could look up the price difference for each device and know how many of the devices would be affected in each category if the reform had taken effect.    "," The issue of co-paid medical devices is complex and difficult to understand. When the NHI Administration announced the planned reform, not only doctors protested but it also drew criticism from the general public. Many of the critics, however, did not really know what the controversy was about. We organized the data and presented it visually so readers could join the debate armed with a clear knowledge about where they found the pricing unreasonable.    A month after scrapping the proposal, the NHI Administration announced a revised system involving “extreme values,” which again drew flak, including a lot of emotional comments. It was at the moment that we put our series of charts and graphs online after cross comparing our data. We used figures to present the effect of the new system, with the hope that the public could obtain correct information before conducting a debate in a rational manner. The project was praised by our readers, with one medical professional describing it as “great work getting this data and organizing it, leaving those of us stuck in the heated debate appearing to be seeing things in a fog.”    "," We used information obtained from the NHI Administration and its open data service, combined and categorized the information, and used R for its analysis before visualizing the result for readers to look up the price of an item under any category.    "," The most difficult part of this project was to familiarize with each medical device and to present information about it in a way that would be comprehensible to the average reader. When the new proposal was announced, much of the heated debate reflected a lack of understanding of the issue at hand on the part of the general public. We tried to visualize complex data and used figures to help people understand why there were price differences so they could discuss and decide whether the pricing was reasonable based on actual numbers.     "," Instead of being real-time spot news, the project combined and cross analyzed data and provided more comprehensive information, allowing readers to search for details of the pricing of each medical device, including the extent of effect under the proposed reform and different prices set by individual hospitals.

United States,Insider Inc.,Big,Participant,Uncancellable,14/12/20,"Investigation, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Arts, Lifestyle, Business, Culture, Women","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV"," This project combined data analysis and reporting to answer a fundamental question about new platforms, the consequences of misbehavior, and the behaviors they facilitate and even reward. YouTube is one of the most popular and widely-viewed platforms in the world, and the people who build channels and careers on it weild significant influence on and off the platform. Powerful people who engage in sexual misconduct, unfaithful business dealings, and controversial and erratic behavior typically face consequences in their careers — but in this investigation, Insider discovered that the rules don't apply on YouTube. "," This project brought to light an imbalance that exists in online fame: after a certain audience threshold, it becomes impossible for someone on the YouTube platform to actually suffer consequences based on their actions, and that the historical guardrails of fame and infamy no longer apply to YouTube's most powerful users. Indeed, to the contrary: people became more famous, more viewed, more followed and more notorious after controversies that would have, in any other medium or any other field, led to considerable social consequences.    Insider found that controversial and instigating content led, on balance, to long-term increases in subscribers and views, and to audience growth. Insider found that rather than causing people to lose credibility, inappropriate behavior among YouTube's most famous users led to considerably more attention and eyeballs on the people who did them, and even a momentary lapse in followers following a controversial moment was reliably quickly filled back by more and more fans.  "," Insider combined on-the-ground reporting and synthesis of years of issues and controversies that followed YouTube influencers and backed them up with day-by-day data points of their subscriber base and views. These were presented in an interactive, clearly-labeled format that made these situations clear to both digital native readers familiar with the people involved as well as people wholly unfamiliar with the internecine fights of YouTube's elite and the metrics they use to define acclaim.  "," The most difficult part of this project was the assiduous reporting, reconstructing years of controversy and difficulty and assembling a cohesive and clear timeline to align to the material changes in the fortune of the readers. Data journalism is not merely data, but is indeed journalism, and the process by which subject-matter experts were consulted to build a working timeline of fame and what people do with it was the subject of considerable effort and research. "," We hope journalists come away with a refreshed understanding that infamy is not too far from notoriety, and that the very techniques that high-profile internet celebrities use to stoke controversies are the very same techniques they use to expand the purview of their own influence. Covering people accurately when the individual benefits directly from negative attention is a challenge from the meekest influencer to the highest office in the United States, and what Insider sought to demonstrate was the power that even unflattering coverage can have if the individual it entails is comfortable capitalising on it. In particular, Insider hopes that coverage of misconduct and unscrupulous business dealings are handled with the serious focus they deserve, as failing to do so we found directly empowers the very people who did those things and incentivizes further behavior. Lastly, we hope that platforms and the algorithms they create attract further attention, as a key reason that controversial behavior leads to increases in influence is because the behavior is rewarded financially.  ",https://www.insider.com/cancel-culture-youtube-actually-help-a-youtubers-career-2020-12,https://www.insider.com/james-charles-canceled-jeffree-star-why-real-subscriber-loss-2020-12,https://www.insider.com/jake-paul-logan-data-graphs-will-never-be-canceled-2020-12,https://www.insider.com/shane-dawson-cancel-canceled-followers-come-back-data-charts-2020-12,,,,,"Madison Hall, Kat Tenbarge"," Madison Hall is a Junior Data Reporter for Insider.

This was a ballistics report commissioned to establish whether proper respect for regulations had been observed when the grenade was fired. The conclusions of the report were to exonerate the still-unidentified person who fired the grenade.  This investigation showed that the conclusions of the ballistic report accusing the policeman behind the shooting did not hold up. The lawyers of the civil parties therefore asked the justice to use the video and asked the judge for a new ballistic expertise. A demonstration take place on Marseille to request a real investigation from court about the policeman. One day after the publication, a complaint was launch against the former interior minister, Christophe Castaner, to the Court of Justice of the Republic (CJR), for ""falsification and disappearance of evidence"".  <pre>  </pre>     <pre>  </pre>         <pre>  </pre>     <pre>  </pre>     <pre>  </pre>    "," For made this visual investigation Disclose an Forensic Architecture join their work, on one side deep investigative journalism and on an other side, architectural practice. Our investigations employ pioneering techniques in spatial and architectural analysis, open source investigation, digital modelling, and immersive technologies, as well as documentary research, situated interviews, and video from social network.

I wanted to draw the picture to Ugandans who are looking for work abroad that it is not worth it. I also wanted people to believe my experience not only as a journalist but also as a victim so that it can save many who are already in the process. ," After the first serie, The President of Uganda ordered the State house anti-corruption unit to launch investigations immediately on the matter especially how girls are thrafficked through Entebbe International Airport.

"," Bearing hunger, torture in my agents house, in a slave market,  physical torture in my employer's home was also scary.    When i was leaving the country, i had a story which i had planned but as soon as i landed at the Airport in Dubai, the story changed. I did not give up but i had to swallow and do it. I did not have any idea about  another agent and the slave market but i endured every stuation to have a story so that people know what domestic migrant workers go through to get jobs in the Middle East. "," While starting this project, i had fear but was on the other hand determined to accomplish it. It takes one's courage, patience,  determination, personal security and prayers to do a project like this.     I reached somewhere and lost courage, energy  especially when we reached in a slave market and at agent's ho,me. I had another bad idea of getting intended accident just to get my passport and return home but it was impossible at that time.    I thought of committing suicide but i could not. I only wanted to live and tell a story which i later did. I pushed on. Time came and though of how i would escape(of course) with another group of victims, who actually escaped  later without me and i feared it would land into another trouble of getting arrested and imprisonedt without my passport which would cause a possibility of being identified as a journalist.   It was scary, tormenting, harrowing, strange but i had to do it and i made sure i returned safe after starving myself in my agent's house to look as if i was dyiny tomorrow.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Participant,Up in smoke,05/10/20,"Explainer, Illustration, Infographics, Environment","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite"," In late summer of 2020, wildfires raged across the western United States, home to most of the country’s vineyards, and hit farmers and wine makers already reeling from the Trump administration’s trade wars and demand disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.   Smoke, harmful to wine grapes, had blanketed much of the West and fires charred more than 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares) in California in 2020, more than twice the previous record for any year. Reuters took an in depth look at which wine areas were most affected and how. ", This was the most in-depth analysis of the impact on California’s wine country. The project had high readership and was shared widely on social media and within the wine industry. ," This project drew on a range of techniques from satellite derived data work to reporting over the phone and talking to local wine growers. We wanted to accurately map and show readers how much of the area was impacted and to what extent.   For the smoke map, we downloaded hundreds of data files from NASA’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office before applying our own calculations to get gridded averages which we could map. This allowed us to show which areas were under smoke the most or the longest.    We plotted another summary of that same data on our harvest timeline near the end of the piece to show which grapes were likely affected most.   On the Napa Valley map, fire footprint data came from the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center and was plotted in QGIS along with vineyard locations and a custom hillshade and terrain layer modeled in-house from elevation data. "," The data wrangling for the atmospheric smoke was a challenge. However, the most difficult part of this project was calling and talking to wine growers and family vineyards who had lost everything. Some lost their entire crop and some lost their land. ", Hand drawn illustration and human stories can complement and elevate the data visualisation work.

On election night, Commonwealth Magazine published live election results, displaying the results of the Presidency, House, and Senate. This also included a live blog to provide live updates to our readers. In ""A New Cold War"", Commonwealth Magazine analyzed how Trump's foreign policies during his four years in office caused relations between the US and China to become more antagonistic, and how the rivalry between the US and China is set to continue into the Biden administration.    "," Not only was this package one of the most visited projects published by Commonwealth Magazine in 2020, it was also widely shared by many political scientists, influencers, and other respected individuals. In publishing ""A New Civil War"", Commonwealth Magazine became the only Taiwanese news organization to report deeply on the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, and provided a sharp contrast to the sensational videos of looting that were being shared on social media platforms.   Commonwealth Magazine's live election tracker presented the election results in a very simple and easy to read page. This also included a live blog to provide live updates to our readers, which many readers responded positively to the live updates that were provided throughout the course of the election.    "," The team at Commonwealth Magazine used a significant amount of different tools and techniques in each of the different projects of our US election package. In ""A New Civil War"", we found multiple sources that documented the date and location of each of the protests related to Black Lives Matter to draw our map. We also adapted the models from the Economist to create the graphic that detailed each candidate's support.   In ""A New Cold War"", we used a set of 3D modeling techniques along with THREE.js, an open source WebGL library, to create the spinning chessboard and globe. The technical challenge to display these 3D models proved to be highly technical, but ultimately gave our readers a more memorable, creative approach to illustrating the current US-China relationship.    "," The challenge in this project was figuring out how to frame the US election in a way that would be helpful to our readers, while also facing the limitations that Facebook imposed on foreign media outlets during election season to combat potential fake news stories.    ""A New Civil War"" was the first story published in the series, and the most difficult piece in the series to create. Internally, we debated extensively how our audience would respond to such a story, and whether or not it was worth doing. Ultimately, we decided that although discussions about race may not attract a large Taiwanese readership, it was still one of the largest issues surrounding the US election, and few other Taiwanese news organizations covered it in such depth.    "," Overall, this project distilled a nebulous and complex set of issues to an audience generally unfamiliar with the issues around the US election. To a Taiwanese audience, these projects explored both the domestic and international issues faced by the US, as well as tying it in to issues that Taiwanese people would be most interested in.    ",https://web.cw.com.tw/us-2020/us-china-en/index.html,https://web.cw.com.tw/us-2020/black-lives-matter/,https://web.cw.com.tw/us-2020/,,,,,,"Shu-ren Koo, Yu-hsin Lee, Daniel Kao, Yi-wen Lin"," The team consists of one product manager, one data journalist,  one front-end developer, and two web designers.

"," In this research, we worked with databases and Excel tables to compare the different facts and figures on gender violence in each country. Snowball sampling was applied, which is used when potential participants are difficult to find or if the sample is limited to a very small subgroup of the population. The journalistic techniques used were the interview, both with public officials, leaders of non-governmental organizations, experts on gender issues and victims. The chronicle format was used to narrate the testimonies. Within the investigation we made illustrations and infographics that were made with Procreate Software, Photoshop S6. One of the key tools for this research was the use of video calling platforms, which allowed the organization of an online journalistic writing that was attended by the 36 participants of this report. Through Zoom, interviews were conducted with sources that were in different countries, using semi-structured questionnaires and recording each session to be able to go to the source again, if necessary. The Zoom platform also helped us for the training we received on gender issues. "," The most difficult part of the project was access to official data because most governments do not have official figures or they are out of date. It was also a challenge to conduct an investigation without any financial resources, that is, none of the people who participated received remuneration for their contribution, but there was still commitment and dedication.    In addition, it was a challenge to set up a virtual newsroom to organize the data from all the countries and concentrate them for collation, editing, design and publication. "," From this project, our fellow journalists can learn that it is possible to carry out a transnational and large-scale investigation even without financial resources and that the commitment of those involved is key to carry out an in-depth report that involves the review of official documents, interviews and management of sensitive information. Participants in this investigation took gender journalism workshops to learn how to approach victims. They can learn that preparation is key in any journalistic project. In our case, we received workshops to know how to write about gender violence issues.This work can be an example to delve into the topic of violence, to know what types of sources exist and it can be a starting point to delve into human rights issues.   <img id=""hola-icon-globe"" src=""safari-extension://C705D08D-7419-4E89-B02B-904B20981732/f96811e/iconGlobeBlack.png"" style=""top: 135px; left: 289px;"" /> ",https://pandemiainvisible.lalupa.press (This link has a plugin so you can read it completely in English),,,,,,,,https://pandemiainvisible.lalupa.press/creditos-en-general/ The number of characters allows us to place the 36 participants.

Colombia,Cuestión Pública,Small,Participant,We know what you did last legislature,31/05/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Database, Open data, News application, Fact-checking, OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Mobile App, Illustration, Chart, Video, Map, Satellite images, Elections, Politics, Corruption, Money-laundering, Crime","Scraping, Canvas, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python"," This is the first investigation into the assets of more than 50 Colombian Congress members, their companies, family businesses, state contracts, their networks and private interests. We created a web application called Indi$cregram: the indiscreet Instagram of power in Colombia. Inspired by the famous social network, this app informs citizens about whom they voted for in Congress ahead of the 2022 elections. This citizen tool is based on a methodology to collect analyze and cross information from more than 40 public information sources in Colombia and abroad to consolidate more than 2500 nodes of companies and people. ","  Cuestión Pública sent more than 178 requests for information (FOIA) to Congress members. Thanks to our work to access for information in the public interest, at the end of 2019 Colombian Government finally passed a law which requiring public officials - Congress members-  to publish their income tax returns, asset declarations and private interests form. This law was passed during our investigation, and we feel it as our own achievement.      Thanks to our work and the law we opened 84 asset declarations, 73 income tax returns and 52 records of interests of Congress members. Congress members investigated by Cuestión Pública were chosen by our community in an open survey.     After publishing, we have received 17 reactions  between letters, press releases, tweets and amendment request from those who we investigated. Traditional medias taken our investigations and put them on the public agenda. Also, 48 people paid a membership to Cuestión Pública during publication time (9 weekends).      The hashtag #SabemosLoQueHiciste was a trending topic every Sunday of publication, and we went from 40,000 followers to 61,000 on Twitter, we had a similar increase in the other networks as Facebook and Instagram. #Indi$cregram is our most visited page in 2020 and the first in our history as media outlet.     We made alliances with one mainstream media to spread investigation findings. ‘El Espectador’, the second most influenced mainstream media in Colombia, published more than 19 videos with the highlighted findings of ours investigations.      After published we have been invited by local media in the regions, which Congress members belongs, to explain our web app and investigation findings.      Also, we have been invited to present our application to NICAR Conference 2021 at the panel ‘Decolonizing Data Journalism’. The project also were presented at The International Anti-Corruption Conference (IACC) 2020.  ","  With R and Python scripts, Cuestión Pública scraped open government databases for the massive extraction of contracting information, campaigns funding, and  laws to then cross-reference this information and identify connections on suspected relationships between congressional representatives in its networks and findings on looting public procurement and other irregularities. All the data were consolidated in Google Sheets for easy information visualization and integration with the web platform.     ‘We know what you did last legislature” databases were built in Google Sheets files which connect with a test environment page where we made all the changes and updates before migrated it to the public web app page. This is possible thanks to a script written within Google Apps Script environment that works like a custom API  for the data.  Also, we created an application ‘made to order’ to cross our list of references with procurement Colombian system API.      The ‘We know what you did last legislature” application was created with  HTML, CSS, Javascript and Nuxt  framework to recreate Instagram network. An UX designer worked for four months to make the design and improve the user experience of the platform, the Design process progress were followed up in Sketch application.      As we were under a pandemic crisis all the communications and team operation were managed trough Slack platform, and we shared files also and resources in Google Drive There we consolidated huge databases in order to improve investigation journalism operation processes.  ","  The hardest part to carry out this project was to handle the judicial harassment during publication from the Congress members and its network. Due to reveals that linked Congress members with criminal networks, 'narcos', clientelism and nepotism practices, we received a lot of letters, amendment requests and tweets regarding our publication (9 weekends), our legal team responded accordingly.      Due to the high harassment received we make our methodology stronger in the fact-checking process to avoid unjustified replies to our work. Today our fact-checking method reach high standards as OCCRP and ICIJ.         In the other side, the learning curve to acquire our innovative investigation methodology takes time, because we investigate each Congress member under the same methodology through eight approaches: 1) ownership of real state assets, 2) family business, 3) business partners, 4) campaign contributors and family members which contract with the State, 5) Court electronic records, 6) conflict of interest in legislative activity, 7) Congress member network, and 8) transparency.      Due to the huge numbers of technical tools, digital investigation shortcuts, cross-reference databases that we use, and the time constraint to the release, training new journalists in digital forensics techniques, investigation, and data journalism made the project getting longer to finish its first season.     Also, we had to deal with a large interdisciplinary team composed by employees part-time and full time due to a narrow budget assigned to it. Coordinating those schedules was hard to match heading to date publication.     Finally, it is a challenge to release such a huge bunch of data and facts,  using understandable language, safeguarding the investigation from a legal point of view, and showing citizens how political power works in Colombia.  ","The project ‘We Know What You Did Last Legislature' succeeded in standardizing Cuestión Pública's investigative journalism production processes. In this investigative series, for the first time, counter-power investigative journalism could be measured, analyzed, optimized and improved in workflows, investigative processes, editorial, legal, design and development processes. Each Congress member who have been entered to the Indi$cregram application passed through a measured investigative, fact-checking, editorial and legal editing protocol. We have created a user-centric web application - which makes investigative journalism 'sexy' - and designed for a mobile experience that would inform citizens who they voted for in Congress ahead of the 2022 elections. Our hashtag was #WeKnowWhatYouDid and our slogan ""Stalk your Congress member and discover whom you voted for"". The Indi$cregram considered several stages of publication: 1) journalistic research with data collection through open source, reporting, data journalism techniques and digital forensic journalism; 2) information verification to shield investigation with evidence; 3) editorial stage; 4) legal editing and proofreading. Cuestión Pública (CP) managed to standardize the investigation processes and create a unique, sophisticated, evolving, replicable, measurable, scalable and deep methodology. The Congress members investigated -from all political strands- were chosen by our community in an open poll with 522 voters. This is the first time that a citizen chooses who investigative journalist investigate. CP has as its founding purpose to investigate the assets of Congress Members. With this tool we hope that citizens can monitor and demand accountability from their legislators. The leaders behind this investigative series are the founders of CP, who in 2018 thanks to a crowdfunding campaign, which raised about 7,500 USD, were able to investigate for the first time, prior to the congressional election, the wealth and conflicts of interest of 10 Congress members in a pilot project, CP has investigated 64 of them so",https://cuestionpublica.com/sabemos-lo-que-hiciste/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jBjurRkSjc&feature=youtu.be,https://youtu.be/UtYx-432Zvw,https://cuestionpublica.com/hilo-videos-indiscregram/,https://videos.elespectador.com/p/AcXmfKIX,https://youtu.be/OZuiQakjkSc,https://cuestionpublica.com/sabemos-lo-que-hiciste/creditos,,"Claudia Báez, David Tarazona, Diana Salinas, Ignacio Gómez, Edier Buitrago, Natalia Abril, Andrea Rincón, Mateo Yepes, Angélica Latorre, Nicolás Barahona, Paola Téllez, Sara Cely, Camilo Vallejo, Valentina Hoyos (And 23 people more)"," The Web app took one year to be released and involved a team of 37 people including investigative data journalists, fact-checkers, editors, designers, cartoonist, developers, data scientist and lawyers.

United States,Quartz,Big,Participant,"Welcome to Leeside, the US's First Climate Haven",01/09/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Cross-border, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Audio, Politics, Environment, Culture, Agriculture, Immigration, Economy, Employment","D3.js, Canvas, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Node.js"," Welcome to Leeside is the collaborative centerpiece of Welcome to Green Haven, a Quartz special project about climate migration. We invented a futuristic city that receives climate migrants—and created a fictional digital museum exhibition to describe the experience and showcase the city’s history from the present until 2057.   Though neither the city of Leeside nor its characters are real, the policies its government implements and pressures the city faces are based on today’s research and early thinking about what a future climate haven will face. We are including supplemental links to other components of the project to show the connection. "," Leeside was the story most read by Quartz members the week it was published—a testament to the intrigue of the project. The piece also made waves beyond the confines of Quartz:   <ul>  Vox loved the piece and proposed working together with our Amanda Shendruk to create <a href=""http://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/a-climate-change-of-address/id1346207297?i=1000502878860"">an audio version of the project</a> in Podcast form. Says Amanda: ""I worked with the team at Today, Explained. They used much of the material from Leeside, and also included some of their own ideas. They kind of built off the world I created, which was really neat.""   Amanda also was asked to moderate a panel at a climate migration conference called <a href=""https://newcities.org/higher-ground-live/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" tabindex=""-1"" target=""_blank"">Higher Ground</a>, hosted by New Cities.   She also was interviewed by a researcher from the Futures Research Centre at University of Turku in Finland, which wants to include the piece in its masters program course. The researcher praised Leeside as an ""example of how to tell a story about a scenario in a convincing way.""  </ul>"," We created a number of artifacts featured in the exhibit—posters, maps, videos, and an audio recording of a speech from Leeside's mayor—to spotlight the emotions and travails of the city's residents, politicians, and activists. We employed a variety of tools and technologies to do this.  <ul>  We used CSS/HTML/Javascript to build the website for the museum exhibit.   We used CSS/HTML/Javascript to create the map of incoming migrants in different areas in the US, based on data from Dilkina et a. (2020)   We used Adobe Illustrator for much of the illustrations and visuals   We worked with the research arm of KPF (called KPFui) to build the digital twin. It was built using their own interactive city planning <a href=""https://www.kpf.com/stories/kpf-ui-climate-haven-city"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" tabindex=""-1"" target=""_blank"">tool called Scout</a>, and then we built out the interface using javascript.   We used Garageband to record the audio of the Leeside mayor's speech   And we used iMovie to edit the video for the conservative PAC ad  </ul>"," The hardest part of this project was creating something that was fake but felt real, and spoke to real issues. We are journalists, and we wanted to be able to credibly call the final product ""journalism."" How do you do that, though, when even the medium you are using (in this case, a digital museum exhibit) is entirely fictional, and based on an imaginary town?   We created a piece of what we call ""speculative journalism,"" ensuring that everything in the piece that could be was grounded in interviews, research, and recommendations from experts. The names of the hurricanes are based on the names that would be in use that year in the future; the location of the town is based on the advice from researchers we talked with who think there's a lot of opportunity for this kind of thing in America's Rust Belt. Our desire for ""accuracy in the imaginary"" includes the interactive ""digital twin"" piece of the museum exhibit. The architectural agency we teamed with based their map of the city (the density, the grid, the types of houses and lots, etc.) on similar <a href=""https://www.kpf.com/stories/kpf-ui-climate-haven-city"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" tabindex=""-1"" target=""_blank"">cities in the same region</a> (such as Buffalo and Rochester, New York). "," Our speculative journalism blends fiction and nonfiction in a unique and critical way. We took care to make clear to readers what is real and not real, but all of the information is rooted in the traditional, fact-based journalism that makes up the larger project. We hope it sets an example for other journalists interested in prospective storytelling. We also hope it is a compelling example of the kind of environmental journalism that resonates with readers. It has narrative (several narratives, actually), and interactivity, and it's solutions-oriented, all of which were intentional to make sure readers confront climate change and engage with the implications of it, rather than scroll by another headline about it. Lastly, while many of today's journalists already understand the power of collaboration, this is another example of it—we orchestrated contributions from all around our newsroom to bring the project to life.

United States,The Marshall Project,Big,Participant,What do we really know about the politics of people behind bars?,11/03/20,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Chart, Crime","D3.js, R, Python","  There are 2.2 million people in America’s prisons and jails who are directly affected by the outcome of our elections, but until now, their political opinions have been largely ignored. In early 2020, The Marshall Project partnered with Slate to conduct a first-of-its-kind political survey of people behind bars—and over 8,000 incarcerated people across the country responded. The survey was such a success that we undertook a second survey over the summer, exploring incarcerated people’s political views in more depth on the cusp of the election.  ","  The results of this project are threefold:       <ul>     It raises important questions about the impact of felony disenfranchisement and makes clear that this should not be a partisan issue. Typically, Democrats lead the effort to re-enfranchise people with felony convictions. There is a widely held assumption that people in prison will support the Democrats. But the results of our survey show a wide spectrum of political belief behind bars, which could help temper conservative opposition to returning the vote to people with felony convictions.     </ul>     <ul>     Our survey humanizes people behind bars. We asked important questions and amplified the voices of thousands of people in prison and jail. As a result, people can see just how much humanity and human potential is locked up across the country. Perhaps the biggest impact are emails and tweets from readers who say that they’ve been moved by our project or reconsidered their assumptions about prisoners.     </ul>     <ul>     The project has provided inspiration and research material for several political scientists who study the impact of incarceration on political development. We are currently in conversation with researchers at Johns Hopkins, University of Chicago, and Columbia University about further lines of inquiry.      </ul>","  Because of restrictions on communication into and out of correctional facilities, the incarcerated population is a uniquely difficult group to survey. We knew it would be virtually impossible to obtain a survey sample that was truly representative across demographics and geography.          So we had to get creative; as part of the survey process we collected a range of demographics, personal information, location and facility-level data that would allow us to analyze, control for and cross-check our results across many factors. We programmatically produced and then manually inspected hundreds of sets of results for subgroups of our population, checking for consistency across groups, and confirming the differences we saw. We avoided making generalizations about the entire incarcerated population, instead focusing on more narrow, meaningful findings that we were able to rigorously confirm with this data.          The end result was a first-of-its kind series that provided readers with nuanced, in-depth reporting of the views and voices of the incarcerated population.  ","  Prisons are like black boxes where little information gets in and even less gets out. Incarcerated people can’t receive phone calls or use the internet, and only some facilities allow them access to electronic messaging services such as JPay or Corrlinks.         Prisons and jails are less restrictive about snail mail and information on prison-based digital tablets. News Inside -- our print publication for incarcerated people -- was an ideal way for us to connect our survey with people behind bars, and we also created a digital version for  Edovo, a nonprofit tablet company that we partner with          To make taking the paper survey as easy as possible,<a href=""https://www.themarshallproject.org/documents/6795496-News-Inside-Survey""> we printed it on a perforated page that people could tear out and mail back</a>. To avoid passing postage costs, we put a self-addressed stamped envelope in the magazine. It was no surprise that the digital versions came back first: Many people wrote additional insights on the survey itself and on loose sheets of paper. We also discovered that some participants had taken the initiative to photocopy the survey and share it with fellow prisoners who couldn’t get the magazine. We had hoped for 1,000 responses.<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q5y4P9AtT_XB7pK-7vblVuOCownNpcJRWaWoqb5Ky6s/edit?usp=sharing""> We were surprised to receive more than 8,000</a>.         As this unexpected number of surveys piled up, we had to come up with a plan that would allow us to analyze both the digital and paper responses. We ended up creating a Google form that mirrored the survey. Collectively, we have entered more than 650 paper surveys by hand so far and synthesized them with the 7,600 digital responses.         Due to the difficulties in obtaining a representative sample of the incarcerated population,  we ocused on looking for trends across race, gender and other demographic differences to make sure the results we reported were meaningful.         ","  We believe that we broke new ground by allowing our readers to hear directly from incarcerated people about how being imprisoned has shaped their political outlook and what political engagement looks like behind bars. We would encourage other journalists to also engaged with incarcerated people, and more broadly with justice-involved communities, and to ensure that their voices are heard and become a great part of a political conversation that has, until now, ignored them.

Later on fakes appeared in kyrgyz Instagram accounts, defended Jeenbekov and insulted the journalist, urging not to believe her.    After parliamentary elections and unstable political situation in October 2020, president Jeenbekov has left his post.    Our main focus was about Instagram fakes, so we made our story designed as Instagram-stories.

In order to confirm the influences of extreme climate toward agriculture, we compare the changes in all kind of fruit production, choosing the top 10 species with the most reduction and analyze the reasons by interview the fruit farmers, the researchers of the Agricultural Research and Extension Station, and the government.

United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,Participant,Where are you in the vaccine queue?,20/12/20,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Health","Animation, Personalisation, D3.js, R, RStudio"," It was one of the biggest questions of 2020: when will I be vaccinated from Covid? We tried to answer it, building a tool to tell our readers their vaccine priority based on their age and situation. As well as telling our readers when they might expect to get the jab, we illustrated how many people they might be behind in their local area to give a sense of how they fit in compared to their family and friends, as well as the unique pressures on specific parts of the country that have more vulnerable people than average. "," In its first weekend alone there were 131,000 searches of the tool – more than any other interactive we've ever produced –  including more than 40,000 unique combinations of postcode, age and other input. Because the piece had nearly 20,000 hits from search in that first weekend alone, we were encouraged by the SEO team to republish it several times as more data came in (hence the later 2021 timestamp on the article). The project gained traction in the days after we published it and was featured on Times Radio the following week.   We also built an automatic share function for twitter which let people share a tweet with a sentence of their queue position pre-filled in. This helped us to track how people were interacting with it.  "," Our project was partly inspired by the New York TImes' piece which estimated vaccine priority in different parts of the US   We started with the list of vaccine 'priority groups' from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation in the UK, which prioritises care home staff and residents and over-80s, and moves down the age groups with special priority given to those with underlying health conditions. This gave us the 'order' in which people would be getting vaccinated.   However, because we wanted to show people their queue position within their local area, we had to source data on the number of people who were in each age group, in frontline health professions, in care homes as both residents and workers, and those who were clinically vulnerable, all by local authority – a Herculean task.   Fortunately, we found most of the data we needed from the Census which, where required, was then scaled up to take into account population growth since 2011. The data analysis was all done using R.    The tool itself was built by our brilliant developers using React.js. When readers entered a postcode, it was matched using postcodes.io to their local authority. Based on their inputs, their queue position was calculated from the number of people in each area that were in each priority group. "," The most challenging part of the project was the data gathering, especially in trying to find data on population health for local authorities in all four nations of the UK. While the number of people who were ""clinically extremely vulnerable"", and then those with ""underlying health conditions"", is published for the whole of the UK, that data just did not exist at the local authority level.   We had to improvise. Insteaad we found data from the 2011 census by five-year age group and local authority, crucially split into whether they reportred being in ""good"", ""very good"", ""bad"" and ""very bad"" health, along with whether they had problems with their mobility. We used these categories to estimate how many people in each area were likely to be ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" as well as having ""underlying health conditions"". We checked our estimates based on how many people nationally were known to be in these vulnerable categories. It was not a perfect solution, but it fit our purposes.   More than 1,000 readers in the first weekend opened the 'methodology' tab, suggesting their was a strong enthusiasm for the inner workings of the tool.  "," Don't let perfect be the enemy of the good! When you're trying to explain or show something to readers, sometimes a model with sensible assumptions but imperfect data can be just as effective. We didn't have the exact data on vulernablle people in each area, but we improvised using the data we had.   More specifically, the tool drew people's attention to the fascinating issue of varying demographics when it comes to vaccine distrirbution. It reminded us and other journalists that areas had more than twice the proportion of older and more vulnerable people than others, a point which became clear when readers in London compared their results to readers in 'older' parts of the country. Sure enough, several stories about the 'postcode lottery' of vaccine distribution followed in the weeks after.              ",https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/when-will-i-get-the-covid-vaccine-find-your-place-on-uk-priority-list-with-our-calculator-9kxqdlh6k,https://twitter.com/MattChorley/status/1340966573645975553?s=20,https://twitter.com/samjoiner/status/1340623126493876224?s=20,https://twitter.com/colinrtalbot/status/1340629963297468418?s=20,https://twitter.com/susiepomme/status/1341302273427857408?s=20,,,,"Tom Calver, Ryan Watts, Daniel Clark, Sam Joiner, Anthony Cappaert"," We are the Data and Digital Storytelling Team at The Times and The Sunday Times, an eclectic mix of investigative journalists, data analysts, designers and developers.

Many in the community rebuked her for a lack of empathy during the anti-government protests and the initial outbreak of the coronavirus. Some commentators suggested there was more to read into her sartorial choices than her briefings. We used data to trace her public appearances and speeches and checked photographic evidence to explore whether there was any truth to these allegations. "," Lam’s apparent reluctance to appear in public during the social unrest led many in the community to question her ability to handle the protests and outbreak of the coronavirus. By showing how often Lam actually met with the public we were able to offer insights and clues about how she was handling the mass demonstrations and  looming pandemic. The story aroused heated discussion and proved to be an evergreen sensation with readers commenting on and sharing it online, as well as messaging the graphics team directly on Facebook, Twitter and email. "," The data for this project was processed and summarised using Google Sheets while the motion graphics were created from written code, After Effects, Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. The charts were made interactive by exporting them from Adobe Illustrator as SVGs and then animated in javascript and jQuery. The video map of Lam’s whereabouts was generated by coding and recorded as an mp4 file. "," The hardest and most time-consuming part of this project was collecting and processing the data. Initially we hoped to scrape Lam’s press conferences and speeches using Python but the government system is not uniformly formatted so we could not extract consistent information. Instead, we manually searched official government announcements and briefings using keywords. We then plotted the connections and timelines using google sheets.

While in other sectors CO₂ emissions are falling, the transport sector is stagnating.  Our application playfully introduces the topic – with a simplified version of the classic car quartet. Readers quickly realize that manufacturers have to reduce their cars' emissions significantly if the targets are to be met. The reason for this is explained by an interactive chart that makes clear that the 2010ths in Germany were the decade of the SUV. "," The project came at just the right time, before the coronavirus pandemic and in the midst of the debate about a sustainable and environmentally compatible future. In winter 2019, there had already been debates about SUVs in cities and their potential danger in traffic accidents in Germany, following several serious accidents. The project underpinned the debate with the facts about the rise of the SUV as the best-selling car segment in Germany, and the poor environmental performance of the car fleet of the Germans' favorite manufacturers. "," We created and discussed the designs in Sketch, and the implementation was done in d3.js in a template based on react.js and node.js. For data cleaning and analysis we use R. "," Although the data was published by the ""Kraftfahrtbundesamt"", Germany's motor vehicle authority, as individual tables within several, long PDFs, the authority was very uncooperative when it came to releasing the data in machine-readable form. The office wanted us to sign a contract and pay a four to five figure euro amount for compiling the statistics. Moreover, this was supposed to take several months. So we downloaded every single PDF, manually cropped them to the pages with the tables, and then extracted the data as CSVs. Since the tables were designed differently in some years, we could only merge the data into a common database via manual and R-assisted cleanup to finally do the analysis. We are convinced that it is our task as data journalists to also make freely available data usable for all people. Because this data could be viewed by anyone, but each PDF was very long and complex, one for each month of the year, and all placed in individual subfolders of the page. Our extra work compiled the data and put it in context for all to interpret. "," This project shows that playful approaches work very well for topics that might otherwise be more unloved. Germany is a car country, and although awareness of sustainable lifestyles is growing, many people don't want to do without them. Election data even suggests that the typical environmental party voter likes to drive up to the health food store in an SUV. What's more, this project has shown that one should not be deterred by uncooperative authorities and threats of large sums of money. Sometimes it is even more worthwhile to do the manual work and free the data.

In this ground-breaking piece HS acquired and analysed multiple data sets and found out that almost 1 out of 5 apartments are most likely used against their intended purpose. The investigation also found out that average Hitas buyers are richer than average working people and showed how Hitas apartments really are significantly cheaper than those on the open market.     "," The legitimacy of Hitas system has been widely disputed throughout years. However, before our investigation no one really knew who exactly benefited from the system, i.e. who owned or lived in these subsidized apartments. Our investigation showed that almost 1 out of 5 apartments are likely used against their intended purpose. The apartments are rented out, not used as the owner’s own aparment as intended. Also, our prior investigation showed how Hitas regulations are often bypassed, and one person owns more than one Hitas apartment.     Immediately after the publication of the story the deputy mayor of Helsinki thanked HS for the investigation and acknowledged that the city will use the findings of the story to help the city to revamp the Hitas system.    Eight months later, in November 2020, the city council decided to terminate the whole Hitas system in two years and replace it with a fairer system. "," Our goal was to show these unique and complex findings with couple of easy to understand, informative scrolly tell charts while simultaneously highlighting the most important findings in writing.      We acquired four kinds of data sets: one from Helsinki city that listed all the owners of the Hitas apartments. Secondly, we bought two sets of address data to be able to check where the owners actually live. Thirdly, we sourced manually public tax records and found out how much the owners of the Hitas apartments earn.

United States,"Minute Physics, aatishb.com",Small,Participant,Why Masks Work Better Than You'd Think,08/09/20,"Explainer, Illustration, Video","Animation, Canvas, Python"," This is an interactive article & companion YouTube video [1,2] explaining the counter-intuitive math behind how masks protect people in communities. Using interactives and simple visuals, we explain how even partially effective masks confer more protection to a community than you might intuitively expect (especially when many people wear them). We created interactives where readers can understand interactions in networks, vary mask usage and mask effectiveness, and calculate & visualize the benefit that masks provide a community. Both our video and our interactive essay can be viewed independently, and were designed to complement each other and reach parallel audiences. "," Our video trended on YouTube and was viewed over 1 million times. Our interactive essay has been viewed by a large international audience, and was shared on Twitter by epidemiologists, science communicators, data journalists, health journalists, the Berkeley Advanced Media Institute,  and the Washington Department of Health. It was also shortlisted as a finalist in Flowing Data's Best Data Visualization Projects of 2020 [5].     Aatish created a guide to contributing translations [4], and consequently our work has been translated into 14 languages to date by a volunteer team of international open-source contributors [4], including many first-time GitHub contributors. It was translated to Czech for a popular science & technology website [6], where it reached 100,000 readers in 2 days.     Aatish went on to collaborate with OpenSciEd, an organization creating freely available science educational materials for US middle schools, and adapted the interactives for use in middle school STEM classrooms [3]. It is currently being piloted with ~40 middle school teachers, with the goal of publishing these teaching materials for use in classrooms by the summer.     "," We created an animated YouTube video explaining the math behind how masks multiply protection using standard animation tools. We also created an interactive essay using custom JavaScript, HTML, & CSS, and using the p5.js, plotly.js, and vue.js libraries for canvas animations, graphing, and interactivity, respectively. Finally, we created a Python code notebook [7] outlining the mathematical ideas underlying the essay for those with a math background who want to dive in deeper, which included plots and simulations of the mathematical model underlying the essay. "," The greatest challenge was to create a visual language that allowed us to explain the key mathematical ideas without resorting to equations. Rather than simply *telling* people the outcome of the mathematical models, it was important to us that we convey a genuine understanding of the math through the visuals and interactives.     We first developed a mathematical model to calculate the effect of a bidirectionally effective mask on controlling an epidemic [7]. We then worked to integrate this into the video & essay in a manner that is jargon-free, compelling, and understable to a general audience, largely by relying on carefully chosen visuals, animation, and interactives to convey understanding. We incorporated feedback from top scientific experts including Manu Prakash, David Fisman, and Monica Gandhi. "," They can learn about how to break down a complex topic and distill research in a manner that is compelling, clear, and easy to read.

These could actually lead to real world harm and even death.   This story showed how police accounts shared malicious content against left-leaning personalities from a network of anonymously-managed Facebook pages. These actions violate not only laws and codes but also Facebook's policy against content that ""incites or facilitates serious violence."" "," Following Rappler’s investigation, Facebook took down several pages and networks identified in the article. In a statement, Facebook said the dubious network it took down violated its policy ""against foreign or government interference which is coordinated inauthentic behavior on behalf of a foreign or government entity"" and had links to the Philippine military and Philippine police. This was the first time Facebook tagged a state-sponsored disinformation in the Philippines. "," We used our internal social media monitoring tool to track posts from the anonymously-managed pages. The team then closely monitored these pages, as well as official police websites and Facebook accounts.   The networks were then visualized using Flourish. "," The most difficult parts of the project were the months long data gathering - which includes among others fact-checking and content analysis - data cleaning, and analysis.   It started from the false claims being circulated about a politician, who is a critic of President Rodrigo Duterte. The initial pages we spotted were anonymously managed. Then we saw one known propagandist post from a police page. That’s when we tried to determine whether this was an isolated incident or not and the extent of such operation.   On top of this, it was also difficult to get the response from the Philippine police. We had to wait for months. "," There is a need to closely track disinformation to effectively fight it.    The project just started with an appreciation of the pattern of disinformation against a presidential critic. The team decided to follow the posts, until one thing led to another.   In disinformation stories like this, individual fact-check stories are important because they will serve as the backbones of the investigation.   Millions of Filipinos are on Facebook.The platform has become the go-to place by organized disinformation campaigns in the Philippines, including that of the state.   It is critical for the media to learn, unearth, and make the public aware of the different disinformation and propaganda strategies, and to consistently do such stories so as not to drop the ball.

In addition to her priorities as president, we also presented with charts and graphs those of her predecessors after analyzing all 15 presidential inaugural speeches since 1948 as well as press releases issued during Tsai’s first fours in office, from 2012 to 2016. "," Using a series of visualizations and charts, we presented the key words of all 15 presidential inaugural speeches from 1948 through 2020 and the main issues on the top of President Tsai’s agenda during her first four-year term.   We did not seek to interpret the meanings of individual keywords. Instead, we wanted the readers to see if there were differences in the choices of words by presenting both the frequency of each term that was used and the connection of those words while demarcating the years when Taiwan was under Martial Law from 1949 to 1987 and the years since those stringent regulations were lifted and also the times when the president was or was not popularly elected. There was much discussion after our project was posted on the internet, with readers offering their different interpretations and viewpoints. Some political scholars said that analyses like this were highly valuable and could be of great interest to think tanks based overseas.     "," Ckip Tagger, an open-source Chinese language processor developed by Academia Sinica, Taiwan’s top research institution, was used for this project for the purpose of word segmentation. All words having been sorted, nouns (with related postpositions and quantifiers taken off), verbs and adjectives were selected for statistical analysis and subsequent visualization.   Keywords related to government policies were computed using word2vec, a Google open-source machine learning module, which projected the terms into a vector space and calculated their distances from each other. The closer one keyword is to another, the more closely they are connected. This was combined with word frequency data and finally an editor came up with a final list of keywords, complete with the usage frequency of those words and their proximity to each other.    "," Until now, no other Taiwan media outlets were known to have explored written texts with this method. Our project marked the first attempt by a Taiwanese media organization to not only consider word frequency but to select parts of speech in order to systematically digitize a huge number of texts and to visually present the result in a way that is easy to comprehend.    "," For this project, artificial intelligence rather than experts was used to analyze the texts. A reporter could potentially write a more comprehensive article by identifying the differences among the speeches of successive presidents with the help of those analyses. At the same time, a thorough exploration of the press releases issued on behalf of President Tsai over the previous four years could also help a reporter to compare her policies during her second term of office with what she said previously.    ",https://www.cna.com.tw/project/20200520-inauguraladdress/,,,,,,,,"Lee Yi-ying, Sung Yu-tai, Lin Chi, Chen Ying-yu, Huang Shu-fang"," The Central News Agency launched its Media Lab in July 2018 to cope with new challenges that come with the digital era.

Norway,NRK,Big,Participant,Your Climate Future,28/11/20,"Long-form, Database, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Environment","Animation, Google Sheets, Node.js"," The project consists of  356 data-driven, illustrated and animated long-feature articles, one for each municipality in Norway.  The story explores how the livelihoods in each municipality will change towards the end of the century due to climate change, i.e., how much hotter, more rain, less snow and higher sea levels there will be, compared to the levels of today. Enormous amounts of data on municipality-level are utilized to create a feeling of localness. An animated character serves as the reader’s companion throughout the story.     In the landing page, search for “Molde”, “Kautokeino” and “Oslo” for different variants. "," The value of the project lies in its total scope and illustrates how nearly every part of daily life will be affected by climate change. None of the revelations are necessarily shocking understood alone, it’s the total compilation of data that is truly alarming and innovative. The project reached about 540 000 readers, a high number for an NRK-story.   We shared our findings with several small newspapers across the country, who in turn wrote local articles based on our data and findings. The project also led to various follow-up stories from local divisions of NRK.   We gathered qualitative feedback from readers in the article footer. Among the feedback were especially the friendly non-doomsday presentation, and the easy-to-understand text and graphics. Several teachers wrote that they would like to use the article in their classroom. Many mentioned that the story helped them to relate to climate change in a new fashion, because it illustrated what the changes will mean for aspects they personally care about.   "," We assembled all data collected from various organizations in Google sheets. This included both data about each municipality (altitudes, forest types, size etcetera), how the climate is there now (rain, skiing days, temperature, typical storm surges), and how those values will change if the RCP4.5 emission scenario is fulfilled. In total: over 40.000 data points. Based on the data and filtering of each municipality, we rendered out illustrations and text. In municipalities located near glaciers the story included how much the ice level in the nearest glacier would drop. In municipalities with coastline, we included a section stating how much the sea level will rise, while municipalities with lakes received a section of how the freshwater fish will cope. The journalists wrote variants of the paragraphs in sheets, while the municipality filters determined how it was rendered.    The article is developed with node.js and Svelte. Animations are a hybrid between JavaScript-animation and sprite animation. "," One of the central premises of the project was that the reader should experience the feature as local, because we believe it is easier to grasp climate change when its impact is close in time or close in area. That premise was probably the hardest. Our data told us a lot of what was applicable to include in each story, but it also had certain limitations. For instance, the data said that one municipality had 134 skiing days per year. That may be true in theory, but 10-20 skiing days were more realistic, locals felt. The data did not reveal that those potential skiing opportunities were on a steep mountain hill, not recommended for skiing. All 356 articles should ideally have been read through by a resident from each municipality before the project was published. We did not reach that goal completely, but great crowdsourcing searching for local feedback a few days before the deadline really enhanced the result. The response from readers also indicated that the extremely local references we included in some municipalities were much appreciated.   The local feeling was also maintained in terms of the graphics and illustrations. We could for instance not illustrate steep mountains, as some residents in flat municipalities might find that strange. A few municipalities in Northern Norway don't have spruce trees thus we had to draw birch and apply them to the areas in question. That was our mantra throughout – don’t illustrate or write anything that would put the reader off and make her think “it’s not really like this where I live, so I don’t know if the part about climate change is true either”.   "," We recommend close and open cooperation between journalists, designers and developers, who don’t mind stepping into each other’s field of expertise.

Egypt,"ARIJ Network, Infotimes",Small,Participant,Youth Centers Drop Women Athletes from their List of Concerns by Hager Hisham,23/12/20,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Sports, Lifestyle, Women","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets"," The investigation reveals the failure of the Egyptian government, through the Ministry of Youth and Sports, to provide a suitable environment for Egyptian women to play sports in youth centers. This happened in various governorates of Egypt, specially in rural areas and Upper Egypt where there are rarely alternatives, and is discriminatory against women as it deprives them of the opportunity to play sports. Although youth centers account for 85% of all sport facilities in Egypt, there was a clear absence of strategies needed to be taken by the government to increase women's participation in sports in youth centers. "," The investigation caused discussions to arise in the athletes' community and those responsible for sports in Egypt. In response to his statement in the plenary session of Parliament, MP Sahar Talaat Mostafa used the most prominent figures in the investigation to ask the Minister of Youth and Sports about the steps needed to correct the situation and create a suitable environment for women to increase their turnout in youth centers. This is a big shift after this topic was under-reported and did not receive much attention in the media or in government plans and statements regarding women's sports.   Community wise, the investigation created a different narrative from the mainstream and stereotypical one that states that Egyptian women are not that interested in sports exclusively because of customs and traditions. By analyzing government data from the past 10 years, the investigation proves that the negligence of women in youth centers contributed to their reluctance to benefit from their activities and facilities. It is important to note that youth centers represent 85% of all sport facilities In Egypt, and they didn't provide privacy for women while practicing sports nor did they provide a training team of women. This contradicts the legal definition of these centers, which exist to serve youth without discrimination while providing their activities for a symbolic fee.   Most importantly, the investigation turned an issue that was on the sidelines into the spotlight and it became a debatable topic during the questioning of the Egyptian parliamentarians to the Minister of Youth and Sports under the dome of Parliament. It also created awareness of a fundamental part of the problem regarding the reluctance of many women to practice sports in youth centers, which are the most widespread sports facilities In Egypt with affordable prices for most citizens. "," I used the OCR application and data scraping programs from PDF files like Tabula to scrape sports activity data related to youth centers during a time period of 10 years. This data gets annually published by the Central Statistical Organization in Egypt. Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned and organized the data, then I analyzed it to answer the basic questions of the investigation. Using phone interviews and Microsoft Excel again, I created a database with a sample of youth centers in Egypt to reveal that at least half of them did not provide sport activities for women over 18 years old.   I then used Flourish's website to create graphs for the investigation, and through several phone calls and field visits (within the limits of what was possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic), I managed to speak with a number of sources related to the story, like affected women, experts on the topic, and government officials. Lastly, I used Google's advanced search to find studies or previous journalistic stories that support this investigation's hypothesis and its results, as well as to help put the topic in a logical context to explain the results of the data analysis. "," The most difficult part was developing a methodology where the hypothesis of the investigation could be proven. It was a challenge to prove that women were descrimnated against and neglected by not having a suitable environment for them to practice sports in youth centers. Although most public data available from official statistical centers in Egypt prove that this problem existed, I still had to prove that the reason behind women's reluctance to join youth centers was the negligence of the administrators.   Using a database provided by the Ministry of Youth and Sports that included the names and locations of youth centers across Egypt, I chose a sample of 54 youth centers across 14 governorates using the random multistage sampling method and contacted them to ask about the sports activities available for a girl over 18 years old. The results revealed that at least more than half of them didn't provide activities for women and didn't account for them.   Then came the hurdle of finding enough information to explain the results of the data analysis, like the reason behind why the number of female athletes is affected by the number of female coaches, or the correlation between their reluctance and the number of changing rooms available to them. This was specially difficult because of the scarcity of studies that dealt with the issue of female athletes in Egypt. However, through extensive search, I was able to find enough information and resources to support and explain the results of the story. Besides extensive search, it helped to find the suitable sources and affected cases that have experiences that match the data. This also gave the story a human voice and amplified the results and helped audiences relate to the story and understand what it meant for women. "," Working on data-driven investigations requires persistence and hard work and needs intelligence, flexibility, and planning. In countries where data on social and economic situations is not readily available, you must find alternative ways to collect data to complete your story, and you must ensure that your methodology will support your hypothesis and prove it.   Additionally, it is important to start with the story and not the data. What is your big question about this phenomenon? And how can you answer this question using data? In the case of the youth centers investigation, there were dozens of tables across 10 years from the official statistics, if I had followed the data before putting my basic questions out, it would have taken me a long time to realize that I needed other data to prove the hypothesis of the investigation. Therefore, writing questions first helps save a lot of time and effort.   It is important to remember that data analysis does not always help and can sometimes mislead you without context. We cannot understand the data and the results of its analysis accurately expressing reality without collecting sufficient information about this reality first. This means reading other stories and talking to colleagues who worked on similar stories and listening to your sources, especially the ones affected by the phenomenon you are investigating. Yes, they may not have the data and information you have, but they live with what this data reflects every day.   For example, while analyzing the data for my story, I found a weak correlation between the numbers of women in youth centers and changing rooms, and without talking to my sources and knowing that they use alternative rooms to get changed, I would have concluded that changing room didn't affect their turnout for the centers.
