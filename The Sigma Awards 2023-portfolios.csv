Malaysia,Macaranga Media Sdn Bhd,Small,Winner,"Data journalism in Malaysia has been elevated to another level since Yao Ha-Law began to lend his talent. To show this contribution, it is important to note that the focus of the work is on environmental issues in a country that has many needs in this area. By using visuals, precision journalism, and other tools, his production gives shape and concreteness to the issues.

An example of an initiative that projects Yao Ha-Law's career is the creation of the Macaranga portal, addressing issues that have not been disclosed by any other communication vehicle. By publishing mainly about forestry data, the work of the award-winning professional is exquisite. With his denunciations, often being the only voice to divulge the subject, Yao Hua-Law managed to produce effective results, preventing the continuation of environmental crimes.",Yao-Hua Law,"I have been a science and environment journalist in Malaysia since 2014. I have mostly reported on ecology and public health for top science magazines, including a narrative feature on snakebite health burden in Indonesia that won the One World Media Award in 2020.

In 2019, Wong Siew Lyn and I co-founded Macaranga, an environmental journalism portal, to fill a gap in in-depth, data-driven and analytical environmental reporting in the country. When our reader interest survey singled out ‘deforestation’ as the top concern, we looked into the matter and started my years-long investigation on forest use and management in Peninsular Malaysia. At the time, no other Malaysian media provided accurate insights on the people or forces that drive forest use. Forestry data was often described as obscure and “confidential”, and the prevalent notion was that reporting on logging projects would trigger the wrath of tycoons, politicians, and royal families.

Our stories for Macaranga, supported by the Pulitzer Center, showed otherwise. I saw how foreign media like Guardian, Bloomberg, and Economist were combining data, satellite imagery, visualisations and storytelling to produce impactful environmental reporting. I attempted a similar approach – though without a freedom of information act in Malaysia, data remain largely limited and scattered. Still, I have been able to sniff out several sources of data (resource centers in government department), learn to analyse satellite images and GIS data in QGIS, use free tools like Flourish, Pinpoint, and others to scrape websites. With Siew Lyn
as editor, we produced stories that were very data-driven and data-supported, and successfully transported readers to the locality using maps and engaging writing.

It might have been a coincidence, but since Macaranga started publishing, other Malaysian media began to include more graphs, maps, and satellite images in their environmental reporting too. Well, we are some of several people training journalists in Malaysia on data journalism and environmental reporting.

In 2022, my stories for Macaranga won Malaysia’s top journalism award – the Malaysian Press Institute Award Gold Prize for Excellence in Environmental Reporting. Macaranga had just turned 3 years old then. But the best news last year was that a company stopped their logging after we reported on them, and the Department of Environment initiated investigation on a royalty-associated company after we exposed that they had broke the law on an oil palm project.","I am the sole reporter and I made almost all of the elements presented in the stories. Wong
Siew Lyn edited all the stories. These projects investigated unsustainable use of forests in Peninsular Malaysia, and exposed systemic failures, illegal activity, or projects that hurt the state and communities but benefit the shareholders.
In ‚ÄúForest Plantations in Reserves‚Äù, I showed that the governments‚Äô forest plantation efforts have destroyed huge tracts of forests without achieving delivering any goals. Forest plantations are monoculture tree farms, and were meant to provide a sustainable timber supply. But I showed that governments only approved plantations inside reserves, and that two-thirds of the 185,000 ha cleared for plantations had been abandoned. Furthermore, genuine planters are struggling with their businesses and refuse to harvest timber as scheduled. 
I analysed more than 40 years of forest plantation documents ‚Äì government reports, conference papers, manuals, and scientific studies. I sought maps to check if and where plantations were destroying good forests. I combed through company financial statements and EIA reports of projects. I persuaded loggers and planters to explain the specifics of their projects; got government officers to confess that their data fails to reflect reality; and spoke with communities affected by forest plantations.
The work required data that is distributed without clear organisation across several government agencies. I had to go to these agencies, daily for weeks to comb their shelves. To convince loggers and planters, I spent days roaming in town. 
A month before my publication, the government suddenly announced a halt on new forest plantation projects. My findings were used in a debate in state legislative assembly. And in the year after publication, as forest plantations hit the news often, journalists and policymakers refer to my stories for background. 
For ‚ÄúCutting Chini-Bera Forests‚Ä¶‚Äù, I revealed how the state government and Department of Environment have approved an oil palm project doomed to fail. That‚Äôs because the project had and will clear natural forests, which disqualifies it from mandatory sustainability certification in Malaysia. The forests there houses tigers, elephants, and hornbills. The site also houses two indigenous villages, some of whom claim they were tricked by the developer into signing letters of consent. 
Digging into company documents and property ownership, I showed that the developer‚Äôs shareholder include royalty and a major Thai conglomerate that brands itself as a tiger defender in Thailand. I made accurate maps and gathered satellite images of the deforestation, and used the evidence to prod Malaysian oil palm regulators into responding: they denounced the project. 
After publication, the developer didn‚Äôt exercise their rights to start logging. A major conservation group suspended its partnership with the Thai conglomerate. And lawyers for the indigenous villagers are using my stories and data to build their court case. 
In the third project, ‚ÄúDrains Dug, Trees Cut, Now Let‚Äôs it Approved‚Äù, I exposed a developer for clearing forests and planting oil palm before it even submitted the mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA). This was a risky story to report on because the Sultan of the state and his family own the developer and the land. The evidence and data I present must be extra solid.
I extracted location, names, and dates of legal procedures out of the project‚Äôs EIA report. I used satellite images to identify progress of deforestation. Then I used a drone to snap images of the development. But the drone limited range meant I had to enter the plantations, posing as a birder, to get exact coordinates of the site‚Äôs border and see the palm saplings planted. I also spoke with workers and locals.
The story prompted the Department of Environment to investigate the developer.",English,https://www.macaranga.org/forest-plantations-in-reserves-quick-to-cut-slow-to-grow/,https://www.macaranga.org/cutting-the-chini-bera-forests-for-oil-palm-that-cannot-sell/,https://www.macaranga.org/drains-dug-trees-cut-now-get-it-approved-aa-sawit-johor/,,,,,,,
Brazil,"The Intercept Brasil, Rede Interação, Revista Piauí, Sumaúma Jornal, Repórter Brasil/Unearthed",Small,Shortlist,,Rodolfo Almeida,"My name is Rodolfo Almeida, I'm a visual journalist, and I have been working at the intersection of journalism, visual narratives and data in Brazil for the last 8 years, and data journalism has shaped my understanding of the world and the ways in which we can act upon it.

My journalism carrer started with an internship working with video stories at Estadão, Brazil’s second biggest newspaper, which introduced me to the power of visual media in telling the stories of our time. This understanding was further developed when I worked at Nexo Jornal, an explanatory journalism outlet, as an infographics reporter. There, I was mentored by amazing professionals such as Simon Ducroquet and Daniel Mariani, and discovered a passion for finding the most simple yet profond visual metaphor for a certain story – a goal I aim at to this day. 

With time, the needs of that job shifted from more classic illustrated infographic work to more data visualization and analysis – and I accompanied that shift and began studying statistics, visual perception and languages such as R, visualization tools and concepts. I'm very greatful for the recognition my work has received in the past years from the likes of Malofiej, SND ÑH, Biennale di Venezia and more.

Since then, it's been a wild ride. I've went to work with other outlets and companies and in January 2022 finally decided to give the freelance lifestyle a shot. In the last year I've worked on 18 different projects for 15 clients – mostly journalism outlets, collaborating with diverse teams of reporters and data scientists on new and original stories. I'm proud of having worked with publications and institutions such as The Intercept, Greenpeace/Unearthed, Revista Piauí, the Climate and Land Use Alliance, and more.

With an educational background on journalism and no formal education on design, coding or data, I also felt the need to go deeper on my understanding of visual representations of the world and how they can inform our actions and generate impact on our lives. So, in 2021, I started a Master's degree in Design at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, with orientation by the incredible professor Doris Kosminsky.

My line of research coincided with the subject matter I've been devoting most of my attention, worries and work towards: the climate. In Kosminsky's lab, I've been studying how climate phenomena are currently represented in data visualization and looking in areas as diverse as anthropology, design and philosophy for new and different ideas on how to understand and visualize that which is, by nature, invisible. As part of this academic endeavour, I've given talks in events such as IEEEVIS and CIDI, and published some of my findings in scientific journals.

I personally believe that journalism is a job deeply connected to everyone and everything that surrounds it and, in that sense, that the scientific research process can play a very important part in furthering our journalistic endeavours and the solutions we provide to problems – it sure has definitely deepened my understanding of the world and my journalistic work.

With this portfolio I'm presenting I hope to showcase a data journalism practice in tune with the problems of our time and oriented towards finding new solutions that are simple to understand, but complex to develop. I'm deeply commited to achieving a greater understanding of the world through journalism and to do meaningful and impactful work, and I'm greatful and appreciative of all the talented colleagues I've worked with.","**Additional information from the applicant:**

I've submitted seven projects as part of my portfolio. In five of them I'm credited either on the byline, or footer, or below the graphic pieces. They are:

1. Amazon Under Siege (The Intercept Brasil) - cited below graphics
Contributed only with the charts and animated maps. The Intercept's team had already obtained and pre-analyzed the data. They briefed me on the discussion and invited me to come up with the visualizations.

2. Cities & the Climate (Rede Interação) - cited in footer notes
Contributed with almost every facet of the project. Rede Interação had no expertise in infographics or printed publications. I was called in to both research the content, write it and edit it as well as come up with layout, composition, visualization, and illustrations. The only parts I wasn't involved in were the translations to other languages, and the workshops with local communities, which were held in person and helped shape the publication.

3. Cattle Laundering (Revista Piauí) - cited in footer notes
Contributed only with static charts, header illustration, video and storytelling ideas. The video was the main piece I worked on. Piauí's team had already done most of the reporting, but had trouble coming up with an intuitive and engaging way to convey the data they obtained. I suggested a video as a storytelling device and got to work with the editors on a script, motion graphics and sound design. The reporters recorded the narration for the video, and other interesting pieces of information were visualized as static charts.

4. Yanomami under attack (Sumaúma Jornal) - cited in footer notes
Contributed only with static charts, data analysis and animated maps. The Sumaúma team contacted me before visiting the Yanomami territory and asked me to come up with charts detailing the impact on Yanomami women's health. Soon after, they obtained data from local leadership and I analyzed and wrangled the data and proposed these sets of graphic pieces.

5. Deforestation in the meat business in Brazil (Repórter Brasil/Unearthed) - cited below graphics
Contributed only with static charts and data analysis. The Greenpeace team was working with Repórter Brasil in following the trail of illegal cattle in the Amazon. The bulk of the data work was done by Reporter Brasil's team, which resulted in a fairly large dataset that needed some analysis in search for relevant aspects to be visualized. That's where I conducted most of my work.

The other two projects don't seem to cite my name anywhere. They are:

1. The radicalization of Jovem Pan (Revista Piauí)
Contributed with data analysis, static charts, video research and video editing. The team behind Novelo Data invited me to help them analyze and visualize a large dataset for Revista Piauí. They managed to scrape from YouTube the transcriptions for every episode of Pingos Nos Is, which is Jovem Pan's most prestiged news show and, with so much data available, had a hard time coming up with insights from it and finding ways to visualize it. I proposed some analysis questions, and got to working with the data. This project was a part of a larger investigation conducted by Revista Piauí on Jovem Pan's history, with which I had no involvement. The reporting team occasionally requested some topics to be explored on the data side, and I worked on it alongside Novelo's team. I developed some interactive charts as well which didn't end up on the final piece due to CMS limitations. Midway through the work we had the idea of producing a video montage. I then sketched out a script with the general ideas, and partially watched 100+ episodes of Pingos Nos Is in search of footage. My involvement with the project can be corroborated by Guilherme Felitti (guilherme@novelo.io), Novelo Data's founder, and main data scientist on this piece.

2. The Connection (Revista Piauí)
Contributed only with illustrations, static and animated maps and charts. The reporting was already well advanced with Piauí and OCCRP teams following the trail of yellow Ipê. They had obtained a large amount of geographical and transactional data and needed to present it in a compelling way. I went through their dataset trying to reconstruct the routes and visualize them in maps. My involvement with the project can be corroborated by Allan de Abreu (allandeabreu@revistapiaui.com.br), the main reporter for this piece.

**The original project details are as follows:**

Amazon Under Siege (The Intercept Brasil)
This feature examines the rise in the numbers of shooting clubs in the Amazon and their effects on the neighbouring indigenous lands and other vulnerable communities. For this project, I worked to visualize the original data obtained by The Intercept team in engaging ways, and used static and animated maps and charts. This project was specially important in the context of the 2022 brazilian elections.

Cities & the Climate (Rede Interação)
This large-scale infographic was comissioned by the NGO Rede Interação and produced with input from the communities of Santarém, Pará. It illustrates how urban life relates to climate change and many of the feedback loops involved in these interactions. I was responsible for research, writing, designing, mapping and illustrating the piece. It was distributed freely at Amazon cities and online, in three languages, and informed citizens of the north region of Brazil.

Cattle Laundering (Revista Piauí)
Part of a larger investigative initiative made in collaboration with OCCRP, CCCA and Fiquem Sabendo, this piece for Piauí details how cattle laundering works in the Amazon and how ingrained it is in the meat business in Brazil. I produced static charts and maps and an animated video detailing the process and it's effects. This project shed a light on a repeating pattern on the region.

The radicalization of Jovem Pan (Revista Piauí)
This visual analysis produced for Piauí with Novelo Data's team illustrates how one of Brazil's biggest TV outlets became a disseminator of Bolsonaro's ideology. For this piece I watched hundreds of programs to piece together a video montage detailing how the channel's positioning changed over time and how it fit with Bolsonaro's agenda. I also produced static charts with data processed by Novelo Data's team from YouTube transcriptions.

The Connection (Revista Piauí)
In this piece, I collaborated with charts, illustrations, and maps reporters which reconstructed the route of a batch of yellow ipê wood illegally extracted from the Brazilian state of Pará to a store in New York. Made in collaboration with OCCRP and CCCA, the piece revealed a series of irregularities and corrupt practices along the route that helped to “launder” the endangered wood. The movement of the ipê batch also raised suspicions among Brazilian customs officials, but a series of decisions by the then-Minister of the Environment undermined any chance of investigating the sale. That same minister had already faced scrutiny by the Federal Police for facilitating the international smuggling of timber from the Amazon. Shortly thereafter, he resigned.

Yanomami under attack (Sumaúma Jornal)
The Yanomami land is the largest indigenous territory in Brazil and also one of the main targets of illegal miners bringing violence and destruction to the region. Sumaúma obtained data on these impacts and visited the territory in loco, providing me with first-hand reporting on the situation, and images which helped me produce the animated and static maps and charts in the piece.

Deforestation in the meat business in Brazil (Repórter Brasil/Unearthed)
This collaborative investigation from Unearthed, Greenpeace and Repórter Brasil revealed how Brazil's biggest meat company bought almost 9,000 cattle from one of the biggest deforesters in the country, leading the company to admit, for the first time in its history, to malfeasance. I collaborated with maps, charts and data analysis.",Portuguese,https://theintercept.com/2022/11/09/sob-bolsonaro-clubes-de-tiro-explodem-em-areas-de-conflito-da-amazonia-legal/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1McnP6_AHOG0PsQnsV-efKcLiabPdv6Lo/view?fbclid=IwAR0O95mnud6RkbJLhxC75_AR9YrCXd3cKq1-Gum9a6_Hf1uRoA7hhtzjF1w,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/materia/lavagem-da-boiada/,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/radicalizacao-da-jovem-pan-uma-analise-visual/,https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/materia/a-conexao-2/,https://sumauma.com/por-que-os-garimpeiros-comem-as-vaginas-das-mulheres-yanomami/,https://reporterbrasil.org.br/2022/11/jbs-admite-ter-comprado-quase-9-mil-bois-ilegais-do-maior-desmatador-do-pais/,,,
United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,,Sondre Ulvund Solstad,"You judges have a tough job. I am sure you must have many strong candidates - I can only imagine the strong submissions you must get. If you were to pick this one, my guess would however be it is for one of the following reasons:

1. These projects suggest novel and often inspiring ways to approach a difficult subject - war and its consequences.
2. They are often very original: from training a machine learning algorithm to read twitter to using over 200 years worth of data to look at conquest
3. Some of the projects are of a different flavour than most data journalism: the story being not the data itself, but what insights you can derive from it - often via rigorous statistical modelling.
4. The portfolio shows a willingness to challenge readers: one attempts (and, I dare say, succeeds) at showing how knowing facts about statistical distributions can be cool (because they show that some countries actively faked covid data).
5. The projects show ambition: from using machine learning to model how the war might lead to more or less political unrest around the world (through price hikes in fuel and food, and more), to pioneering a new way to measure military spending (a ""military PPP"").

To give a bit of background about me: I started working as a journalist in 2020, just before the pandemic began. Before that, I was at Princeton University doing a PhD, and before that, at New York University doing a BA. And before that, I spent a year as a conscript - not too far from the Russian border - in the Medic Battalion of the Norwegian Army. As a journalist, I am probably best known for being the person behind ""the pandemic's true death toll"" - the project which first estimated how many really died due to the pandemic via excess deaths. In addition to my own work as a journalist, I have in the past year also intermittently acted as data editor at The Economist. 

Beyond individual projects, I strive to make data journalism use more of the cutting edge methods found in social science and machine learning, and to make the field more transparent by sharing my code and data whenever I can, as well as helping the field grow through mentoring, presentations (of which I have done many in the past year - including some in person!), and by building bridges with academia (here hope to leverage my nomination to the Institute for Quantitative Social Science). 

Thank you for reading!","My portfolio submission shows my work on the Russia-Ukraine war and its consequences. The goal is to show some of the breadth of what I’ve produced on the subject in the past year. In addition to stories about how the war affects Ukraine and the rest of the world, I’ve tried to include stories of how the war is changing Russia. I’ve also included an article suggesting how hard it is to cover the country as a data journalist - providing statistical evidence that within it, even covid death statistics may have been actively faked. 

To usefully highlight some challenges I encountered along the way: 

“Russians in every major city and region call for #nowar” includes data from public profiles on Instagram. Instagram does not provide this to journalists, and have taken steps to make obtaining it via computer very difficult. Getting this data was therefore very, very, time-consuming.

“Russia is swaying Twitter users outside the West to its side” uses a machine learning algorithm to detect pro-Ukraine, neutral, and pro-Russia sentiment. Such an algorithm did not exist when I started the project, so I had to make and validate one myself. This involved manually reading and coding thousands of tweets to create training data. 

“Vladimir Putin is dragging the world back to a bloodier time” begins with a map showing the approximate location of all wars on the planet since 1816. No dataset of these locations existed either - so I had to find them through other data and historical research. 

In terms of metrics, I am not sure what is expected or what I’m allowed to say on my end. However, I can confidently say that all these articles were widely read: and some were among the most popular articles we have published all year. Moreover, the article “Costly food and energy are fostering global unrest” resulted in massive policy engagement. This included “a high-level discussion” at the United Nations’ headquarters (they told me I could not be more specific), which centred on how the UN could use the methods it pioneered in its work and planning. 

I am the author of all these projects, doing the data collection, modelling, writing, and reporting. All were solo-authored except three: Daniella Raz collaborated with me on ""How the war in Ukraine compares to other refugee crises"", Adam Roberts on “Vladimir Putin is dragging the world back to a bloodier time”, and “Costly food and energy are fostering global unrest” was the work of many hands - I did the data journalism sections, and Robert Guest, Joanna Lillis, Charlotte McCann, Lena Schipper, Mitra Taj, Liam Taylor, Namini Wijedasa, Piotr Zalewski contributed the rest.

Germany,Der Tagesspiegel,Big,Shortlist,,Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab,"Actually, it all started over a beer in a pub. That's where the idea for the Radmesser project was born in 2018. At the time, we used sensors to measure how closely cyclists were being overtaken by motorists. It was to become the Innovation Lab's first project. In January 2019, the team was officially founded. Four years have passed since then. Four became eight team members. Now, three journalists, four programmers and one designer work in the Lab. The projects are more professional, technically better and reach a much larger audience. 

Especially in 2022, the team has proven how outstanding it has become. Our portfolio shows a variety of topics and data visualizations, quite a few of them are live graphics. 

How the ideas come about varies greatly. Of course, as the data team of a daily newspaper, we care about current issues. At the same time, we want to develop our own spin on these topics as much as possible. We succeed in doing this by using special forms of presentation, but also by using different data sources or machine learning for analysis. To get even better access to data, we cooperate with universities and startups. Next to that, we also take part in internationally investigations. And in contrast to other media, we do most research in our Lab team in-house. Precise work and factchecking always have priority. Technically, we are oriented at the fast-faced best practice of international teams. We use Svelte, D3 and prerendering technology. 

Of course, we are not only technically inspired by other media - exciting links to stories with exciting forms of presentation also end up in the team channel as well as new data sets. What is important to us: If we use another medium as inspiration, this is of course indicated. 

After just a few years, the Innovation Lab has become an established data team in Germany. We are delighted if we are considered for the award.","The Innovation Lab's portfolio primarily includes dataviz and visual stories on various topics – from interactive calculators to scrollytelling to live graphics. A quick overview on the stories we handed in: 

For our YouTube and dataviz series „Papaya and Fries“, which was about migrant kitchen and climate change, we built an interactive climate impact calculator for cooking. This can be used to calculate exactly how much CO2 a dish consumes. The data comes from the API of the startup Eaternity, which deals with CO2 balancing. 

An animated scrollytelling with the most important foodstuff furthermore made possible to quickly compare the values and understand, why for example chicken can be much more climatefriendly than many vegetarian aliments made from milk – or, why vegan produce will always be more climate friendly, even if imported. 

In our live article on the Ukraine war, the map shows the course of the war, most current research by media all over the world as well as the locations of significant fighting and tropu movements. It is updated daily. Other graphics in the article data such as support payments to Ukraine, refugees and air strikes. Per month the article gets an average of more than 500.000 clicks. It is among the most successful published pieces. 

The war in Ukraine showed in sad clarity how dependent Germany is on Russian gas. The Tagesspiegel Innovation Lab has therefore built a gas simulator in exchange with scientists, where everyone can try out for themselves how different measures and decisions could interact when the discussion about them was most vibrant last summer. 

Because fake videos are used for disinformation in the Ukraine war, we show how easy it is to make such videos with our own Deep fake. And where the limitations are. 

The „Temperature Monitor„ is also a live graphic and is intended to give a rough impression of how ""normal"" the weather is right now. Daily weather data and forecasts come directly from German Weather Service APIs. With a methodologically very transparent display it shows how – over time – a dramatic climatic trend is created from weather fluctuations. 

The consequences of climate change could be observed especially well in the summer of 2022. In 2022, many rivers had too little water. We use graphics based on water height measurements and satellite images to show how serious the situation is. 

With visual formats we tell the story of the nely started oil production in Uganda from the beginning – using 3D maps; data sets and satellite images around the logistical large-scale operation and the ecological risks. 

Regularly, we use data to work locally and map neighborhoods - for example, with the green space map. It shows which neighborhoods have particularly poor environmental factors. Readers could explore their neighborhoods. The map was our most successful subscription piece. 

In addition to current topics, the Innovation Lab is part of the European Cities Investigative Journalism Accelerator, in which it leads the data management and dataviz for the whole network of 12 European media organisations. It's a network of European media dedicated to researching common challenges facing major European cities and countries. In focus so far is mainly housing. The research on Student Housing is a part of this.","English, German",https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/co2-bilanz-von-essen-der-klimarechner-fuer-deine-kueche/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/wie-klimaschaedlich-sind-beliebte-lebensmittel/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/wie-weit-sind-die-soldaten-aktuelle-karte-der-russischen-invasion-in-der-ukraine/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/lieferstopp-rechner-reicht-das-gas-im-winter-trotz-importstopp-aus-russland/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/real-deep-fake-giffey-antwortet-klitschko/index.html,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/temperaturmonitor-wetter-vs-klima-sind-die-temperaturen-in-deutschland-gerade-normal/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/gruenflaechen-laerm-luftverschmutzung-wie-lebenswert-ist-mein-kiez-in-berlin/index.html,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/pegelstaende-auf-rekordtief-europas-fluesse-trocknen-aus/index.html,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/worlds-longest-heated-pipeline-oil-wells-in-the-national-park/,https://interaktiv.tagesspiegel.de/lab/studentenwohnheime-im-visier-der-investoren-das-geschaeft-mit-den-studierenden/
United States,"Armando Info, El País, Earthrise Media, The Intercept Brasil, The New York Times, Pulitzer Center´s Rainforest Investigations Network",Big,Shortlist,,Airstrips of Destruction in Brazil and Venezuela by the Pulitzer Center´s Rainforest Investigations Network (RIN) -,"I write this letter on behalf of an alliance of journalists and outlets that collaborated to reveal the criminal infrastructure fueling the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Their stories were published by Armando Info, El País, The New York Times and The Intercept Brasil – a collaboration coordinated by the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network (RIN).

The RIN was launched in 2020 with the goal of promoting collaborative investigations to unveil the causes of environmental destruction in the Amazon, Congo Basin and Southeast Asia. As the editor of RIN, I have worked with some of the most talented investigative journalists of our time and have been inspired by their embrace of teamwork and collaboration. 

The project I am submitting represents an important breakthrough because of its innovative methodology to prove a crucial, underreported issue: the connection between criminality and deforestation in the Amazon. Brazil and Venezuela share a sad history of land invasions, violence against Indigenous people, and pollution. A great part of this is caused by the rush for minerals, especially gold.

The investigation broke new ground as the first journalistic endeavor to use artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to map mines and runways in a tropical rainforest. These airstrips are the most blatant element of the growing illegal economy in the Venezuelan and the Brazilian Amazon. Driven by the high profits from mining and drug trafficking, clandestine groups, such as militias and guerrillas, conquer territories by tearing up the forest to allow them to advance into more remote regions. Many of these areas are Indigenous territories and represent the last barriers to the total destruction of the planet’s largest tropical rainforest.

Bringing together journalists from local and global media organizations with civic technologists required diligence and sensitivity given the different languages, cultures, and audiences. The dedicated team from the Rainforest Investigations Network had to manage the expectations, workflows, and dynamics among these partners through countless meetings, one-on-one conversations, and a customized collaborative platform called Confluence. 

Through a collaboration with Earthrise Media, a non-governmental organization that uses geospatial data in journalistic investigations, the team developed a machine-learning algorithm that analyzes satellite images to identify the covert runways. In addition to publishing major stories in The New York Times, El País, Armando Info and The Intercept, we made the geospatial data of gold mines and runways detected by the algorithm publicly available and downloadable, to assist other journalists and investigators in their work.

By publishing methodology and data used, we believe the project will have an enduring resonance beyond this first batch of compelling stories. In partnership with Earthrise Media, the Rainforest Investigations Network has transformed the monitoring of airstrips and mining areas in the Amazon into an interactive tool that other journalists as well as civil society can use.

We published a platform called Amazon Mining Watch (AMW), which will continue to update the data and inspire new investigations. AMW has since been featured by journalism publications including the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN), the Online Journalism Blog, and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.

The reports drew immediate global attention. They were republished and quoted in Venezuelan and Brazilian media. Prominent journalists and media organizations in the United States and Europe also highlighted them. An example of the investigation’s lasting impact is the fact that, with the transition of government after Bolsonaro lost reelection in 2022, legislators in the Brazilian parliament are using the number of airstrips as an indicator of the urgency to reverse the destruction in the Amazon. The new minister of the environment, Marina Silva, cited the investigation’s findings in her speeches and positions.","The principal authors AIrstrips of Destruction are Hyury Potter, for The Intercept Brasil, Manuela Andreoni, Blacki Migliozzi, Pablo Robles, Victor Moriyama and Denise Lu, all for The New York Times, and Joseph Poliszuk, María Antonieta Segovia and María de los Ángeles Ramírez, from Armando Info/El Pais. The project was done with the coordinatination of the Pulitzer Center’s Rainforest Investigations Network editorial team: Environmental Investigations Editor: Gustavo Faleiros, Executive Editor: Marina Waker Guevara, Data Editor: Kuek Ser Kuang Keng and Reseach Editor: Jelter Meers. Partnership with Earthrise Media developers Caleb Kruse and Edward Boyda. 

The products of this collaboration are 
- 1 multimedia (front page) article published at The New York Times about airstrips in Brazil 
- A series of six articles called ""Corredor Furtivo"" with multimedia elements published simultaneously at El País and Armando Info, about the relation between the airstrips and illegal armed groups in Venezuela
- 1 featured article at the Intercept Brasil about the relation between the airstrips and illegal mining in Brazil
- 1 documentary launched by The Intercept about the life and work of the pilots working in the illegal runaways.
- The website Amazon Mining Watch and GitHub page managed by the Earthrise Media with all the documentation and code for the geospatial analysis

Since its inception, the investigation had the ambition of generating strong stories and groundbreaking data analysis that would serve as a blueprint for other journalists and civil society actors investigating criminal activities in the Amazon.

From their previous reporting, Potter, Poliszuk, Ramírez and Andreoni knew that unregulated landing strips were key to the criminal infrastructure that facilitates gold mining and other illegal activities. But until now no one had been able to systematically research, identify, and map the gold mines and airstrips, in part because of the impenetrable geography of the Amazon.

 As Rainforest Investigations Fellows, the three journalists decided to join forces to combine advanced data analysis and technology with traditional shoe-leather reporting to reveal for the first time the true scope of the problem. The team partnered with Earthrise Media to build a machine-learning algorithm and the public database that underpins the project.

The Amazon’s illegal economy is an extremely dangerous beat. To complement and verify the computational findings, our reporters did extensive field reporting and had to take many safety precautions. They talked to the people affected by illegal mining and to the pilots flying to and from the mines. They visited the different parts of the illegal mining supply chain, from dig sites to clandestine gold shops.

Different parts of the analysis included painstaking manual work to improve the machine learning algorithm and verify the results. Lining up satellite imagery with a computer program also created coding problems and technical delays.

The development of the algorithm consisted of manually selecting information from historical satellite imagery and then using this baseline for programs to find similar patterns in recent images. This machine-learning process allowed the team to scan thousands of high-resolution Sentinel 2 satellite images dating back to 2016, covering an enormous area in the Amazon.

Such a statistical and computational model is known as an artificial neural network. It was trained to look at patches the size of 44 by 44 10-meter pixels, an equivalent of 440m by 440m on the ground. The AI program found roughly 1269 airstrips in the Brazilian Amazon and 47 in Venezuelan Amazon . Many were found by cross-referencing information in Open Street Map, a community-built global map of roads and other infrastructure.","English, Portuguese, Spanish",https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/02/world/americas/brazil-airstrips-illegal-mining.html,https://elpais.com/internacional/2022-01-30/las-pistas-clandestinas-que-bullen-en-la-selva-venezolana.html,https://theintercept.com/2022/08/02/amazonia-pistas-clandestinas-garimpo/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IA-Rk_hdl4M,https://amazonminingwatch.org,https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector,,,,
Portugal,Público,Big,Shortlist,,Rui Barros,"Durante os últimos anos como jornalista de dados/journocoder no jornal PÚBLICO fui autor de várias peças, experimentei vários formatos, explorei novas formas de “data storytelling” e construí várias “news applications”.

Jornalista desde 2016, desde cedo demonstrei interesse na forma como os números, as bases de dados e algumas linhas de código podem ajudar a contar histórias com interesse público. Desde 2020 que trabalho exclusivamente em jornalismo de dados, sendo um dos poucos jornalistas em Portugal que se dedica a este ramo.

Como único jornalista de dados na minha redacção, o meu trabalho inclui colaborar com muitos colegas de diferentes áreas, desde a economia à política, mas também pensar e encontrar novas formas de olhar para um problema - e explicá-lo aos nossos leitores. Peças como “Com que programa eleitoral sairia para jantar?” e “Prometómetro” demonstram, por exemplo, como o jornalismo de dados pode ser útil para pensar novos formatos que sirvam o interesse dos leitores e permitam oferecer novas formas de levar a informação ao público. 

Quando não estou a trabalhar em artigos mais longos e com uma forte componente interactiva, participo com os meus colegas de redacção na elaboração de várias notícias que vão da saúde à economia. São exemplos disso peças como “Travão ao alojamento local pode afectar quase 60% do mercado em Portugal” ou “Profissionais de saúde já fizeram 9,9 milhões de horas extras no primeiro semestre deste ano”. Estes dois casos demonstram como tenho procurado aliar o conhecimento de muitos dos meus colegas de redacção nas suas áreas à minha experiência em recolher e analisar dados. São também um exemplo de como o jornalismo de dados encontra novas perspectivas ou histórias dentro de temas recorrentes no espaço mediático.

Um dos meus grandes interesses como jornalista de dados/journocoder passa pela produção de “news applications” e os seus múltiplos propósitos. Um desses casos é, por exemplo, o trabalho “Simulador: com a Euribor a subir, faça as contas à subida da prestação da casa”, o “tracker” do custo de vida ou o trabalho que permitia aos leitores perceber como o aumento do custo dos combustíveis estava a pesar nas suas finanças. Estes trabalhos, baseados em dados, são, na minha opinião, exemplos de como podemos recorrer a números e bases de dados para oferecer aos leitores conteúdos relevantes e personalizados. A capacidade que o jornalismo de dados online tem para criar experiências únicas aos meus leitores continua, depois destes anos todos, a fascinar-me. Tenciono continuar a desenvolver mais trabalhos como estes.

Para além destes trabalhos, este ano explorei também o scrollytelling como estratégia narrativa para contar histórias. Estou convencido que o scrollytelling, quando combina dados e multimédia, tem a capacidade de contar histórias de forma criativa e eficiente, agarrando o leitor através de uma experiência que faz parte do nosso dia-a-dia: o simples scroll.

Ser um dos primeiros jornalistas de dados num país onde estes se podem contar pelos dedos da mão não foi uma tarefa fácil. Devo muito do que sei à comunidade de jornalistas de dados de todo o mundo, que sempre se mostraram disponíveis para partilhar o seu conhecimento. Também por isso, procuro, agora, devolver à comunidade aquilo que me deu. Tenho sido orador no Dataharvest, onde já fiz sessões sobre NLP com R, introdução ao desenvolvimento web e ao desenvolvimento de news applications com Svelte. Em Portugal, encontro-me neste momento a orientar um estágio em jornalismo de dados e preparo-me para leccionar a disciplina de jornalismo visual e de dados numa licenciatura.

Atenciosamente,

Rui Barros","1- [Com que programa eleitoral sairia para jantar?]
Com recurso a NLP (mas também muito trabalho manual) converti os programas eleitorais dos partidos portugueses numa matriz de concordância e discordância para produzir um “tinder clone” que permitia aos leitores conhecer um pouco melhor as propostas dos partidos.

2 - [Prometómetro]
Seleccionamos 150 medidas emblemáticas e relevantes do programa do terceiro executivo liderado por António Costa e, numa base mensal, vamos verificando o estado de cada uma dessas promessas. Fui autor da “news application”, tendo sido responsável pelo seu design, funcionalidades e implementação.

3 - [Travão ao alojamento local pode afectar quase 60% do mercado em Portugal]
Fui responsável pela recolha, via “web scraping”, dos dados do Registo Nacional de Turismo e consequente análise para perceber o possível impacto que um travão ao alojamento local teria no país.

4- [Profissionais de saúde já fizeram 9,9 milhões de horas extras no primeiro semestre deste ano]
Realizei a recolha e análise dos dados a partir do portal da transparência do SNS.

5 - [Simulador: com a Euribor a subir, faça as contas à subida da prestação da casa]

Japan,"Nikkei, Nikkei Asia",Big,Shortlist,,“Cities and Climate Crisis” series from Nikkei’s investigative reporting team,"Nikkei is Japan’s largest financial newspaper company with more than 820,000 paying subscribers for its online edition. A main focus of the investigative reporting team, formed in April 2021, is how global heating is affecting urban life. We gathered reporters who have extensive experience covering natural disasters, science and technology. They conceived the project's theme and framed the overall story.

The “Cities and Climate Crisis” series used multiple data techniques to analyze the reality of the climate crisis looming over densely populated areas. Through the effective use of graphs, images and maps, we examined strategies for protecting cities beyond a century from now.

We reported on how many airports in the world would be below the sea level if it rises by various amounts due to global heating. We mapped how major cities in Japan and abroad would be submerged and how many residents would be affected.

We analyzed the current status of airports and discussed the measures that should be taken to protect them. We also estimated the cost of countermeasures to protect infrastructure. 

In the project “Heat Island”, we looked at the relationship between the incidence of heat strokes in Japanese cities and the urbanization rate - a measure of the paved area covered by asphalt and concrete. 

We also investigated the threat of “megastorms” - rapidly developing low-pressure systems that can cause major disasters.

The projects explain complex processes using easy-to-understand data. We believe our work provides high-quality and useful information.

The projects involved many designers and engineers who worked to create visually appealing graphics. The designers sorted information and improved its appearance, while engineers created prototypes of interactive graphs and maps. The team prioritized giving the projects a consistent appearance, whether viewed on PCs, smartphones or other devices.","Our “Cities and Climate Crisis” series consists of four infographics.

1.Rising seas threaten world’s airports (available in English)

According to a Nikkei analysis of 5,014 airports around the world, 753 (15%) are located less than 10 meters above sea level. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that sea levels will rise by 1 meter by 2100 under a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions remain high. We used this estimate to conduct a simulation that found 35 airports would be below the sea level if it rose by one meter. 

2.‘Zero-meter zones’ expand globally as sea levels rise (available in English)

This project analyzed the impact of sea level rises on coastal cities in various regions, including Tokyo, Japan. The map shows the affected areas according to the degree of sea level rise. We also highlighted the flood control and evacuation measures envisioned for each area.

3.Heat Island: increased risk of heat stroke (Japanese only)

In this project, we addressed the “heat island” phenomenon in Japan: that temperatures are higher in urban areas than elsewhere. The work looked at the impact of temperature rises in major cities, focusing on numbers of heat stroke victims in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.

4.Threat of megastorms (available in English)

With the help of university researchers, we studied the increase of “bomb cyclones”: sudden drops in atmospheric pressure. We used data from the Japan Meteorological Agency to portray rapidly developing bomb cyclones in a three-dimensional time series. The project used recent trends in typhoon paths to show the increase in precipitation associated with the extreme weather.

Social media users responded very positively to the work and its innovative design. In November 2022, we won a Japan Typography Annual award from the Japan Typography Association.","Japanese, English",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-airports/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-airports/,https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-coastal-cities/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/sea-level-rise-and-coastal-cities/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/overheating-cities/,https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/cities-and-climate-crisis/threat-of-megastorms/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/cities-and-climate-crisis/threat-of-megastorms/,,,
Romania,Panorama,Small,Shortlist,,Edit Gyenge,"Traditionally, data visualization has been the domain of large newsrooms with large teams of journalists and designers. However, the rise of new technologies and the availability of open-source tools and platforms has made it possible for small and medium newsrooms to create high-quality visualizations with minimal resources and in a timely manner. This democratization of data visualization has enabled smaller newsrooms to compete with larger ones, by allowing them to tell stories that are just as compelling and engaging as those produced by larger organizations.

What I wanted in 2002 was to make data visualization as accessible to a large audience as I can.

2022 was a year of data visualization experiments and innovation, with over 50 infographics and over 5 major data interactive data visualization stories. I was able to try out a lot of new tools and techniques, and it was a great opportunity for me to learn and grow in this field. I used to think that the most important thing in data visualization was making sure the data was represented accurately, but I've learned that there's more to it than just using the right chart types. It's also important to consider the overall message being conveyed and to be creative about how to effectively communicate it. Sometimes, the story being told through the data might require going beyond traditional methods and finding new ways to present the information. You definitely have to keep in mind what will people feel when seeing your data visualization project. By the end of the year, one of my project was shortisted at the Information is Beautiful Awards and this was a huge step towards achieving my goal in 2022: to play a role in the data visualization democratization in my country and to empower and inspire others to use data visualization to tell their own stories and communicate their own insights.

I believe that by creating effective visualizations, we can contribute to the larger body of knowledge in the field and make it easier for others to understand complex data. This is something I strive to accomplish with every data visualization project I undertake.","My portfolio showcases a variety of data visualization projects, including interactive stories and infographics, that I have created with the goal of pushing the boundaries of what data can communicate. I strive to not only present data in an accurate and accessible way but also to find new and creative ways to tell stories and convey insights. 


**Project link 1: The demographic, political and economic power of generations**

A visual representation of the demographic, economic and political power of each generation in Romania, along with the opportunities and challenges they encountered in their lifetimes regarding human rights protection, urbanization, and economic development. This visual story traces back the factors that impacted the country's demographics and the reason why Generation X currently represents the largest age group in Romania. A large number of generation X representatives were born out of ""patriotic duty"". Decree 770 was enacted in 1966 to restrict abortion and contraception and was intended to create a new and large Romanian population. This visual story presents Romania's present political and business scenes and how younger generations fit in such a context, at what level are they represented in companies, and also national and local political assemblies.

**Project link 2: Mapping down Romania's healthcare system**
An interactive data visualization piece of 173 maps and 63 charts that present the country's health infrastructure (hospital, hospital beds, number of doctors) at a microregional level for each of the 41 counties. Also, for each county, there is a visual history of the evolution of the main causes of death in the past 30 years. Ischemic heart disease remains the main cause of death due to the lack of prophylaxis. This project was made in partnership with fellow journalist Claudia Spridon. 

**Project link 3: Fear of failure in Romanian entrepreneurship and why women fear it more than men**
In Romania, the fear of failure is a prevalent issue in the entrepreneurship landscape, with many individuals being hesitant to start their own business ventures. Research has shown that this fear is often greater among women than men. The aim of the project was to uncover the underlying reasons and explanations for why women may be more susceptible to this fear and how it affects their participation in the entrepreneurial field. The story breaks down the subject matter, analyzing various factors .

**Project link 4: Mapping exam results to understand the Romanian educational system**
An interactive data story about the Romanian educational system over the past 12 years. This story focuses on the various reforms and changes that have occurred in the education system during this time period, and how they have impacted the performance of students. The innovation in this particular story is the 3 granular maps representing school level exam results in 2 Romanian counties and the capital city.

**Project link 5: Global raw material supply**
A data visualization that presents the global distribution, across continents and countries, of minerals using the periodic table of elements. There is strong competition among producing countries such as China, Russia, and the US when it comes to minerals that enter international trade.

United States,The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists,Big,Shortlist,,The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ),"For nearly a decade data and technology have been a central part of ICIJ’s cross-border investigations. Throughout the years the team has developed tools that have made collaborations around the world possible and at the same time share and explore millions of records securely. In parallel, the organization has made data accessible to journalists in all continents and has driven analyses to help explore systemic global problems.

ICIJ started expanding its data work back in 2013 during the Offshore Leaks project. Since then, the team has grown and worked on development of tools, data analysis and research to address specific journalistic needs. The team has used open-source technologies to make large sets of files explorable and share them securely for projects like the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers and the Pandora Papers.

ICIJ’s tech team developed an open-source research tool known as Datashare that has been used since 2019 for various cross-border investigations. More recently, ICIJ has also developed another open-source tool called Prophecies to help with fact-checking and validation efforts. 

ICIJ believes that data can be a key connector for journalists around the world and makes it accessible to everyone working on a project. By doing so, journalists bring their best local knowledge and help connect the dots across borders. To facilitate this, ICIJ has also used graph databases (Neo4j and Linkurious) as part of the reporting process.

To coordinate its efforts and stay connected, ICIJ and media partners use a communication tool known as the Global I-Hub. This platform was inspired by the experience of the Offshore Leaks collaboration and an idea brought by ICIJ member Giannina Segnini.

ICIJ’s data and research team has used various approaches to address complex data problems. These include the use of programming languages, machine learning, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets as well as manual work. The team has worked on data validation, research, data gathering, data structuring, cleaning, analysis and fact-checking. The work has served journalists around the world who have worked together on different projects. It has helped explore topics systematically and driven some reporting efforts.

During its projects, ICIJ has also provided training to help understand how to best use its technologies for research.

For gathering data, journalists around the world have done thousands of freedom of information requests in projects such as the Implant Files, and explored public records. In the case of investigations that started with a leak, connecting the data with public records has been a central part of the work done by the team followed by traditional investigative reporting efforts done across borders.

ICIJ has also developed products to make data accessible to the audience, such as the Offshore Leaks database and the Medical Devices Database. The Offshore Leaks database contains information on more than 810,000 offshore entities from five different leaks.

ICIJ has been inspired by hundreds of partners around the world. Le Monde, Premières Lignes, Süddeutsche Zeitung, Buzzfeed News, The Guardian, have shared files with ICIJ and media partners that have triggered various global collaborations. SVT and Quartz AI Studio, have also contributed with data efforts.

In 2014 ICIJ established its first data unit comprised by three people: Mar Cabra, Matthew Caruana Galizia and Rigoberto Carvajal. The team has expanded since then.

In 2022 the ICIJ team working on data, research, technology and product included: Agustin Armendariz, Whitney Awanayah, Hamish Boland-Rudder, Jelena Cosic, Antonio Cucho Gamboa, Caroline Desprat, Emilia Díaz-Struck, Miguel Fiandor Gutiérrez, Marie Gillier, Jorge González, Karrie Kehoe, Javier Ladrón de Guevara, Soline Ledésert, Carolina Verónica López Cotán, Asraa Mustufa, Miriam Pensack, Delphine Reuter, Pierre Romera, Nicole Sadek, Bruno Thomas, Maxime Vanza Lutonda, Margot Williams.","2022 brought different data challenges to ICIJ. Throughout the year different projects worked in partnership with journalists and media from around the world involved working with different scale data sets as well as data gathering and analysis efforts. Some started with leaks, others with public records. The team also structured data, shared records, and analysis with journalists to help with the reporting process, using different tools and approaches.

Between January and May 2022 ICIJ incorporated data on people and companies behind more than 11,000 offshore companies, foundations, and trusts from the Pandora Papers to ICIJ’s Offshore Leaks Database. To be able to do so, the team conducted checks and validation on the data that was originally extracted from 11.9 million records using a variety of methods including machine learning, programming languages as well as manual extractions. The Offshore Leaks Database now has data on more than 810,000 offshore entities from five different leaks and connects with more than 200 countries and territories.

Together with the publication of the data, ICIJ conducted an analysis on the presence of Russian oligarchs and politicians in the Pandora Papers that was published as part of the Russia Archive project. 

Additionally, between February and December 2022, ICIJ worked on the Ericsson List that revealed that the Swedish-based multinational sought permission from Islamic State terrorists to work in an ISIS-controlled city in Iraq and paid to smuggle equipment into ISIS areas on a route known as the “Speedway.” ICIJ’s data team reviewed all the leaked documents to consolidate details of payments made by Ericsson and what constituted a breach of its own code of conduct to complement on-the-ground reporting. The team also reviewed public data on deferred prosecution agreements of the kind that Ericsson had negotiated while much of the corruption undercovered in Iraq was underway. ICIJ discovered that countries around the world had been adopting the use of such U.S.-style corporate leniency deals even as they had come under increasing criticism in the U.S. itself.

During July 2022 ICIJ, The Guardian and media partners published the Uber Files. The project started with more than 124,000 leaked records. Using Apache Tika, Python, Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel, ICIJ organized information on meetings, reviewed public records on lobbying and declaration of meeting schedules, to investigate how Uber stormed into markets around the world and how it deployed a phalanx of lobbyists to court prominent world leaders to influence legislation and help it avoid taxes. ICIJ had to parse countries’ varying lobbying and meeting-disclosure records, accounting for variations in the type of data available and its quality. It was key to confirm whether scheduled meetings referred to in the records took place or not, for which connecting the data with public records was central.

Datashare, an open-source research platform developed by ICIJ’s tech team was central to allow journalists to search and review the documents securely. As some of the emails were in French, the team developed a feature that converted the text to English. 

Between November and December 2022, ICIJ, ProPublica and media partners published the Shadow Diplomats that identified at least 500 current and former honorary consuls accused of crimes or embroiled in controversies, before, while or after they were appointed, including some caught exploiting their status for personal gain. ICIJ spent months requesting, collating and analyzing data on honorary consuls from all around the world, and created a first-of-its-kind index to analyze the transparency of countries and their honorary consul appointments

United States,Reuters,Big,Shortlist,,Reuters,"Reuters continues to tell their most important stories visually. Our projects follow a narrative driven expressly by visual journalism, whether that is innovative data gathering techniques, data-driven investigations, satellite journalism, explainer illustrations or immersive presentations.

Regardless of subject matter, project size, or reporting methods, data journalism plays a major role in delivering stories.

**Strong emphasis on project design**
Reuters pays careful consideration to the tone and subject matter as expressed through the design of the story. Reuters strives to forge a visual connection between audience and content before they have read a single word. The design and feel of each piece often reflect the tone and subject matter. This can be seen in across a range of our work. The project looking at the collapse of insects is a strong example of this.

**Making data understandable**
One of our missions is to make complex or difficult data sets easily digestible to tell stories. Design is a key component of making difficult data accessible. For example, our project explaining how Tonga was engulfed by lightning after the massive volcanic eruption combines huge amounts of data with clear explanations and animation to explain why it was one of the largest volcanic lightning events ever recorded.

**Innovation**
The Reuters Graphics team are continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information. One example of this is evident in our coverage of the sediment loss in the Mekong River. The team are constantly experimenting with striking ways to deliver our stories too. Take our series of projects on the major volcanic eruption in Tonga, for example, where the explosion cloud was reprojected, animated, and placed over major land masses to show its scale.

**Public service**
Getting timely information around the U.S. midterm elections and putting the mountain of statistics, voting information, and polling data in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. Our live results maps and dashboard were used by other media outlets around the world and read widely online. 

**Breaking news coverage**
When major news breaks, such as natural or unexpected disasters, colleagues from all aspects of the newsroom join forces to work with the graphics desk. Data, deep reporting and powerful presentation create insightful explainers that give the reader everything they need to know about an event in one place. Our project revealing how the Halloween crowd crush unfolded in Seoul, South Korea, is a prime example of this.

**Analyzing and contextualizing the news**
Beyond the real-time response to unfolding news events, the graphics team strives to keep in mind the bigger picture and possible follow-on effects to produce timely stand back pieces that investigate the wider impacts or potential directions of a story. The team’s ongoing coverage of the war in Ukraine is a prime example of this.

Our job is to tell stories, and to further understanding of the news. We believe data, design, and narrative need to connect with the reader to bridge this. Reuters strives for this balance in every piece of visual journalism we undertake.","**The collapse of insects**
The most diverse group of organisms on the planet are in trouble, with recent research suggesting insect populations are declining at an unprecedented rate. This piece combines data with vivid illustration to explain the importance of insects and why they are in decline. 

**The perfect storm: How Tonga was engulfed by lightning**
This data analysis shows why the volcanic lightning storm from the Tonga eruption was unlike anything on record. Reuters used data from a ground-based global lightning detection network to visualize the lightning activity during the eruption. The immersive animated storytelling helped put this storm into perspective and make this complicated information easy to digest.

**The war in Ukraine**
By early January 2022, the Kremlin had massed some 100,000 troops around Ukraine's borders in a preparation to invade. Reuters used satellite imagery to show the scale of Moscow’s logistical expansion along the border, measured how the Ukrainian defence forces compared to Russia’s military and outlined the likeliest routes Russian troops would take to occupy Ukraine. The project was one of the first to outline the likeliest scenarios for military invasion.

Then came the energy crisis. As tensions between Russia and the West deepened on the borders of Ukraine, Europe and Russia’s long interdependence on one another for energy had become a critical bargaining piece on both sides. Reuters published a data and map based project that clearly quantified Europe’s reliance on Russian gas and oil and the pipeline infrastructure that underpinned the alternatives available to Europe.

Then in the summer, we looked at how control had changed hands through the war. Nearly five months into what Russia had planned as a swift invasion, Ukraine had preserved its sovereignty and pushed back Russian forces in some areas. This report, based on data derived from satellite-images provided by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), as well as Reuters reporting from the ground, captures key moments on the road to the summer's military impasse.

**Stronger, faster, higher**
This data-driven explainer visualizes how North Korea’s missiles are going higher and further. The team turned trajectory data into an interactive 3D animation, walking the reader through one of the record-breaking launches. Further data analysis reveals the progress of Pyongyang’s missile program. 

**Why plants matter**
They are the foundation of life on Earth, providing food, medicine, building materials and clean air but across the world, plant species are disappearing fast. This story takes a closer look at the rate at which we are losing species and why they are harder to assess than mammals. Scientists have assessed the extinction risk of only about 15% of species. 

**Starving the Mekong**
An exclusive data analysis shows how dams in the upper Mekong River are holding back up to 80% of sediment that should flow through the 4,900km-long waterway, starving the delta in Vietnam of nutrient-rich, land stabilizing soil essential for farming. This graphics story brings together data visualization and on-the ground reporting to show how this phenomenon is gradually but irreversibly reshaping the lives of millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the river.

**Why Arctic fires are releasing more carbon than ever**
With climate change raising Arctic temperatures faster than the global average, wildfires are shifting poleward where the flames blaze through boreal forest and tundra and release vast amounts of greenhouse gases from the carbon-rich organic soil.

A Reuters analysis found that high-latitude wildfires were responsible for a greater share of total global fire emissions in 2021 than in any year since monitoring began in 2003, releasing nearly a third of last year’s total carbon emissions from wildfires.",English,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/INSECT-APOCALYPSE/egpbykdxjvq/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TONGA-VOLCANO/LIGHTNING/zgpomjdbypd/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/RUSSIA-UKRAINE/dwpkrkwkgvm/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/GAS/gdpzynlxovw/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/UKRAINE-CRISIS/CONTROL/gdpzygorxvw/,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES/TESTING/byvrllmjmve/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/PLANTS/jnpwyygywpw/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-ENVIRONMENT/MEKONG/egpbyyadnvq/index.html,https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/WILDFIRE-EMISSIONS/zjvqkrwmnvx/,
Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Shortlist,,Stephanie Adeline,"I am a journalist for The Straits Times digital graphics team. Since I joined the team in 2020, I have dedicated my time to understanding large, complicated datasets and presenting them through simple, comprehensible charts, maps and other creative visualisations.

My goal as a journalist is to detangle complex issues and explain them in a way that is accessible to our readers. In 2021, one of my focuses was visualising the urgency of climate action.

Since 2021, one of my areas of focus was visualising the impact of climate change and the urgency of climate action. In 2022, our team continued with the Climate Code Red series with three projects, two of which were led by me.

In July, I published a piece for Earth Overshoot Day. My goal for this piece was to explain the abstract concept of Overshoot Day in the simplest terms possible so that readers don’t feel overwhelmed, while also explaining the urgency that time is running out and we need to act now. This piece was one of our most viewed graphics this year.

Another project that was near and dear to my heart was a deep dive on the fashion supply chain and practices of greenwashing. This was a challenging story because it pushed me creatively to think of visual metaphors and an engaging way to explain a complicated process. After countless virtual meetings with experts and people working on the ground and virtual sketching sessions, we produced an interactive page that featured a stop-motion video and visualisation of the Fashion Transparency Index. This theme of transparency was reflected in the design of the page, including in the data visualisation. 

This year, I was also challenged to take on data projects on new topics that I’m not familiar with. I produced pre and post- analyses of the Malaysia elections, which involved a lot of sifting through a lot of election data, both current and historical. It was an unprecedented election and we were able to gain many insights from data in a relatively short time.

Throughout the year, I have led the team in many quick-turnaround breaking news reports, despite working remotely and being based in a different country than most of the team. This included the Russia-Ukraine war, the football tragedy in Indonesia, the crowd crush in Seoul and the landslide in Malaysia.

Going into my third year working as a data and visuals journalist, I continue to acquire new skills in my toolbelt. I am currently taking my Masters in visual tools with the University of Girona. Through the master’s program, I am advancing my skills in programming, statistics and data analysis. This year, I am hoping to further challenge myself creatively to make data more relatable to readers and to tell data stories with empathy.","1. Earth Overshoot Day: We're living like we have 1.75 Earths: Mankind is consuming way more natural resources than the planet can replenish each year.

United States,ProPublica and Partner Newsrooms,Big,Shortlist,,ProPublica and Partner Newsrooms,"With a team of nearly 150 journalists, ProPublica investigates a range of topics including government and politics, business, criminal justice, the environment, education, healthcare, immigration and technology. We focus on stories with the potential to spur real-world impact. Among other positive changes, our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws; reversals of harmful policies and practices; and accountability for leaders at local, state and national levels. A key element of our model is partnering with other newsrooms - from national nightly news broadcasts to legacy local newspapers to new regional nonprofits. Data journalism has been central to our newsroom from the beginning. In the 15 years since we first published we’ve grown enormously and, as evidenced by this portfolio, the amount and ambition of our data journalism has grown as well.","In 2022 our data journalism uncovered broken systems and policies, holding those in power to account:

* We detected dangerous concentrations of toxins in wild salmon, a staple of tribal diets in the Pacific Northwest, shedding light on the agencies and policies that are responsible for endangering tribal members’ way of life.

* We exposed how school officials exploited a loophole in Illinois law by working with police to fine students for violations like truancy and vaping. Our interactive database allowed parents and students to check how much it was happening in their district. Newsrooms across the state, including at least one high school newspaper, used the data to publish their own stories. Hours after the investigation’s first story was published, the state superintendent told schools to end the practice. 

We named every Fortune 500 company that provided financial support to election-denier members of Congress after Jan 6.

* We showed how for Black families in Phoenix, child welfare investigations are a constant threat. One in three Black children there faced a child welfare investigation over a five-year period. The office of the state’s incoming governor said it had read our work and wanted to take the agency in a new direction. She chose a new director of the state’s CPS department: a Black community advocate whom we had highlighted in our story. 

* We revealed that soldiers in the Army are more likely to be locked up ahead of trial for disobeying an officer or drug offenses than for sexual assault.

* We found that traffic cameras in Chicago disproportionately ticket Black and Latino motorists - a byproduct of the difference in urban design among neighborhoods.

* We tackled economic inequality from multiple angles: continuing our coverage of America’s broken tax system, documenting the scope of a predatory lending industry, and examining the long-lasting economic effects of the Hurricane Katrina rebuilding program.
 
A common thread in our entries this year: most of these projects used data that was difficult to obtain. Sometimes the data we needed didn’t exist; we spent weeks or months painstakingly compiling it ourselves. Our interactive database of roughly 12,000 tickets issued to students in Illinois is based on records requests from more than 500 school districts and police departments. For another project, we got sensitive data only available with an research proposal and approval from an institutional review board. Other times, we spent hours reporting out where to get not just any data, but the right data, and then used persistence, politeness and patience to get access. 

These projects are stellar examples of accountability data journalism, and we are proud to submit them for a Sigma Award.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-us-broke-promise-to-protect-fish-for-tribes,https://projects.propublica.org/illinois-school-police-tickets-fines/,https://www.propublica.org/article/for-black-families-in-phoenix-child-welfare-investigations-are-constant-threat,https://projects.propublica.org/americas-highest-incomes-and-taxes-revealed/,https://www.propublica.org/article/army-sexual-assault-alvarado-pretrial-confinement,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-louisiana-road-home-program-shortchanged-poor-residents,https://www.propublica.org/article/title-lenders-trap-georgia-residents-in-debt,https://projects.propublica.org/fortune-500-company-election-deniers-jan-6/,https://www.propublica.org/article/chicagos-race-neutral-traffic-cameras-ticket-black-and-latino-drivers-the-most,https://www.propublica.org/article/gallup-mckinley-schools-native-student-discipline
United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,Shortlist,,The Times and The Sunday Times Data Team,"The Times and The Sunday Times are two of the oldest newsbrands in the world, boasting about 437 years of journalistic history between them. Data has been a feature of our reporting for most of those years: back in 1860, The Sunday Times devoted most of a page to a grim yet fascinating chart from an insurance company, on the ages at which people in Britain were expected to die. 

Data has been part of our journalism for many decades – but in the past three years, it has become crucial to our reporting of the very biggest stories. The breadth of our portfolio bears witness to this, as does the strength of our data team. Now 10-strong, and made up of developers, reporters, designers and talented graduates, we cover everything from contextualising breaking news, to vital investigative journalism. 

We’ve shown that data-led and visual techniques can be turned to any topic. Covid and the Ukraine war have been important focuses for us this year – but the team has used clever and insightful visualisation techniques to explore everything from Eurovision to Formula 1. At the centre of our data journalism is the reader: how we help them to comprehend a topic, understand the truth behind a story, reassure or warn them about the future, or see where they fit into the wider context. This approach pays off: our journalism is frequently among the best-engaged of any other pieces on the site. 

While change at two two-centuries’ old newspapers can be a slow process, The Times and The Sunday Times are gaining a well-deserved reputation for concise, clear and timely data journalism.","Collaboration is key to our work. The team projects below have relied on a network of talented developers working to challenging deadlines, visualisation experts, and some of the best journalists in the country working in every field from health to sport, war reporting to climate science.

Helping our readers contextualise the Ukraine war was a challenge, particularly given unreliable data from both sides. In March we sought to explain why so many Russian soldiers were dying in Ukraine, and suggested it could be down to the size of the populations they were trying to subdue compared to the number of Russian troops. We also used scrollytelling to show how the present rate of attrition – worse than some of the 20th century’s bloodiest wars – was unsustainable. This piece had an average dwell-time of nearly seven-minutes, exceptional for a piece of its length and indicative of how visually engaging our readers found the storytelling.

In our reconstruction piece of the siege of Mariupol, we aimed to walk the reader through what happened, placing them at the location and recreating the destruction of the theatre by bringing together satellite maps, photography from the ground, drone video footage and case studies from those in the city. We used OpenStreetMap to build a 3D building layer of the city, and OSINT techniques to pinpoint key events and photographs.

From war to peace, our data journalism was utilised on a range of different topics in 2022 – including the Eurovision Song Contest. Our anallysis used Spotify’s API to log the attributes behind the most successful Eurovision songs of all time – and give countries a hint as to who might win. We used a combination of React components and Datawrapper charts to present the findings in an innovative and engaging way – including a few Times data team firsts, like what we can only term a “piano” chart. 

Last year was an outlier for a variety of different reasons, not least climate records, shattered in Britain and beyond. Our analysis allowed readers to learn where, why and how the UK recorded its hottest day on record, and what it meant for our warming nation. Readers told us that they loved playing with the interactive map sliders which showed – in no uncertain terms – how recent droughts had turned our countryside yellow. 

We have also used data to track some of the seismic political shifts that are happening in the UK. We used fresh polling data to see whether a United Ireland was indeed a likely prospect, as some forecasters have suggested after Sinn Fein became the largest party in Northern Ireland. Our subsequent work on the topic – including polling on young peoples’ awareness of the Troubles – dominated the Irish news agenda for several weeks afterwards.

Some of our slickest visual work tracked the most unusual topics: our depiction of the changes to F1 cars for the 2022 season involved the creation of a scrollytelling component to animate a 3D model, which has been reused for a variety of different uses since.

Our data journalism has also been used as the centrepiece to a number of key investigations in 2022. We used R to analyse more than 11,000 messages on the social media site Telegram, and found that antivaxxers were directing horrific abuse at health workers. At the end of the year, we turned our attention to the dire state of cancer care in Britain after the pandemic. We found that the average wait for cancer treatment had gone from 47 days in 2019, to 55 – which could make the difference between living or dying – resulting in an agenda-setting front-page story.",English,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/outnumbered-why-are-so-many-russian-troops-being-killed-in-ukraine-hhshp5jcr,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mariupol-documenting-a-medieval-siege-in-the-21st-century-9p7r8m68v,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/eurovision-2022-songs-analysis-p5d6gndsp,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/closer-racing-and-more-overtaking-inside-the-2022-car-3g0phg5xc,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/would-a-referendum-deliver-a-united-ireland-vmb78dwvg,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-is-the-uk-so-hot-climate-change-explained-in-maps-and-charts-qjl22c685,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kill-health-workers-antivax-campaigners-demand-in-telegram-chats-mk87kpcsd,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-is-britain-still-lagging-behind-on-cancer-care-02bzp3vg8,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-long-can-the-unions-afford-to-go-on-strike-26rkmdp26,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/america-s-battle-with-gun-violence-in-maps-and-charts-sjl083fcf
Indonesia,Narasi,Small,Shortlist,,Narasi,"Narasi was founded in 2018. It was founded by Najwa Shihab, a popular TV journalist in Indonesia. Our editorial staff consists of less than 35 people (small newsroom). Our reporting platform focuses on video reports.

Since three years ago, the investigation and data division was formed with three personnel: Aqwam F Hanifan (Producer - OSINT researcher), Arbi Sumandoyo (Field producer), Waheb (Video data-journalist)

Investigative reports in platform video using data and OSINT in Indonesia are very rare. We are trying to fill that void. In addition to extensive research, a creative approach needed so public understands the complex data. And we've done it successfully for the last three years. 

Some of our reports become public discussion. Among them dismantling the government's fake Covid-19 data by utilizing a leaked spreadsheet on the Ministry of Health's YouTube channel, exposing the perpetrators of a riot during an anti-government demonstration which turned out to be not a demonstrator by using an open CCTV, dismantling the placement of a new military post in Papua by using photos and videos of soldiers on social media etc.

As one of the countries with the highest internet users in the world, digital data information in Indonesia is quite abundant. That's why we are trying to popularize the use of a combination of traditional journalism with open source methods in various media, NGOs and campuses. 

We often collaborate with campuses, NGOs and other media in dismantling various cases of human rights violations, environmental damage, and disinformation on social media.

Our video-based investigation report requires us to present the clearest evidence possible. This is what makes us sometimes get threats from those who don't like us. Last year, our site was hacked and given a ""shut up or die"" threatening message. In addition, 30 of our staff's WhatsApp and Telegram accounts were hacked. This strong suspicion comes from the government, because the hack coincided with our report alluding to corruption cases within the state police and intelligence services.","1. This report was in collaboration with HRW. During the Covid-19 pandemic, and schools were closed, students were required to attend online school. The Indonesian government required students to use 6 EdTech applications. Using static and dynamic analysis, we found strong evidence that this child user data is being sold by applicators to advertising companies. Ironically, one of the apps selling the data to the ads is owned by the government.
2. We scraped hundreds of keywords selling wildlife on Facebook and found a local big seller who turned out to be affiliated with a Chinese middleman. We found the cage he used to keep the rare animal. We reported this finding to the police, unfortunately the police did not follow up on the findings of the Chinese intermediary. They only arrested the local people who were involved.
3. As the world's largest nickel producer, the Indonesian government has banned raw nickel exports. Nickel can be exported after being processed in a special smelter. We collected hundreds of business documents for nickel companies in Indonesia. The result is that 90 percent of nickel companies in Indonesia are owned by China. The problem is, this Chinese company is not environmentally friendly. We found a large company in Maluku that dumped nickel waste into the open sea. By analyzing satellite imagery combined with photos/videos of residents on social media, we can prove this allegation. This pollution makes it difficult for fishermen to find fish. and the fish also polluted. We collect data on fishermen's activities and fish movements. In conclusion, nickel pollution in the Halmahera Sea is very dangerous because the area is a national fish storage area. 
4. A police general kills his aide. Then he fabricated a case that he wasn't the culprit. One of the tricks was by releasing a CCTV to the public which was used as an alibi that when the murder occurred he was not at the crime scene. By analyzing the sunshade, we proved that the tape was engineered. The video displayed does not match the hours it should be.
5. This report aims to provide a detailed chronology of the Kanjuruhan incident that took place on October 1, 2022. We analyze thousands of videos from public sources and eyewitnesses. Based on our analysis, there were at least 80 projectiles of tear gas fired after football match Arema vs Persebaya ended, causing a loss 135 of lives. Horribly, the spectators were the main targets of the shots by the police. When everyone was trying to get out of the stadium in a state of panic, there was a large crowd at the exit, which exacerbated the situation. The disturbances and horror were caused by the tear gas deployed by the police.
6 We infiltrated and collected thousands of chats on telegram and monkey hater community forums for five months. There they traded sadistic content monkey torture. The monkey was tortured on request: burned, skinned, blended, etc. By analyzing one by one the sadistic content videos as well as a series of digital footprints in the form of social media and online financial transaction accounts from social media that we ""infiltrated"", we were able to track down several perpetrators in this network. This community moves underground in a coordinated manner through various online community platforms. The majority of customers this content come from United States and Europe, they seek supplies of this content from Third World countries. Indonesia is the largest supplier of sadistic content that violates the animal's right to life. We found the perpetrator in Indonesia and managed to drag him to prison.","English, Bahasa",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5AtwMKGc2o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hODangmzhas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oyoud99LfRs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH_hzuxxeW8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZYl4Jifzf4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOHRFIhF0Y8,,,,

Se trata de un medio de información generalista, con especial foco en la política, la economía y las finanzas. En su trayectoria, destaca por ser el primer medio español que decidió crear una sección de datos. Desde entonces, ha participado en investigaciones internacionales como los Panama Papers. Desde 2017 también forma parte de la primera red de periodismo de datos europea, la EDJNet.","Presentamos este portfolio de forma conjunta entre la sección de datos, formatos e internacional de El Confidencial. Este año, uno de los retos informativos ha sido cómo contar las cifras de la guerra entre Rusia y Ucrania. La falta de información fidedigna en muchos aspectos ha llevado a pensar en nuevas formas de contar el avance del conflicto, con los datos disponibles, pero mateniendo el rigor que caracteriza nuestro trabajo.

El primer reto fue intentar medir el arranque del conflicto a partir de los datos de las bajas. Para ello, nos preguntamos cuántos cuántos rusos estaban muriendo en Ucrania, a solo un mes del inicio del conflicto. Las cifras eran muy diferentes dependiendo de la fuente, por lo que creamos una visualización que permitiera explicar todos los posibles escenarios. Con una estimación cauta, mosotramos cómo el principio de esta guerra estaba siendo ""un desastre al ritmo de 20 afganistanes"". A través de un formato especial, con infografía y vídeos, pusimos en contexto las cifras del comienzo de la guerra en cuanto a las bajas tanto humanas como materiales, en comparación con otros conflictos. 

También al principio del conflicto, contamos cómo el conflicto se planteaba en un contexto de aislamiento de Rusia. Visualizamos en un formato especial qué paíse apoyaban a Putin y cuáles eran los posicionamientos internos de la población rusa. Como se ha hecho en otros medios de comunicación, en El Confidencial tambiénse ha llevado a cabo un gran esfuerzo por contar con mapas la evolución de la invasión.

En mayo, hicimos un repaso de los diez principales datos que explicaban la guerra, con infografías, mapas y vídeos para contar desde la destrucciones de las ciudades hasta los envíos de armamento.

Entre las publicaciones con mapas, destacamos un proyecto en el que dimensionamos a la escala española la invasión de Rusia a Ucrania, para acercar esta información a nuestro lector.",Español,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-03-24/cuantos-soldados-rusoshan-muerto-en-ucrania_3396744/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-03-05/guerra-ucrania-putin-elparia-mas-peligroso-mundo_3385522/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-05-09/una-factura-millonaria-y-la-destruccion-de-un-pais-10-datos-de-la-invasion-rusa-de-ucrania_3420013/,https://www.elconfidencial.com/mundo/2022-04-30/mapas-espana-ucraniaguerra-invasion-comparacion_3414873/,,,,,,
Germany,CORRECTIV,Small,Shortlist,,CORRECTIV.Klima,"CORRECTIV.Klima is a small team within the German non-profit investigative newsroom CORRECTIV. For the past year, we’ve covered (ground)water and other climate topics extensively in Germany. Whether it be suing the Government of a federal state to name the biggest commercial groundwater users or tediously collecting and analyzing data with the help of hydrogeologists, we have been adamantly reporting on the fate and well-being of Germany’s most precious resource – and providing local journalists around the country with the tools to do so, too.

At the heart of our research on water is the groundwater atlas. We were able to visualize for the first time how groundwater has developed since 1990. An overview that did not exist until our publications. For the first time, researchers, the public and, above all, those with political responsibility can now see in which regions are threatened by water scarcity.

We do not do this work alone. Collaboration with journalists, especially on the local level, is a key part of how we do our research. Whenever we do a data-driven investigation, we share our results with the over 1,500 local journalists who are part of the CORRECTIV.Lokal network. We do this through writing a “reporting recipe” for each investigation, a sort of how-to guide for covering topics like groundwater or extreme heat. The recipe details what data is available and how to interpret it, as well as possible angles and interesting regions. Oftentimes, the data comes from freedom of information requests or months of scraping and analyzing the disjointed systems maintained individually by Germany’s 16 federal states. We also field questions and consult directly with local reporters who may need help filing follow-up requests. We recently started offering expert-interviews ahead of publication as well. The final step is a joint publication that reaches readers on both the national and local level.

Our goal as a team is to not just produce journalism that holds governments and companies accountable for their impact on the environment, but also to make this reporting accessible to local journalists, who – like in many other news ecosystems around the world – often lack the proper time and resources to delve into complexer data stories. To meet this challenge, we also coordinate regular and free workshops for the local network. After all, change starts at the local level. In 2020, local journalists published over 150 articles in cooperation with the CORRECTIV.Klima team.

In the coming years, we hope to develop ourselves as a regular source for climate coverage for readers and local journalists alike. This means expanding our regular coverage by making use of sources like the Deutsche Wetterdienst, Germany’s national weather service and an expansive provider of monthly and daily climate data. With an eye on the summer months, we are planning to offer a regular data package focused on extreme heat, forest fires and drought on the regional level. At the same time, we also hope to continue to work on longer-term projects where we can dedicate time to collecting and analyzing data that is not easily accessible to the public.

Simon Wörpel, freelance data journalist","Throughout 2022, our team has published 3 data-driven investigations into groundwater in Germany. For the first of our publications, “Diese Unternehmen dürfen Wasser auf Jahrzehnte entnehmen”, we collected data on the biggest water users in each federal state – almost all large industrial operations.

As Germany starts to experience more summers ridden by extreme heat, drought and forest fires, the number of local conflicts is growing. This led us to investigate which of those conflicts go to court. We scraped and evaluated roughly 350 proceedings on water conflicts in the Juris legal database, which collects all judgments made available by German courts. Our sample shows a clear trend: In the past ten years, judicial conflicts over water have increased in 11 out of 16 German states compared to the previous ten years.

Our most recent investigation into groundwater took a more scientific approach. Over 10 months, we collected 32 years of data for every groundwater measuring station in Germany. 

The resulting publication was the first Germany-wide analysis of groundwater thus far. We found that during the drought years between 2018 and 2021, half of the over 6,600 evaluated measuring stations reached their lowest level in the last 32-years. In many areas, we have been able to demonstrate extreme trends for which industry and drinking water extraction are primarily responsible.

We also published the Groundwater Atlas, an interactive map that allows users – both readers and local journalists – to explore how groundwater levels have changed in their region, as well as to inspect the trends of individual measuring stations. The biggest challenge of this investigation was collecting and standardizing the data. Each federal state measures its own groundwater – sometimes several times per day, others once per month. The units of measurement also vary from state to state, as well as the coordinate systems used to map the measuring points.

After consulting with multiple hydrogeologists, we analyzed the data by first standardizing it and filtering for quality and completeness. For this step, we used a semi-automated process that highlighted points where water levels changed erratically. For example, if a monitoring well is replaced and the measurements are not recalibrated for the new elevation, it may seem that the water level suddenly rose. We manually reviewed the data for each monitoring station where such jumps were identified and removed the erroneous stations from our analysis.

We then used a monotonic trend analysis to test for long-term increasing or decreasing trends, and categorized the resulting measurements into three categories: strong trend, weak trend, or no trend. All of the data we collected, as well as the code and methodology for the analysis, are available for public use on GitHub.

The topic of water scarcity touches every individual and manages to make the complex and complicated climate crisis tangible. Our research makes it understandable that water can become scarce for every individual – also in Germany. Local journalists published over 40 stories across the country using the data from our analysis, and with their work bringing this important discussion even closer to the public.",German,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/kampf-um-wasser/2022/10/25/klimawandel-grundwasser-in-deutschland-sinkt/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/klimawandel/2022/06/14/klimawandel-konflikt-um-wasser-in-deutschland/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/kampf-um-wasser/2022/11/22/klimawandel-wasser-knapp-industrie-hat-jahrzehntelange-entnahmerechte/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/klimawandel/2022/11/02/grundwasser-atlas-lokal-welche-regionen-besonders-betroffen-sind/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/klimawandel/2022/06/24/wasser-verbrauch-unternehmen-private-haushalte/,https://correctiv.org/lokal/workshops/,https://correctiv.org/themen/klima/,https://github.com/correctiv/grundwasser-data,,
United States,"Associated Press, The Philadelphia Inquirer",Big,Participant,,Jasen Lo,"I’ve had the immense fortune to have been mentored by brilliant, patient editors in my one-and-a-half-year career as a data journalist, mainly because I did not have formal training as a journalist, let alone a computational one.

When I was an Asian American Journalist Voices fellow, Propublica’s Irena Hwang taught me the fundamentals of data reporting. During my time as an Associated Press intern, Justin Myers, Camille Fassett, and Angeliki Kastanis showed me how to apply rigor to my data reporting process and analyze datasets using insight gained from interviewing expert sources. Sam Morris and Dain Saint at The Philadelphia Inquirer helped me create interactive stories and maintain applications with front-end web development.

Thanks to the influences of all these mentors, I have become experienced with different tools and frameworks. A diverse skillset unlocks the ability to tell data stories in innovative ways. I look forward to building on my work last year by producing creative and rigorous work in 2023.","My portfolio includes work I helped create at the Associated Press and the Philadelphia Inquirer. 

I sourced, cleansed, and analyzed datasets during my internship at the Associated Press. I reported on national stories about the effects of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, climate change, and punitive electrical utility fees. 

On the interactive team at the Philadelphia Inquirer, I created interactive presentations on topics ranging from inflation, abortion rights, and Pennsylvania politics. I also maintained web applications like election trackers and one other to help Philadelphians access tax benefits.

Brazil,"Data Fixers (Brown Institute for Media Innovation), Fiquem Sabendo, OCCRP and Revista Piaui",Small,Participant,,datafixers.org,"Land grabbing is often linked to illegal deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest. Investigating these crimes in Brazil requires multiple databases spread among dozens of agencies and several government branches. Data is often delayed or even denied due to privacy laws. Data Fixers is getting and organizing these records, writing stories with them and helping news media around the world find their own environmental crime stories. The data is shared for free in two online platforms, Aleph, designed by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), and Google Pinpoint collections. A newsletter is sharing insights about the data in Portuguese. Data Fixers was the first Brazilian project to receive the prestigious Magic Grant from the Brown Institute for Media Innovation at Columbia and Stanford Universities. We received a US$ 100,000 grant to start this project and, since the beginning, in August, more than 80 stories have been published or republished based on our data, including cross border investigations on timber illegal trade between Brazil, US and Europe. Our work has been used by news outlets like The Washington Post, BBC, Al Jazeera, OCCRP and several Brazilian news organisations.","Data Fixers has been gathering public and private data to investigate environmental crimes. It involves environmental fines datasets, expired sanctions, seizures, indigenous people data, rural land property register (CAR), sanction lists, slave labour lists and many other datasets that you can see here. Most of it is being shared both in a Google Spreadsheet link and a Google Collab notebook so any person can check or change the code according to their needs.
Besides the data sharing we are also doing several investigative journalism projects. We would like to highlight two of these projects. The first is an investigative piece published at BBC and The Washington Post, both based on a dataset of environmental fines that have expired in Brazil due to lack of enforcement from the environmental agency (Ibama). We found that data through a FOIA request and then analysed it to find out that many deforestation drivers have found a way to skip these fines by using lawyers. The environmental agency doesn’t have people enough to enforce the fines so impunity has became a rule. The impact of our story was huge - the data we got was later used by the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), that is now asking Ibama to improve their fine process. The biggest tv station in Brazil, Globo, also published a story based on that report. The Washington Post version also used our dataset and revealed other angles from that problem. 
The second story is a 2-month cross border investigation about who are the smugglers behind illegal timber trade between Brazil, US and Europe to produce violin bows around the world. The government was trying to hide their names, but we developed a methodology where we have cross referenced small pieces of information from several government press releases with a dataset that contains names of sanctioned people and companies for environmental crimes. We developed a simple Python code to run those names and see what sanctions those people received. Then we sent several foia requests to get the reports and finally found the names of all the smugglers. It was a scandal- many are famous on that field and sell bows to stores around the world. The story had a good repercussion and we’ve been interviewed by a major tv show in Brazil to explain how we did the project.","English, Portuguese",https://datafixers.org/,https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/operation-do-re-mi-the-brazilian-bow-makers-under-investigation-for-dealing-in-endangered-wood,https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-62429583,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2022/brazil-amazon-deforestation-enforcement/,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/30/brazil-votes-bolsonaro-allies-stand-firm-in-amazon-bastion,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2022/dec/06/data-fixers-add-ons-case-study/,https://brown.columbia.edu/major-investigations-published-through-data-fixers-project/,,,

I hold two master's degrees - one in Data Journalism, at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism (New York), after being awarded a full scholarship, and the other in Public Administration and Government, at FGV-EAESP (São Paulo/Brazil), both with honors.

At Columbia, I'm currently leading a journalism project about environmental crimes in the Amazon Rainforest at the Brown Institute for Media Innovation, after being awarded a Magic Grant. This project has been used as source by news outlets like BBC, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post and several Brazilian organizations. 

I can report in Portuguese and English and work on local or cross-border projects.

Using programming languages, I can analyze huge databases and scrape thousands of web pages. I can also uncover public records with Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. 

I have been teaching data journalism techniques and public records to Brazilian students. Since 2018 I have taught more than 2,000 students and professional journalists in several workshops and lectures presented in more than 10 Brazilian states, Washington DC and Oxford (UK). In 2022 I taught in a masters program at Insper university. I also coordinate one of the most popular newsletters about public records in Brazil.","I have worked for a decade in major publications in Brazil and abroad, such as Estadão, TV Globo, CNN Brasil, Revista Piauí and OCCRP. During that time I received more than 10 journalistic awards, scholarships and fellowships.

I have also been coordinating and/or contributing to multiple projects that improve government transparency in my home country. I co-founded Fiquem Sabendo, a Brazilian NGO that fights to open public interest data. We've successfully released hundreds of public records used in over 2,000 stories by major Brazilian and international media (some examples are BBC, Mongabay, CNN, Deutsche Welle, El Pais, Folha de São Paulo, TV Globo and Estadão).

We doubled our team since last year and our work shapes transparency policies in our country. The next president's transition team is using our content to think about how to improve the freedom of information act in 2023 and recognized, in a public letter, that we're the only organization in Brazil that is monitoring the undue secrecy of public information in a systematic way. Fiquem Sabendo has become one of the most relevant sources to discuss public transparency and we give several interviews every year to the most relevant news media in Brazil to discuss open data and open government policies.","We are currently developing many projects to enhance data journalism in our country. We have a newsletter to release data and public records we received through FOIA requests. Hundreds of regional newspapers and national and international media outlets use the data and documents we find every year. Only in the first semester of this year, more than 600 articles have been published using as sources, including AFP, Deutsche Welle, BBC, Al Jazeera, Estadão, Globo, Metrópoles and others. Since we started, in 2019, more than 3,000 articles have been published with our content. Some of these stories resulted in investigationsm helped authorities sanction companies and made the government save millions in public funds.
We have created WikiLAI, a Wikipedia-format website where users can find everything they need to know about FOIA in Brazil, like how to send requests, how to get specific information in many different government agencies, how to overcome secrecy and how to appeal - https://wikilai.fiquemsabendo.com.br/
We have received a grant from Google News Initiative and developed, this year, a platform to monitor government authorities' schedules. To do that we have scraped hundreds of government websites and now we're working with machine learning to identify when the same authority is meeting specific companies, politicians, political parties, etc. This will be helpful in the future to monitor lobbies in Brazil.
We also have a legal team that has presented more than 10 bills in the Brazilian congress to improve FOIA legislation in 2022. For that work, we receive a traditional award from the Congress, Premio de Transparencia.
We also started working on investigative projects in partnership with other organizations such as Revista Piauí and OCCRP.

Trap Aggressor",Small,Participant,,Inna Popovych,"For 8 years, I was engaged in investigative journalism in the field of political corruption in Ukraine. 

After the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Russia on the territory of our country, I began to investigate the crimes committed by Russian soldiers in our country. In particular, to study the origin of the details of the weapons used by Russia in this war. I was able to investigate elements of European and American origin in the Iranian Shahed-136 drones and in the Russian Iskander missiles. Canadian and US authorities responded to these investigations. Internal investigations are currently underway in these countries. They are investigating how components produced in the United States and Canada could end up in Iran and Russia.

I also worked on documentaries in 2022. In particular, I collected information and eyewitness accounts about the Russian occupation of the Chernobyl zone. In another material, I recorded the testimony and reproduced data from the diary of a woman who survived three months of occupation in Mariupol.

I believe that Ukrainian journalists have done a lot of important work in this difficult year of 2022. We documented crimes, collected testimonies, recorded important interviews and cooperated with law enforcement investigators. I sincerely hope that our work was not in vain.","1. **""As if they kept a beast in a cage, and then let it out"": chronicles of the occupation of the Chernobyl zone** 
_Inna Popovych - journalist, screenwriter, author._

I filmed my material in the already de-occupied territory, that is, I did not have to deal directly with military actions. But our country lives in a constant state of caution.
- The Chernobyl zone is an object of increased protection. To make filming possible, I had to obtain many permits from various special services, approvals, draw up many documents and pass several checks. At this stage, we succeeded!
- Next, I recorded interviews with several people who survived the Russian occupation. Such interviews also require special preparation and caution (it is necessary to take into account the traumatic experience that these people have experienced).
- It was difficult to find and obtain surveillance video and operational footage taken directly by the military or special services, but we did it.

For almost three months, two women have been waiting for one body. For one it is the body of her son, for the other it is her husband. Natalya and Olya are the mother and wife of a soldier of the ""Azov"" regiment. Since 2015, he has been defending Ukraine. In the spring of 2022, together with other fighters, he defended Mariupol and Azovstal.

From the windows of her own house, Natalya Lepina saw bombs falling on Azovstal, a black mirage covering the horizon. She prayed, because she knew that her son was somewhere there, and she described her feelings in a diary. On April 15, all words lost their meaning.
""I live one day at a time. I don't even fear for my life. I do not care. Rashka broke my life. My environment. They're just beasts.""
Natalia knows strength. It passed ""filtration"", got out of the occupied hell and is waiting.

_Inna Popovych - journalist, screenwriter, author._

Three hundred Iranian kamikaze drones have attacked Ukraine since September. While the leadership of Iran continues to deny deliveries of ""mopeds"" to Russia, the occupiers launch them at energy facilities and civilian homes.

Ukrainian intelligence officers disassembled the Shahed-136 in detail and found out that almost all components, as in other Iranian drones, are of American or European origin. Some of these parts are not under export control, so they can easily be bought online. However, in order to supply others, the Iranian manufacturer of kamikaze drones had to make machinations and enlist the support of third countries to circumvent sanctions.","Ukrainian, English",https://youtu.be/wDm7hsL_578,https://youtu.be/L7Fd3mX8Ys0,https://youtu.be/5nO0k_o_IAA,,,,,,,
Nigeria,Nigerian Tribune,Big,Participant,,Ifedayo Ogunyemi,"As a journalist, fact checker and data journalism enthusiast with working experience dating back to 2014, my interest in the media was spiked by the knowledge and journalism resources that have equipped and helped me join others to change the society using the media to report on the various issues that affect the lives of people. 
 
My first exposure to journalism took place when as a young boy my father would pass on his favourite sports newspapers for me to read whenever he was done reading them daily. It also became a ritual for all members of the family to watch news programmes at that time. These actions inadvertently influenced my interests in journalism, how things work and how to solve the sector's problems, and my decision to become a newspaper journalist, my first biggest decision of my life.
 
As a result of this, I developed a deep interest in the media space and how it is being run. I prepared myself by working diligently as a campus journalist where I had the privilege to oversee and edit several campus publications and equally served as editor, vice president and president of my institution’s only press outfit whose job is to provide other students and members of the campus community with adequate and up-to-date information about academic events and happenings during my stay on campus. This and many others culminated in the award of the best campus press outfit in Nigeria the association received in 2018.
 
At present, I am a Senior Reporter with the oldest surviving newspaper in Nigeria, Nigerian Tribune where I create a variety of news content for immediate and scheduled publication for the consumption of a global audience both online and offline. This position offered me a great opportunity to carry out reporting projects for local and international organisations as part of efforts to shift perception towards a global pandemic and re-awaken Nigerian citizens’ attention to areas where corruption breeds among other social vices among others.
 
Despite my deep interests in print journalism, I carried out a data-based reporting project in 2020 which involved radio programme production with support from UK-based Internews to educate people about COVID-19 in the rural part of Oyo State, Nigeria while dispelling fake news that arose as a result of and during the pandemic.
 
The duties I completed during a global fellowship with the Solutions Journalism Network (SJN) in 2022 revolved around training and mentoring 15 campus journalists to expand and spread solutions journalism in West Africa.
 
As part of my drive to engage young persons like me, I equally mentored and supervised 20 campus journalists on the impact of environmental crimes in local communities during a project funded by the Environmental Reporting Collective (ERC). These are part of the many data-based projects I have carried out to support and help sharpen the focus of the media space in Nigeria.
 
I equally participated in a fact-checking fellowship during the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria; an agriculture-focused fellowship programme where I reported about challenges facing smallholder farmers in Oyo State and how they went on teaching each other about solutions that can improve farm yields and food security for the country as well as a data journalism fellowship focusing on deep-seated issues where I reported about the discrepancies in the database of the nation's digital identity scheme and the poor welfare of journalists during the pandemic.
 
While carrying out these projects and coupled with my interactions with people and sources on the ground, I was fascinated by how journalism can help change the lives of many people - one at a time.","Nigeria has continued to be plagued by insecurity and it didn't come off as a big surprise that a 2021 report by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a disaggregated data collection, analysis, and crisis mapping project on political violence and protest around the world, reported that abduction/forced disappearance events in Nigeria ""increased dramatically in 2020,"" while noting that banditry and kidnapping in Nigeria increased in 2020 by more than a 100% of the 2019 figures. 
The report and many other similar ones prompted the Federal Government to devise means to arrest the development by ordering the linkage of all Subscriber Identification Modules (SIM) cards with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) database. It added that the synchronisation will help the government identify crooks and provide a digital framework for improving security and strengthening the economy
The federal government thereafter on December 15, 2020, ordered the linkage of valid National Identification Numbers (NIN) to every SIM card registered in the country within two weeks and threatened the disconnection of unlinked SIMs. 
In fear of disconnection, Nigerians, including 25 million estimated to have at least one disability, besieged the enrolment centres and yet still experience sharp practices, extortion, neglect, prolonged waiting time and inhumane treatment etc. that characterise NIN enrolment at the NIMC centres nationwide.
During this period, their experiences were way worse than others because most of the public places where the enrolment centres are located are not disability-friendly.
It should be noted that abled-bodied Nigerians and most PWDs underwent the same process of enrolment in contradiction to the provisions of the Disabilities Act which caters for the right of access to public premises through the use of accessibility aids in public buildings. Most of the enrollment centres do not have these aids that help persons with disabilities. My report documented the experiences and lamentation of some PWDs who had to rely on unknown persons at the centre to fill out the enrollment forms, a development that is prone to errors. 
To document experiences of PWDs discriminated by design, l travelled around the six South-Western states of Nigeria - Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo and Ekiti - to see first-hand, how they register for the important national government-issued IDs. This immersive storytelling and data-based report took into account the challenges of PWDs while accessing the enrolment centers spread across the states.
While analysing the data on NIN enrollment for my first report, I realised there was a discrepancy as high as 7 million records in the numbers on the NIMC database. This prompted my second report which x-rayed the discrepancies in the periodic updates of the digital identity database commission. The analysis of the agency's data and subsequent findings did not go down well with the commission as it launched a personal and verbal attack on my person and my medium. This they did without denying or confirming my findings which was based on their periodic data release on NIN enrollment.
In my third instalment of reports on NIMC, I took a look at how feasible it was for the agency to complete and meet its target of enrolling all Nigerians as envisioned at inception or the 148 million Nigerians target stated as part of a $430 million World Bank loan facility secured under the Nigeria Digital Identification for Development (DI4D) project by June 2024.",English,https://tribuneonlineng.com/persons-with-disabilities-suffer-during-compulsory-nin-enrolment-nimc-personnel-facilities/,https://tribuneonlineng.com/did-nimc-lose-nin-records-of-7-9-million-nigerians/,https://tribuneonlineng.com/will-nimc-meet-148-million-nin-enrollment-target-by-2024/,https://tribuneonlineng.com/7-9-million-nin-records-not-missing-%E2%80%95-nimc/,,,,,,

I have travelled extensively in India covering investigative stories on gender, health, poverty, policies and politics. In 2020-21, my work focused on highlighting the human cost of Coronavirus in Small towns and rural India. In May 2020, I spent 25 days on the road covering India's two populous states---UP and Bihar. During this period, I filed more than 15 ground reports on the plight of migrants walking home, quarantine centers, deliveries on highways, migrants who died in road accidents, etc. In the months of April and May 2021, I spent more than 60 days in the thick of deadly second waves covering mass cremations, queues at testing centers, collapsed, health infrastructure, underreported covid deaths, inside the covid wards, etc. 

From August 2021 to December 2021, I again went to the deep pockets of the country to consistently report on the aftermath of the second covid wave. My ground dispatches focused on the gender gap in education, disrupted mid-day meals, drop-in institutional deliveries, suicides, mental health, etc.
 
The pandemic years brought to the surface-- the social and economic injustice, apathy, intolerance, and deep-seated, systemic patriarchy again. It has shaken us out of the complacency that three decades of impressive GDP growth, urban boom, and global clout had lulled us into. It reinforced the unsettling idea that our nation-building and modernity project is still fragile. 

I view my work and mission as a woman journalist as one making a critical intervention in this national journey.","The human cost of India's biggest defence reforms:

China,南方财经全媒体集团，21世纪经济报道,Big,Participant,,南财金种子企业数据库及数据分析报道,"我自2005年从南开大学毕业后就开始从事新闻，至今已有17年。2005年到2015年，我在《21世纪经济报道》做了10年的记者、其中2008年到2009年的两年里担任南方都市报驻香港记者；随后2016年，我进入21世纪经济报道担任资深编辑。自2020年开始，《21世纪经济报道》及其母公司南方财经全媒体集团（Southern Finance Omnimedia Group）探索转型，试图成为“中国的彭博社”，既提供新闻也提供数据。在此背景下，我也在新闻采编的基础上做复合转型，我既是记者，也是数据库产品经理，同时还是研究员。
作为数据产品经理，我带领技术人员，经过近两年的努力，在2022年建成了一个名为“南财金种子企业产业数据库”的数据库，该数据库聚焦中国高科技中小企业。目前在库企业10万多家。企业数据有100多个数据维度，产业数据涵盖国内企业、国际巨头、产业链、行业人物、产业研究及资讯等多个方面。数据库保持更新，全面监测企业上市退市、税务司法、经营搬迁等成长动态，跟踪中国高科技中小企业的成长。
作为记者，我利用技术手段挖掘该数据库，做深入的数据分析，并跟新闻采访相结合，撰写数据新闻和深度报道。同时，该数据库对南方财经全媒体集团的所有采编人员开放，为他们提供数据，支撑我们的更多报道。
作为研究员，我要利用这个数据库，同时结合对高科技企业和行业的实地采访调研，深入研究中国科技企业的发展情况、问题和挑战。就此，2021年底，我撰写完成并发布了一篇深度报告；2022年的报告因中国国内疫情原因有所滞后，也在进行当中。","这个作品集是基于我做的“南财金种子企业产业数据库”并以我为主要作者、在2022年发表的多篇报道。作品集包括三类报道：
第一类是南财金种子企业产业库报告，也就是针对该数据库的数据更新变化情况而做的数据分析报道，如链接1、链接2和链接3，作者都是我。报道内容包括中国各省高科技企业的数量和质量变化、企业退市及上市的数量变化和趋势、科技企业面临的经营风险情况等。做这类报道的挑战在于数据要准确：首先数据库的数据需要不断清洗、去除芜杂和错乱数据，得到干净无误的数据。其次，再运用EXCEL工具进行各种比较和统计分析，这个过程中分析逻辑和计算也必须准确。一旦发现一处错了，就得推倒重来。为此我每写一篇报道，都要做数十张EXCEL表、统计分析到深夜乃至凌晨。
第二类是运用数据库的存量数据，利用视觉化工具，做的数据可视化报道，如链接4，我是报道的策划和数据支持。这类报道的关键是根据主题，从数据库中选取合适的数据，并跟视觉编辑讨论，设计出最适宜表现的形式。
第三类是运用数据库的数据，针对一个地区如深圳市的高科技企业整体情况，来做的区域经济报道，报道的作者是深圳站记者，我提供数据支持。如链接4和链接5。这类报道的挑战在于，要针对采编的需求，给他们提供现成的统计结果，为此我要对数据库的原始数据做进一步加工，有时还要把“南财金种子企业产业数据库”的数据与其它来源如WIND数据相结合，一起提供给写报道的记者。
21世纪经济报道的读者是中国收入较高、知识层次也较高的中高端人群，在这些读者中，上述三类数据新闻着重影响的是关注中国高科技企业发展的政府、投融资机构和高科技企业经营者。由于该数据库以及基于数据库所做的出色报道，南方电网开始跟我们合作，进一步充实高科技企业的用电数据；同时粤港澳大湾区的多家科技企业们也积极向我们反馈他们对于政策和营商环境的意见和建议。",Chinese,https://m.21jingji.com/article/20220114/herald/6acbb2ebf23fb04bacdecc18b2884ebc.html,https://m.21jingji.com/article/20220531/herald/8514cbda121c9caf989d99e083227547.html,https://m.21jingji.com/article/20220601/herald/73ca2832400a0693e2ff089736c37259.html,https://app.21jingji.com/h5/2022/06_nansha/#/,https://m.21jingji.com/article/20220624/herald/2ddfc7f4c7c717954a1c90d1285e4dcf.html,https://m.21jingji.com/article/20220830/herald/9669015cf123dffb0ec58ab154d42067.html,,,,
Kazakhstan,"Центральноазиатское бюро аналитической журналистики Cabar.asia (здесь публиковалась под псевдонимом Инна Чернышевская), независимое деловое информационное издание Казахстана ""Курсив"" (публиковалась под именем Ирина Осипова).",Small,Participant,,Ирина Осипова,"Добрый день. Меня зовут Ирина Осипова, я независимый журналист из Казахстана. В журналистике работаю со студенческой скамьи, общий стаж работы 17 лет. Последние четыре года активно внедряю в работу инструменты data-журналистики. Почему мне стало интересно это направление? С развитием цифровых технологий журналистика сильно изменилась. В ней слишком много стало фейков, мнений и разговоров на ту или иную тему. Это не плохо и не хорошо. Но этот человеческий фактор акцентировал внимание на том, что должно быть главным в любом журналистском материале, а именно фактах. В первую очередь именно факты, цифры должны быть во главе, их можно интерпретировать, по-разному ""читать"", но исказить - нет. Это главная задача Data-журналистики.
Поэтому когда базы данных стали доступны и открыты, мне стало очень интересно заниматься анализом цифр. Появился азарт. Каждое исследование стало своеобразным поиском клада. Источниками вдохновения для меня были события, происходящие в Казахстане и мире. Ведь цифры должны ""работать"" на актуальные события.
Мне бы очень хотелось продолжать развиваться именно в этом направлении. На мой взгляд, журналистика данных - это журналистика будущего.","В портфолио собраны материалы, которые я готовила после начала конфликта на Украине. Главный вопрос, на который я искала ответ - как этот геополитический кризис повлиял на те или иные стороны экономики Казахстана в частности и Центральной Азии в целом.
В материале ""Как изменилась взаимная торговля Центральной Азии с Украиной и Россией?"", опубликованном на портале Центральноазиатского бюро аналитической журналистики, data-данные о динамике взаимной торговли стран ЦА с Россией и Украиной помогли понять, насколько сильно государства Центральной Азии зависят от РФ, а экспертный комментарий независимого политолога дополнил материал оценками и прогнозами.
В материале ""Казахстан многократно увеличил реэкспорт товаров в Россию"", опубликованном на портале делового экономического издания ""Курсив"", главной целью было выявить тенденцию, которой раньше не было и понять, как она может повлиять на Казахстан.
Тема рынка труда Казахстана после 24 февраля тоже стало важной для профессиональных исследований, так как она показала влияние релокации российских специалистов в РК.

El Salvador,"El Diario de Hoy, elsalvador.com, International Women's Media Fundation (IWMF), Internews, Observatorio Universitario de Derechos Humanos (OUDH), Mirella Cáceres, Lissette Lemus",Small,Participant,,Lilian Martínez,"Lilian Martínez ha sido periodista 22 años. Inició en elfaro.net en 1998, donde escribió sus primeras notas periodísticas y corrigió textos y actualó el html del sitio cada fin de semana. Ella cree que esa experiencia quizá influyó en que haya tenido siempre interés en producir reportajes no solamente pensando en la edición impresa, sino también en cómo presentarlos en la web.
En el año 2001, se unió a la redacción de El Diario de Hoy, donde escribió reportajes en las revistas Planeta Alternativo (dirigida a adolescentes y jóvenes) y Vértice (periodismo de profundidad).
Luego formó parte de las secciones de Investigaciones, Política y, finalmente, Servicios. Ahí escribió reportajes y notas diarias sobre medio ambiente, educación, salud pública, transporte, derechos de la niñez y migración.
Para 2015, Lilian había caído en la rutina. Pero navegando en Internet, supo que había una organización llamada Chicas Poderosas que había dado capacitaciones de periodismo de datos en Costa Rica e incluso en El Salvador, sin que ella se hubiera enterado. Ella había recibido el Mooc ""Matemáticas para periodistas"", impartido por Sandra Crucianelli a través del Knight Center for Jornalism y quería aprender más.
Se puso en contacto con Mariana Santos, fundadora de Chicas Poderosas, preguntando si habría más capacitaciones y Mariana la invitó a un summit para embajadoras de la organización en Stanford. Ese encuentro con decenas de mujeres periodistas, mentoras y mentores como Scott Klein (ProPublica) dio un giro a la carrera de Lilian. 
En agosto de 2016, junto a las periodistas Karla Arévalo, Xenia González Oliva y el ingeniero Carlos Palomo, integró la Unidad de Datos de El Diario de Hoy: Focus Data. Ahí, como editora, lideró al equipo en la producción de diversos proyectos; dos de los cuales entraron en la lista corta de ediciones anteriores de los Sigma Awards: ""Homicidio, la principal causa de muerte de los cuerpos repatriados a El Salvador"" (https://historico.eldiariodehoy.com/historico-edh/101226/homicidio-la-principal-causa-de-muerte-de-los-cuerpos-repatriados.html), de la periodista Xenia González, y el proyecto multimedia ""Rostros y voces del conflicto"" (https://rostrosyvocesdelconflicto.elsalvador.com/), en el que participó no solo la Unidad de Datos, sino también colegas de las áreas de Multimedia, Fotografía y Diseño Web de El Diario de Hoy.
A finales de 2021, Lilian fue becaria de la International Women's Media Fundation (IWMF), como parte de su Iniciativa global de reportajes sobre la salud: vacunas e inmunización en América Latina y el Caribe. Gracias a ello, investigó la aceptación o no del a vacunación anticovid entre la población indígena de El Salvador, un país donde además de la primera y segunda dosis, el Ministerio de Salud ofreció un primer y segundo refuerzo. La investigación contó con la tutoría de la periodista y comunidadora de ciencia Aleida Rueda, y se llevó a cabo entre los meses de enero y marzo de 2022.
En ese lapso, la Unidad de Datos de El Diario de Hoy fue disuelta y Lilian pasó a formar parte de la sección de Sucesos: justocuando en El Salvador se instauró un régimen de excepción que ha sido prorrogado 9 veces y que sigue vigente a la fecha (6 de enero de 2023).
Desde Sucesos, sección de cobertura diaria, continuó solicitando datos para poner en contexto lo que estaba ocurriendo durante los primeros meses del régimen de excepción: el crecimiento de la población y del hacinamiento en las cárceles, y las muertes ocurridas dentro de esos recintos. Dos temas que desde entonces llamaron la atención de las personas defensoras de derechos humanos y de organismos internacionales como la CIDH.
El 28 de septiembre, Lilian dejó El Diario de Hoy e inició una nueva experiencia en el área de alfabetización mediática.","El primer reportaje presentado ""Mined reparó la mitad de escuelas que lo dicho por exministra"" se hizo en el marco del proyecto CADRE de Internews, una iniciativa para formar a periodistas y editores de El Salvador en el uso de herramientas de Fact Checking y en la elaboración de reportajes que verificaran el discurso de los funcionarios y/o personajes públicos. El reportaje fue editado por el colega Mario Beltrán, editor de la revista digital Gato Encerrado, y se basó en datos e información solicitada al Ministerio de Educación, luego que la ya para entonces exministra dijera que durante los primeros 18 meses de su gestión habían sido reparadas más de 2,000 escuelas.
El segundo reportaje ""Indígenas en El Salvador, su mirada ante la vacunas anticovid"" se hizo gracias al apoyo de la International Women's Media Fundation (IWMF). La investigación contó con la tutoría de la periodista y comunidadora de ciencia Aleida Rueda, y se llevó a cabo entre los meses de enero y marzo de 2022. La mayor dificultad para llevarlo a cabo fue la falta de datos oficiales desagregados por municipio, edad, género y etnia. Por lo que hubo que recurrir a la técnica ""bola de nieve"" y a un sondeo estadísticamente no representativos entre 25 líderes y personas indígenas en distintos puntos del país: Izalco, Panchimalco, Nahuizalco, Cacaopera y Guatajiagua.
Los siguientes reportajes se hicieron cuando la Unidad de Datos de El Diario de Hoy ya había sido disuelta. Corresponden a investigaciones relacionadas con el régimen de excepción y en medio del ritmo de la cobertura diaria.
""Medicina Legal no identificó 27 cuerpos hallados en colonia donde vivía expolicía en Chalchapa"", se refiere a que la mayoría de cuerpos encontrados en fosas comunes dentro y en los alrededores de la casa de unexpolicía no habían sido identificados por la autoridades. El caso conmocionó al país cuando se conoció. La Policía y Fiscalía restringieron la información. Por lo que para esta nota se solicitaron y usaron datos del Instituto de Medicina Legal. La no identificación de cuerpos resulta indignante para muchos en un país donde cientos de familias buscan a sus desaparecidos.
""¿En qué municipios ocurrieron los 88 homicidios del 25 al 27 de marzo?"", intenta dar luz sobre lo ocurrido esos días, pues la racha de homicidios fue el argumento con el que la Asamblea Legislativa estableció el régimen de excepción en todo el país, y no solo en los sitios donde ocurrió la mayoría dehomicidios. En este caso, el texto estuvo a cargo de la periodista Lisette Lemus y la recopilación de datos, limpieza, análisis y visualización de datos a cargo de Lilian Martínez.
""Gobierno duplica la población carcelaria en dos meses"" reveló cómo de marzo a mayo el número de personas recluídas en las cárceles, condenadas o no, se había duplicado como resultado de los miles de arrestos durante el régimen de excepción.

United Kingdom,https://shado-mag.com/,Small,Participant,,shado mag CIC,"shado is a lived-experience led community of artists, activists and journalists united in the fight for social change. We believe those with lived experience of an issue or injustice are best placed to advocate for meaningful change within that space.

shado exists to disrupt, diversify and decolonise the current media landscape through amplifying the voices of people on the frontline of social change. We do this through connecting journalists, activists and artists across borders through collaboration.

We work with a community of over 300 artists, activists and journalists in 56 countries around the world to spotlight necessary and innovative stories – promoting our mission of decolonising and demystifying some of the most important issues of our lifetime.

The topics we cover include: climate justice, class, migration, intersectional feminism, racial justice and LGBTQI+ rights. 

The journalists we commission are often misrepresented and excluded from mainstream media newsrooms. They are majority BIPOC and include frontline activists in the Global South, Indigenous land defenders, refugees and people seeking asylum. We believe storytelling is key to changing perspectives, providing education, creating change and confronting injustices within our society.

shado was launched in 2019 by its two co-founders, who were frustrated by the top-down and siloed nature of global reportage and the lack of space for those with lived experience of global issues to tell their own stories. So, they strove to create a grassroots platform which put lived experience storytelling at the helm, and which connected artists, activists, journalists across their separate fields. This community continues to grow and drives shado to continue working to build radical (re)imagination, meaningful action and hope for a better future. 

The co-founders have first-hand experience of working with historically minoritised communities to produce creative writing. Examples include: a young person entering university from a family experiencing homelessness who wrote about the role of creativity in aiding her mental health, and a Malawian community organiser and migrants’ rights campaigner who wrote about the importance of healing for refugee communities and how the current hostile environment is re-traumatising people.

shado’s co-founders have significant ongoing experience working with so-called ‘vulnerable’ communities of refugees and people seeking asylum, from grassroots work in Northern France to creative workshops in the UK. This has also most recently included an online shado series for Refugee Week where the co-founders produced and managed a series of articles by first time writers and creatives who were of refugee or asylum seeking status. 
 
shado’s co-founders also have extensive experience working with Indigenous groups and land defenders. They are currently leading a collaboration with the farmer-led food sovereignty advocacy organisation A Growing Culture on a series titled Land Defenders, working with frontline farmers and activists to spotlight the issues facing frontline land defenders and the resistance movements they are building. In the reporting of issues related to the climate crisis, there is a lack of representation of BIPOC and frontline Indigenous communities – shado’s work exists to disrupt this.","shado is a network of creative writers and artists from 56 countries around the world. The makeup of the creatives shado work with and support is 71% BIPOC and 85% female or non-binary identifying; first-time writers from historically underserved communities who write about social justice including: 

- Refugees and people seeking asylum
- Youth
- Working class communities
- LGBTQI+ folk
- MAPA communities

All content across shado’s platform and different mediums is overseen, commissioned, edited and published by shado’s co-founders. This is true of the 10 articles within this portfolio.

All the communities we work with are often under- or mis-represented in the mainstream. Our work at shado aims to decolonise and democratise access to and representation of creatives in arts and media spaces and to put money back into the communities who need it the most.

By commissioning those with lived experience and publishing nuanced stories often excluded in the mainstream, we aim to create a “trickle up” process of culture-led system change to disrupt power imbalances in the coverage of global issues. 

The reoccuring challenge we find in our work is finding the appropriate journalist to write on social justice topics from a lived experience perspective; someone who is able to include both qualitative and quantitative data. We overcome this through extensive outreach and targeted research to commission appropriate journalists, writers and activists working in relation to the specific topics.

The need for the platform can be seen below in testimonies from writers:

""It was a pleasure to work with shado magazine. I found the shado team to be incredibly supportive. shado is incredible and it gives writers like myself a platform to have our voices heard. For people like myself (a Zimbabwean former asylum seeker), there are very little opportunities for us to do so. I hope to work with them again in the future.""
Refugee activist from Zimbabwe

""Being featured on shado gladdens my heart so much because Queer African kids won’t have to look for representation in the West anymore. We are here, with them, in this struggle.""
Queer Nigerian activist and writer

""Working with the shado team has been an utter pleasure. The team shares a way of working rooted within inclusivity, understanding and knowledge sharing. Editors held a strong understanding of the reader and writers perspective, as well as of a range of social justice issues. shado is undoubtedly one of the best places to develop your editorial skills.""
British South Asian researcher, activist and writer

'I’ve learnt more from shado than I have from anything else. Feminism, environmental justice, human rights, cultural justice, mental health and so much more.""

United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,Participant,,Tom Calver,"Who will win the next election? How many people really have long Covid? Which age group has the most money? Is our welfare system fair? In these fractured and polarised times, responsible use of data can help us cut through political spin and give balanced, considered answers to questions like these. 

I’ve been in data journalism for nearly seven years, and I’ve loved seeing it grow from a niche expertise on the periphery of the newsroom to one of journalism’s most important skills. 

I started my career at Which? magazine and BBC News. Now, as Data Editor at The Times and The Sunday Times, I co-manage a team of journalists covering everything from daily charts to bespoke interactive projects. I also write weekly data features for the Sunday paper, some of which I’ve submitted below.

Like most journalists, 2020 and 2021 were largely spent researching, visualising and writing about Covid, yet I am a generalist at heart: last year I was lucky enough to write about everything from intra-age wealth inequality to the threat foreign states pose to our network of undersea cables. Whatever the topic, succinct use of data can provide our readers with insight, context and balance. Our efforts are rewarded: our data-led pieces are often the most well-engaged with each week.

The late Sir Harold Evans, editor of the Sunday Times, said of his journalism, “all I tried to do… was to shed a little light.” The skills may have changed, but the aim remains the same: data shines a spotlight on the world by revealing patterns that some would rather be kept hidden. 

My team and I are lucky to have the backing of some of Fleet Street’s best editors – many of them who have been in journalism for decades – who have helped data journalism at The Times and The Sunday Times to flourish.","Each of these data-led features do slightly different things, which hopefully speaks to many of the different ways that data journalism is integral to the modern newsroom.

One way is holding the powerful to account. When the then home secretary said that too many people were on benefits when they could be working, I wrote a data-led feature showing how more than 40 per cent of those on benefits were actually in-work; pay in Britain, at the lower end, is simply too low to live without support. 

Another use of data journalism is explaining difficult concepts. Using vaccine efficacy data from various sources, I used data on deaths to reverse-engineer a model for how many people could have died if Covid vaccines had not been discovered and we had behaved as we did. The results showed that more than 200,000 extra people could have been killed.

Data journalism can be a powerful weapon in calling our inaccuracies. When a misleading claim circulated on social media that just 17,000 people in Britain had died of Covid, I used data to robustly refute the misleading claims – but also explain the challenges of counting Covid deaths to begin with. There are some things that data cannot measure accurately.

Data can also harness the power of visualisation to teach readers something new. When the Nord Stream pipeline was mysteriously severed, attention turned to whether foreign states could sabotage Britain’s network of undersea cables and pipelines. Working with three other members of the team, we produced a map-based scrollable interactive to explore the UK’s subterranean threats.

Data journalism is about the reader – quite literally, in this case. Teaming up with our developer Michael Keith, we built an inflation calculator where the reader could enter their own personal situation – whether they drove, drank alcohol, had children – and get an approximate personalised inflation rate. 

And finally, it can also answer challenging questions. Whether about the state of our health system – my feature on GPs made the front of the Sunday Times last Summer – or the nature of modern politics, data gives us the tools to keep tabs on the seismic shifts that have happened to our society over the past three years.",English,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-real-state-of-welfare-unpicking-the-lives-of-britains-nine-million-claimants-f0hgmpc3f,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/without-covid-vaccines-the-uk-could-have-had-another-200-000-deaths-fh78sntc8,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-women-became-more-left-wing-than-men-zp0tz023n,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/what-is-the-uks-true-covid-death-toll-lzpb0xnqs,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/what-do-labour-need-to-do-to-win-a-general-election-292k9gwl6,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/is-this-the-end-of-the-full-time-family-doctor-tvffppcnm,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/long-covid-the-nightmare-a-million-of-us-still-cant-shake-off-52hghqn5z,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tories-dont-dare-pinch-pensions-but-even-the-old-are-starting-to-think-they-should-90b7nmld9,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-we-rely-on-a-fragile-network-of-undersea-cables-6k9n8nrgr,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/personal-inflation-rate-calculator-gmlpg6d9f

Nigeria,"WikkiTimes, Sahara Reporter, The Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR)",Small,Participant,,Yakubu Mohammed,"Dear Jury,

It is my pleasure to express my interest in the 2023 Sigma Awards: Young Journalist category. I am an investigative and data journalist with WikkiTimes, a Bauchi-based investigative platform in Nigeria. For my medium, I have authored a number of accountability and data-driven stories that produced impacts in notable manners. 

With reference to my journalism career starting as a campus journalist, I have over the years improved my journalistic writing with many of my works published with daring investigative platforms. However, I believe data stories are beyond graphics. They are stories, with rigorous efforts, pulled out from open source data on various platforms.

As a young passion-driven young reporter, I am confident in my ability to use data and tell some stories that hold power to account.

Using journalism that matters (data-driven journalism) to advocate for a sane democratic and transparent society, I believe many of the pieces I am submitting meet the criteria of what data journalism that holds power to account entails.


I’m looking forward to your considerable response. Thank you!

Sincerely,

Yakubu Mohammed","**Bauchi-Gombe Road: In Questionable, Shoddy Execution, FG Wasted Over N1bn In Emergency Repairs, Road Still Death Trap**

This is a data-driven story that exposed how the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, in a clear indication tactically siphoned money meant for contruction of Bauchi-Gombe road in Nigeria's North East, by awarding contradicts to companies that do not have the experise of road constrcution. Some of them are oil companies while some could not be traced.

The road was awarded at varying times between 2018 and 2021. It was awarded to 10 different companies, some of which were even not unfit for the jobs — thus prompting suspicion of misappropriation and embezzlement of public funds. 

Data obatined from Govespend totaled the money expended on the road around N928,461,482 million.

However, some few qualified companies who mobilised workers to the highway also did substandard job as some portions of the road keep failing --a situation that justifiably creates rooms for unchecked corporate heist.

Following the publication, a subsidiary of the ministry, Federal Roads Maintenance Agency (FERMA) took over the road and rehabilitated some failed sections.

**Bauchi govt spends above N21 Billion on ‘Security Votes’ within 18 months amid rising killings, kidnappings**

In this data-driven investigation which I ghostly co-aurthored [for security reasons], we chronicled how the Bauchi State government spent billions of naira in what he tagged as 'secuirty votes' to contain worsening insecurity frequently claiming locals' lives.

As the goveernment clamied to be spending much to tame insecurity, citizens also paid billions to bandits who kidnapped their loved ones.

When a state is pending more of secuirty votes on insecurity, it is expected that the trend reduced to a significant level. However, a security expert I spoke to belives the scheme is 'legal means of broad daylight stealing.’ 

Although, insecurity is still trending in Bauchi, but how story informed citizens what was being done aimlessly to combact it.

The management Sigma data Journalism
Media Awards 2023
Dear Sir/madam,
Ref: Cover for Ms Lominda to compete in Sigma data Journalism media awards 2023
It is interesting writing feature articles that topics related to science Journalism in the area of environmental science and climate change, health science, agricultural science, marine science, engineering and Energy and Information Communication Technology among others.
My name is Ms Lominda Afedraru a freelance science Journalist attached to Nation Media Group head quartered in Nairobi Kenya but in the Daily Monitor Publication in Kampala Uganda.
I do freelance for other scientific magazines abroad including Genetic Literacy Project and Alliance for Science in USA, Centre for Science and Environment in India, Pan Africa Agriculture publication in Nairobi Kenya including editing scientific books for scientific organizations on consultancy basis
I have practiced Journalism for the last 20 years where I began as a general reporter but for the last sixteen years I have majored in science reporting.
I am features writer which requires analysis of data and general information gathering and I have trained as a data journalists in various trainings within the country and elsewhere.
I have participated in several online/ face to face fellowships, the first one being a two year online/face to face fellowship courtesy of World Federation of Science Journalists Sjcoop programme where I graduated with Higher Diploma in Science Journalism in 2012.
I also participated in a two year fellowship in Biosciences for Framing in Africa courtesy of University of Cambridge UK where I emerged the overall winner science journalism reporting in 2014.
I am well-travelled journalist going to attend scientific meetings for purposed of gathering information for publication with my recent visit last year in October in Germany for a tour exploring the agriculture sector in Berlin.
Some of my mentors are senior science Journalists including Lynne Smith from South Africa who mentored me during the WFSJ Sjcoop programme. 
Others are Otulah Owori from Science Africa Nairobi Kenya who is known as the father of Science Journalism in Africa. There are quite a number of my mentors in Nairobi Kenya and in Uganda a good number of them are scientists who have guided me in reporting scientific topics in the simplest manner.
A number of Editors in the Monitor Newspaper where I have worked for as freelancer have also helped on how to polish my story some of them have since left the paper and moved on.
The Monitor News that produces the daily news and features section is flexible because it us me space to publish my feature stories which are developmental touching lives of communities. This leads to policy making in certain circumstances to improve lives of communities.
I belong to different science Journalist Associations right from the counytry Asociation Uganda Jounalists Science Association and Afrca Federation of Science Journalists where I sit on the board of both as General Secretary
I do mentor upcoming science journalists and I mentor train them as well.
I have won a number of Awards all related to science Journalism descipline.
Therefore if given the opportunity to win in the data journalism competition this will expose me experts and journalist colleagues from whom I can learn further to improve my writing skill.
I treasure in networking and this way I am able to create more sources globally because I do write articles for global readership where the coverage of sources has be wide.
I will also be able to share my experiences for other colleagues to know how I do it as a freelance journalist
Hoping to be successful.","My understanding of projects is explaining the stories I am submitting for the entry and I have submitted five story links most of them tagged to agriculture and climate change because I published most of my Covid-19 articles and other health related stories in 2021.
These are articles I pursued individually on my own accord and all are published in Daily Monitor in a farming magazine within the newspaper called Seeds of Gold to which I am a major contributor.
The background of how as freelancer I get my stories published in the newspaper is that I have been any active journalist writing stories on daily basis but it is upon the Editorial team to choose to publish the stories or trash them into a dust bin.
This therefore means all stories I write are published though most of them get published and it is the reason I have specialised because the editorial team know I am the expert in writing the science articles.
However there is the challenge of reaching out to the scientific Institutions or rural communities in search of information because the media outlet does not facilitate
Sometimes sources are busy to attend to me when contact for an interview about s tory idea I have come up with which is another challenge.
However I managed to overcome these challenges by building friendship with a number of my sources and a good number are able to reach out to me to go to the field with them when going in the fled upcountry and I get the chance to reach out to the communities.
I sometimes apply for story grants to publish stories of the interest as per the call topic and once I am successful, I am able to reach out to the communities to gather information for story publish
Sometimes I conduct phone call interviews or sent questions to my sources vial email and for sources who do not have time for me I reach out to alternative sources to get the same information.
This is the reason I find it easier to publishing stories related to agricultural science and climate change because the experts are easy to reach to compare to those dealing in Human science because they are a little reserved in giving information.
The five story links differ in content because the two are from my recent visit to Berlin Germany which was an organised trip for journalists and other stakeholders from different countries by the Germany Embassy in our various countries reaching out to us and I happened to be privileged from my Country Uganda.
I wrote these stories for farmers and other stakeholders in agriculture sector to learn from what is going on in Germany because most of the research work done by scientist is collaborative with their colleagues abroad.
The other stories are about research work done by scientists in the animal and crop sector to come up with ant tick vaccines which has been launched for animal husbandry farmer’s uptake.
The ground breeding story is solely about how scientists in Uganda have over the years bred groundnuts for consumer uptake because most Ugandans consume it as a delicacy. This means the production has to be increased because the demand is high.
The last story is about the importance of valuable insects in the pollination process of plants. A section of scientists are maintaining the insectarium especially for students to acquire knowledge about the various insect species.

United Kingdom,"The Courier, the Press and Journal",Big,Participant,,Lesley-Anne Kelly,"I have been working in data journalism for just over five years and in that time I have gone from a solo data journalist within the newsroom to now being Head of data journalism and running a small data unit.

I threw myself into the intensity of demand for data journalism that arose as a result of the pandemic but I also strive to show balance in covering both serious subjects whilst also showing that data journalism is allowed to occasionally have a more lighthearted side.

I was the recipient of the Specialist Reporter of the year title at the 2021 Scottish Press Awards and was Runner up in the Data Journalist of the year category at the UK regional press awards. In the following year my team were shortlisted for the Scottish press awards (journalism team of the year) and the Future of Media awards (data journalism category). We were recently announced as making the shortlist three times in the Digital Initiative category at the UK regional press awards occurring in 2023.

With every bit of journalism I or my team produce our aim is always in a laser focus on the end user experience.

As part of running the data team I also run training sessions for journalists looking to upskill their data journalism and data visualisation skills.

One of the first courses I took as a data journalism was one that Alberto Cairo ran and that helped to cement a lot of the fundamental principles. I followed this up with a masters course in data visualisation at the University of Edinburgh in 2020 and this really helped to get into the nitty gritty of data visualisation and design principles that I use in my training today.

It's probably cliched at this point but I would say I am inspired by the work of John Burn Murdoch and the entire data team at the Financial Times as well as Alex Selby Boothroyd of The Economist who has shown me an incredible amount of kindness to an annoying Scottish upstart.

It also goes without saying that the Pudding article on women's pockets was nothing short of life-changing and if I could one day make anything even have as cool as that I'll retire happy.","This portfolio should back up the light and shade I referenced above - a mix of serious and lighthearted journalism, but all using the same principles of trying to present data in a user friendly way that makes the end user experience as easy as possible.

Argentina,My own site,Small,Participant,,Federico Acosta Rainis,"My mother was a writer: since I was a child I was surrounded by books and I am passionate about telling stories. After studying anthropology, I took a master's degree in journalism and in 2018 I started writing in the Society section of the Argentine newspaper La Nación, one of the most important newspapers in Latin America.
 
I am interested in the environment, human rights, health, poverty, diversity and the challenges of the digital world. I participated in three team investigations - on the recognition of Argentine soldiers who died in Malvinas/Falkland, on sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in Argentina and on the 100,000 deaths caused by Covid in Argentina - which received national and international awards.
 
The arrival of Covid-19 marked a before and after in my professional life. When the government decreed a strict quarantine, I asked my editor to go out immediately. I was one of the few journalists who covered the crisis on the ground, from the very beginning. Week after week I traveled around Buenos Aires, talking to doctors working on the edge, homeless families, shopkeepers who lost everything and people who died alone. I wrote powerful stories that made visible the problems caused by both the virus and the measures taken to combat it.
 
Those experiences and the enormous work done by La Nación's data team (LN Data) during the pandemic taught me that incisive journalism can really make a difference, but also the importance of data today. The datification of the world raises ethical, political and privacy dilemmas that democracies must address immediately. It also opens up a gigantic field of research for journalism.
 
To learn more about data, in 2021 I applied for and won a competitive UK government Chevening scholarship that allowed me to travel to pursue Birmingham City University's Masters in Data Journalism, led by Paul Bradshaw. Under his generous mentorship, I developed strong data analysis, processing and visualization skills and learned a host of new tools, from R to QGIS. I was particularly interested in OSINT, AI, maps and satellite imagery. Among all the teams that inspired me, the work of Bellingcat is worth mentioning.
 
In 2022, I got the Google News Initiative internship to work for eight weeks in the visuals team of the prestigious The Guardian. For me, a journalist from the ""end of the world,"" it was a dream come true: the opportunity to learn from world-class journalists and developers and explore new narratives and innovative ways to reach audiences. During my internship, I published my own data- and map-based analysis of the Brazilian presidential election in The Guardian and collaborated on projects such as real-time visualization of the US midterm elections, among others.

I am someone who is just starting to walk the path of data and this is the first time I am participating in the Sigma Awards: the mere fact of doing so is already very gratifying for me. I was encouraged to apply, convinced that my work humbly tries to follow the best tradition of data journalism, documenting every step so that it can serve others to explore this field","This portfolio was done entirely by me and originally published independently (and replicated on Birmingham Eastside and Online Journalism blog). It explores the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery in journalism. For that I looked for topics where I could put these techniques into practice. In this sense, it works the other way around from a traditional investigation, in which first the journalistic question appears and then the best way to answer it is chosen.

The use of AI and satellite imagery is a growing field with enormous potential in journalism, but still little explored due to lack of technical expertise, necessary infrastructure and the cost of commercial satellite imagery. My goal was to develop its basic fundamentals and produce pieces that could be useful to other journalists interested in getting into the subject.
 
This work is part of my final project for Birmingham City University's Masters in Data Journalism. Two seminal pieces inspired me to work with AI and satellite imagery. Texty's pioneering ""Leprosy of the land"" and Earthrise Media's wonderful ""Amazon Mining Watch"", which I met during the Perugia 2022 International Journalism Congress.

During this process I faced several challenges. The main one was the limited information available on how to use AI and satellite imagery in journalistic investigations. To overcome this, I interviewed the few journalists who had worked on similar projects. They recommended using ESA satellite imagery and using machine learning instead of deep learning, as it has a lower initial difficulty.
 
I experimented with supervised and unsupervised learning and became familiar with satellite data processing: how to work with image rasters, plot combinations of different bands and normalize images using attributes such as gamma and brightness values. Once I was familiar with the tools, I applied them to real cases.

Thus, I investigated the impact of Chinese military maneuvers on maritime traffic in the Taiwan Strait and the violation of the Forest Law in Argentina. And I also wrote other pieces as introduction and conclusion, with possible ideas for further research on these techniques.

The idea is that the five pieces can be read independently, but also function as a whole. To serve as a general overview of what can be done using satellite imagery and AI and, above all, to demonstrate that no great technical knowledge is needed to start exploring these tools.",English,https://facostarainis.github.io/ml-satellites/index.html,,,,,,,,,
Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Participant,,elDiario.es Data Team,"elDiario.es is a digital news site which has become a major reference in current affairs for a new generation of Spanish readers, and also a pioneer in high quality content and innovative business model worldwide.
Since its inception, elDiario.es has opted for data journalism as a way to create quality content for subscribers and also to reach new audiences in Spain. Since 2015, our data team has always been a small data unit with at least two journalists who have based their work on constant collaboration with the entire newsroom. In 2022, the data journalism team was formed by 4 team members.
This year, our inflation and climate change crisis coverage proves that this team has had a public service role. First, using data analysis, interactive narrative, and visualization of complex issues to make them understandable, and second, as useful tools and stories to help readers make better decisions on a day-to-day basis.
And also this year we published big investigations and visual stories beyond them about health, social inequalities, climate change and urbanism. Precisely, our work philosophy has always been to visualize and explain things in the simplest way to the reader and collaborate with all the journalists in the newsroom to search stories and do better, accessible and understandable data journalism.
elDiario.es was launched in the middle of the financial crisis in 2012 with no big investors or corporates backing it – just a bunch of journalists and their savings – and it has developed a community-based journalism model reaching mainstream audiences with scarce resources. Among the dozens of new digital projects born in the past decade in Spain, elDiario.es stands out.
More than 12M unique users per month now read elDiario.es and that figure grows every month. It is the most widely read native digital media outlet in Spain, according to the Spanish Sociological Research Center.
The key business innovation is the ‘membership program’ – more than 60.000 people (“socios”) already give financial support to elDiario.es in order to strengthen our editorial and economic independence. But it is not a paywall: the “socios” of elDiario.es do not pay to read the news, they pay for the information to be freely spread and thus gain social impact. They pay to belong to a community of citizens sharing values like equality, democratization, social justice and more importantly, the need for independent journalism. 
Our business model has remained the same since our foundation, but when the coronavirus crisis hit, the media experienced financial difficulties. In order to handle this situation, we decided to barely change our business model and make an evolution of it, always keeping our foundational principles: elDiario.es will continue to be free for those who cannot pay but it will be necessary to be a member to read it regularly. 
In a world where manipulation and propaganda advance, we do not want our journalism to be left behind a wall that excludes people based on their income. This evolution in our business model has brought to our community 18,000 new members and thousands of existing readers stepped in.
Thanks to them elDiario.es is also a profitable company and can support innovative data journalism. Nowadays, our community represents more than 50% of our annual income. And in order to be fully transparent with their contribution, we annually publish our financial accounts. This good practice has become an expected date for the audience who perceives us as a trustful and reliable newsroom.","2022 was the year we finally forgot the pandemic but faced war in Europe and the worst inflation crisis of the XXI century. When life returned to “normal”, millions of people all over the world saw how their shopping basket and the energy bill skyrocketed and how the consequences of climate change blew up in their face.
This is the 2022 coverage by elDiario.es data team, formed by Raúl Sánchez, Ana Ordaz, Victòria Oliveres and Carmen Martínez, of the year in which we explained the effect of numbers and data (prices, energy, inequality, taxes, or climate change) on people’s lives.
The team’s work during the year has been conditioned by tracing the inflation crisis. We have daily and weekly updated visualizations of the rise of cost of living, always improving the pieces according to the informative and public interest. We tracked the price indexes of more than 200 products on the shopping cart of an average household that helped us to prove inflation moved from energy bills to basic food products like milk. This tracker helped our readers to make better informed decisions about their purchases.
We also published a daily updated map with fuel prices in all Spanish gas stations that allowed every reader to know where it was cheaper to refuel and a piece to calculate how much your mortgage could rise with new interest rates. But this coverage wasn’t limited only to following the numbers as a public service role. We also published big explainer stories about how the electricity marginal market works where we revealed that we are paying water, sun and wind at gas prices. This analysis of more than 8 million records helped us later to explain the Government measures to cap gas prices.
Tracking the inflation crisis conditioned our daily workflow but it did not prevent us from being able to publish great in-depth investigations and visual reports. For example, our journalistic investigation “Give birth with a scalpel” reveals for the first time in Spain the rate of cesarean sections in all public and private hospitals and shows how the probability of giving birth with a C-section in Spain depends on the hospital a woman goes to. We also published an investigation which revealed inequalities in cancer treatment access in each municipality. We proved with open and public data that 10% of the Spanish population would have to travel for more than two hours to get treatment.
Summer 2022 in Spain showed consequences of climate change. To track the hottest summer in history, we followed the spread of heatwaves, wildfires, mortality and drought. We published stories confirming with open data which cities set a new record-high temperature, how tropical nights skyrocketed with climate change, how heat waves raised mortality or that water reservoirs were suffering the worst drought in decades.
Inflation put the tax debate on the agenda and we achieved public impact with The Great Gap, is a journalistic project focused on the increasing inequalities between rich and poor in the country and reveals holes in the taxation system that allows millionaires and large companies to pay less taxes for their capital gains and business profits.
Our 2022 coverage also included social and culture stories like our analysis of 1.000 name’s popularity to show how Spanish parents choose shorter and original names, the story about streaming borders that explain how Non-English speaking movies and TV series are conquering the world or our urbanism project that explores how each city has grown according to the year of birth of each reader using footprint data of more than 12 million buildings.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/sube-super-han-encarecido-precios-producto-ultimo-ano-alimentos-luz-transporte-diciembre_1_8901588.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/agua-sol-viento-precio-gas-funciona-mercado-electrico-espana_1_8854576.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/son-5-am-20-grados-noches-tropicales-multiplican-cuatro-ciudades-espanolas_1_9263791.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/guia-visual-espana-llega-primavera-campana-riegos-embalses-secos-decada_1_8851664.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/trampas-sistema-fiscal-declaracion-renta-beneficia-millonarios-ingresos-capital_1_9556178.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/mapa-tasa-cesareas-espana-hospitales-abusan-partos-quirurgicos_1_9545161.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/10-poblacion-espanola-tendria-viajar-horas-dia-tratarse-cancer_1_8789307.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/crecido-ciudad-naciste-mapa-edad-espana-catastro-ano-urbana-edificio_1_8582771.html,https://www.eldiario.es/nidos/variados-originales-cortos-han-popularizado-1-200-nombres-25-anos_1_9207661.html,https://vertele.eldiario.es/noticias/netflix-mapa-series-peliculas-fronteras-habla-no-inglesa-expanden-mundo_1_9238389.html
Kyrgyzstan,Asia Plus,Small,Participant,,Altynai Mambetova,"My name is Altynai and I have been working as a data journalism mentor and editor since 2018 in Central Asia. My interest in data journalism has grown much after the completion of the data journalism institute where Eva Constantaras was the main trainer.

In Central Asia, data-driven journalism is perceived as a complex way of producing stories only implemented by high-ranked media organizations such as NYT, WaPo, Economist or Financial Times. However, societies in developing countries such as Central Asia need data journalism more than ever. It is an ultimate instrument to fight against corruption, inequality, misleading information.

However, there are even more challenges than opportunities. In the states like Tajikistan where a journalist can be sent to jail for 7 to 12 years for just being a reporter, any kind of free media is censored and under pressure. There is also lack of open data sources, low computer literacy among journalists, lack of data mentors and editors.

Starting from 2022 I have been a trainer and mentor for the Asia Plus media in Tajikistan supported by Internews Organization. During the mentorship program I led with other mentors Andriy Gazin and Rustam Gulov the team of Asia Plus produced their first stories. Given that most journalists have never produced data stories and have never worked with mentors and data editors, within just five months they have learnt all the stages of data story production starting from the search for the data to the data visualization. 

Journalists in Tajikistan produced data stories that uncover injustice, and inequalities and reveal major issues in the socio-economic environment of Tajikistan all supported by data.
Tajikistan is a country where data availability is one of the biggest issues journalists have faced. Moreover, available data was only available in scanned or online PDF formats. Journalists took additional steps to convert PDF to Excel sheets. That is the reason why many stories are buried behind these unavailable datasets and printed reports. 

Despite many challenges the team of Asia Plus together with mentors and editors created a portfolio of data projects on topics that are essential for the local communities. That is a big achievement for Tajik media organization.","In our portfolio we are presenting three data stories about the effects of Ukrainian war and vulnerability of Tajik economy against Russia, the problems and effects of imbalanced nutrition in Tajikistan, and the widening gap between rich and poor.

Our first story is the analysis of the vulnerability index for which we used a methodology developed by researchers from the S. Rajaratnam Graduate School of International Studies (RSIS) in Singapore. Since the invasion of Russia effected Tajikistan in many areas, vulnerability index quantifies how the economy of Tajikistan is vulnerable. 

Tha main struggle of story was to find data. Alongside with the search for data, journalists worked closely on the research methodology to carefully assess the index and understand the results of calculations. It was the first time when vulnerability of Tajikistan against Russia was put in an index in comparison with other countries. Tajikistan still remains as one the top countries which depend on remittences the most. 

As a result, the article was viewed more than 10K times only on the website, and attracted even more viewers on social media platforms and channels on Telegram and Instagram.

Another story is about the widening gap between rich and poor in Tajikistan. According to the survey results the pandemic has widened the gap massively. And this gap increased by 25 times in 2020, the phenomenon has not been addressed by officials. 

The analysis reveals a growing problem of inequality worsened by the effects of pandemic. For instance, poor people in Tajikistan are constantly living in debt, they spend more than they earn. It is a great example of a crucial social data analysis which was covered only by Asia Plus for different reasons. First, the government officials did not state these issues in their press-releases and, secondly, other media platforms were not able to analyze and produce data-driven story. The story attracted about 7K viewers only on the website. 

The third story of the team is the uncover of the imbalanced consumption of food in Tajikistan. For the story journalists analyzed a survey dataset from an Agency for Statistics survey on how Tajikistanis eat and compared it to national dietary standards set by the government. The team also created a personalized calculator to assess the nutrition habits of each reader according to national standards.

The results of the analysis are shocking: in villages all residents are undernourished except for the bread and butter/oils. In urban areas people's eating habits are slightly better. These all result in high rates of anemia and other health problems which are widely spread in the country. Fopr instance, one in five children under the age of five suffered from stunting in 2018. And the bulk of them live in rural areas. And the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has made malnutrition even worse among vulnerable families.

While working on the story journalists striggled to clean the dataset since it was only available in PDF version. The story attracted about 8,5K viewers only on the website and much more on social media platforms such as telegram and Instagram.","Tajik, Russian",https://asiaplustj.info/en/news/tajikistan/economic/20220520/vulnerable-economy-how-dependent-tajikistan-is-on-russia-and-other-countries,https://docs.google.com/document/d/19v2OMHuN3k8iIBsBVnR2xMA4jlgjoR_a/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111685189969875654218&rtpof=true&sd=true,https://docs.google.com/document/d/19v2OMHuN3k8iIBsBVnR2xMA4jlgjoR_a/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111685189969875654218&rtpof=true&sd=true,,,,,,,
Russia,«Важные истории» (Important Stories/IStories),Small,Participant,,Sonya Savina,"Я работаю в дата-отделе российского интернет-издания [«Важные истории»](https://istories.media/) с момента его основания в 2020 году. В дата-журналистике я уже 6 лет. До «Важных историй» я работала в дата-отделе [РБК](https://www.rbc.ru/), делала дата-исследования для издания [Проект](https://www.proekt.media/) и занималась расследованиями в составе команды военных аналитиков [Conflict Intelligence Team](https://citeam.org/). 

Но именно в страшном 2022 году, когда Россия развязала войну в Украине, я осознала, насколько важна для меня моя профессия. Через две недели после начала войны, 5 марта 2022 года российские власти признали «Важные истории» «нежелательной организацией». Это фактически означает, что они запретили нам работать на территории России: за публикацию текстов в «Важных историях» по российским репрессивным законам мне грозит реальный срок в тюрьме. Я должна была принять непростое решение: закончить работу и уйти из профессии или покинуть родную страну, семью и дом, чтобы продолжать рассказывать читателям правду. 

Я сделала тяжелый, но единственный возможный для профессии выбор: не останавливаться. Теперь мы работаем из-за границы без возможности вернуться в Россию и увидеться с семьей, пока ситуация в стране не изменится и репрессивные законы не будут отменены. Недавно я получила сообщение от своего главного редактора Романа Анина: «Война хорошо выявляет профессионализм людей — те, кто может в стрессовой ситуации собраться и работать, несмотря на все трудности, — вот они и есть настоящие профессионалы. О тебе я это могу сказать точно». Поддержка моей редакции каждый день помогает мне не сомневаться в своем выборе. 

Теперь все мои тексты о войне: я фиксирую преступления российской армии в Украине и рассказываю об ущербе, который Россия нанесла мирным украинцам. В этом мне помогает мой многолетний опыт работы в дата-журналистике: некоторые тексты, про которые я расскажу в своем портфолио, было бы невозможно сделать без навыков программирования и анализа больших данных. Кроме этого, я чувствую, что опора на данные в журналистике приобрела особую актуальность в условиях военного времени. Большая часть россиян отравлена пропагандой, многим сложно поверить в свидетельства людей, рассказывающих об ужасах войны. Мой способ достучаться до россиян — показывать им точные цифры и надежные данные, с которыми невозможно поспорить.","**[«Почему Россия бомбит жилые дома, больницы, школы и храмы»](https://istories.media/investigations/2022/07/25/pochemu-rossiya-bombit-zhilie-doma-bolnitsi-shkoli-i-khrami/) 
**

На пятый месяц войны я посчитала, сколько гражданских объектов российская армия разрушила в Украине за это время. Тезис о том, что «удары по гражданской инфраструктуре Украины не наносятся» заезжен российскими властями и пропагандистами. Я решила опровергнуть его на данных, которые не соврут. 

Даже во время войны Украина уделяет внимание публикации открытых данных: украинские ведомства сразу после вторжения российской армии начали фиксировать военные преступления. Анализ этих данных показал:

* Россия атакует гражданские объекты в 60 раз чаще, чем военные;
* каждый третий атакованный жилой дом был уничтожен полностью;
* разрушения в Мариуполе сопоставимы с ущербом, который был нанесен советским городам во время ВОВ;
* среди культурных объектов чаще всего страдают церкви.

**

Самым сенсационным моим материалом за время первого года войны стал текст о том, как российские суды смягчают наказания военным, которые возвращаются с войны в Украине и совершают преступления в России. Я написала парсер на Python и собрала все тексты судебных дел в отношении российских военных после начала войны, в которых упоминалось их участие в войне. Я обнаружила, что судьи учитывают участие в войне как смягчающее обстоятельство при назначении наказания. Чтобы понять, насколько участникам войны в Украине смягчают наказания, я сравнила это с тем, какие наказания получает по этим же статьям большинство россиян.

До войны Россия считалась второй страной в мире по военной мощи, и я задалась вопросом: насколько война в Украине ослабила российскую армию? 

Я собрала данные о потерях личного состава и техники и рассчитала долю этих потерь от всех ресурсов российской армии. В ситуации военного конфликта, когда собрать точные данные о потерях собрать сложно, а российские власти и вовсе скрывают потери, я могла лишь опираться на оценки разных сторон. Я собрала все версии о потерях: 

* данные OSINT-исследователей, которые опираются в подсчетах на фото и видео утраченной техники с полей боев;
* данные украинской стороны;
* данные третьих сторон: Британской разведки и Минобороны США.

Затем я опросила военных экспертов, которые помогли найти достоверную середину в данных.

** 

Когда в сентябре 2022 года украинская армия начала контрнаступление, я снова посчитала долю потерь российской армии и вооружений от военной мощи довоенного времени. Оказалось, что в первый месяц украинского контрнаступления российская армия потеряла в два раза больше военной техники, чем месяцем ранее.

В сентябре 2022 года в России началась мобилизация. Вместе с моей коллегой из дата-отдела мы посчитали, сколько мужчин отправили на войну из разных регионов России. Официальные ведомства не публикуют такую статистику, поэтому мы вручную собирали разрозненные данные о том, сколько мужчин мобилизовали в каждом регионе. Мы доказали, что мобилизация проходит по стране неравномерно: что чем беднее люди живут в регионе, тем сильнее его коснулась мобилизация.

Мы продолжили следить за темой и спустя месяц после начала мобилизации опубликовали второй [текст](https://istories.media/stories/2022/10/21/kak-rossiiskie-vlasti-provalili-mobilizatsiyu/), для которого я подсчитала, сколько россиян мобилизовали по ошибке.

За время войны в Украине российские военные гибли не только в боях с украинцами, но и от friendly fire — «огня по своим». Часть потерь российская армия несет и вне зоны боевых действий. Чтобы рассказать читателям, как российские военные убивают друг друга на службе, я написала парсер на Python, чтобы собрать все тексты судебных дел, в которых военных судили за убийства сослуживцев. Они показали, как халатность командования, низкое качество военной подготовки истощают российские войска еще до отправки на фронт.

United States,"ProPublica, NBC News, Outlier Media",Big,Participant,,Agnel Philip,"Last year was my third as a data reporter at ProPublica, a nonprofit investigative news outlet in the U.S. In my time here, I’ve contributed to our organization’s rapid expansion into local journalism. I've assisted partnerships with news organizations throughout the country through our Local Reporting and worked on stories with our relatively new local offices in the Southwest, Midwest and South regions of the country. Prior to this role, I was a data reporter on the investigative team at The Arizona Republic in Phoenix, Arizona for a year and a half. I'm proud of our organization’s mission to improve the quality of local investigative reporting, which has been decimated in recent decades as newspapers have declined.

I view data reporting as an integral part of authoritative journalism, and at its core, it isn’t that different from traditional reporting. Many stories start with questions that are inherently quantitative. My job, and the job of all data specialists, is to determine whether the data exists to answer that question and how to get as close to the truth as possible. To do this, I interview data, scrutinizing it for what it shows and identifying its weaknesses and contradictions.

In my career, I have strived to become equally proficient in data analysis and traditional reporting. Last year, for example, my analysis of child welfare data led me to West Virginia, where termination of parental rights happens more often and more quickly than anywhere else. I then reported in the field, interviewing characters that were used in the stories.

Data journalism is also inherently collaborative, and I enjoy working with others to make projects better. I help host periodic data “office hours” to provide assistance to other reporters on staff. I have taught data journalism classes at conferences and in workshops with journalism organizations.

I’ve only worked as a professional journalist for five years, but I have gained a lot of experience in that time. I’m grateful for my colleagues at ProPublica who provide a constant source of inspiration and encouragement for the work I do. In particular, my editors Hannah Fresques and Ryann Grochowski Jones have been incredibly supportive of my desire to branch out of the traditional data reporter role.","In many ways, my portfolio for 2022 represents a culmination of the five years I’ve worked as a data journalist professionally. It showcases a wide array of skills in nearly every aspect of data journalism, from analysis to visualization to on-the-ground reporting. My work last year uncovered troubling disparities in the child welfare system and predatory behavior by an energy utility in Michigan. And the work had measurable impact, leading to changes in leadership at child welfare agencies and investigations by legislators.

I’m most proud of the work I did on ProPublica and NBC News’s child welfare series, which covered the ineffectiveness of mandatory reporting laws, the pervasiveness of child welfare investigations in Black communities and the speed at which parents lose the right to parent their children. I led data analysis efforts for this investigation, which went beyond the prevailing narratives about state agencies either doing too much or too little to keep children safe. Instead, we revealed a system that deprives people of their rights in ways that neither protect children nor their families.

Our analysis relied on data from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect for their National Child Abuse Data System (NCANDS) and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). The NCANDS data required a research proposal documenting how we would keep the information secure and approval from an institutional review board. The databases are both incredibly large (millions of entries per year) and messy, so over the course of a year, we developed a careful methodology for analyzing them, requiring multiple large queries — written and executed in R — to pull relevant information from different parts of each database to create as accurate a list of children and cases as possible. We also shared our methodology and analysis results with multiple experts familiar with both sets of data as well as the data archive itself who confirmed the validity of our methods.

I was the lead reporter for our story on termination of parental rights, finding that parents in West Virginia often lost their rights in a matter of months. As part of this, I found the people affected by this practice and interviewed them, and I was the lead writer on the story.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/six-months-or-less-parents-lose-kids-forever,https://www.propublica.org/article/for-black-families-in-phoenix-child-welfare-investigations-are-constant-threat,https://www.propublica.org/article/mandatory-reporting-strains-systems-punishes-poor-families,https://www.propublica.org/article/lights-out-profitable-utility-company-shut-off-electricity-to-homes-hundreds-of-thousands-of-times,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-child-welfare-investigation-data,,,,,
United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Participant,,Steven Bernard and Chris Campbell,"Steven Bernard, Senior Visual Journalist

I am traditionally trained as a scientific illustrator, which gave me my artistic grounding, an eye for detail and the understanding of how to convey information in an unambiguous way. These skills I found were very transferable into the field of visual journalism.

Over my nearly 3 decades as a visual journalist at the Financial Times, my role has changed immeasurably. I have always been motivated by a strong desire to be constantly improving, whether it is diving into R, learning 3D skills in Blender or animation techniques in After Effects. Constantly pushing myself and experimenting enables me to approach projects from a different angle. 

Climate change has been on the news agenda for decades, much longer than my 26 years at the FT. But it is only in the past 5-10 years that it has become a key focus within our organisation.

I first worked on climate and environment stories in 2018, mainly dealing with the topic of pollution. This introduced me to the plethora of climate and atmospheric data that was available on Nasa, Noaa and Copernicus databases and the brilliant work of Joshua Stevens, esteemed lead data visualiser/cartographer at Nasa’s Earth Observatory. But it wasn't until the Climate Graphic of the Week was started in October 2020 and the subsequent launch of the Climate Capital hub that I really immersed myself in the subject.

Having a role to play in highlighting the key climate concerns through visual journalism has been the most rewarding aspect of my job in recent years.

========

Chris Campbell, Visual Journalist

For me, visual journalism is about using data to reveal patterns and trends in the world around us.

Like many in the field, it was a chance encounter at college with Edward Tufte’s seminal book ‘The Visual Display of Quantitative Information’ that set me on my current career path. 

After an MA in visual communication, I was hired in 2007 by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court as an ‘experiment’ - to see if data and visual presentations could be useful in the prosecution of complex international war crimes.

Of course, the lawyers immediately saw its value and I spent three busy years working across all the court’s investigations; from tracking the movements of child soldiers in DR Congo to plotting ethnically targeted attacks in Darfur for the indictment of then President al-Bashir of Sudan.

I joined the Financial Times graphics team in 2011 as the newsroom was pivoting its journalism towards a digital first approach. During my time at the FT, data visualisation has become a core pillar within editorial.

This is exemplified by the FT’s Climate Graphic of the Week, for which myself and Steven pitch, research, analyse, visualise and often co-write.

========

Climate change stories can provoke a strong reaction in those that seek to deny it. By visualising evidence gathered by satellites and scientific institutions we strive to make climate data accessible to a broad audience, highlighting trends to change minds and inform policy on what is one of the most urgent crises facing the planet.

Having this effort considered for the portfolio prize at this year’s Sigma awards would mean an enormous amount to Chris and Steven as well as sending a strong message about the importance of presenting climate data to the public.","Climate Graphic of the Week charts the global impact of climate change, covering its environmental, economic and human impact using sophisticated data analysis and visualisation techniques to consistently deliver powerful, insightful and concise stories that matter.

Since its launch in October 2020, visual journalists Steven Bernard and Chris Campbell have produced graphics that pull the latest environmental monitoring data from NASA, EU satellites and other real-time sources - often during extreme climate events. Their pieces have been so authoritative at conveying important information on climate change that secondary school teachers have regularly used them as part of the curriculum on climate change.

The Climate Graphic of the Week has been so successful that an accompanying newsletter -- The Climate Graphic: Explained was launched last July offering insight into how the visual journalists analysed the data and the design decisions that were made when producing the visualisations.

1. To illustrate the devastating monsoonal rains that affected Pakistan, we downloaded dozens of files from Nasa's Global Precipitation Measurement and performed our own data analysis to create the rainfall anomaly map and chart. This approach highlighted how extraordinary the amount of rainfall was, with some areas encountering 1.6 metres more rainfall than normal .

2. Europe’s 2022 wildifre season got off to an early start, using data from the EU’s European Forest Fire Information System database, we took the innovative approach of using an animated chart of the total burnt area to highlight 2022's severity compared with recent years.

3. Illustrating how the most vulnerable in Kentucky were hit by the heaviest rainfall involved combining rainfall data from NOAA and the US Social Vulnerability Index. This an excellent example of how combining disparate datasets can provide important additional insight.

4. Performing our own analysis on the data provided by the Human Climate Horizons platform enabled us to produce an insightful chart stepping through the impacts on mortaility rates, the labour market and electricity demand. This highlighted the main finding of the report that extreme heat due to climate change is expected to hit poorest countries hardest.

5. This explainer on how hurricanes form combined 3D graphics, digital illustration and sound design to create a compelling and informative standalone video that was a big hit with geography teachers and students alike.

6. Data gathered from Copernicus to show the record breaking temperatures in the Antarctic in March of 2022. By presenting the temperature and sea ice concentrations anomalies, we are emphasising how far from normal this warming event was for the time of the year.

7. CO2 is a primary driver of global warming. In 2022, concentrations in the atmosphere hit record levels. Often charts plotting climate variables are attacked for showing a relatively short time frame. “What about a thousand years ago!” is a frequent criticism. But thanks to ice-core data, we are able to show 800,000 years worth of CO2 levels which serves to emphasise just how alarming the recent rise is.

8. Heatwaves hit Europe again in 2022, setting records in several countries. What is particularly concerning is that many of these high temperature records have been set in the past 10 years. This graphic serves to emphasise this recent clustering of records, using annotation to group heatwaves together to show how several countries can be impacted during one event. Attention is also drawn to a contentious historic record. 

9. High resolution sea surface temperature data was pulled from Noaa to create an animation showing the unusual warming across the northern hemisphere. This data is also used to visualise the current La Niña event (cooling in the Pacific Ocean) which impacts global weather patterns.",English,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/cd179ed8-82d3-4ce1-ba3d-3525340c5225,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/a15268f9-e121-41cd-9755-737c6705d17d,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/b6fd9071-0688-46d1-b4e6-1cd672ddefd3,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/eb0d8c8b-f1d0-478f-b4fb-3409731cf5fb,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/ed7cd18e-caaf-41ed-afc4-bc5e0e3fb53a,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/e4bdf47b-2dbb-4678-bdc7-f92e0929b2e1,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/55064726-f5a5-454f-8e5a-b7af60e174d2,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/fbdddfdc-0f6b-47b3-92b9-72c2aa12a24e,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/0d91ddb0-49ed-4e34-b0b6-7b969ca735be,
United States,"The Marshall Project, Newsday",Small,Participant,,Anastasia Valeeva,"I fell in love with data at the DataHarvest conference in Belgium, in 2014. Being a reporter and TV producer, I saw the beauty of uncovering the root causes of the issues and systemic failures. Having returned from that conference, I took the online class ‘Doing Journalism With Data: First Steps, Skills, and Tools’ taught by Simon Rogers, Paul Bradshaw, Steve Doig, Nicolas Kayser-Bril, and Alberto Cairo. Somebody once told me that nearly all data journalists in Europe took that class. It was a great source of inspiration and a solid skills foundation. That year, I became a part of the Open Knowledge community. 

I continued my journey with data while finishing up my Master’s Program. Soon after graduation, I interned at Open Knowledge Belgium, organizing a hackathon at the Council of the European Union. Later that year, I got my first data journalism job, as a trainer assistant to Eva Constantaras. Eva became my mentor for years to come. 

As a data journalism trainer, I wanted to research what could make data journalism sustainable. I researched the use of open data in Russian investigative journalism as part of my fellowship at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. By the end of it, I had a roadmap for myself. I believe this is why, when Eva and I came to Kyrgyzstan to run a month-long Data Journalism Summer Institute, I saw the opportunity and decided to stay. 

For the next four years, I was wearing multiple hats and mostly teaching, mentoring, and editing data journalism projects with students and local newsrooms. I served at the Journalism & Mass Communications Department at the American University of Central Asia. I engaged with Internews Kyrgyzstan as a lead trainer and mentor for their year-long data journalism fellowship, for which I designed the study program and trained my assistants. With alumni of my first training, we co-founded the School of Data Kyrgyzstan, actively promoting data journalism through education and events. In 2020, we established the first Russian-language data journalism conference, LAMPA. 

We published the first data journalism stories in Kyrgyzstan. With data, we investigated the influence of poverty on health and education, the vicious cycle of domestic violence, barriers to clean water in rural areas, and the correlation between early marriages and maternal mortality. We scrutinized the judiciary system, government expenditures, and the work of the parliament. These stories sparked national debate and were acclaimed internationally. In 2021, my mentees brought the first Sigma Award to Kyrgyzstan for their piece on femicide. 

By that time, I saw the systemic change happening in the media community in the country, with data journalism becoming a norm. I started looking for the next step. 

My ‘capstone project’ from this 4-year residence in Kyrgyzstan was a semester-long data story about the poor state of school infrastructure, implemented as a part of the ‘Data Storytelling’ course I was teaching. We cross-published this as a series in nine media outlets. The main bar was followed up by a series of reports from local schools, and a game called “To save a school.” The story got a special prize at the national investigative journalism award “The Truth” and the first prize in its category at the national journalism award ""Aspiration.""

Meanwhile, I got into the Lede Program and was lucky to be selected for the Alfred Friendly fellowship, which places international journalists in US newsrooms. 

In January 2022, I joined the data team at my host newsroom, The Marshall Project. This is where I spent most of 2022. I consider my data editor, David Eads, as my mentor, too.","“What You Need to Know About the Rise in U.S. Mass Shootings”:
33,000 page views. This story was #5 out of all TMP stories that year on Apple news gaining 247,000 views. 

The main challenge was the absence of a single database of mass shootings. I went through all of them to prove that US mass shootings are on the rise, no matter how you count. This story was cross-published with The Guardian and highlighted by the researchers of the issue at The Violence Project.

It also got lots of interest from readers who wrote emails and left comments. We anticipated these questions (why this database, why the number, not the rate, etc.), so I had them already answered during the analysis stage. I interacted with readers on Reddit and released the code and methodology to build trust and explain my work: “How do we know mass shootings are increasing?”.

Since the beginning of my fellowship with The Marshall Project, I have been studying how federal COVID funding was spent on criminal justice. This involved some data journalism heavy-lifting, getting data from various sources in different formats. The main challenge was that the data does not allow to answer questions like ‘how much money was spent on X’, so our analysis involved a lot of additional categorization, context-setting, and pattern-seeking.

This story is a national overview of how billions of federal grant money end up in the criminal justice system. It was the most trafficked and talked about story published by The Marshall Project in the past few months. It was also republished by several newsrooms and websites, and made it to the top-10 data journalism links by the Global Investigative Journalism Network that week. 

We also partnered with Axios and shared our database with them for exploration. This partnership resulted in 270,000 email opens in the first 10 ARPA stories they run. They have run quite a few ARPA stories since. 

During this time, I also appeared as an expert at The Poynter Institute for Media Studies’ data journalism workshop series ‘Follow the money: American Rescue Plan”, attended by dozens of local reporters from the US newsrooms.

We run a few local follow-ups where I did most of the data analysis and, in the case of the story on Independence, reporting, too. I talked to the local NPR affiliate in an interview about how we reported the story. They were both cross-published by several local media.

Overall, starting from July 2022, when my first story came out, I ranked #10 overall in terms of TMP on-site traffic, which is top 25 percentile among active TMP authors. 

My fellowship concluded in October 2022, and in December 2022, I joined Newsday as a data reporter in the investigations team. Together with the politics reporter Scott Eidler, we published this story: “George Santos far outspent other successful LI GOP congressional hopefuls for food, out-of-state travel” on 2022-12-30. I did all of the data analysis and visualizations for this one. I guess the main challenge was doing data analysis on a deadline. The story had 8,731 unique visitors and prompted 14 people to subscribe to Newsday.

Throughout the year, I also engaged in teaching data journalsim (workshops for Alfred Friendly fellows, investigative journalists at RISE Moldova and a global cohort of students at the OSUN Data Storytelling class) and public speaking (“Data Journalsim in the wartime’, a guest lecture at the California State University).

Singapore,"Mediacorp Channel 8 (Free-to -air), 8world.com",Big,Participant,,Mediacorp Channel 8 news data team,"Recognizing the importance of incorporating data analytics into news production and driving data journalism, Mediacorp Channel 8 news started a data journalism team in 2021, one of the first local newsroom to set up a team dedicated to produce data-driven stories. 

Through collaborating with both public and private sectors, the team collates and analyses available data and reports on sustained or emergent data-driven trends. Some examples are Covid travel, dengue trends, inflation and also lighter topics such as how music consumption are affected by the pandemic. The stories run throughout the day for five different bulletins, with a differing angle and format for each.

As data-driven stories tend to be more heavy on numbers, the team worked together with the in-house Augmented reality team and presented the stories in AR format, to make it more appealing and easy to understand for the audience, also bringing a new dimension of news presentation. The AR data segment was well received by the public as they could easily make sense of the numbers presented with the graphic visual aid. 

The team also embarked on providing exclusive online content, such as interactive graphs and a food price checker web application- a project collaboration with Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and Esri Singapore. 

Besides bringing the audience through a new sensory experience in news consumption, the purpose of the data journalism team is also to equip a new generation of news reporters the skills to work with big data as a news source - an ongoing effort to move towards a future newsroom. The team of 6 journalists has undergone data analytics training courses and are continuing to hone their skills.

Driven and led by Evelyn Lam, the data team members include Wong Kang Wei, Tan Sze Shuen, Ngan Zhi Ying, Zheng Xin, Julia Nga and Wong Hui Yen. Although every one of us has a core role in the newsroom, we still dedicate extra time and effort for this passion driven project. The recognition provided by this award will act as a timely booster for the team to continue embarking on this journey of data journalism.","We did a total of 50 stories for the various bulletins to date and have selected 7 stories plus 1 web application project for the submission.
The synopsis of each featured data story as below:

1.**How Covid affects Music consumption**: We use data to find out how the tempo and mode of the music preferred by Singaporeans changed during the Covid period and how music may help in relieving stress and act as an alternative treatment for chronic patients. 

2.**Obesity during pandemic**: This story focus on weight management during the pandemic. We find out how much weight Singaporeans have gained during Covid and how this will in turn impact the number of Covid severe cases.

3.**Tourism during pandemic**: With the closing of borders, tourism is badly affected. With data, we look at how the industry and tourists preference have changed, also tourism is bouncing back after some relaxation of covid measures.

4.**Dengue in Singapore**: Through analyzing area data, we found out that 3-4room HDB flats are most prone to breeding Aedes, clusters also have a high concentration of elderly. We also analyze the effectiveness of Wolbachia over the years using data. 

5.**Cybersecurity**: Some 500 images from CCTVs in Singapore have been leaked on the internet, over half are images from homes or non-public areas. Cybersecurity experts flagged that many Internet of things, such as web cams, have fallen prey to hackers, especially if the devices’ passwords are not strong or are default passwords. We also found out that Some 70 CCTV images showing PUB water pipes and construction sites on Jurong Island were leaked on the internet in the past 3 months. Cybersecurity experts say this means the webcams have been compromised and this could pose network security issues, hackers could even access the network to steal info or mount an attack.

6.**Gaming during the pandemic**: During Covid, gaming patterns have changed and we see a surge in education games download, creative play became the norm and games with socialising elements were most popular with children. Interestingly, the colours used in games during the Covid period has changed too, reflecting the emotions of game creators during the different periods of Covid. We also look into game addictions, where we observe a double increase for kids and more pronounced symptoms for teens.

7.**Makan Index:** Our data team partnered Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and surveyed over 2,400 food stalls at hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts island wide. We found that prices of 4 most common food items – kopi-o, iced milo, mixed vegetables rice and chicken rice – have gone up by at least 10% in past 5 years. On average, kopi-o now costs 17.2% more at $1.09, iced milo went up by 20.7% to $1.81, chicken rice is 23% more expensive at $3.80, while 2 veg + 1 meat economic rice has gone up by 11% to $3.44. Supply chain disruption is the main reason for food inflation.

8.**Food price checker web application**: The web checker gathered food prices of 4 common food and drink items in Singapore, sold in hawker centres, coffee shops and food courts. Users can easily check for the cheapest chicken rice, economic rice, iced milo and kopi-o, according to their geographical location, which may come in handy especially in times of inflation.",Chinese,https://www.8world.com/stories/hello-singapore/big-data-analysis-music-listening-habits-1769746,https://www.8world.com/stories/hello-singapore/big-data-analysis-personal-weight-management-during-covid-1718686,https://www.8world.com/stories/hello-singapore/big-data-analysis-covid-impact-on-travel-habits-1837021,https://www.8world.com/stories/hello-singapore/big-data-analysis-dengue-fever-1874216,https://www.8world.com/stories/hello-singapore/big-data-analysis-cyber-crimes-1913356,https://www.8world.com/stories/hello-singapore/big-data-analysis-gaming-habits-1957626,https://www.8world.com/stories/hello-singapore/big-data-analysis-food-inflation-2015696,https://www.8world.com/singapore/data-makan-index-web-app-2014436,,
Germany,Deutsche Welle (DW) Data Team,Big,Participant,,Deutsche Welle (DW) Data Team,"As Germany's international media company, DW offers reporting in over 30 languages. Its goal is to provide factual, unbiased and insightful information in order to provide the basis for people forming their own opinions – particularly in countries where free, unbiased information might be scarce. 

Producing insightful data-driven stories that are relevant to audiences spread across the globe, is a challenge we navigate anew with every project. Subsequently, we aim to cover topics that are pertinent irrespective of location: stories on migration, environment and climate change or on democratic values have time and time again proven to be interesting to DW's readers and viewers worldwide.

While DW – launched initially as a radio broadcaster in 1953 – has a longstanding tradition reporting on these topics, DW's data team was founded only in 2017. Since then, the team has grown from two founding members to now seven data journalists. Each of the team members comes with skills in journalism, code and design to realise a story from idea to final published product on multiple platforms.

Although each team member comes with the skills to produce a story on their own, we foster collaborations – both within the data team, but also with other DW journalists as well as media partners across Europe. In 2019, DW Data became a core member of the European Data Journalism Network ([EDJNet](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/)). In our first project phase, DW Data committed to experiment with how we might best tell [data-driven stories on social media](https://innovation.dw.com/articles/data-driven-journalism-for-social-media-creating-the-right-post-for-every-platform-and-occasion). This project resulted in a series of templates we continue to use today. Together with DW's Innovation Lab, we also developed a [data-driven AR filter for Instagram](https://innovation.dw.com/articles/you-draw-it-ar-instagram-face-filters-for-data-driven-journalism). In our second project phase with EDJNet, we co-created investigative data units that brought together partners from different countries to craft missing datasets together, for example with our [Covid in prisons](https://www.dw.com/en/covid-how-europes-prisons-have-fared-in-the-pandemic/a-60006262) investigation in 2021 and [plastic promises](https://www.dw.com/en/european-food-companies-break-their-plastics-promises/a-62622509) investigation in 2022. Collaborating in EDJNet and building upon the regional expertise of partners, allowed us to tell stories from different perspectives adding up to a kaleidoscope for each topic.

Beyond collaborating with external partners, DW Data proved crucial to several inhouse developments. We started an internal newsletter and offered training to promote data journalism across all desks and languages. We pushed to go beyond department silos and lead DW's initial Visual Journalism Team and started to collaborate daily with DW's Infographics team and DW's research unit. And with the Covid-19 pandemic, we showcased how (semi)automated content creation workflows could look at a multi-language media company.","Against the backdrop of a strong news department, we decided for the data team to not focus on stories strictly set by the news agenda but instead highlight contemporary topics that deserve attention. We strive to identify story angles others might not cover and try to shed light on underreported issues to tell exclusive stories. 

With its broad language portfolio, DW is a very diverse outlet allowing us to cover topics from different regions and beats. The diversity also extends to data gathering: we work with datasets already available, but also create datasets together with partners, scour scientific publications, set up scrapers to collect data or file FOI requests to make information public. Transparency and reproducibility are important to our work, therefore we publish all data and code on [Github](https://github.com/dw-data). 

To maintain quality, we developed a standardised pitching process that involves getting feedback from languages desks and expert departments early on, as well as thinking about follow-ups and how to tell a story adequately on different platforms.

These examples showcase how we put this philosophy into practice:

[Building own databases] Using recycled plastic, using less plastic in packaging, organising beach-cleanups: European food and drink companies got creative on making their footprint greener. But do they follow through on their promises? Our investigation into plastic promises (project link 2 to 4) together with partners from the European Data Journalism Network (EDJNet) set out to answer that question. Combing through hundreds of sustainability reports, we co-created a database detailing the goals and whether a company succeeded. The investigation showed how only a fraction of promises is actually kept, while others are silently dropped or the goalposts are moved again and again.

[Politics vs reality] As the plastic promises story demonstrates, pledges and reality don't necessarily match. Naturally, we are not only sceptical towards promises of industries, but also take a closer look at political decisions: The EU invests billions in infrastructure in its effort to replace Russian fuels with liquefied natural gas. We investigated why this action could prove to be a dead end, both for taxpayers and for the climate (project link 5), by digging through difficult to obtain data and asking for information via FOI requests to several European governments.

Another example of holding politicians accountable is our investigation into the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (project links 8 to 10) together with EDJNet partners. The fund set out to ""address the root causes of migration"" in 2015, particularly focusing on economic development and job creation. With our investigation we traced how the focus shifted towards migration control and how this focus did not necessarily reflect nor tackle the reality on the ground – relying on data scraped over three years, database queries and around 20 interviews with experts from African countries as well as the EU.

[Not finished after publication: Follow-Ups] With publication, stories often move off journalists' desks making space for new ones. We made it a habit to reserve some ""desk space"" for following up. The above mentioned EUTF series is one example, our story on border controls within the Schengen area (project link 6) is another one.

[Shed light on otherwise unknown] Flooded towns, destroyed homes, missing people: Failing dams are often tragic. Our investigation into dams in Brazil (project link 7) highlighted a systemic aspect connecting individual tragic incidents. Many dams don't have an emergency plan and for half of all dam structures the legal status is unknown. For now, there are no consequences for dam operators, resulting in a situation where an estimated 1 million people live in proximity to an at-risk dam structure.","English, Arabic, Spanish, Portugues, Indonesian, German, Polish, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Turkish, Polish, Albanian, Chinese, Hindi",https://www.dw.com/data,https://www.dw.com/en/european-food-companies-break-their-plastics-promises/a-62622509,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em07usLG2oY&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=DWPlanetA,https://www.instagram.com/reel/ChEje1MKjNH/,https://www.dw.com/en/to-cut-off-russian-gas-eu-burns-billions-on-lng/a-63863444,https://www.dw.com/en/schengen-states-extend-border-checks-ignoring-eu-court/a-63747406,https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-dams-1-million-live-close-to-danger/a-61523548,https://www.dw.com/en/how-the-eu-spent-billions-to-halt-migration-from-africa/a-61362906,https://www.dw.com/en/eu-uses-development-aid-to-strongarm-africa-on-migration/a-61375189,https://www.dw.com/en/how-germany-manages-eu-funds-in-africa/a-61375626
United Kingdom,BBC Shared Data Unit,Big,Participant,,BBC Shared Data Unit,"The BBC Shared Data Unit has continued to promote and support data journalism at a regional level across the UK, whilst making national and local headlines with a series of public interest data investigations. The team’s collaborative model sees it share its data journalism with more than 1,000 local news outlets across television, radio, print and digital. The team's work led to at least 280 print or online stories among our local news partners last year.

During the course of the year, the team have also led free week-long masterclasses in investigative journalism for regional journalists, and hosted drop-in sessions over Zoom for journalists wanting to learn key technical skills. Participants develop skills to be able to source, clean, analyse and visualise datasets for their audiences, as well as exploring more advanced techniques such as how to maximise their use of Freedom of Information laws, how to scrutinise financial data from Companies House accounts and how to use advanced internet searches. In June, we hosted our first ever two-day coding course for journalists.

In May, we hosted a hack day inviting regional journalists to explore Twitter data, alongside MPs, academics and data scientists. Later in the year, we brought together data journalists from across the UK at Data Journalism UK conference we co-hosted with Birmingham City University.

A commitment to transparency and the open data movement is at the heart of our team and our output. We have demonstrated how adopting open data principles enhances the trust in our reporting, builds a personal relationship with audiences and helps to engage them in the process of journalism. We demonstrate our commitment to transparency through sharing source data, methods and code for the majority of our projects.

A key part of the team’s editorial remit is to find news stories that are hiding in plain sight, using data journalism techniques to explore the impact of local and national government policies on the lives of individuals. 

The team has demonstrated a wide range of technical skills across its portfolio. Techniques include accessing open data sources, using Freedom of Information laws, scraping data from websites or building our own databases. What matters is finding the right data to bring important information into the public record.","In January, we revealed how NHS dentistry in the UK was “hanging by a thread” with some patients facing two-year waits for routine check ups.

First, we built a scraper in Python to find out how many practices in England were accepting NHS patients. More than 75% of all dental practices in England had out of date information – hinting at the scale of the problem.

Next, we turned to the annual dental workforce statistics. A time series – created with the programming language R - revealed an 8% drop in the number of NHS dentists last year. Breaking the data down by clinical commissioning group showed areas that had lost more than a quarter of their NHS dentists in the last year.

We found stories of people using metal files and superglue on their own teeth, people in pain for over a year and dentists pushed to financial and mental breaking point.

Four days after publication, £50million was released by Westminster for NHS dentistry. 

In February 2022, we reported around half of police employees who had committed gross misconduct since the formation of the latest police watchdog had not been dismissed.

In May 2022, we partnered with BBC Newsbeat to report on the gender imbalance among headline performers at UK music festivals.

We compiled and analysed a spreadsheet of the headline acts for 50 music festivals. 

In August 2022, we reported how the share of homegrown doctors and nurses joining England's NHS had reached its lowest point in seven years.

We analysed workforce data provided by NHS Digital showing the nationalities of joiners, leavers and staff in post in England’s NHS from 2015 to 2021.

We also submitted 27 FOI requests to every health board in Scotland and Wales and every health and social care trust in Northern Ireland.

In October 2022, we revealed a postcode lottery in terms of the amount of money NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) spend per woman aged 45-60 on common hormone replacement therapy (HRT) treatments.

In November, we collaborated with BBC Learning & Identity to look at the rise in the number of five and six year olds who need speech and language support at school, finding that it had risen by 10% in England in the last year.

An R script was written in a Python notebook to download data, filter it, pivot it by local authority and year, and calculate year-on-year changes.

A second script downloaded data on pupil numbers, combined it with the figures on special educational needs (SEN), and divided the SEN figures by total pupil numbers to get a proportion. 

This allowed us to test whether an increase in speech, language and communication (SLC) needs might simply be due to an increase in pupils (it was not)

A third script downloaded data on the numbers of pupils for whom English was a second language (ESL), to test whether an increase in speech, language and communication needs might be due to an increase in ESL pupils (it was not),

Also in November, we reported how thousands of disabled people had had their benefits paused during extended hospital stays under a rule which charities said penalised the most vulnerable.

Later in the month, we shared an analysis of almost 3 million tweets mentioning politicians' Twitter accounts. More than 3,000 tweets were sent to UK Members of Parliament every day that a Google algorithm classified as ""toxic"". The project used ""big data"" tools and artificial intelligence to analyse the data.

In December 2022 we looked at the patchwork provision of holiday food vouchers being offered to families with children in receipt of Free School Meals.",English,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59874320,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-61512053,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61230287,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63373804,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63036042,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63330885,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-62849438,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-64038416,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59594712,
Germany,Storyworks Studio,Small,Participant,,Storyworks,"Dear jury, 

Storyworks Studio is a collective of like-minded people who believe in the power of data visualization, storytelling and interactivity. Combining these three entities in one we create unique special projects, which we call storylandings. We've been creating print infographics for a long time, making complex information easy-to-understand. But print format has it's boundaries. When we switched to digital, this skill helped us create clear and comprehensible projects. And interactive features enhanced the effect and increased user Involvement. In every project our main goal is to create a seamless engaging visual story whatever the initial data we have. Converting patchy pieces of information into holistic story and implementing such an approach for social and commercial needs — that is where we have succeeded. 

We have been in the field for 4 years by now. Our inspiring gurus are ""SCMP"", ""New York TImes"", ""National Geographics"" and ""pudding.cool"". We believe that their work is the benchmark for the industry and we strive to achieve the same level in our work. We hope that the jury will evaluate the contribution of our studio to the industry.","The portfolio of Storyworks Studio consists of social and commercial special projects. 
We try our best to create native and engaging storylandings. On our way to bring to life projects we face different challenges and find various solutions according to the aims of a particular project.

For example, the project ""[HIV. The answers you didn’t know](https://projects.storyworks.digital/hiv/)"" was important to be precise in wording. That's why we worked closely with a foundation that deals with people with HIV.
The main challenge of the project was the need to involve users who would not normally associate themselves with a group at risk of HIV infection. For that very reason we created chapters that can show them that HIV can also apply to them. In addition we created a quiz that reveals major misconceptions and myths about HIV. 
We launched the project on the 1st of December — World AIDS Day. We cooperated with instagram influences to attrackt wide audience to that topic. 

---

The project ""[Blood donation](https://https://projects.storyworks.digital/donors/)"" was created to change the positioning of blood donation, to remove fears and concerns before the procedure. Thereby increase the number of regular donors.
We have processed more than 50 sources with information about donation into an illustrative and welcoming storylanding, consisting of 4 steps. The project gained 20,000 views in a month.

We decided to build a story through short situational sketches about a donor character. The focus in the project is not on the character themselves, but on familiar objects and details from their life like dishes, documents, plants, and lockers in a medical room. So we could link together all the stages of donation, even when the reader doesn’t see the character, for example, when the donor's blood is being transfused to a recipient.

The concept also helped to avoid unnecessary triggers. The story didn't have to depict a hospital that could cause negative connotations.

---

[""Customer Experience Research""](https://https://projects.storyworks.digital/nda/index.html) was created to present the results of market research in a way that will give the bank’s employees a clear understanding of their clients’ requests and needs. Over the course of 3.5 months we turned more than 10 large-scale studies into a storylanding with 4 stories that helped the bank’s employees see the experiences of real people behind the numbers and make effective decisions based on it. We illustrated the NDA’s multi-million client base through 7 characters from different generations. All the characters in the storylanding are members of the same family. There are people of all ages in the family, which is universal enough to be clear to any reader.

We simulated typical situations in which people use the bank’s products together with the client. We then created scripts for the characters based on those situations. This allows bank managers to understand how customer experience is formed, as well as what is important for their customers and why.

As a result we found a new and effective format for internal newsletters — the storylanding made it easier for employees to digest the research data. This in turn helped improve the quality of the bank's customer service.

[""Why did the Kursk sink""](https://https://projects.storyworks.digital/kursk/) - the project dedicated to the tragedy of submarine Kursk, killing 118 crew members. We have visualized the causes of the tragedy described in the book “The Death of the Kursk”. Its author, Vice-Admiral Valery Ryazantsev, was part of the government commission set up to look into the catastrophe. Ryazantsev’s conclusions didn’t go into the official account, and he was dismissed. We visually explained the Ryazantsev's version, leading the reader through all details of that catastrophe.","English, Finnish",https://projects.storyworks.digital/hiv/,https://projects.storyworks.digital/donors/,https://projects.storyworks.digital/nda,https://projects.storyworks.digital/kursk/,https://tieto-2.culturas.fi/askel-1/,https://projects.storyworks.digital/gold/,,,,
Spain,Relevo,Big,Participant,,Relevo (Equipo de Datos),"Relevo es un medio deportivo que empezó a publicar en redes en mayo y en web en octubre de 2022. En su apuesta por la innovación y el compromiso para una información deportiva de calidad, ha creado un equipo de datos con cuatro integrantes (de periodismo, ingeniería y matemáticas) con una triple misión única en las redacciones deportivas de España: trasladar el _sports analytics_ a narrativas de datos para cambiar la forma de contar el deporte; descubrir a través de los datos los enfoques sociales y brechas en el ámbito deportivo, y complementar con análisis, infografías y visualizaciones de datos las peticiones de la redacción para que en Relevo todos sean capaces de construir historias con datos. 

Los miembros del equipo son: Sara Carmona, redactora jefa de datos, especializada en _Big Data_ deportivo; David Acosta, ingeniero para extracción, automatización y análisis de datos deportivos, y también diseñador; Guillermo Villar, periodista de datos y visualización, y Fran Martínez, matemático y especialista en datos de la liga española.","Los ejemplos del _portfolio_ muestran las noticias más destacadas de los miembros del grupo, tanto historias propias como en colaboración con otros componentes de la redacción. Nuestros trabajos muestran que, en poco más de medio año, hemos sido capaces de hallar las tendencias de los equipos en la liga española; de cubrir un Mundial con periodismo de datos de calidad en vez de con información básica, y de encontrar las historias ocultas en las licencias en deportes como fútbol femenino y pádel. De esta forma, nuestro _portfolio_ enseña que un periodismo de datos con mayor nivel en el deporte es posible a través de las métricas avanzadas y que no todo son los enfoques en el juego sino las desigualdades sociales e hitos históricos detrás.

Con periodismo, analítica de datos, programación (Python y R), diseño gráfico (paquete Adobe) y visualización de datos (Flourish, Datawrapper), nuestras historias, enfocadas al consumo en móvil, han llegado a diferentes audiencias más allá del fútbol tradicional y a la generación Z a través de Twitter, Instagram, TikTok y Twitch. Incluso cuando no se había estrenado la web, ya conseguimos publicaciones virales a través de estas historias.

United Kingdom,The Times & Sunday Times,Big,Participant,,"Venetia Menzies, The Times & Sunday Times","As an economist by training, I always keep in mind the micro and macro perspective. Upon graduation, I wanted to investigate and report on socioeconomic issues, not just from behind a desk looking at the data, but on the ground, fielding human stories and capturing images that would transport the audience and platform the voices of those impacted. This led me to pursue photojournalism, and I worked freelance as a photographer and journalist before securing a job at The Times and Sunday Times. Data journalism and visual storytelling has allowed me to marry both the micro and macro perspectives. Deep dives into the data can examine the scale of an issue, and the voices of case studies, photographs, infographics and video can engage a reader and bring to life the individuals involved. This is the motivation behind my work, and after over a year on the data and digital storytelling team, I hope that the projects submitted herein show variety and a desire to bring both the big and small picture to the reader in an engaging manner.","1 - This piece, produced solely by myself, explored the global state of gay rights. I was motivated to provide a global context on the issue following coverage pinned to the World Cup in Qatar. News organisations are inherently bad at reporting on long-term issues such as gay rights which ‘lack novelty’ and do not ‘have a news line’. I was keen to seize the opportunity provided by the World Cup to explore the issue in depth and delve into the data, platforming those who are domestic activists fighting for change abroad.
2 - In a year of political turmoil, it wasn’t often that I was able to do a deep dive into the data on a light topic. In this article which I also produced independently, I examined the impact of cultural influences on what parents choose to name their children. Famous characters such as Frozen’s Elsa provided inspiration, whereas others are shirking names such as Alexa.
3 - Combining data, photography and writing is what I am most proud of within this article, which was produced with my colleague Ali Mitib and reviewed by social affairs editor James Beal. The disparity in life expectancy between neighbouring areas is most acute in Glasgow, where in some areas men are expected to live to only 68. With exclusive access to data, the piece marries in depth interviews with photography to highlight a longstanding inequity that is worsening. 
4 - Following the Queen’s death, there was a considerable number of stories that examined the Queen’s life. But what about our lives and that of our society? How were they transformed under the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Working with my colleague on the data team Anna Lombardi, we reviewed the key ways in which our country changed during her reign.
5 to 8 - In the months where our country saw two monarchs and three prime ministers, the news agenda was all consuming. These pieces, which I led with the support of my colleagues, aimed to explain to the audience the process of electing a new leader, the policies they were pledging, and how they differed to one another. The quiz, which started with all of the candidates and was whittled down to the remaining two, was the most engaged and viewed project that I completed last year and allowed readers to put aside their presumptions and find out which candidate aligned with their views. 
9 - I led the geolocation and visual storytelling aspects of this project. Eminent journalist Anthony Loyd was investigating what happened to John Cantlie, a British journalist who was kidnapped by IS and used for propaganda videos. Loyd wanted to return to his last known locations in Iraq, and so I geolocated over twenty sites that he was seen at within propaganda films so that Loyd could return on the ground and investigate. This culminated in a podcast series and documentary of the investigation, and for the digital piece I worked with our developer to make a scrolly map that walked you through Cantlie’s last known movements.
10 -We aimed to walk the reader through what happened during the siege of Mariupol, placing them at the location and recreating the destruction of the theatre by bringing together satellite maps, photography from the ground, drone video footage and case studies from those in the city. To identify the exact locations of key areas, photographs and bomb drops, we used general OSINT techniques to match the exact coordinates. I was in charge of the storyboarding of the scrolly, geolocation, sourcing of video and imagery, and research and case study sourcing for the story itself.",English,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-being-gay-is-a-crime-for-a-quarter-of-the-worlds-population-8s7tckzlv,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/baby-names-tell-us-a-lot-about-the-times-we-live-in-65rzrlgz5,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rising-death-rates-in-poor-areas-blamed-on-austerity-fvgcztp5q,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/queen-elizabeths-reign-in-charts-how-has-britain-changed-j9hxs65zc,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/who-will-decide-next-prime-minister-tory-conservative-membership-demographics-pww3v95r0,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/which-tory-leadership-candidate-do-you-support-xcpx0nw8w,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnsons-resignation-the-chaos-explained-in-charts-and-graphs-w8pjtpfld,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-great-british-pledge-off-totting-up-the-campaign-promises-p2jj29vxl,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/what-happened-to-john-cantlie-my-hunt-for-the-forgotten-isis-hostage-v8wt08sfg,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/50329e3a-b754-11ec-b9c2-2038a863bceb
Spain,DATADISTA,Small,Participant,,DATADISTA,"DATADISTA es un medio de comunicación español especializado en periodismo de investigación, datos y nuevas narrativas. Fue fundado en 2016 por los periodistas Ana Tudela y Antonio Delgado, ambos con más de 20 años de experiencia en el sector.

Ana Tudela está especializada en investigación económica y en nuevas narrativas. Ha sido redactora de El Economista, Público, El Español, colaboradora de elDiario.es, Jot Down y Vanity Fair, y jefa de contenidos de Forbes España. Es profesora de investigación en el máster de periodismo de investigación, datos y visualización de Unidad Editorial. 
Antonio Delgado es periodista especializado en periodismo de datos y visualización y profesor de periodismo de datos desde 2012 en diferentes másteres: Periodismo de El País; Periodismo de investigación, datos y visualización de Unidad Editorial; Periodismo Multiplataforma de CNN Loyola...

DATADISTA trabaja para aportar en los ángulos muertos que el periodismo generalista se ha ido dejando por el camino. Es un medio para gente que quiere entender, no reafirmarse en sus opiniones. Apostamos por temas de importancia social como el medioambiente, la sanidad o las cuentas públicas, entendiendo el periodismo como servicio público. Nuestra filosofía se basa en que, detrás de cada proyecto, haya un trabajo periodístico serio y profundo. Dedicamos buena parte del esfuerzo a lograr que llegue al mayor número posible de personas, utilizando todas las narrativas a nuestro alcance. 

Nuestra primera investigación, Playa Burbuja, una investigación transmedia sobre los efectos de la burbuja inmobiliaria en la costa mediterránea peninsular, así como la corrupción y los desastres medioambientales que provocó, sumó más de 15.000 kilómetros recorridos durante dos años, más de un centenar de entrevistas y numerosa documentación inédita. La publicación del libro, financiada mediante crowdfunding, fue recogida por numerosos medios.

Fuimos seleccionados en el programa de innovación de Google DNI Fund para el desarrollo de la plataforma Hiperia, para la gestión de proyectos de investigación basados en peticiones de información pública y datos abiertos. En 2019 realizamos, junto con RTVE, el especial #Losdatoshablan, proyecto de análisis de datos y visualizaciones interactivas para las Elecciones Generales del 28A y 10N en España.

En octubre de ese año, después de 9 meses de trabajo, publicamos la investigación más completa realizada sobre las causas y consecuencias del desastre medioambiental del Mar Menor, publicado simultáneamente en elDiario.es y La Sexta. Esta investigación fue seleccionada por la Global Investigative Journalism Network entre las mejores investigaciones de 2019 en español y fue medalla de plata en Especiales en los premios ÑH2020, que reconocen los mejores diseños periodísticos de España, Portugal y América Latina. El galardón se une a las 4 medallas de bronce ganadas en los ÑH2019 por los especiales de investigación y datos: Desmontando El Algarrobico, Presupuestos Participativos de Madrid, En deuda con Gallardón y Los Datos Hablan.

Durante la pandemia, realizamos un trabajo de monitorización y visualización de datos y análisis de legislación asociada. También creamos un repositorio de datos en GitHub donde publicamos decenas de datasets, extraídos de fuentes oficiales y depurados, para facilitar el seguimiento de la pandemia en España. Estos datasets han sido utilizados en una decena de papers científicos.

En 2020, participamos con análisis de datos, visualizaciones y animaciones en el documental interactivo ""Parir en el siglo XXI” de la productora Barret, RTVE y À Punt. Entre los numerosos premios recibidos, se incluye el Premio World Press Photo 2021 en la categoría de Digital Storytelling.

En 2021 publicamos la investigación ""España Intensiva"" sobre el impacto
de la Política Agrícola Común en el olivar y la ganadería porcina. Este trabajo, publicado simultáneamente en elDiario.es, recibió una mención especial en los premios Ortega y Gasset de periodismo 2022.","A lo largo de 2022, nos hemos centrado en investigar en profundidad la contaminación de acuíferos y territorios debido a múltiples factores como la ganadería y agricultura intensiva y su afectación a grandes ecosistemas como el Parque Natural de Doñana, el Mar Menor o las Tablas de Daimiel. El aumento de la inflación nos hizo analizar en datos y recorrer el país sobre el terreno para mostrar el rostro de las personas que cobran la pensión mínima. 
En ese contexto de escalada de precios, especialmente el de los carburantes, lanzamos, como servicio público, un mapa interactivo totalmente automatizado que se actualiza en tiempo real, con el precio de todas las gasolineras del país y que permite búsqueda por dirección y geolocalización. Ha sido citado en medios como El Español.

La investigación “El oscuro rastro en el agua del negocio de la carne barata” es un trabajo conjunto de Antonio Delgado y Ana Tudela que, siguiendo el camino de proyectos anteriores, se centra en la situación de la ganadería intensiva en Aragón, sus orígenes, consecuencias de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, la contaminación de las aguas e incluso el efecto en el agua del grifo. España es el tercer productor mundial de porcino en el mundo y Aragón, una de las regiones con mayor concentración de macrogranjas del país. Se trata de un trabajo de datos, documentación y sobre el terreno, con visualizaciones, mapas e imágenes que analiza, entre otros muchos aspectos, por primera vez 1,8 millones de parcelas para demostrar la sobrefertilización de tierras con purines y muestra a vista de dron, igualmente por primera vez, los purines frescos extendidos junto a las macrogranjas.

Se explica el modelo de integración, las ayudas públicas y la implicación de las administraciones, analiza las cuentas de las grandes empresas integradoras del sector, sus entramados empresariales y las causas de su expansión por la despoblada región; detalla los acuerdos con los granjeros y logra testimonios sobre la presión que sufren por parte de las integradoras.

United States,USA TODAY,Big,Participant,,Aleszu Bajak,"To the judges:

Aleszu Bajak exemplifies the best qualities of a data journalist. He gravitates to cutting-edge social science techniques, contacts experts in the field for ideas and brings them to bear on important questions in the news. Those qualities shone brightly in 2022, starting with Broken Adoptions, USA TODAY’s groundbreaking examination of how and why parents walk away from children they agreed to make their own. 

We learned early on that no one had quantified how many U.S. adoptions fail. Building on work of previous USA TODAY reporters, Aleszu scoured the obscure Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, or AFCARS. The multi-million-record database shows the status of each child in foster care each year, including whether a child was previously adopted. Although unique identifiers are meant to link records across years, Aleszu found states inconsistent about flagging a kid’s past adoption and preserving IDs. Any responsible estimate required painstakingly weeding out nonsensical cases, such as those that went from “Adopted” to “Never adopted” in one year.

Tallying up 66,000 failed adoptions was only the start, however. Aleszu wanted to know why they failed. The breakthrough came when he unearthed a study finding 16 states with reliable IDs in AFCARS over time. Suddenly, we could track trips from foster care to adoption and back with confidence. Aleszu decided to see what happened to a cohort adopted from 2008 to 2010. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, Aleszu found statistically significant, independent risk factors predicting failure. The results might help child welfare workers know which kids need the most support at the time of adoption placement. Yet no one had done this analysis to tell them.

The reporting begged one last question. Why did states so frequently delete child identifiers from AFCARS, seemingly breaking from guidance laid down for this federally funded database? It was one of those irritating data flaws that, in this case, had newsworthy consequences. Aleszu tracked down the bureaucrat who designed AFCARS three decades ago, and she had a lot to say. Through this and other historical research, Aleszu showed how a deliberately obfuscated dataset undermines our ability to see whether billions in adoption subsidies are working.

In the second half of the year, Aleszu turned his lens on politics. He used Crowdtangle and the Twitter API to collect social media posts from 1,500 congressional campaign accounts in 2022. Then he examined phrases that rose and fell in frequency based on party to reveal trends. Later, at a summer residency with Vienna’s Complexity Science Hub, Aleszu learned of a technique called hierarchical clustering. It can identify shared linguistic patterns among speakers. Aleszu quickly pointed the algorithm at our campaign database, surfacing first-time candidates with the most in common with well-known incumbents Marjorie Taylor Greene and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He then added historical perspective by tackling a decade of congressional tweets. With graphics specialist Ramon Padilla, Aleszu showed how shared Republican- Democratic Twitter clusters declined as partisans sorted themselves into like-minded camps.

I am pleased to recommend Aleszu Bajak’s body of work for your consideration.

Sincerely,

This is a detailed visual presentation of all Aleszu's findings. Using Google Big Query and R, he wrangled the massive Adoption and Foster Care Analysis Reporting System database containing millions of records over a decade. In theory, database should make it possible to easily identify kids in foster care who landed there after a failed adoption. But USA TODAY data reporters who worked with the data previously found the data quality questionable. Building on their work, Aleszu created tests, in an abundance of caution, to eliminate potential false positives. Aleszu also located a researcher who examined data quality state by state, giving us a list of 16 that made longitudinal tracking of kids possible. He followed what happened to a cohort of kids adopted from foster care 2008-2010, using Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the impact of key risk factors such as race and mental health diagnoses.

[Broken adoptions, buried records](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/05/19/bad-data-accountability-adoption-subsidies/9722162002/). Aleszu's reporting showed how the failure of states to preserve unique IDs, a technical flaw many people would find ho-hum, means no one can account for whether or not $3 billion in annual adoption subsidies are working. He traced the history of the federal government's foster care database, tracked down its designer, dug through audits of state data quality and examined failed attempts to penalize states that did badly. Penelope Maza, a statistician who prompoted the federal data effort to states in the 1990s, told Aleszu: “If they thought there was a penalty, they’d improve their data.”

Marjorie Taylor Greene's matches used terms such as ""southern border,"" ""free speech,"" and ""God bless.""

Philippines,ABS-CBN News,Big,Participant,,ABS-CBN News,"This portfolio represents journalistic efforts to seek the truth and tell it, despite challenges and uncertainty, especially when this truth is essential for citizens to decide about their future. 

Truth does not always win. Yet, in dire circumstances such as what many journalists find themselves in, in a place like the Philippines, there is something to be said for insisting on telling the story. 

People have been calling the Philippines the ‘Ground Zero’ of mis/ disinformation because its heavy use of social media has made it a potent incubation point for the atomic-bomb-like explosion of false news in its information ecosystem. 

There is no solid proof that there were Cambridge Analytica operations here, at least not in the way that was described and documented by the whistleblower Christopher Wylie. But in the last 6 or 7 years, numerous studies and anecdotal evidence have pointed to systematic operations perpetuated by vested interest groups to weaken democratic institutions (demonize journalists and civil right advocates, shake down certain groups or businesses), and sway the result of elections. 

The May 2022 elections when the Philippines installed a president, a vice president, hundreds of legislators and thousand others for local posts, were very important historically, and one that may have been informed and influenced by massive mis- / disinformation on social media, as our stories indicated. 

Our team spent months working on a series of special reports auditing the Facebook presence of those running for president; on Facebook because this is the most influential social media platform in the Philippines. 

Adding complications to the work is the fact that our organization, ABS-CBN News, has been denied in 2020 a franchise to operate our fleet of free television and radio stations, and related businesses. 

Once the Philippines’ biggest and most profitable broadcasting company operating an award-winning powerhouse of a newsroom that produces the country’s top primetime news, ABS-CBN went into an election year in 2022 without any of its dozens of free TV and radion stations, as these all had to be shuttered. 
 
ABS-CBN nearly starved to death with the loss of its broadcast ad revenues, and was struggling to keep afloat with about two-thirds of its resources and manpower gone. 

Against this background, remaining journalists who were spared from retrenchment like us decided to go on, be business-as-usual, but extra. We researched extensively and made good with what resources we could muster; we dug deep for data, and put out the story.","**Project team: **

The contest for the Philippine presidency may have been decided on May 9, 2022 but the battle for people’s hearts and minds on social media appeared to have started six years earlier, way before Filipinos even casted their votes. 

Interactions on Facebook over the past six years and in the months leading to the 2022 polls revealed how some candidates or their supporters and critics used Facebook to create buzz, and push or shape narratives.

The reports we produced covered the 5 main candidates for president who had the biggest following and activities on Facebook: Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the son and namesake of the deposed dictator who declared martial law in the Philippines exactly 50 years ago; then incumbent Vice President Leni Robredo; boxing superstar and later senator Manny Pacquiao; actor-turned-Manila-mayor 'Isko Moreno' Domagoso; and former police chief and later senator Ping Lacson. 

A couple of days after the election, when there was a clear frontrunner for the Senate contest, we published the research on the Facebook performance of Robin Padilla, the actor who had the biggest Facebook footprint who also turned out to be the Senate candidate with the highest number of votes. 

Our research for each candidate, done at least half a year, stretched all the way to data from 2016 when Marcos Jr. lost the vice presidency to Robredo. Even at the time, there appeared to be traces of groundwork that were being laid down for political narratives that would surface and be prominent 6 years later. 

Our stories yielded about 200,000 interactions on social media – likes, comments, shares, as well as exposure via posts by accounts with millions of followers and likes. 

Though we were able to use Python to surface and study patterns in the behavior of social media accounts and pages, there were thousands of these actors, and there were millions of interactions that had to be parsed so we can decipher their modus operandi. 

Each social media account or page suspected of inauthentic behavior had to be tracked offline, the identities and other related information of their administrators investigated, and their side of the story asked and documented. 

In the end, we were able to refer to Facebook dozens of suspicious pages and accounts for investigation. 

But a highlight was when our efforts led to the discovery and eventual takedown from Facebook of an account that posed as a radio station, had even managed to get itself verified, and had instigated millions of interactions by provocative posts containing disinformation to favor one candidate.",English,https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/05/02/22/marcos-content-spreads-via-super-sharers-on-facebook,https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/05/02/22/marcos-has-biggest-facebook-footprint-since-2016,https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/05/02/22/isko-morenos-presence-on-facebook-grew-massively-quickly-after-2019,https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/05/03/22/pacquiaos-fb-page-remains-biggest-among-all-presl-bets,https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/05/03/22/robredo-has-high-numbers-on-facebook-but-most-are-criticisms,https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/05/05/22/ping-lacsons-fb-page-grows-steadily-but-not-at-par-in-size-with-competitors,https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/05/12/22/robin-padilla-has-biggest-fb-presence-among-top-senate-bets,,,
Philippines,Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism,Small,Participant,,Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism,"To the judges of the Sigma Awards 2023:

The Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) is an independent, nonprofit newsroom that specializes in investigative reporting. It was founded in 1989 by nine Filipino journalists who realized, from their years in the beat and at the news desk, the need for newspapers and broadcast agencies to go beyond day-to-day reportage.
 
The PCIJ believes that the media play a crucial role in scrutinizing and strengthening democratic institutions and defending and asserting press freedom. The media could -- and should -- be a catalyst for social debate that would redound to the promotion of public welfare. 

The stories we are nominating in this application reflects PCIJ’s commitment to contribute to this end by investigating largely underreported issues in the Philippines.

Campaign finance, the subject of our entry, is an important, if not the most important aspect, of any electoral exercise. One’s capacity to run for office is largely hinged on their access to resources. Raising and spending of money in elections has implications beyond election day; it has links that may predict or define how a candidate or a political party will govern. 

However, although substantial improvement has happened in the last decade, media coverage of the money flow during elections leaves a big room for improvement. The Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility’s (CMFR) election monitoring reports of the 2016 and 2010 presidential elections show that campaign finance does not get a lot of coverage in mainstream news. 

“Dominated by reports from the campaign trail, the daily feed from the field failed to provide helpful information about the candidate,” the CMFR observed of the 2016 election coverage. “Embedded media clearly failed to get more facetime with the candidate, which they could have used to get deeper into issues.”

CMFR’s observation reflects longstanding challenges: The 24-hour news cycle, the pressure to publish along with the difficult process of obtaining and analyzing voluminous campaign-finance records and lack of usable data leave a big gap in terms of what reporters can investigate. 

PCIJ covers campaign finance all-year round recognizing that the election cycle does not stop once candidates are proclaimed. This began in 2007 when election watchdogs and media groups like PCIJ formed the Pera at Pulitika (PAP) (Money and Politics) Consortium to review how and why candidates spend huge sums of money to get elected. 

The coverage of campaign finance in the Philippines, although far from ideal, has since come a long way, from being ignored to becoming a key part of public discourse. The use of money to win a seat in public office was no longer just a topic of discussion among political scientists and election experts, but even among ordinary people. Most important, the work done by civil society complemented by media covering these activities also helped push the demand for the country’s Commission on Elections to take on concrete steps to institutionalize campaign-finance work. 

Like most initiatives dependent on funding, PAP is no longer existent at least in formal terms. But the same groups continue to do the work and PCIJ has followed the money every election year. The reports PCIJ produced inspired by this effort have contributed to a deeper understanding of campaign finance, uncovering who’s backing presidents, conflict of interests between donor and donee, prohibited contributions, erring candidates as well as failure to regulate and enforce laws of the country’s poll body.

The series of reports that we are entering is the latest in this long-term endeavor of PCIJ to bring campaign finance high on the election agenda.

Thank you for reading our work.

Respectfully,

Karol Ilagan
Editorial Director, PCIJ","To the judges of the Sigma Awards 2023:

In May 2022, roughly 31 million Filipinos entrusted the two highest positions in the country to children of strongmen. The son and namesake of a dictator became president, while the daughter of a self-proclaimed murderer became vice president. Despite the fact that their family histories are tainted by plunder and murder, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. and Sara Duterte managed to outrun their demonstrably capable rivals. It was a stark example of power begetting power.

But who funded their run for office?

This is one of many questions that the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) tried to answer in its scrutiny of campaign-finance records submitted by the candidates. 

Our reporting reveals interesting findings:

1.The successful presidential campaign of Marcos Jr. was funded by cronies of his father, the country’s late dictator and his namesake, and by today’s opulent names in the real estate, retail, construction and shipping industries. They also include owners of firms barred by law from making political contributions.

2.Sara Duterte meanwhile stands out for becoming vice president without spending any cash. She only reported receiving in-kind donations, coming political parties, senatorial candidates, and a realty firm owned by a contractor and an appointee of her father. 

3.Leni Robredo’s donors tells a different story. Only one in five of her donors gave P10 million ($183,000) and above. The rest came from a long list of relatively small donors. This is a departure from presidential candidates who always reported receiving the bulk of their donations from just a few but big donors. 

Still and all, the recent elections kept the unbroken pattern every three years – a round robin among political families as if public service was a cottage industry. Most of all, we found that it wasn’t only well-oiled disinformation machineries that supposedly laid the foundation for the Marcoses’ return to Malacañang, we identified the people who funded it. This information will be useful as we cover the Marcos presidency – who will win contracts and get favors?

These findings would not have been uncovered without poring over hundreds of paper records, encoding them in spreadsheets, and analyzing rows and columns of data. We first spent around three months negotiating with the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to allow us to get a hold of the Statement of Contributions and Expenditures. The piecemeal release of these records ate up a lot of time. The redactions made on the records did not help as well.

The practical challenges we faced in the 2022 Elections is reflective of the long-term problem hounding Comelec as well. The need to level the playing field and enhance transparency in the use of money in elections has been recognized in laws dating back to the 1970s, but serious steps to regulate campaign finance were not taken until the last decade.

The difficulty in accessing records for instance is mainly due to the poll body’s Campaign Finance Office (CFO) lacking in key personnel. With only job-order employees and a few lawyers, the CFO has its work cut out for it. 

This is the big hurdle that PCIJ as well as many journalists in the Philippines face in terms of covering campaign finance. Although far from ideal, it has come a long way. While news coverage has included money matters such as vote-buying, the last decade has seen a gradual shift in the media’s focus on the influence of money in politics and vice-versa. We hope to continue this kind of coverage alongside tracking the development of the poll body’s CFO.

Since then, we have produced eighty projects, ranging from factual investigative pieces to historical, sports, scientific, health and climate-related topics. The team currently consists of three people, with many occasional contributors. Átló is currently still the only platform of its kind in Hungary. In addition to articles and projects, we also produce educational and scientific outreach work, and the materials of our lectures and workshops are available free of charge on our website.","This year we are submitting our 2022 portfolio. We were expecting a busy year because of the elections, and this year it was also our biggest and most complex work. With our elections site, we not only offered visitors continously updated content for the April elections, but also processed data for all parliamentary elections since 2006. You can see the results in more than a hundred graphics on the site. On election day, we had hundreds of thousands of readers, and most of the opinions said our content was the most comprehensive, complex and understandable in Hungary. We have also made all the data we used and processed available for download. This year's important investigative piece, which has been covered on television and radio channels too, was about the creation, operation and finances of the pro-government Facebook empire. What makes it special is that the investigation and research was carried out by a media researcher and a sociologist. Also an example of collaboration with academics is the Lutheran Network, which we produced with two well known historians. It is about the inhuman deportation of the Hungarian population after the First World War from the county of Szepes, what is now in Slovakia. Our public service work this year was a map of teachers' protests, which we updated over months with parents sympathetic to the teachers' desperate plight. The impact can be illustrated by the fact that many teachers in many schools decided to take part in the civil disobedience after seeing the map. Our long-standing wish has come true by finally collecting in one place the small, static, uniformly designed graphics we created for our mother, Átlátszó. Alongside these, we helped Budapest and the small 18th district to explore snippets of its history, and we also produced a piece on the history of Formula 1 and the history of football World Cup.",Hungarian,https://medium.com/@attilabatorfy/2022-atlos-year-in-review-56ebbba19982,http://adatvizualizacio.bparchiv.hu/budapestiutcanevek/,https://atlo.team/valasztas2022-eredmenyek/,https://atlo.team/magyarorszag-klimaja-otven-ev-mulva/,https://atlo.team/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/tuntetesterkep.html,https://atlo.team/ner-metaverzum/,https://atlo.team/lutheranus-halo/,https://atlo.team/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/vebetortenelem.html,https://www.bp18ker.hu/interaktiv-terkepek/,https://atlo.team/orbis/

Spain,Maldita.es,Small,Participant,,Maldito Dato,"Maldito Dato es la sección de Maldita.es especializada en periodismo de datos. Maldita.es es una fundación y medio sin ánimo de lucro en español especializado en lucha contra la desinformación y promoción de la transparencia, entre otros asuntos. Maldito Dato es fundamental dentro de Maldita.es utilizando el periodismo de datos no sólo para contar historias, sino también para realizar investigaciones, verificar el discurso público y político y poner el foco en la transparencia de las Administraciones y Gobiernos.

Maldito Dato, que existe desde la creación de Maldita.es en 2018, es un referente en España en el uso del derecho de acceso, la ley de transparencia y los datos abiertos. La sección está formada por un equipo de cinco periodistas de datos y ha sido galardonada con diferentes premios en España, como el premio GO! a la Difusión de la Transparencia (en 2020 y 2021) o el premio de Open Data de la Junta de Castilla y León (en 2021 y 2022).

Las bases de Maldito Dato siempre han sido claras: periodismo de datos y uso de la ley de transparencia para revelar información relevante desconocida por la sociedad. En 2022, además, ha ido un paso más allá aplicando aún más sus dos principales herramientas para hacer periodismo de investigación. 

Este año Maldito Dato ha publicado grandes investigaciones basadas en periodismo de datos, como 'Destino España', junto a Planta Baixa (TV3), 'Los negacionistas de Telegram', en solitario, o 'La red europea de los corona-negacionistas', junto a Correctiv. Tres grandes investigaciones basadas en trabajo de periodismo de datos y de gran recorrido y aliento, que se han realizado y publicado en un solo año. 

La primera de ellas, 'Destino España', basada en el uso de la ley transparencia y las solicitudes de información a Administraciones y Gobiernos para poder conseguir las bases de datos necesarias para poder investigar, analizar y revelar que había ocurrido en los aeropuertos españoles tras la pandemia.

La segunda, 'Los negacionistas de Telegram', basada en programación y scraping para poder obtener una base de datos con los mensajes de 39 canales de Telegram desinformadores durante más de dos años. Una base de datos con más de medio millón de mensajes que permitió ver realmente cómo actúaban y qué mensajes enviaban de una forma sistémica gracias al periodismo de datos.

Por último, la tercera, 'La red europea de los corona-negacionistas', de nuevo, una investigación basada en periodismo de datos, pero, de nuevo, con una base distinta a las otras dos. Si la primera nace de la transparencia y la segunda del scraping, en esta ocasión el equipo de Maldito Dato, junto a los compañeros de Correctiv, creó desde cero su propia base de datos con multitud de variables sobre los distintos grupos negacionistas durante la pandemia a nivel europeo para poder investigar sus relaciones, conexiones y 'modus operandi' a nivel trasnacional.

El equipo de Maldito Dato ha demostrado a lo largo de 2022 una gran labor de investigación basada en periodismo de datos y lo ha aplicado de distintas formas: a partir de Transparencia, de scrapping, creando sus propias bases de datos, etcétera. Además, su trabajo ha dado un gran salto cualitativo, ya no sólo haciendo un gran trabajo diario y de actualidad con periodismo de datos, aplicándolo al fact-checking u obteniendo datos con solicitudes de información, sino que ha utilizado de una forma magitral la obtención, análisis y visualización de datos para realizar distitnas investigaciones periodísticas fundamentales para un medio como Maldita.es, para nuestro público y lectores y para nuestros objetivos como fundación y medio sin ánimo de lucro que intenta beneficiar a la sociedad con su trabajo.","Nuestro porfolio durante 2022 no consta únicamente de esas investigaciones. Está formado por todo el trabajo de la sección a lo largo del año, aplicando el periodismo de datos a investigaciones de largo recorrido, pero también, por ejemplo, al fact-checking. En 2022 hemos verificado lo que dicen los políticos y hemos puesto contexto en los temas que preocupaban a la sociedad española. Hemos verificado los principales debates políticos que ha habido y hemos hecho cobertura de las elecciones que se han celebrado este año en nuestro país, las de Andalucía y Castilla y León.

Además, hemos tratado temas de actualidad y de preocupación para la sociedad, intentando poner luz a través del periodismo de datos y aportando nuevos enfoques. Como, por ejemplo, cuando analizamos los datos de desplazamientos en jet privado en Europea en los tres últimos años y explicamos cómo uno de cada cinco eran viajes de menos de 300 kilómetros. Otro trabajo interesante de periodismo de datos que hemos hecho este 2022 ha sido un análisis de cuáles municipios de España se vacían y cuáles se llenan durante el verano, un tema que fue muy difundido y leído debido a su enfoque novedoso.

Nuestra labor de periodismo de datos también la empleamos para fiscalizar a nuestros Gobiernos y representantes públicos. Este 2022 creamos nuestra propia base de datos sobre los decretos leyes aprobados por los Gobiernos de la democracia. Esta herramienta legislativa permite a los Gobiernos estar menos fiscalizados por el Congreso. Gracias a esa base de datos y a su análisis pudimos explicar que el actual presidente ya ha utilizado más los decretos que sus predecesores o que la mayoría de veces que el Congreso pide que esos decretos sean modificados para poder introducir algún cambio esto no acaba sucediendo. Del abuso de esta figura se ha hablado bastante en España, pero nunca se había hecho un análisis a ese nivel histórico y de detalle. Además, publicamos nuestra base de datos en abierto, como hacemos en multitud de ocasiones. 

Temas de este tipo, basados en periodismo de datos y con la intención de fiscalizar a Gobiernos, son el grueso del porfolio de Maldito Dato. Este 2022 también revelamos, tras obtener los datos tras multitud de solicitudes vía Transparencia, cuántas donaciones y de quién las habían recibido distintos Gobiernos que en España abrieron cuentas para pedir dinero contra la pandemia. Había grandes donativos de empresas y partidos políticos.

Otro ejemplo son las informaciones que publicamos tras investigar el acceso al aborto en la Comunidad de Madrid. Conseguimos los datos de los abortos que notifican los médicos y pudimos ver que un tercio de las mujeres se tienen que pagar sus propios abortos y que estas interrupciones del embarazo apenas se hacen en centros sanitarios públicos.

Estas informaciones redundan en el otro gran pilar de Maldito Dato más allá del periodismo de datos: la transparencia y el derecho de acceso. O dicho de otro modo: en nuestro objetivo de conseguir mediante solicitudes bases de datos para revelar información que la sociedad española desconozca. La labor que intentamos hacer en Maldito Dato es poner luz gracias al periodismo de datos y la transparencia y creemos que la hemos acrecentado en 2022. 

Otro ejemplo es la publicación que hemos hecho sobre gestación subrogada. Revelamos cuántos bebés españoles han nacido en el extranjero por esta vía tras obtener la información de los consulados españoles. De hecho, una novedad de este 2022, es que ahora Maldito Dato en algunos casos acude a la Justicia para luchar por los datos que creemos que deben ser públicos y el Gobierno se niega a dar.",Spanish,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220324/destino-espana/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221227/negacionistas-telegram/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220805/ciudades-desiertas-abarrotadas-julio-agosto-turistas/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221121/bebes-vientres-alquiler-gestacion-heterosexuales/,https://maldita.es/tag/decretos-sanchez,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220929/datos-jet-privados-espana/,https://maldita.es/tag/aborto-comunidad-madrid,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221229/informaciones-periodisticas-maldito-dato-transparencia-2022/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221230/informaciones-periodismo-datos-maldito-dato-2022/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/

What inspires me to tell compelling stories is the desire for change. As a Nigerian, storytelling is the only way things can turn around for the better in Nigeria. And the economic and societal conditions is that trigger to help inform, educate, liberate the citizens while exposing government ills. Some of the reports shared in this current portfolio of mine are attempts to use data journalism to cause change. Some reveal the ineptitude of givernment and corporations while others, use data to simplify and tell compelling stories to educate, inform, liberate and cause a positibve change in action, especially now that elections are approaching.","1. In Lagos, Nigeria, a city of over 22 million people, accommodation is more than just a problem- it is a huge thing of worry. Several people do not have where to stay and are forced to roam the streets, sleep under bridges, fall into crime and compromise themselves and their values, just because accommodation in the city is both scarce and very expensive.

Getting a basic studio flat apartment or a one bedroom, is difficult, as well as finding the right amenities, or even funding to be able to put down between N500,000- N700,000 (around $400 or more) to afford the most basic living facility. This has led to situations of inequalities, and the heightened inflation plus global shock in the world, hasn't made the matter any better.

As with the spirit of good storytelling, this story utilises interactive infographics, pictures and analysis to deconstruct what this means to its audience while tackling the government's faux idea of low cost housing.

2. While Lagosians battle lack of accommodation, a carefully curated data from year media reports showed how 10 buildings have collapsed between November 2021 till October 2022, which is a year period. In 2022, nine buildings collapsed; eight were under the past commissioner for the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development, Salako, while one is under the current commissioner, Omotayo Bamgbose-Martins. 28 deaths were tracked by the ICIR from February 2022 till October 2022.

3. The data report spotlights how air travel delays have impacted customers trust in Nigerian airlines. It singled out Air Peace, Max and Arik Air as the airlines with the most delays while Overland, Dana and Azman Air were the airlines with the most percentage of delays. This data is a trend data showing how unreliable Nigerian airlines are and the reason for code share trips to stop frustrating travellers.

4. This story delves into why Nigerian airlines are known to be unrelaible. With series of data about the planes Nigeria airlines use, sourced from Planespotter and with the help of experts, we used data to tell a story of how the issue of grounded fleet affects airlines schedules and cause flight delays. This story led to the grouding of Aero and Dana for a few safety audits for three months.

5. This story uses infographic and media reports to track the number of music artistes that show up late and analyse how it has become a problem for show goers in the country. It also engages experts to seek out a solution to the endemic for Nigerian fun lovers. It caused media professionals to weight into the matter with one of the singers offering an apology later for his lateness.

6. Over the years, the desire to get a body enhancement surgery, otherwise known as a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) surgery has pushed many Nigerian women to their deaths. At least, five women between 2019 and 2022 in Nigeria, have suffered either death or deformity via these procedures and one particular doctor, Dr Anuoluwapo Adepoju has been found guilty of botched procedures in Nigeria, my country. It got great feedback from readers who felt informed thereafter

7. This story uses data to argue for and against why sugar tax should be levied on drinks. As well Its impact and whether Nigeria's Finance Minister was just taxing for funds or health reasons. The story is a contribution to the argument on taxation in Nigeria and had a few people reach out to myself and the ICIR on how important the story was and helped them to make better decisions.",English,https://www.icirnigeria.org/woes-travails-of-securing-good-housing-in-lagos/,https://www.icirnigeria.org/timeline-eight-buildings-collapse-under-ex-lagos-commissioners-watch/,https://www.icirnigeria.org/overland-air-peace-max-air-others-top-nigerias-2021-delayed-cancelled-flights/,https://www.icirnigeria.org/special-report-nigeria-tops-list-of-grounded-aircraft-fleets-globally/,https://www.icirnigeria.org/indepth-eight-nigerian-artistes-that-turned-up-late-for-their-shows/,https://www.icirnigeria.org/inside-the-world-of-nigerian-women-and-body-enhancing-surgeries/,https://factcheckhub.com/does-excessive-sugar-cause-diabetes-analysing-nigerias-claim-for-taxing-sugar-beverages/,,,
Pakistan,The Express Tribune,Small,Participant,,Shazia Mehboob,"I am a freelance journalist based in Islamabad with over a decade long working experience in leading print and digital media outlets i.e. The Express Tribune, Dawn, The News, Naya Daur, and The Reporters.pk. I have published more than 350 investigative reports, in-depth features, columns, and news reports covering a wide range of issues including governance, corruption, disparities in treatment of women & religious minorities, gender-based abuse, impact of poverty on children, and climate change, particularly focusing on human interest issues. Currently, I am leading an online news platform ‘ThePenPk.com’ as founder and editor which is particularly focusing on public interest issues.


Before establishing my own digital media platform, I was staff member of The Express Tribune, The Nation, and International News Network. I am also involved in teaching and research activities with Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad and Allama Iqbal Open University, and delivered lectures at Fatima Jinnah Women University. I did M.Phil in International Relations in 2018.

I grew up in a remote village in district of Mansehra, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
My own education and career has entailed many ups and downs because of socio-economic and cultural barriers. This, in many ways, has given me the motivation to set an example for others on what can be achieved with persistence and determination and often taking ‘no- for- no’ approach whilst impelling me to become a ‘voice of voiceless.’


Through my journalistic pursuits, today I am in a unique position to influence state policy and implementation, raise public awareness and engagement through my investigative reports on myriads of political and socio-economic issues, which have generated debate at policy level, led to government-level initiatives, and led to involvement of civil society, NGOs, and major stakeholders to take heed of the issue.

For example:

In 2021, I published an investigative feature highlighting the inability of public sector universities to recruit qualified staff even though there were more than 1,000 PhDs scholars jobless in the country, being denied opportunities by prevalent nepotism in the system of hiring. This report was awarded the ‘Aghai Award’. 
https://tribune.com.pk/story/2290500/more-degrees-more-problems

In the same year, my story on two Zob-Balochistan students who were campaigning for books donations to establish a library as there was no library in the entire district. One of the country's prestigious institutions, after my report, approached the students and financed them to establish a digital library.
https://tribune.com.pk/story/2287840/an-oasis-of-knowledge-in-zhob

In 2020, my story on an engineering graduate forced to sell fruit at a roadside for not having a suitable job went viral on social media and generated a much needed debate on challenges faced by young graduates. Following this, two companies approached me for his contact details. He is now working for one of them in a role reflective of his specialism.
https://nayadaur.tv/2020/08/nust-graduate-forced-to-set-up-fruit-stall-due-to-lockdown/

In 2019, my investigative report into the difficulties experienced by residents of Islamabad (country’s capital) to access safe water and sanitisation due to the stifling mismanagement of the concerning authorities, inter-departmental bureaucratic wrangles and power struggles. The report was awarded ‘Journalism for Equitable Asia’. 
https://www.dawn.com/news/1521124

My investigative report into the growing trend of ‘crystal meth’ stimulant use by young people in educational institutions in 2019, not only helped to draw attention to the issue but successfully pushed the authorities into action to introduce measures required to prevent and curtail the use of harmful substances in higher education institutions.
https://tribune.com.pk/story/1890319/1890319

Another story included the pressing issue of ‘out-of-school children’ which went on to win Aghai Award 2020.

My journalistic career has mainly focused toward public interest journalism and solution journalism as evident from the published work.","In Pakistan, women experience acute inequalities due to age old social and cultural norms and customs, patriarchal setup, entrenched political instability and ineffective public policies. Their lack of voice in political, economic and social spheres means that very little coverage is given to issues pertinent to their plight. Demographically, women outnumber men in country’s population index yet no priority is given to their development. Successive governments for too long have overlooked their needs in education, health and releasing of their potentials. Education general scores low in country’s budget allocation thus further exacerbating gender imbalance.


Project 1: Pakistan has among the world's lowest literacy rate and lack of women's active participation in political, economic and civic spheres is one of the major reasons for country’s subject political culture and its sluggish economy performance. The current makeup of Pakistan’s parliament is only 21 percent female. In the National Assembly, which consists of 342 members, female representation is only around 3 percent.


Project 2: Despite the existence of a strong law concerning domestic violence, most victims find themselves without protection because the implementation is circumvented by outside influence and interference, poor execution of courts’ decisions, and lack of honesty, dedication and will of enforcers. 

Project 3: Women with disabilities in particular are often considered a burden. They not only suffer from disabilities but also struggle with accessing education and employment opportunities. Options for marriage for this group are few since they struggle to achieve social acceptance. Gendered discrimination is widespread but there is little being done by the state and development sector in this regard.

Project 4: Abortions are a growing practice in Pakistan and the rate of compromised abortions is also increasing owing to multiple factors which include untrained mid-wives, illegal abortions, legal and religious limitations, unplanned pregnancies, ignorance of family planning and self-medication.
 
Project 5: Large majority of working women are victims of harassment but are forced to continue their jobs in hostile working environments. Those who are able to take a stand are confronted by numerous challenges. Victims bear the cost of expensive legal fees while perpetrators have huge company funds to pay for expensive corporate lawyers, who can prolong cases with numerous adjournments, which are aimed to exhaust the victim’s financial resources and emotional stamina. 


The main objective behind the coverage of these stories is to scale up the attention of decision-makers at national and sub-national level, raise awareness of the women's pressing issues and gender sensitization at societal level, and to nurture and empower leadership potentials so that ‘the voiceless have the voice’ in society and in the system of governance which on many account remains oblivious of their plight and potentials. 

In Pakistan, social media has become a ‘factory for generating
fake news’ that has the potential of pervading information system. It
has increased the potential for false information to spread quickly
with real-world repercussions for marginalized and minority
communities in particular and the general public. Moreover, the federal and provincial departments and organizations are reluctant to share information so access to information from govt agencies is a worrisome problem. Therefore, during the development of these stories, I had continuously utilized the ‘Right to Information Law’ as a tool to collect data and information from departments/ organization for my stories to eliminate elements of mis/disinformation in reporting, distribute accurate information to public to ensure standards of ethical journalism.
I have also won RTI Champion Award 2021 for using ‘Right to Information Act’ for my investigative reporting and fact checking.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Participant,,Ainslie Johnstone,"Dear Sigma Award Judges, 

I would be delighted if you could please consider my 2022 portfolio entry for the Sigma Awards. 

I am a data journalist, based in London, working at The Economist magazine. I joined the team in August 2021, and before that was a post-doctoral research fellow in the Institute of Neurology at University College London. 

I was motivated to make the move from neuroscience research into data journalism during the covid-19 pandemic. At that time I realised how data, communicated well, was crucial to helping people to understand the world around them. Through my research work I had a strong background in statistics and had enjoyed writing popular science articles about developments in my field of neuroscience. After trying my hand at a few data journalism projects I applied for the job at The Economist and was accepted. 

My main interests are in science, health, education, climate and the environment, although I have written articles on many different topics. Since beginning work at The Economist I have also become increasingly interested in using satellite imaging and geo-spatial analysis in my work (which bears some similarities to MRI brain image analysis which I performed in my pre-journalism life). Not only is this an unusual skill set for a journalist, meaning my pieces can be relatively unique, geospatial data also often makes for rich, immersive data visualisations and lends itself to interactives. I aim to use my skills to cover important topics, and hope my work can have a positive impact. 

I take inspiration from many sources. Most of my stories are a data-driven take on a subject that is in the news or the public consciousness. I typically read around the academic literature to make sure I am not replicating something that already exists, and talk with researchers to ensure that I will be using best practices in the field. This has lead to many collaborations with researchers and I am hoping aspects from several of my pieces will contribute to academic papers. 

The Economist has provided me with many great data journalism mentors, without whom I could not have done most of this work. Special thanks to Dan Rosenheck, my editor, and to all the members of data and visualisation teams. In the projects mentioned below Rosamund Pearce, Matt McLean, Evan Hensleigh, Xavi Gimenez and Andreas Moor are to thank for bringing the stories to life with visualisations and interactive elements. 

I have lots of exciting ideas for 2023, including a deep-dive into climate change in India, an analysis of insider trading in clinical trials and a look at the world's access to water. I am thrilled that my job allows me to ask, and answer, the most interesting and important questions facing the world. 

Thank you in advance for taking the time to consider my application. 

Yours faithfully, 
Ainslie Johnstone","This portfolio contains my original research data-journalism projects from the year 2022. 

**Nearly half of Mariupol has suffered grave damage** (link 1)
_April 23rd 2022_
Contribution: Conception, research, data-analysis and writing 

After nearly two months under siege by Russian forces, what was left of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol?

Using freely-available satellite data from the European Space Agency, I detected damage to building across the city. The location of damage was matched up to individual buildings using Open Street Map. I verified the technique by comparing a list of damaged buildings from earlier in the war, compiled by the UN, to the results from our pipeline using satellite data from the same time. 

I found that nearly 45% of the built up area had suffered damage, including 33% of residential buildings.


**Republican senators gained almost 160,000 Twitter followers after Elon Musk’s deal** (link 2)
_April 27th 2022_
Contribution: Conception, research, data-analysis and writing 

Did the prospect of Mr Musk in charge of Twitter cause a shift in user demographics? 

I used data on follower numbers of America's members of Congress to study users political preferences. The average number of followers for all Senate Democrats dropped by around 0.2% between April 25th and April 26th. Accounts linked to Republicans, however, increased by 0.8%. The same was true for the House of Representatives, with Democrats losing and Republicans gaining followers. Twitter had shifted right-wards. 

After we published this article several other outlets also released similar, but less thorough analyses. I believe I did this first, and best!


**The Brazilian Amazon has been a net carbon emitter since 2016** (link 3)
_May 21st 2022_
Contribution: Conception, research, data-analysis and writing 

Is the destruction of the Amazon releasing more carbon than the forest can absorb? 

Using high resolition maps of carbon emissions and carbon removals, produced by Global Forest Watch, and combining with maps of yearly tree removals, I calculated the yearly carbon flux for the Brazilian Amazon. Sinice 2016 the Amazon has been a net carbon emitter. Over the last 20 years the Brazillian Amazon has lost 350,000 square kms of forest, and emitted 13% more CO2 than it absorbed. 


**A rising share of people are exposed to dangerously high temperatures** (link 4)
_July 21st 2022_
Contribution: Conception, research, data-analysis and writing 

Just how much time does humanity spend exposed to dangerously high temperatures? 

Combining gridded historic meteorological data with high resolution maps of population I calculated how the share of humanity experiencing extreme heat has changed over time. Extreme heat above 46°C is remarkably common, occurring three days per year for each person on Earth. As the temperature increases so too do the populations of the hottest countries. The share of time that people have felt very strong heat stress has risen by 50%. 


**Russia is using energy as a weapon** (link 5)
_Nov 26th 2022_ 
Contribution: Conception, research, data-analysis and writing

The price of gas and electricity has surged as a result of Putin's war in Ukraine. 
High energy prices are not only bad for people's wallets but also their health. As prices rise, the most vulnerable skimp on home heating, raising their risk for lung and heart problems. 

With winter approaching, I modelled how deadly Putin's 'energy weapon' might be. I predicted that high fuel prices could result in 150,000 excess deaths in Europe. More than have died in the fighting so far.

Sweden,Sveriges Radio,Big,Participant,,Sveriges Radio's data team,"The data team at Sveriges Radio launched with its first member in November 2020 (better late than never!) and today we’re a small but scrappy team of three data journalists working closely together, within the group itself but also together with other news desks and reporters.

We’re proud that in our first two years we’ve both produced investigative journalism using methods entirely new for not only Sveriges Radio but also journalism as a whole, and have developed methods for sharing our data analysis with the national news desk and, more importantly, with Sveriges Radio’s 26 local stations across the country. Although we are a new team, our work has already been nominated three times for Sweden’s most prestigious journalism awards, Stora Journalistpriset and Guldspaden.

Our team’s focus is data-driven investigations. We all have several years of experience of data journalism and over the past year we’ve uncovered personal data breaches of sensitive health information, state pension funds being invested into fossil fuel companies, and Swedish prisons isolating teens for longer than is legal. 

Collaboration is a cornerstone of our work. We always try to work together with reporters on other desks, to join our data skills with their subject matter expertise, and to date we’ve worked with over 150 different reporters. For instance, we teamed up with investigative and local reporters to uncover the large number of convicted criminals continuing to commit crimes while waiting to be sent to prison. We also worked together with the business desk for a project on the billions of Swedish crowns paid out to businesses in corona support, which would have been very difficult without the business reporter’s expertise. 

A key focus for our team is working together with Sveriges Radio’s local newsrooms across Sweden, sharing our data with local reporters who can use it to produce locally relevant stories with voices from those most affected. Something which has been important to us from day one was to ensure our team’s work didn’t just result in dry numbers stories. Having the opportunity to combine data analysis and local journalism in this way makes our data journalism more human, tangible, and impactful.","[Fewer qualified teachers in poorer areas]: How does the type of area a child goes to school in affect the education they receive? To answer the question, we geocoded all 4,700 Swedish schools and mapped them to their neighbourhood’s socio-economic index. Our analysis showed that not only are schools in poorer areas far less likely to have qualified teachers than in richer areas – the gap has actually grown in recent years, in direct contradiction to the government’s election promise. The Swedish minister for schools at the time had to admit that they had failed to deliver this promise when commenting on our story. (Links 1 + 2)

[Convicted criminals continue to commit crimes - while waiting to go to prison] Our investigation revealed that nearly a fifth of people sentenced to jail time in Sweden in recent years committed another crime while waiting to be sent to prison. To uncover this we scanned 4,000 pages of documents from the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, and by sharing our results we were able to coordinate a unique collaboration between Sveriges Radio’s data team, investigative reporters and local reporters around Sweden, which meant not only the national story but also many local versions of this story could be told. Politicians reacted very strongly and many Swedish parties have suggested amending current laws following our investigation. (Links 3 + 4)

[Trains almost always cheaper than planes] This investigation set out to answer the question: which is cheaper, rail or air travel? We scraped over 22,000 ticket prices to get an answer and found to our surprise that domestically, travelling by train was cheaper nine times out of ten. This turned out to be a controversial result: our story was more read and received much more audience feedback – both positive and negative! – than anything else I published last year, and led to huge reactions on social media.(Links 5+6+7)

[Your health for sale] By investigating the Meta Pixel, we revealed that the largest pharmacy in Sweden, state-owned Apoteket AB for several years shared personally identifiable data and information over the counter pharmacy purchases of approximately one million online customers with Meta. We also exposed leaks by several other actors in the health sector. When we asked Meta what happened with the data, they responded, “[O]ur systems are designed to remove potentially sensitive data”. By creating our own virtual, fake online pharmacy and a robot customer, we showed that Meta in fact: 1. received personal data, and 2. stored sensitive health information. This investiga has been nominated for Stora Journalistpriset, a prestigious journalism prize in Sweden.

United States,The Economist,Big,Participant,,G Elliott Morris,"I am a data-driven journalist and US correspondent for The Economist. 2022 marked my fourth full year in this role. As a journalist that sits on two teams, my job marries ""traditional"" reporting with data analysis, computational social science, and applied statistics to tell interesting stories about our complex and (increasingly data-rich) world. Most of those stories were about US politics last year; In 2022 I also published my first book about how political polling works and why it's crucial for a healthy democracy. Before this, I was an undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin, where I studied government, history and computer science. (If you're counting, that makes me 26 years old — in the past I believe this would have qualified me for the ""Young Journalist"" award, though I gather there are no categories this year!)

A ""data journalist"" in practice, I am a politics researcher and empirical storyteller at heart. I draw my inspiration from messy datasets that hide fascinating stories on how the structures of politics and society influence individual behaviors and outcomes. That includes studying survey data to show the effects of the two-party system on political polarization, electoral results to quantifying how Donald Trump has extremized the Republican Party, historical data to show how gerrymandering works (in America and elsewhere), and, polling and other data to forecast uncertainty in election outcomes; I am the chief architect of The Economist's statistical models of polling data worldwide. These are areas of coverage with a lot of demand from both readers and decision-makers; Our various elections projects this year combined for nearly 2 million views, making the content area one of our most-read.

In my role I have been infusing more statistics-driven ideas into our industry's coverage of politics. Over the last decade, the growing popularity of data-driven journalism has been a major disruption to political journalism in the US and abroad. In my view that disruption has been mostly, but not entirely, positive. Iterations in communicating uncertainty have been particularly impactful on the news media and inspirational to my own career. But it is easy to see an excessive focus on the horse race and minute changes in the latest readings from political polls. This distracts readers from the true trends of an election and the broader importance of democracy. 

My work on The Economist's election forecasting models thus steers readers away from a focus on point predictions and daily movements in probabilities and instead uses methods from machine learning and Bayesian statistics to capture and communicate the full range of uncertainty in an election—using polling data and other sources. Unlike other well-known political data journalists, I focus especially on deciphering whether some polls are more trustworthy than others and whether movements in polls are real or phantom. I look at the underlying data-generating process for political surveys and elucidate for readers, via parameters in our model and in standalone articles, what more shallow analyses of data don't tell us.

Of course, as a data journalist, it is hard to resist pursuing stories outside of my beat. Last year I wrote for Graphic Detail, our online and print data journalism section, about covid-19 stimulus buoying retail stock trading, the link between religion and attitudes about abortion, and inflation in food and gasoline prices. In the past, I have covered subjects from climate to crypto to the statistics of climbing Mt Everest. In all my projects I work with my stellar colleagues on visualization, editing and programming. My portfolio below details how I use statistical rigor to extract stories from data in new, interesting, and entertaining ways.","My major project in 2022 was The Economist's statistical model of the 2022 midterm elections for the United States House and Senate. I worked on methods for this project with Dan Rosenheck, our Data Editor, and was responsible for our pipelines gathering, processing, and modeling polling data in every race. We aided the paper's visual and interactive journalists in producing the online interactive. Unlike other outlets' presentations of forecasting models, ours highlights confidence intervals like a weather forecast. For those familiar with the contest, we did not predict a ""red wave"" as some others did, providing a useful signal in the noise of most political coverage last year. (See links 1 and 2.)

As mentioned, The Economist uses its forecasting models to guide other coverage of the election and unearth interesting stories from the data used to train and test its models. This means I get to work with editors outside of our data team on coverage and teach other non-data correspondents how to use the model and write about its outputs. This lets us spread the impact of empirical journalism throughout the company. We used the model to write about where voters were sending their campaign contributions — a data source aside from polling, coverage of which is abundant (third link).

We also produced forecasting models for the French and Brazilian elections (links 4 and 5). The two-round electoral systems for those countries allowed us to analyze the ideological ""lanes"" of the country's party systems. This diversity of viewpoints is often obscured by the final-round vote totals for both of the two top candidates (link 6). 

On political process, I also wrangled data on America's new congressional maps and built a congressional model to analyze how biased it was toward a certain party, and compare that to its historical slant (link 7). For The Economist's newsletter on US politics, which is sent to nearly 200,000 readers each Friday, I popularized two metrics of fairness (bias and responsiveness) for the maps that have not before been covered by political journalists (link 8). This is another example of using my data journalism skills in sections beyond the data team's designated space. Through our ""Checks and Balance"" newsletter, from 2020 through 2022 I was the only journalist at our organization to write a weekly article for our subscribers.

For this year's midterm elections, we also launched a weekly data-driven feature for the paper's print US section. One of the most popular articles was an investigation into a pollster that was producing results wildly out of sync with the industry's consensus. We obtained the company's data, discovered severe problems with their methodology and published our own re-analysis of their data. We used the investigation as an opportunity to teach our readers about how polls work (see link 8). Later, in the same column, we discovered that a slew of polls from right-wing pollsters was biasing the most popular polling aggregation sites in America.

Along similar lines, I used a large database of historical election results to write a story about how Hungary's far-right ruling party gerrymandered the country's legislative maps to give itself an advantage in parliament (link 9). We also analyzed the changes the party made to Hungary's constitution that allowed them to rig the system.

My work required both deploying current skills in my toolset — a mix of traditional social science techniques in the R programming language and programs for Bayesian statistics — and learning how to use C to code complex machine-learning methods for big data and large parameter spaces. I learned additional reporting skills from working with my non-data colleagues.",English,https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-midterms-2022/forecast/house?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/11/07/why-a-republican-ripple-is-more-likely-than-a-red-wave?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/10/17/with-their-wallets-americans-are-voting-for-democratic-senate-candidates?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/interactive/france-2022/forecast?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/interactive/brazil-2022?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/how-we-forecast-the-french-election/21807484?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/06/02/americas-congressional-maps-are-a-bit-fairer-than-a-decade-ago?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/20/how-to-spot-a-wonky-poll?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/02/a-wild-gerrymander-makes-hungarys-fidesz-party-hard-to-dislodge?fsrc=core-app-economist,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/10/20/how-to-spot-a-wonky-poll?fsrc=core-app-economist
United States,The Washington Post,Big,Participant,,Adrián Blanco's portfolio,"To the attention of the 2023 Sigma Awards Jury,

During the past three years and half years as a Graphics reporter at The Washington Post, combined with my previous experience as a data journalist in Spain and the United Kingdom, I've analyzed dozens of datasets and published dozens of pieces, hundreds of graphics and experimented with new ways for data to tell stories. 

[How election modeling can help us understand who might win](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2022/how-election-models-work/?itid=ap_adrianblanco), [Tracking which 2020 election deniers are winning, losing in the midterms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/election-deniers-midterms/?itid=ap_adrianblanco) and [More than 1,700 congressmen once enslaved Black people are two pieces](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/?itid=ap_juliezauzmerweil) I have worked on this year that show complex analyses of hand-crafted databases, high-quality data visualizations and curated design. These pieces showcase my interest in pushing for more investigative, highly curated and uniquely presented content.

Over this time, I have become a better graphics reporter, widening my range of technical and visual skills. From my position in the newsroom, I have tried to promote collaboration, knowledge sharing and learning across the Graphics team and other desks. I have been part of the onboarding process of numerous colleagues, offering support and solving questions and teaching them the systems in place.

As a Graphics reporter, I always aim to create beautiful and well designed graphics that stop people from scrolling to take a deeper look and leave having learned something new and unexpected. I strongly believe on the use of highly curated visualizations to explain complex concepts such as redistricting, policy making or even election results that have an impact in our daily lives. As data and visual reporters, I believe we have the capacity to not only react to the news with explainers, but also push exclusive content and generate and open source [our own databases](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners) where no data exists. 

I am fascinated by the possibilities the intersection of reporting, data and design offers to journalism. Not only do I put this combination of skills in practice on my own work, but also advocate for it. In my free time, I have also mentored students and taught classes on these disciplines at Master's levels in Spain and the U.S.

[My portfolio](adrianblancoramos.com/) showcases my goal of innovation and thinking outside of the box for daily pieces to highly curated investigations. No matter the topic or the approach, my goal when working on a story or graphic is to create a ‘whoa’ factor for the reader using data visualization techniques, graphics or illustrations.

In terms of presentation, I always pursue beautiful and well designed stories that stop people from scrolling to take a deeper look and leave having learned something new and unexpected. Examples of highly sophisitcated data visualizations include [a live tracker on which 2020 U.S. election deniers were winnin and losing in the midterms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/election-deniers-midterms/?itid=ap_adrianblanco) and [a visual explainer rich on illustrations on how election modeling works](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2022/how-election-models-work/?itid=ap_adrianblanco). 

Behind the scenes, I have developed a wide range of skills to analyze complex databases, identify the most important patterns in the database and prepare the main findings for publication. The investigative analysis on [how many suspects have been charged in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2022/jan-6-capitol-riot-charges-sentences/?itid=ap_aadittambe), as well as the investigation on [the congressmen who once enslaved Black people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/) are examples of sophisticated analyses based on hand-crafted datasets created in the newsroom for investigative purposes that I have worked on during the past year. The original topics, attention to the detail and the technical skills put into practice to create these pieces are some of the things I enjoy the most while reporting. I feel strongly that this portfolio reflects my passion and aim as a graphics reporter. 

[My portfolio](adrianblancoramos.com/) also features [a few courses and workshops](https://observablehq.com/@zachlevitt/nacis-collaborative-mapmaking-with-observable-in-javascript) on data visualization and data analysis that I taught over the past year. I find it incredibly rewarding to teach others and help them grow and develop their skills to become better graphic reporters or data journalists.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Participant,,LA NACION (Argentina): Coverage of the 2022 FIFA World Cup,"The portfolio presented is a collection of visual projects produced by the LA NACION Data and Digital Narratives teams, which collaborated throughout the year with the LA NACION sports section to cover the World Cup with different approaches and with special emphasis on the data generated before, during, and after the World Cup.

The Digital Narratives team at LA NACION is dedicated to interactive design, producing special projects from a visual perspective and assisting other sectors of the newspaper with graphic elements for their journalistic articles. It is a team with extensive experience in the production of content such as data visualizations, interactive features, infographics, web applications (webapps) and more. The team is composed of designers, journalists and programmers.

LA NACION Data is an interdisciplinary team of engineers, programmers, journalists and data analysts dedicated to innovative uses of data and public documents for research and journalistic coverage. It seeks to advance the development of new technologies and reuse existing ones to produce outstanding content that covers diverse topics.

Both teams collaborate to analyze a large volume of data and develop interactive pieces with great visual contributions. Their work has received numerous awards from various institutions including: WAN-INFRA, GDA, ADEPA, the Society for News Design (SND), the Malofiej Awards, the Online Journalism Awards and the Sigma Awards for their data journalism portfolio. 

Beyond the diversity of the profiles that make up both teams, all are involved in some way in the production of content, and all are constantly driven by their interest in telling stories in an innovative, data-driven way.","Soccer / Football is the most popular sport in Argentina and is part of the country's cultural identity. The World Cup, the most important international event in this sport, takes up a large part of the media agenda every four years and is the most important social event for most Argentines. Given the cultural and sporting importance of the tournament, it was LA NACION's journalistic bet of the year.

A large volume of data is generated before, during and after the World Cup. Our biggest challenge was offering data-based content using distinct approaches in a landscape in which all media outlets have practically the same information.

LA NACION carried out a series of interactive projects that emphasized the team’s expertise in the fields of data analysis, unique database generation, predictive model development and innovative data visualization. 

Coverage began in early 2022 with the World Cup group draw. LA NACION developed a simulator that allowed users to predict the results of the draw and the level of competitiveness of each group.

Another highlight was the development of mathematical models that predicted the outcomes of all World Cup matches as well as the winner of the World Cup. These calculations were visualized in an application called “El Bot del Mundial,” which showed the probability of each team winning or losing each match. The results of the simulations were also shown, along with the predicted stage each team would reach in the World Cup. Our algorithm simulated each match one million times to evaluate the probability of each team's victory.

Since social networks played an important role during the development of the tournament, we developed a Twitter bot with the predictions of the mathematical model. Likewise, these calculations were included in several LA NACION features such as the fixture, calendar and interactive key (brackets), among others.

We had some opportunities to take more playful approaches to storytelling. A few months before the start of the World Cup, a collectible album of trading cards was launched in Argentina. With the unexpected success of the album, we created an interactive that allowed users to estimate how much it would cost to fill the album based on how lucky they were. These different “luck” scenarios were calculated on the basis of a mathematical model developed for the occasion.

In some cases, we utilized a particularly innovative visual format. An example of this is our analysis of the Argentine team’s performance by means of three-dimensional graphics that reconstructed the shots on goal taken by the national team in the group stage. 

In other cases, we employed innovative metrics that showed aspects of the games’ development that were less intuitive. For example, by comparing the xG metric (expected goals scored) with actual goals scored in each match, we were able to evaluate teams’ performance.

Another challenge we faced was how to cover the World Cup Final. In this case, we asked readers in realtime on our website what emotion they were feeling as the match unfolded. The data collected was used in a visual feature that documented the emotion of Argentines at every moment of the match.

This portfolio of projects has succeeded in converting readers into subscribers, and some of the projects have reached record numbers of pageviews.

Spain,Newtral.es,Small,Participant,,Newtral,"Newtral Data is the data visualization and analysis area of Newtral.es. We are a pioneer team in Spain working with artificial intelligence, and creating algorithms where journalists and engineers work together to design tools focused on journalism. In the team, we are journalists, engineers, programmers, and graphic designers who turn data into stories through different visual narratives, supported by graphics, illustrations, infographics, and other approaches to address current affairs. To do so, we use technology to automate some scraping and data analysis processes. 
As part of the editorial staff of Newtral.es, we work in three rhythms. First, we cover current affairs through simple graphics and maps. Secondly, we look for our own topics that we can approach with different approaches. Finally, we go for in-depth specials on specific topics. The goal is to be able to have a quick response to breaking events for which visualizations and other forms of storytelling are needed, while in other cases we can go beyond current news and look for our own visual approach.
We have five years of experience, two of them with a specific unit focused on data journalism. Although all our sections have a strong vocation for data. In particular, the verification area, where data is the basis of our work for fact-checking. At Newtral we verify dozens of figures given by politicians and we try to visualize them in order to highlight falsehoods or deceptions. For example, when misrepresented graphs are used or when data are selected incompletely to highlight or criticize certain issues, such as unemployment, or when comparisons are made without the proper context or without taking into account the magnitudes being compared. This helps us to debunk myths or preconceived ideas, for example about healthcare or budgets.
The other section where data takes on a special dimension is Transparentia, where we monitor public money. As part of it, we manage the first public salary search engine in Spain, which collects information on the salaries earned by thousands of public officials. We also try to translate the big figures of public budgets and items into comparable amounts. To do this, we developed a public money calculator. For example, the latest contract for catering in the Congress of Deputies for the next 34 months amounted to 3,800,000 euros. The figure alone is important, but it occupies another place in our heads if we see that it is 2,385 times the health spending per capita in 2019 or 155 times the average annual salary of a worker in Spain in 2020.
In a cross-cutting way, we try to employ technology to automate updates and handle large data sets. For example, we train a machine learning algorithm to be able to analyze the names of about 40,000 streets and check how many of them recall a woman.","Portfolio #NewtralData 2022

The war in Ukraine
Beyond maps and evolution on the fronts, we have focused on explaining and visualizing human aspects of the war, such as how the Kyiv metro became a shelter for the population and how protests were being suppressed. Additionally, we have attempted to visualize what weapons were being used and how attacks on key infrastructure such as nuclear power plants occurred. During the war coverage we learned how to find information from various open sources, verification tools and satellite imagery.

Data to communicate climate change
Anomalous temperatures have been part of an important part of the headlines, and at the beginning of the year, we reported that 2021 was the fifth warmest year in the world since records began. 'Tropical nights', those in which the temperature does not fall below 20ºC, are becoming increasingly frequent. Heat waves, with maximum temperatures, then gave way to other topics, such as drought and fires. In the latter, we try to show with maps the space that corresponds to the areas of land and forest burned, as well as what means we have to fight them, such as amphibious aircraft. We also try to portray the effects to explain that the Pyrenees are melting: 60% less snow and no glaciers in 2050. We had to learn to extract, clean, and correctly analyze large volumes of data from hundreds of weather stations in Spain.

Inflation, gasoline price, and calculators to understand the world
Inflation and the increase in the price of basic products have been one of the biggest concerns this year. We have tried to show how it affects us with simple visualizations that could convey the impact they had on the population. To do this, we chose to make visualizations of typical dishes, such as Andalusian gazpacho or breakfast, to break down the variation in the price of their components.
With an interest in public service, we have developed a map that is updated automatically to show the price of gasoline at each service station. Additionally, we explain how the price of this fuel is composed and its evolution. The concern for energy and the dependence on Russian gas by Spain and all of Europe has also been the subject of several projects. Among them, we drew the insides of a natural gas power plant to explain how the combined cycle of electricity works, how 'district heating' works, or how people's uncertainty about gas was revealed on the internet by the growth of the searches of ""firewood"" or ""heat pump"" in the middle of August.
The block is closed by the tools that we have developed, such as a calculator to know the quota of self-employed and another to calculate the pension. In both, the user entered the necessary data and could calculate how the announced measures would affect them.

Summarizing the current events #in1chart 
Trying to summarize current events in data and at the necessary pace is not always easy, that's why we created the #in1chart format, in which we use data and visualization to synthesize and explain a current topic that can be summarized in one chart. With this format, we have addressed, for example, the duration of mandates in the United Kingdom, following the resignation of Lizz Truss as Prime Minister, including the resignations of ministers, how many women occupy seats in the Royal Spanish Academy of Language, or the reign of Queen Elizabeth II and the age at which European monarchs were crowned following the coronation of King Charles III of England.","Spanish, English",https://www.newtral.es/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Newtral-Data_Portfolio_2022.pdf,,,,,,,,,
Brazil,"Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro, Metrópoles, UOL, Folha de S.Paulo e Aos Fatos",Big,Participant,,Judite Cypreste,"Há cinco anos produzo reportagens que se apoiam em análises de dados. Além de escrever e apurar, tenho como iniciativa a colaboração daquilo que consegui fazer. Informação nunca fica presa: sempre que possível, disponibilizo meus códigos e dados. 

Por vezes, sou chamada para dar palestras e contar como foram estas investigações, o que faço sempre que chamada. Para mim o jornalismo de dados revolucionou a forma como jornalistas atuam dentro de redações. 

A cultura colaborativa de compartilhamento tomou o lugar da velh briga por contatos de telefone para abrir caminho para um jornalismo mais colaborativo. Sinto orgulho do meu trabalho feito até aqui e mais ainda de poder mostrar para outros colegas como é possivel realizá-lo.

Acredito que deva ganhar este prêmio por também representar uma minoria no país: o de jornalista de dados do gênero feminino. Em meu país, a área é predominantemente masculina e não é incomum sofrer com preconceitos sobre minhas capacidades só por ser mulher. 

Ganhar este prêmio será a valorização do meu trabalho não só como jornalista de dados, mas como alguém que tenta a todo momento trazer o jornalismo de dados para o ensino e conhecimento de todos.","Atualmente sou jornalista de dados da Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro, onde tenho como foco a produção de reportagens que utilizem cruzamento de dados e contem para os cidadãos a história da cidade. Como um trabalho pioneiro no Brasil, tenho o desafio de aliar reportagens instigantes, dados e informação pública de uma forma atrativa e clara.

Um de nossos principais trabalhos, do qual fui idealizadora e jornalista, foi a criação do albúm de figurinhas exclusivo de cariocas que participaram da Seleção Brasileira de Futebol em Copas do Mundo. Um trabalho que consistiu na busca por dados muito antigos e a checagem de lugar de nascimento de quase 500 jogadores brasileiros. O trabalho foi amplamente compartilhado e fez muitos cariocas se surpreenderem com alguns nomes. 

Além de reportagens mais lúdicas, também escrevi trabalhos mais sérios como o especial ""MAIS DE 1.300 CONSTRUÇÕES IRREGULARES A MENOS NO RIO DE JANEIRO"" onde mostramos como as demolições de construções irregulares na cidade foram capazes de gerar prejuízos para o crime organizado e salvar vidas.

Em meu trabalho anterior, na capital do país, atuei no Portal Metrópoles onde escrevi investigações que aliavam dados e política. Entre os destaques está um grande cruzamento de dados que mostrou como filhas beneficiarias de pensões militares recebem o benefício do governo mesmo sendo sócias de empresas milionárias.

Utilizando os dados abertos governamentais dos pagamentos realizados com o Cartão de Pagamento do Governo Federal Brasileiro, mostrei como servidores gastaram dinheiro público para pagamento em churrascarias de luxo em pleno aumento da fome no país durante a pandemia da Covid-19. O link de dados e códigos utilizados por mim estão disponíveis para acesso público.

Também tive passagem pelo Portal UOL, outro grande veículo de jornalismo brasileiro. Lá, a minha missão eram duas: a de produzir pautas com dados e também fazer o restante da redação entender o que era o jornalismo de dados. 

Foi lá que escrevi reportagens como uma análise em que mostra como o Oscar sempre deu sempre preferência para homens em suas premiações. Através de uma grande coleta de dados e checagem de informações, criei um banco de dados que permitiu saber que a academia sempre deu preferência para filmes protagonizados por homens para ganhar o prêmio de melhor obra. O link de dados e códigos utilizados por mim estão disponíveis para acesso público.

Também atuei como fact-checker na agência Aos Fatos. Por lá, fui responsável por encabeçar uma investigação jornalística na busca de entender como ficaram as obras prometidas pelo governo brasileiro após 4 anos da realização da Copa do Mundo de 2014 no país. 

No meio desta investigação, o governo resolveu tirar os dados sobre o assunto do ar, numa tentativa de censura a nossa reportagem. Utilizando então dos meios de raspagem e análise de dados, continuamos a investigação e alertamos sobre a censura. Posteriormente consegui que os dados fossem divulgados de volta para acesso à população.

Uma de minhas primeira investigações em minha carreira fez com que informações sigilosas expostas pelo governo fossem retiradas do ar. Durante meu trainne, feito no no jornal Folha de S.Paulo, mostrei que o Conselho Nacional de Justiça estaria divulgando dados acerca de crianças que foram vítimas de abusos sexuais. Após a veiculação da matéria, o órgão impediu, por meio de um dispositivo captcha, que mais pessoas tivessem acesso automatizado a sua base de mandados de prisão no país.",Portuguese,https://www.dados.rio/especiais/copa-do-mundo-carioca,https://viz.dados.rio/#/especial-seop/demolicoes,https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/registros-mostram-400-filhas-pensionistas-de-militares-como-socias-de-empresas-milionarias,https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/em-meio-a-pandemia-governo-bancou-252-refeicoes-em-churrascarias,https://entretenimento.uol.com.br/reportagens-especiais/apos-91-edicoes-o-oscar-ainda-e-um-clube-do-bolinha/#cover,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/cidades-sede-da-copa-de-2014-ainda-tem-obras-por-fazer-e-problemas-de-transparencia/,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2018/04/sistema-da-justica-viola-sigilo-e-expoe-criancas-vitimas-de-estupro.shtml,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/relatos-de-falta-de-verba-e-abandono-do-museu-nacional-remontam-decada-de-1950/,https://noticias.uol.com.br/reportagens-especiais/as-vitimas-do-coronavirus/index.htm,https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/brasil-tem-762-mil-policiais-e-bombeiros-ainda-sem-nenhuma-dose-da-vacina
United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Participant,,John Burn-Murdoch,"Given that I was fortunate enough to win a Sigma portfolio award in 2021 for my work covering Covid-19, it might seem a little cheeky to submit another portfolio award barely two years later. However, I feel that my work has taken another big step forward in this period in a way that speaks volumes about the way that data journalism itself is still evolving.

Two years ago I wrote as part of my submission that “data journalists weren’t often considered to be ‘words journalists’ “. For many, that remains the case, but reporting on Covid allowed me to break down the barriers that had previously left me labelled as a ‘graphics journalist’ and I started to feel more confident delivering fully shaped stories that integrated data-driven analysis, graphics and words into compelling stories. A question I asked myself at the time was how far I could take this approach within the context of a major international news organisation like the Financial Times.

The answer is contained in the portfolio that I am submitting this year. I am now a columnist at the FT, using data to produce data-driven opinion on a weekly basis.

I feel that my column — Data Points — is unique in many ways. It uses data, yes, but that by itself is not so distinctive these days. I have put into action many of the techniques that I originally used during my work on Covid — sourcing, combining and analysing disparate datasets, speaking with topic experts and academics. The timetable for my work remains demanding. But now, my range of editorial topics is much wider — and the output is evidence-based opinion journalism.

I am proud of the result, which I believe demonstrates that the career path of a data journalist need not be restricted to only certain quarters of the newsroom. In becoming a bona fide columnist at the FT, I’d like to feel that it might serve as a model from which other data journalists might learn, and that others responsible for career development in news organisations might also benefit from hearing about. I’d be delighted to be considered for a portfolio prize at this year’s Sigma awards.","This portfolio contains ten examples of a new weekly column for the Financial Times that now extends to 25 (and counting) individual articles. These cover a range of topics, including (but not limited to) politics, health, sport and economics. Geographical coverage is broad. Often focusing on US and UK, but using international comparisons wherever possible. One column as its premise highlighted the lack of data in China.

Though each column addresses a different topic, they share many attributes:

* Original data sourced using techniques old and new: an extensive contacts network and scrapers using R and node.js.
* Narrative visuals designed to carry the main thrust of the column. Not only do these work in the context of the column but they are sufficiently ‘standalone’ to help promote and share the work on social media. I continue to use R, d3.js and Adobe Illustrator, among a suite of tools, to produce responsive graphics
* Text written in a way that weaves the graphics together. It is clear from the structure of my articles that the graphics and copy have been conceived in tandem rather than in a traditional linear op-ed text-first approach.
* The column appears both online and in print. Uniquely, I am perhaps the only opinion journalist who produces their own print-ready graphics on a weekly basis!",English,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/3f3de15f-aae5-43fd-9d18-26a6c50c4c26,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/f2310b50-97dc-46d2-90a1-c2df866981d9,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/e8c4b481-564b-4484-8db4-d8c1e2de1065,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/c64fe242-938d-4c66-9ec0-1157486ff273,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/16e32d7e-ed74-4707-89d3-e5305ebfcbea,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/7fbc0f08-9e41-4da1-b258-71c2741b3ab9,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/ac506c39-05d3-4ffb-9785-0011ae450966,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/b8dd3495-76ee-49e7-be81-16b2a1d95adf,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/769e6c23-eb0b-45af-8a3c-e3faad861a2b,https://enterprise-sharing.ft.com/redeem/6b3c747f-e5f1-4b12-a9de-34bdcf0aa1a9
Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Christopher Udemans,"I am a digital graphics journalist at The Straits Times in Singapore, where I work on visual and data storytelling for the newspaper’s online offering. My aim is to use data in the service of helping readers make better informed decisions.

Using data has been part of my approach to journalism for the past several years, starting as a China-focused reporter tracking the country’s tech companies, to now, where my mandate is much broader, allowing me to use the full range of my skills to tell data-driven stories.

In the pursuit of public service journalism, our team at the Straits Times has worked on several stories aimed at informing and engaging readers in an interactive way. I was a project lead on several of these stories.

One of these public service interactives tracked the dengue outbreak in Singapore last year, allowing readers to find out if they live in an area considered a dengue cluster, or if a location they will be visiting is considered a cluster. 

This project was updated daily and readers could enter in an address that gave them information about the area, including if there were any dengue clusters nearby. Aside from a tracker, the piece functioned as an explainer on how the disease is spread.

In another article, we used data from Singapore’s finance ministry to calculate a personal inflation rate based on spending habits. The interactive allowed readers to see how far their monthly budget could go compared with last year, and what their overall inflation rate was, allowing them to make better-informed budgeting and saving decisions based on the results.
Over the past year I have also had the chance to work on sports stories: a beat that I had little experience covering. I worked on a data-driven piece focused on how Singapore’s first private football club, the Lion City Sailors, aims to become one of the country’s top football teams.

In another sports piece, I focused on spectator chants from countries around the globe in last year’s World Cup. This required a mammoth amount of data processing, converting audio into data that we could use and visualise. The piece pushed my skills as a data reporter, and incorporated some advanced techniques including machine learning.

My mantra as a journalist has also been one of acquiring knowledge to improve my reporting chops. Over the past few years I have spent my nights doing short courses online, with the aim of sharpening my skills. Last year I decided to formalise this knowledge and start a masters degree in data science at the University of London. Since then, I’ve incorporated tools like natural language processing and machine learning into the way I do journalism.","1. Are you living in a dengue cluster? Dengue is a big problem in Singapore around the summer months. This project used public data to track the spread of Dengue around the city, and show where the Dengue clusters were located. The piece combined aspects of a tracker and an explainer to clarify how and why the virus was spreading. Role: Project lead, data journalist, developer, designer

2. What is your personal inflation rate? Inflation has become a major stress for people around the world. This interactive allows readers to calculate their personal inflation rate and how their spending power has changed over the past year. Role: Data journalist, developer, designer

3. How the Lion city Sailors are outspending other Singapore premier league clubs. A data-driven profile of Singapore's first private football club, the Lion City Sailors. In the interactive, we look at what makes the team different, how they hope to reach the top of the league, and how much the players on the team are worth. Role: Data journalist, developer, project lead

4. Sounds of the stadium: Anatomy of a World Cup Chant.

China,网易数读 NetEase Datablog,Small,Participant,,网易数读 NetEase Datablog,"Founded in 2012, NetEase Datablog is one of the forerunners contributing to data journalism in China with tens of millions of subscribers. The column then grew and stood out among peers to be an influencer with high-quality data visualization and unique style and storytelling.

We are committed to mining information in depth and data with enjoyment. The column is featured for creating statistic diagrams. But we keep the soul for exploring more engaging forms like web apps, interactive diagrams, and videos to enhance the reading experience with higher accessibility and readability. And we have made a breakthrough in illustrative storytelling with videos enriched by fascinating motion graphics (MG).

The team has two editors, two designers, and a front-end developer with a clear division of labor with broad coverage, including daily life, healthcare, finance & business, culture and entertainment.

A key value we hold is to always tell stories from the perspective of ordinary people, only with which can we produce strong stories. 

To make an entry to this behonored award, we hope to learn from peers worldwide who contribute to data journalism and make better works together.","We selected a collection of works with great importance in public concerns, covering public healthcare, campus life, travel, reflection on life and death, etc. Here is a brief of our work submitted. And we hope it will help you to have a better understanding of our work.

In the field of public health, we made a perspective from the chaotic naming situation of hospitals in China in our story ""2,000 Hospitals with Notable Names: Only Three Are Officially Qualified"". Peking Union Medical College Hospital is a top medical institution in the country. But there are only three Union Hospitals that are officially recognized sharing the same origin – Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Union Hospital Tongji Medical College Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and Fujian Medical University Union Hospital. In the meanwhile, there are over 2,000 private hospitals trying to cheat patients by including ""Union"" in their names. The country's watchdog took measures to clean up the mass, but it then became a cat-and-mouse game. These less qualified hospitals included other well-known names from the country's top medical institutions like Ruijin, Renji, and Changzheng. While investigating the issue, we scrutinized the status of these hospitals on the Chinese business database Tianyancha to inform readers of the sneaky names. The work we delivered made a great difference to the field.

Another work related to public healthcare is ""5,500 Covid Recovery Cases Tell the Things to Do If You've Tested Positive"". The story was published in the second week after China lifted most of the Covid countermeasures. For most Chinese, this is the first time they have faced the coronavirus directly since the initial outbreak three years ago. Then came the situation where people are unaware of the proper treatment for Coivd and most information spreading on the internet is less inaccurate and misleading, even those from official agencies.

We gathered and summarized 5,572 social posts recording their experience of fighting against Covid on the Twitter-like platform Weibo and the Chinese lifestyle-sharing social platform Xiaohongshu. By reading, adding tags, and summarizing these posts, we extract the common symptoms and helpful treatments of Covid-19, adding more professional knowledge to benefit our readers.

In the stories ""A Rank of Chinese Universities' Floor Area: an Enormous Gap"" and ""High-Speed Rail Stations are Far from Central Regions in Chinese Cities, But Why?"", we combine intriguing data with public concerns perfectly. 

For example, we obtained the list of national universities from the country's Ministry of Education and utilized the area of interest (AOI) feature from map service provider AMap to match. As a result, we got the land area data of 1,270 undergraduate universities in China. With the data, we visualized the intriguing data as a rank chart and took our readers a further look into the issue behind the huge gaps between these schools – rampant expansion and crowded dorms. The story drew great resonance from our readers.

We also adopted a similar trick in the other story mentioned above, revealing the issue of the distance between high-speed rail stations and central areas in cities. The article made an approach via data to the concerns people would counter when taking a trip.",Chinese,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/u8lHmlp7CNVwJNOmdspUtw,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/ywjiVud7Ec0sMLA5_E1pLw,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/W-4AyqQhsE72HkPJcsJaJg,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/rlAJc_kTfEC9xyEDYltKUA,https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/JU54P1DS0ws8KDqSPFhfDw,,,,,
Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Participant,,Süddeutsche Zeitung,"2022 was a year of complex crises that unfolded in parallel. As data journalists at Süddeutsche Zeitung, we had to provide our readers with an understanding of this complex situation, explain developments, but also provide hope. The data team at Süddeutsche Zeitung published more than 100 articles in 2022, more than ever before. Data analysis and statistics are becoming increasingly important in understanding the crises of our time. In addition to the coronavirus crisis, which we also reported on extensively in 2022, we were also concerned about Russia's destructive war in Ukraine and the increasingly noticeable climate crisis. We looked at how many people actually live on Earth, proved that children's clothing fulfills stereotypes, and analyzed why people keep dying in traffic.

Süddeutsche Zeitung is the leading daily quality newspaper in Germany. Founded 1945 and based in Munich, it offers reporting, analysis and opinion for a national audience. Editorial staff is 400+ people, with bureaus in Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stuttgart, plus correspondents in major capitals all around the world. Its award-winning Data Team was established in 2018 to focus on data-driven reporting across all topics, with close links to the Investigations team (known for the Panama Papers, among other stories). Although it is a standalone unit of the newsroom, the team always works very closely with specialist editors from the other departments, graphic designers and developers, combining their expertise and skills with their own to achieve the best result for readers. As the team sees it, data journalism is first and foremost journalism – its goal is to tell stories, explain complex issues, expose injustice and corruption. The team is committed to constantly learning, experimenting with new tools, sources and storytelling formats, and providing the best possible experience for Süddeutsche Zeitung readers – online and in print. Exchanging ideas, sharing knowledge and learning from each other are important pillars of the philosophy. Towards their readers, they try to be as transparent as possible – publishing detailed descriptions of their methodology, source code and raw data wherever possible.

All articles published by the data journalism unit of Süddeutsche Zeitung in 2022 are listed here: https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/kolumne/datenjournalismus-portfolio-2022-e922778/","Destruction of Mariupol: Detailed analysis of destruction caused by war in Ukraine, with a focus on the city of Mariupol.

Kenya,British Broadcasting Corporation,Big,Participant,,BBC Africa,"BBC Africa Visual Journalism which is part of the BBC World Service was set up in November 2017 with the remit to tell stories through high visual content and explore new innovative use of technologies with an emphasis on social, mobile and youth audiences. One of the ambitions of the team is taking complex topics, enhancing and explaining them in a simplified format that engages audiences and attracts new and underrepresented audiences to BBC platforms (web and social media). 

Our uniqueness is our dedication and commitment to expanding our visual storytelling of the African continent to a global audience. 

With staff employed in Lagos, Nigeria and Nairobi Kenya, the team is made up of senior journalists, Interactive and data journalists, software engineers and web developers, UX designers and social media visual artists.","Data journalism played a crucial role in the success of the BBC’s Africa coverage of the 2022 Kenya election. It contributed to several BBC Africa language services, including the Swahili, Pidgin, and Africa news online (English) sites, being the leading destination for election coverage and data-led journalism.

The transmission of live Kenyan presidential results contributed to audience growth across the BBC Africa language services and English.

For example, the Live results page for News online delivered 1.9 million users overall with1.5 million coming from Africa, and 1.2 from Kenya alone, primarily driven by search and social (70% WhatsApp and higher numbers from Twitter than Facebook).

The live coverage of results was the most challenging, as the presidential tally was being done by counting results from over 50,000 polling stations while the transmission of the results from the polling stations to the electoral commission data portal was painstakingly slow. Due to the challenges, other media houses in Kenya dropped their live coverage while BBC Africa stayed the course. Audiences turned to BBC Africa online for the latest results, seeing them as credible. We also transmitted gubernatorial and parliamentary results.

Another key offering was a variety of charts that explained Kenya. They were published by BBC Africa Online and Africa Language Services a day before polling day. It got nearly 200,000 visitors and registered a good level of audience engagement. Some of the issues the charts explore include food inflation, public debt, Kenya’s young population, education, the economy, and the country's access to the internet and power. The charts were shared across various WhatsApp groups in Kenya, sparking various debates.

We also published two animated digital explainers on the cost of elections and what it takes to win an election in Kenya. The explainers explored the cost of elections and how much money candidates spend on elections for various positions in select western, Asian, and African countries. The pieces revealed that Kenya’s election is possibly the most expensive per capita globally, and the use of dark money is prevalent.One of the videos caught the attention of an NGO in Kenya that advocates for a corruption-free society through good governance and social justice, who considered using the video in one of their workshops in a session that highlighted media insights and findings on campaign funding.

The two videos were shared on various platforms, including BBC Africa Online, several language services websites, and all the social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. The cost of elections in Kenya explainer garnered over 140,000 views on Facebook and over 2,700 reactions. The video on how to win an election in Kenya got over 54,000 views and over 1,300 reactions on the same platform, which is above the average engagement of BBC Africa sites.

The team also produced a touchscreen presentation that looked at how women have performed in Kenyan elections since independence and at how the country is fairing compared to its neighboring countries.

Altogether, the team learned the value of patience and how teamwork can lead to great results in this project. It motivated us to embark on bigger data journalism projects.","English, Swahili",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-62444316,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-62184544,https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=797291747927851,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXtSlNQ8Nmo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD-flTPI4zw,https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-africa-63870984,https://www.facebook.com/BBCnewsafrica/videos/3269206470035544,https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg4oTKblGAG/,,
Philippines,Rappler,Small,Participant,,Rappler,"Disinformation research has always been a pillar of Rappler, an organization operating in a country often referred to as the “patient zero” in the global infodemic. As a pioneer in online disinformation research, the Rappler newsroom has a dedicated team of fact-checkers, supported by a wide and diverse [network](https://www.rappler.com/movements/factsfirstph/) of [partners](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Screen_Shot_2022-09-20_at_8.27.13_PM.max-1000x1000.png) working together to counter efforts and influence operations that undermine democracy.

Rappler’s Digital Forensics Team, composed of journalists and data scientists, adopts a unique content-narrative-network approach that brings the organization’s disinformation research beyond content analysis and fact-checking. It also studies the distribution networks and platform vulnerabilities that enable lies and hate to spread online, with real and sometimes violent consequences on the ground.

Mentored by veteran journalists and longtime disinformation researchers, including Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, the Digital Forensics Team works on investigative reports for Rappler’s editorial arm and disinformation research projects for international grants. 

With this project, the team lives up to Rappler’s mission of journalism with impact, and has built a reputation of results-oriented investigations that led to takedowns of malignant accounts and networks, as well as spark crucial discussions on how unregulated tech platforms have severe consequences on politics, national security, human rights, and basic freedoms.","This investigative series looked into how a shooting suspect, who is also a popular pro-administration personality on social media, used his platform to justify violence and eventually garner sympathy and support online. This project documents one of the many cases of online violence leading to on-ground violence, in a political climate where social media is weaponized to cause real, life-threatening harms in the Philippines and across the globe.

Rappler’s Digital Forensics Team looked into the online behaviors of Chao Tiao Yumol, the gunman who killed former Lamitan mayor Rose Furigay and two others in the Ateneo shooting incident. The police found that Yumol had personal motives for killing Furigay, as the two had a years-long conflict.

The team’s investigation found that, on Facebook, Yumol’s posts about the Furigay family ranged from accusations of corruption to involvement in illegal drugs. Yumol also openly supported former president Rodrigo Duterte, defended him from criticisms of his policies, and attacked his critics and mainstream media online.

Additionally, the team looked into Facebook posts and YouTube videos sympathizing with Yumol. The investigation found that, in the first two days since the shooting, almost half of YouTube videos and more than half of Facebook posts that mentioned Yumol expressed sympathy for or supported him – even if both platforms explicitly prohibit posts supporting dangerous individuals and glorifying violent events.

The investigative series raised public awareness and sparked online discussions on the close link between online and on-ground harm and how this impacts democracies, human rights, and national security. Days after our reports were published, Facebook also removed Yumol’s verified status and took down his page completely.","English, Filipino",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/things-to-know-information-ateneo-de-manila-university-shooter-chao-tiao-yumol/,https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/sympathizers-defend-ateneo-shooting-gunman-online/,https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/facebook-takes-down-verified-account-chao-tiao-yumol/,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,DC Thomson. Articles appear in both The Courier and the Press and Journal.,Big,Participant,,Emma Morrice,"I started working as a data journalist in 2021 after working as a news reporter for four years. In that time, I've taken on numerous types of projects while working across The Courier and Press and Journal brands. As the only data journalism team of its kind in Scotland, I have made democratising data my focus, breaking it down into digestible chunks for our readers, whether that be for more serious stories or more light hearted topics. I have tried to ensure a balance of understandability with eye catching visual journalism, alongside writing stories that are informative for readers. These stories are a mixture of storytelling, and making data available that may otherwise be difficult to access for the regular person, such as cost of living information and data on the air quality in Scotland. I am constantly trying to think of new creative ideas, and find different ways of giving information.","In my portfolio, I have provided a number of different examples of different types of storytelling. The first two articles on baby names in Scotland showcases data analysis skills, as data was extracted from a spreadsheet of every instance of baby names from the 70s to 2022. It plays with fun visualisations that present the information to readers in a different format to previous baby name articles, helping to attract people in and keep their interest. There is examples of numerous types of charts and maps within both pieces. The air quality tracker involved setting up an external spreadsheet that is linked to a map, where when a point on the map is clicked, it brings up information and a chart that shows the air quality in that location over time. The spreadsheet is utilised by our transport and environment team, and spikes in the data have given the newsroom stories in the past. To create it, formulas had to be written to allow the data to be as automatic as possible once pasted into the spreadsheet, and each chart linked in the points on the map was created individually and is all linked back to the spreadsheet, The living wage data example was an opportunity to use data journalism to help make a topic that was on everyone's minds, the cost of living crisis, more digestible and easy to understand, while being informative. It mixes descriptions of what terms in the cost of living crisis mean with visualisations and charts that show how things are broken down, and how they have changed over time. The elections data piece is a further example of mixing lighthearted content with important topics. During the 2022 Scottish Council elections, I wanted to create a piece in the run up to the election day with information on who was standing in each council ward. But I found a data source which asked more fun questions to humanise candidates - such as what is your favourite biscuit- so that became the hook of the story. It's important to get people engaged in what is important where they live, and one complaint around elections may be that people don't really know who they are voting for, The piece was designed to supplement other election work being carried out by the newspaper at the time, and it saw a lot of interaction due to the hook of the story. All of these examples show how I have used data journalism to fit in with the current trends, and also big stories to try and interest new readers, as well as providing something different for those who have been with the newspaper for years.",English,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/courier-investigations/3149936/gender-neutral-baby-names-scotland/,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/courier-investigations/3138893/scottish-baby-names-places/,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/business-environment/environment/2966154/track-air-quality-scotland/,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/3822889/living-wage-data/,https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/politics/scottish-politics/3260234/council-elections-previous-data/,,,,,
United Kingdom,The Financial Times,Big,Participant,,The Financial Times Visual and Data team: Ukraine war reporting,"The defining story of 2022, the war in Ukraine and the ripple effects of the conflict have completely upended life in Ukraine and shifted the geopolitical landscape in ways few could have imagined.

Newsrooms have adjusted accordingly, and the Financial Times Visual and Data journalism team is immensely proud of the reporting it has produced in response to Putin’s invasion.

An interdisciplinary group of journalists combining data, design, coding and reporting skills, the team has used visual and data journalism to explain the biggest storylines of the war.

Though our projects have covered a range of topics, they are united by their use of data and visuals, which play an essential role in simplifying and communicating complex issues for readers. This relentless focus on producing clear and digestible graphics and visual stories combined with rigorous data reporting and handling is one of the reasons we believe our work stands out.

First published just days after Putin’s invasion, our daily guide to the war in maps epitomises this drive to help readers' understand the conflict. The page has evolved with the war, but it has been built on clear maps showing territorial control, troop movements and liberated territory — supplemented by analysis from our reporters on the ground.

Another standout feature is the breadth of our coverage. As the war unfolded, the second order effects of the conflict began to come to the fore. From the implications for gas and oil prices to global food security, explaining how the war is changing the world both physically and geopolitically has become a cornerstone of our coverage. 

Over the past 12 months, we feel our Ukraine reporting has shown why the combination of data-driven analysis, front line reporting and visual storytelling is such a powerful blend, and the very cutting edge of quality journalism in the digital age. It has enabled us to take our work to new heights — and to delight and inform readers in the process.

The following is a selection of the projects we are most proud of from a breathless year.","**Ukraine war in maps and charts**
A key consideration for this page was democratising production so the map could be updated without specialist knowledge. To accomplish this, components such as the underlying raster, markers and inset map were made configurable in a Google sheet, rather than code.

This meant that when Ukraine began reclaiming territory, or the focus shifted to the east, the codebase didn’t change, only the data configuration, allowing us to be nimble and responsive — and the map to be updated every day. The map was built using D3 and Flourish with daily data from the ISW. 

The page was made free to read to keep everyone informed and with 4mn page views became one of our most read stories of 2022.

**Russia’s mistakes and Ukrainian resistance**
To tell the story of how Russia’s mistakes and Ukrainian resistance altered the course of Putin’s war we combined open source intelligence with mapping and analysis. 

We showed where Ukraine's forces had gained the upper hand, used video to show how, and spoke to military experts to explain why. This included geolocating the 64km Russian convoy that snaked its way to Kyiv and visualising the ranges of key weapons.

Published less than a month after the invasion had begun, we told the story atop a map of Ukraine to both situate readers and take them into the heart of the conflict. The piece was shared thousands of times on social media, and became one of our best read pieces on the war.

**How the war upended the breadbasket of Europe**
Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s agricultural industry was strategic: bombs disrupted farming; the occupation of the southern ports all but stopped distribution. 

Working with John Reed, on the ground in Kyiv, we combined maps showing the damage done to Ukraine’s infrastructure and importance to global food markets with interviews with farmers whose lives had been upended. The piece “resonated in UN circles”, while readers praised the depth of visual storytelling and reporting.

**Race to replace Russian gas**
Wars have a way of revealing the interconnectedness of the world, and the EU’s reliance on Russian gas while imposing sanctions on Putin was a painful way for the bloc’s dependence on Russia to be exposed. But wars also drive change, and the EU’s plan to reduce its consumption of Russian gas by two thirds was a huge moment. 

We visualised the proportion of Russian supply before analysing every step of the EU proposal. Readers were full of praise and the piece resonated beyond the FT — the director of the OECD describing the findings as a “reality check”.

**Rebuilding one street in Ukraine**
Can you fly a drone in a war zone? You can with careful planning and for the right story. With Max Seddon on the ground in Irpin, we used data, photography and videos to reveal just how scarring Russia’s invasion has been — and the enormous task reconstruction will involve. 

**The 90km journey that changed the war**
Working with diplomatic correspondent Henry Foy, this was the story of Ukraine’s counter-offensive in the north-east: how they did it, why it worked, and what it means for Russia's faltering invasion.

The orchestrated assault relied on Ukrainian guile, cunning and bravery, plus western rockets and pinpoint intelligence that weakened and outsmarted the Russian rear, and saw Kyiv capture as much territory in a week as Moscow had in months.

Maps allowed readers to follow one brigade as it sliced through Russia’s defences, capturing towns, railroads and highway junctions morning, noon and night — and turning the war in the east on its head in just four days.",English,https://www.ft.com/content/4351d5b0-0888-4b47-9368-6bc4dfbccbf5,https://ig.ft.com/russias-war-in-ukraine-mapped/,https://ig.ft.com/ukraine-war-food-insecurity/,https://ig.ft.com/europes-race-to-replace-russian-gas/,https://ig.ft.com/rebuilding-one-street-in-ukraine/,https://ig.ft.com/ukraine-counteroffensive/,,,,
Kyrgyzstan,"Общественный Фонд ""Школа Данных""",Small,Participant,,Школа Данных,"Общественный фонд “Школа Данных” Кыргызстан – небольшая организация, которая состоит из 4х человек: Анастасии Валеевой, Чолпон Узакбаевой, Алтынай Мамбетовой и Екатерины Ступкиной. Наш фокус – дата-журналистика, повышение уровня дата-грамотности, развитие дата-сообщества в Центральной Азии.

В этом году Школе Данных исполнилось 5 лет. Наша организация первой в Центральной Азии начала развивать дата-журналистику в регионе. Мы знаем что лучшие идеи и вдохновение приходят за беседами и неформальными встречами, поэтому активно развиваем сообщество дата-энтузиастов и привлекаем контрибьюторов из разных стран – специалистов по работе с данными, которые выступают не только как эксперты, тренеры, менторы, но и вовлекаются в активности на волонтерской основе. Под менторством наших контрибьюторов вышло немало дата-историй https://opendata.kg/page19725884.html 

Наши основные проекты – тренинги по дата-журналистике, менторство и производство дата-материалов, а также мероприятия на тему данных (хакатоны, митапы, конференции).

В 2019 году мы провели первую региональную конференцию по данным – Datacon Central Asia, хакатон по дата-журналистике #HackPoverty в Кыргызстане и в Монголии. В 2020 и 2021 мы провели международные онлайн конференции по дата-журналистике LAMPA, продолжением, которых стал LAMPA Accelerator. 

За время существования Школы Данных мы сотрудничали с крупными организациями, такими как World Bank, UNICEF, ООН Женщины, Internews, IWPR, OCP в реализации дата-проектов. Также мы создали свои продукты: практическое пособие по дата-журналистике “Ищем сокровища в данных”, учебно-методическое пособие для университетов Кыргызстана “Введение в дата-журналистику”, онлайн-курсы по анализу и визуализации данных, гендерной статистике, эксплейнеры и экспертные статьи, провели исследования на данных о том, как COVID-19 и карантин повлияли на жизни кыргызстанцев. Все это вы можете найти на нашем сайте http://opendata.kg/

В 2022 году мы внедрили предмет “дата-журналистика” в 3 ведущих университетах Бишкека и Оша. А также провели первую в Центральной Азии дата-арт выставку в Кыргызстане ""Игра в классики"". Это был наш эксперимент, целью которого было показать масштаб самых острых социальных проблем. С онлайн-экспозицией вы можете ознакомиться по ссылке: https://kuduk.cc/onlinevystavka-ru.

Последние 3 года, мы проводим LAMPA Accelerator, на котором помогаем участникам из Центральной Азии, Восточной Европы и Кавказа создавать трансграничные дата-истории на актуальные темы. 

Уникальность этого проекта в том, что участники, не владеющие английским языком, но желающие научиться работать с данными, получают доступ к современным навыкам и знаниям в дата-журналистике. На акселератор они приходят либо готовыми командами, либо формируют команды во время обучающей части программы, исходя из общих интересов. Преимущественно, члены команд – это люди живущие в разных странах и часовых поясах, они работают над общим материалом онлайн. 

Дата-истории второго цикла акселератора (2021 год) суммарно набрали более полумиллиона просмотров, а количество репостов, комментариев и цитирований составило почти 12 тысяч. Материал “Дала повод для ревности. Как журналисты пишут об убийствах женщин и почему это может провоцировать новые преступления” https://lr.semnasem.org/femicid/ вызвал общественный резонанс. Авторок пригласили выступить на телеканале “Дождь”, также о них написало индустриальное издание sila.media https://sdelano.media/femicid/. 

В 2020 году дата-исследование «Через стиральную машину» и «стеклянный потолок» https://doxajournal.ru/uni/washing-machine-and-glass-ceiling стало инфоповодом для проведения онлайн-дискуссии о гендерном неравенстве в странах СНГ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIOHNWxW5K4 
Острая для нашего региона проблема трудовой миграции также нашла отражение в дата-материалах акселератора: “Почему Таджикистан и Узбекистан поддерживают трудовую миграцию? Объясняем с помощью данных” https://your.tj/pochemu-tadzhikistan-i-uzbekistan-podderzhivajut-trudovuju-migraciju/, “Оставленные позади. Как трудовая миграция в Центральной Азии влияет на детей” https://forbes.kz//process/resources/ostavlennyie_pozadi_kak_trudovaya_migratsiya_v_tsentralnoy_azii_vliyaet_na_detey/. Суммарно эти материалы прочитали более 18 тысяч раз.","Последняя итерация LAMPA Accelerator по дата-журналистике была сосредоточена на осмыслении войны России в Украине. Мы предложили участникам и участницам из стран Центральной Азии исследовать, как война России в Украине повлияла на их страны. 
Главным вызовом для подобного исследования стало, конечно, наличие, а точнее отсутствие, данных. Статистические комитеты обычно публикуют данные с большой задержкой, что затрудняет оперативное осмысление текущих событий. Нашим командам пришлось находить альтернативные источники данных – например, собирать данные из соцсетей, досок объявлений, договариваться с частными компаниями о доступе к их данным. 

Наши команды также проявили находчивость в анализе данных – например, одна из команд применила методы text mining и natural language processing, чтобы исследовать, как люди обсуждают войну в соцсетях. Несмотря на то, что материал вышел относительно недавно, он успел войти в ТОП 10 дата-материалов по версии GIJN http://bit.ly/3X6dw6w. 
Истории, опубликованные в рамках этой итерации Акселератора, исследуют довольно широкий диапазон тем – от глобальных экономических (“Как война России в Украине повлияла на экономику Казахстана”) до повседневных проблем простых жителей (“Как война России в Украине спровоцировала рост цен на аренду жилья в Казахстане и Армении”). Здесь также есть место и исследованию мировоззренческих и идеологических проблем с помощью данных (“Как жители Казахстана и Узбекистана обсуждают войну в социальных сетях”). 

Команда Акселератора сопровождала весь процесс производства историй – от планирования материала и получения данных до редактирования текста и визуализаций. Менторки Акселератора в течение нескольких месяцев координировали работу команд, объединяющих людей из разных стран и часовых поясов.","Russian, Armenian, English",https://cabar.asia/ru/tolko-ob-ukraine-i-pishete-kak-kazahstantsy-i-uzbekistantsy-obsuzhdayut-v-internete-vojnu-v-ukraine,https://elitar.kz/vse-materialy/sezzhajte-srochno-ili-kak-vzleteli-ceny-na-arendu-zhilja-v-kazahstane/,https://infocom.am/ru/article/95774,https://aktobetimes.kz/novosti/9398-rikoshet-kak-sankcii-protiv-rossii-priveli-k-rostu-cen-v-kazahstane.html,https://kaktus.media/doc/473550_othody_novye_dohody._kak_izmenilsia_rynok_vtorsyria_v_ca_i_kyrgyzstane_za_posledniy_god.html,,,,,
United States,APM Research Lab,Small,Participant,,APM Research Lab,"The APM Research Lab, the now 5-year-old data journalism division of American Public Media, is pleased to submit our portfolio for your consideration this year. Specifically, we would like to draw your attention to the public opinion journalism that has grown out of our partnership with the McCourtney Institute for Democracy at Penn State University. (See https://www.apmresearchlab.org/mood-of-the-nation-poll-motn.)

While there was plenty of journalism related to ""horse race"" election polling over the past year, this polling covered issues ranging from COVID-19 and public education to abortion and the war in Ukraine. In addition, the poll probed deeper themes, like Americans hopes, worries, freedom and rights. And it captured the sometimes-neglected voices of the ""general public"" in ways not done in traditional polling. 

While the McCourtney Institute had been conducting its ""Mood of the Nation Poll"" for years, it had not received broad attention outside of academia prior to developing a partnership with the APM Research Lab. Our goal for the partnership was to conduct quicker-turn analysis of the poll (done approximately quarterly) and to bring the findings to a broader audience to help inform public debate and discussion. We feel that our journalistic approach to the data has done just that.","In 2022 we published a series of eight articles based on two iterations of the McCourtney Institute's Mood of the Nation Poll. The findings were brought to life through compelling and often interactive graphs as well as illustrative quotes directly from survey respondents.

These articles drew over 20,000 page views on our website, and a broader audience through engagement on social media and coverage in other outlets, including Marketplace, Politico's weekly education report, The 74 million, Chalkbeat and Education Week (some of this coverage is shown in the links below).

We feel that public opinion research can be an important way to listen to average Americans who are not always centered in media coverage. Reporting on surveys that are properly conducted can give voice to those who are underrepresented and can help us better understand our friends and neighbors, as well as those with whom we might disagree. 

The APM Research Lab believes that public opinion research must be conducted in a rigorous manner and that it is important to show the public how that work is done in order to help build trust and credibility. Toward that end, the Lab is an active member of the American Association for Public Opinion Research's Transparency Initiative. Each of our survey reports includes a transparency discloure and methods report and our managing partner, Craig Helmstetter, is a member of AAPOR's Transparency Initiative Coordinating Committee.",English,https://www.apmresearchlab.org/mood-of-the-nation-poll-motn,https://www.apmresearchlab.org/motn/what-americans-think-about-inflation-may-2022,https://www.marketplace.org/2022/07/04/theres-little-public-consensus-on-how-to-tackle-inflation-new-poll-shows/,https://www.apmresearchlab.org/motn/teaching-race-evolution-sex,https://www.the74million.org/article/critical-race-theory-covid-sex-ed-schools-survey-attitudes/,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/half-of-americans-dont-think-schools-should-teach-about-racisms-impact-today/2022/02,https://www.apmresearchlab.org/motn/poll-school-covid-policy,https://www.chalkbeat.org/2022/2/1/22912272/masks-schools-parents-public-polls,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-education/2022/02/07/the-great-resignation-leaves-schools-reeling-00006061,https://www.apmresearchlab.org/motn/hope-worry-2022
Mexico,Causa Natura Media,Small,Participant,,Causa Natura,"Causa Natura Media es un medio de noticias non-profit que nació hace dos años en la Ciudad de México. Nos dedicamos al periodismo de datos e investigación y tocamos diversos temas ambientales y climáticos. 

A pesar de la amplia gama de temas que trabajamos, nos especializamos en los temas oceánicos, costeros y de playas; y seguimos con especial interés aquellas actividades productivas que tienen en estos ecosistemas. En 2022 Causa Natura Media emprendió la creación de la Red de Periodismo de los Mares del país.

Esta iniciativa es la primera red en su tipo y ha logrado conjuntar a 35 periodistas provenientes de distintas partes de México, en especial de ciudades costeras. A través de esta red Causa Natura ha impulsado el periodismo de investigación proveyendo herramientas y acompañamiento editorial a los miembros para la producción de historias sobre conservación de los ecosistemas marinos. 

Dicho proyecto fue logrado gracias al apoyo de la Earth Journalis Network, que confió en la calidad periodística de Causa Natura Media para el fotalecimiento del periodismo ambiental en México a través de la capacitación que dieron los miembros de la organización en diversos tallere.s 

En cuanto a la plantilla de periodistas de Causa Natura, ésta elabora trabajos con regularidad que son publicados en el sitio web www.causanatura.org y su sitio web de reportajes https://reportajes.causanatura.org/pesca-de-arrastre-en-areas-restringidas-los-riesgos-en-la-busqueda-de-camaron/ . 

Los trabajos enarbolan elementos del periodismo narrativo que son trabajados a través del periodismo de datos y de investigación. De esta cuenta, el portal cuenta con textos que no sólo cuentan historias puntuales de los ecosistemas y los habitantes en ellas, sino también que brindan una ""vista de águila""al poder retratar como estos casos puntuales son parte de problemáticas más grandes que afectan a comunidades y ciudadanos. 

Por ejemplo, el año pasado Causa Natura Media fue invitada a presentar en el Festival LATAM de Medios Digitales y Periodismo realizado en noviembre del año pasado para presentar un reportaje sobre fugas y derrames de la petrolera estatal Petroleos Mexicanos. Un trabajo realizado con bases de datos que retrató la magnitud de estas averías para con los ecosistemas. 

Para nosotros es claro que el camino de este medio apenas empieza. El enfoque del medio se dirige desde ya a abarcar también lo que sucede en América Latina a través del periodismo de datos, algo que en términos generales se presenta como incipiente en la región. 

Por medio de esta carta de presentación queremos externar que nos sentimos muy honrados de poder mostrar el trabajo que hacemos, y también de felicitar el esfuerzo que ustedes hacen por destacar el trabajo del periodismo de datos de calidad.","Los proyectos acá presentados reflejan reportajes de periodismo de datos que utilizan diversos programas de visualización y retratan la dimensión de problemas ambientales los y esfuerzos que se invierten para solucionarlos. 

Todos los reportajes a continuación han sido originalmente elaborados y publicados por los reporteros de Causa Natura Media, teniendo en varios casos aliados que han retomado nuestro trabajo para ofrecer a sus audiencias periodismo ambiental. 

Entre los principales retos, y como denominador común, para la realización de estos reportajes se puede destacar la precaria situación de la transparencia de datos en México, lo que obliga a los periodistas y sociedad civil a insistir en la entrega de los datos. 

A continuación desglosaré algunos de los repotajes a ser compartidos a continuación, sus retos y soluciones:

El enlace uno se trata de un reportaje de pesca de arrastre, y las implicaciones que esta técnica pesquera tiene para las tortugas marinas. El principal reto ha sido el subregistro de estos ejemplares marinos que quedan enredados entre las redes. 

Si bien datos oficiales sobre este tema son escasos, la reportera ha hecho hincapié en las inspecciones que realizan las autoridades sobre Dispositivos Excluidores de Tortugas, aparatos necesarios para que las tortugas no se queden enredadas. Así, desde este enfoque se retrata el tamaño de un problema que también está vinculado con la falta del papel pleno de las autoridades. 

Como segundo trabajo compartidos un reportaje sobre las concesiones de agua que el gobierno de la Ciudad de México, una de las metropolís más grandes del mundo, otorga a inmobiliarias, frente a las colonias pobres de la ciudad que carecen del servicio de agua. Pese a revisar registros oficiales, los datos de estas concesiones no siempre son públicos, ni son otorgados via la solicitud expresa de transparencia mediante la ley, la reportera se concentro en casos paradigmáticos donde se logró conseguir la información y retratar el lucro que ampara estos proyectos. 

Siguiendo con el agua, el tercer reportaje trata sobre el problema de sequía con el que cuenta la segunda ciudad más grande de México, Monterrey. Pese a la reticencia del sector privado de hablar sobre su responsablidad, una revisión de las concesiones de agua da nombre a las empresas que acaparan el agua en una ciudad que sufre de abasto. Este trabajo pone el énfasis en la desigualdad de la distribución de estas concesiones y recuerda que el problema del agua también pasa por su repartición. 

El cuarto reportaje es una revisión de los presupuestos para medio ambiente de la Procuraduria Federal de Proteccion al Ambiente, encargada de la vigilancia de los recursos naturales . Pese al énfasis de las autoridades de hablar sobre presupuestos asignados en términos nominales, se ha descontado la inflación para retratar la caída del dinero que la actual administración del gobierno federal invierte en el medio ambiente, así como sus recursos materiales y humanos. 

El quinto reportaje es una muestra del tamaño de los incendios en México y la afectación que está teniendo en los bosques. Si bien, el cambio climático ha sentado un caldo para estos siniestros, el descuido o mala intención del hombre están arrasando con las áreas verdes. Este reportaje buscó los datos para dimensionar la magnitud de los incendios en México, nos encontramos con la dificultad técnica de encontrar datos desagregados por municipio, de tal cuenta que hemos hecho una solicitud expresa y tuvimos que manualmente posicionar conforme a las coordenas registradas en la institución encargada.",Spanish,https://reportajes.causanatura.org/pesca-de-arrastre-sin-inspeccion-una-deuda-con-las-tortugas-en-mexico,https://causanatura.org/periodismo-cn/agua-para-el-concreto-crecen-megaproyectos-comerciales-ante-la-escasez-en-la-ciudad-de-mexico,https://causanatura.org/periodismo-cn/monterrey-el-privilegio-se-refleja-en-el-agua,https://causanatura.org/periodismo-cn/profepa-la-austeridad-cobra-factura-al-medio-ambiente,https://causanatura.org/periodismo-cn/estos-son-los-municipios-mas-afectados-por-los-incendios-en-mexico,,,,,
United States,"World Resources Institute, Bezos Earth Fund, Outright, Vote Run Lead, Center for Economic Inclusion",Small,Participant,,Graphicacy,"With a nimble team of ten designers, developers, and strategists, **[Graphicacy](https://www.graphicacy.com/)**’s work in 2022 continued leveraging data visualization and visual storytelling to help mission-driven organizations _Visualize a Better World_. We focus on crafting data-driven narratives, visual stories, and digital experiences that help our partners add interest, context, explanation, conceptual thinking, and emotional resonance to their research and mission-driven communication. 

For **Graphicacy**, empathic collaboration is at the heart of compelling stories; it is in the dialogue and exchange of ideas between our clients, our team, and end users, that we arrive at a shared sense of what is most helpful to drive education and advocacy. We believe this is true for what makes for good data journalism: honoring the human lives or important policy decisions that the data or research implicates, wrestling with contending narratives and voices on a topic, and balancing the trade-offs between affording the reader/user the ability to explore the data or be taken on a guided tour of carefully curated facts and story points. This is what we mean by _Visualizing a Better World_, both as an act and service to participate in meaningful conversations around tough and pressing issues of our time. The work represented in our portfolio is beyond **Graphicacy**’s doing alone, and we are proud of that.

The three projects we’ve included were some of the most meaningful and impactful we produced this year. These types of projects motivate our team because of the change they inspire within organizations to bolster their capacity and champion causes in a visually appealing, statistically rigorous, and emotive way. We serve organizations that aim to tell accessible and compelling stories with their data and encourage them to be force multipliers for advocating for better data storytelling in their local communities and global platforms. 

In collaboration with their clients, **Graphicacy**’s 2022 portfolio of work includes economic inclusion and racial equity; performance-based analytics and visualization methods attuned to the advancement of productive climate change policy; and data-driven advocacy for increased women’s participation in politics. Our work aims to investigate, inform, and inspire action. We’re proud of the work we produced in 2022 and are grateful for the opportunity to be considered for the **Sigma Awards**.","**Tracking systems change with the World Resources Institute (WRI), a Bezos Earth Fund**: 
In collaboration with design agency, Outright, Graphicacy co-created the wide-ranging open-source [Systems Change Lab](https://systemschangelab.org/) data explorer to reveal obstacles to curbing global warming, halting biodiversity losses, building a just and equitable economy, and more of the world’s most pressing needs. We helped create a dynamic visual dashboard for the Systems Change Lab that allows many user groups to track progress (the platform identifies 72 targets of progress across 5 systems), learn and share pathways to change (167 enablers and barriers of progress across 5 systems), and encourage bolder action. Part of the challenge in showing large and complex data systems is breaking them down into bite-sized narratives choreographed by scroll triggers that help users understand the need for change and methodologies beyond the facts and figures. Ultimately providing a larger sense of how the tool relates to their everyday lives to protect the planet. This project was presented at COP27 and plans to include additional systems such as Forests and Land Management, Ocean Management, and Social Inclusion and Equity.

**Revealing gender inequality in politics for Vote Run Lead**: 
Our team supported Vote Run Lead, an organization that inspires women to run for office by calling attention to an alarming gender disparity in political representation, designing engaging social media shareables, and a new data exploration tool. The organization inspires more women to run for office by calling attention to an alarming disparity: The percentage of women holding state legislative seats across America is far less than the percentage of women who comprise the state population. We helped Vote Run Lead build the [State of My Democracy ](https://stateofmydemocracy.org/) data explorer — which was released in time for the 2022 midterm elections. Our teams collaborated to create a robust tool that allows users to easily explore representation broken out by different racial/ethnic groups, as well as overall women of color in state legislatures. Unique state report card pages allow users to see where states stand on issues of importance and commit to running for office. This project is an integral example of how the timely execution of data-driven storytelling and visuals can help aid the public debate and build more inclusive pathways for public service.

**Displaying racial and economic disparities with the Center for Economic Inclusion**: 
Across Minnesota’s Twin Cities region, exclusionary policies have historically limited economic opportunities for Black, Indigenous, Asian, and Hispanic residents. This past year, we helped transform their static research data into a dynamic catalyst for reform — inspiring action among employers, policymakers, and others capable of moving the needle for greater inclusivity. Through our work, [The Indicators for an Inclusive Regional Economy](https://indicators.centerforeconomicinclusion.org/), we provided a narrative and exploratory tool for disaggregating racial groups, revealing data collection gaps, and visualizing disparity and dispersion of outcomes attuned to the sensitivities of racial equity. One goal of this project was, when possible, disaggregating data to the specific race or ethnicity within a particular group. By doing so, we were able to show the cultural communities at a more granular level. Cultural communities refer to the more specific race or ethnicity within a particular group. We gained valuable insights into building a data-driven experience that allows for community calls-to-action and linking to partnering organizations of note while not shaming or casting unwanted judgment about where the racial and ethnic communities stand against one another. The Center for Economic Inclusion presented this project to more than 250 business, government, and civic leaders in the Minneapolis-St.Paul region during the Powering Inclusion Summit 2022.",English,https://systemschangelab.org/,https://indicators.centerforeconomicinclusion.org/,https://indicators.centerforeconomicinclusion.org/indicators/ig1/?culturalCommunity=&view=comparison,https://stateofmydemocracy.org/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hk3lZeEGfc&feature=youtu.be,https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ckt6m0NpTBQ/?igshid=NTdlMDg3MTY=,https://medium.com/graphicacy/a-bold-call-to-action-sparked-by-data-9c679583ec0,https://medium.com/graphicacy/visualizing-inequities-in-representation-15cca8445acb,,
Latvia,Novaya Gazeta Europe,Small,Participant,,Novaya Gazeta Europe,"[«Новая газета Европа»](https://novayagazeta.eu/) — русскоязычное издание, зарегистрированное в Латвии после начала вторжения России в Украину. Наш дата-отдел, который мы номинируем на премию, как и коллектив издания в целом, в основном состоит из бывших журналистов российской «Новой газеты» (по факту она прекратила свое существование из-за цензуры и давления российских властей). 

«Новая газета», а теперь и «Новая газета Европа» – это одно из самых заметных изданий на русском языке, которое систематически занимается журналистикой данных. Мы делаем это уже больше 5 лет, и многие звезды российской журналистики данных успели поработать с нами (например, среди победителей прошлого года – журналисток и журналистов «Важных историй» — есть несколько наших бывших коллег). 

Каждый год мы выпускаем десятки исследований, основанных на данных. Некоторые из них вызывали существенный резонанс. Коллеги-журналисты цитировали наши публикации и звали выступать в эфирах, мы преподавали в университетах и на курсах по журналистике данных, на наши публикации реагировали чиновники (например, экс-глава Росстата Павел Малков).

С начала войны мы существуем как дата-отдел «Новой газеты Европа» и работаем в изгнании, без возможности вернуться в Россию. В этих условиях работа с данными становится особенно важным источником информации о том, что происходит в российском обществе. Это приоритетное направление для всей редакции, поэтому мы не жалеем времени и сил на создание качественных дата-публикаций. Особенно много внимания мы уделяем факт-чеку, визуализации данных и придумыванию важных тем, которые раньше не были описаны через призму данных. И кажется, что нам это удается. 

В этом году, помимо партнеров среди российских СМИ, мы начали публиковать наши материалы на английском языке и сотрудничать с коллегами за рубежом. Наши дата-исследования, среди прочих, публиковали немецкий Spiegel и французский Le Monde. У нас есть несколько совместных проектов с Süddeutsche Zeitung и dekoder. Со временем мы надеямся еще больше расширить пул наших партнеров среди иностранных медиа. Особенно с учетом того, что наш тематический портфель теперь шире, и мы стали писать о российско-европейской повестке. 

Помимо большого количества заметных публикаций, мы считаем, что внесли существенный вклад в институциональное развитие журналистики данных на русском языке. С 2019 года мы проводим ежегодные хакатоны, на которых предлагаем участникам призы и возможность строить карьеру дата-журналиста у нас или в других ведущих изданиях. Уже больше сотни человек прошли через эти хакатоны, многие из них сегодня играют очень заметную роль в российской журналистике. 

По этим и другим причинам мы считаем, что можем претендовать на премию.","**1. Отчалившие ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/06/22/otchalivshie), [eng](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/06/29/cast-off-the-lines))**
С начала вторжения в Украину значительная часть российского истеблишмента оказалась в санкционных списках. С начала войны европейские власти успели арестовать 16 яхт, которые связаны с близкими к Кремлю людьми. Мы проанализировали почти 5 млн километров маршрутов 27 российских олигархов и чиновников.

**2. Здесь был <Роскомнадзор> ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/04/21/zdes-byl-roskomnadzor))**
Мы проанализировали почти 600 тысяч сайтов, которые Роскомнадзор внес в «черный список» за все время своего существования, и выделили пять волн массовых блокировок. С помощью алгоритма машинного обучения мы определили причины блокировок сайтов, распределив ресурсы на категории.

Российская армия — вторая в мире по военной мощи, согласно рейтингу Global Firepower — вскоре после вторжения в Украину столкнулась с дефицитом современного оружия. На войну пришлось отправлять устаревшую советскую технику. Мы изучили, какое вооружение состояло на балансе российской армии до вторжения, а также проанализировали более 4 тысяч единиц подбитой российской техники.

**4. Ротный рефлекс ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/10/17/rotnyi-refleks), [eng](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/10/18/the-people-v-the-draft-en))**
Хотя официально срочников обещают не отправлять на фронт, война и мобилизация усилили нежелание мужчин служить в армии, а количество жалоб на призывные комиссии растет каждый год. Мы проанализировали 15,7 тысяч исков россиян к военкоматам за последние шесть лет и выяснили, как ради достижения плана комиссариаты нарушают права призывников, записывая в войска мужчин с хроническими болезнями и отказывая в альтернативной гражданской службе.

**5. Врагоносцы ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/12/12/vragonostsy), [eng](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/12/14/terror-trouble-and-colonels-en))**
В 2018 году директор ФСБ Александр Бортников заявил, что вооруженное бандподполье на Северном Кавказе ликвидировано. Однако силовики стали находить новые «перспективные» направления работы. Понятие терроризма разрасталось последние двадцать лет и достигло пика после вторжения в Украину: только за последние шесть месяцев 2022 года Генпрокуратура зафиксировала в три раза больше террористических преступлений, чем за весь 2012 год. Мы изучили несколько сотен сообщений ФСБ о предотвращении терактов за последние 10 лет. 

**6. Кровоточащие ранцы ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/09/01/krovotochashchie-rantsy), [eng](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/09/05/kids-with-guns))**
Современные школьники обязаны писать письма на фронт, собирать гумпомощь жителям Донбасса и праздновать «русскую весну», а с 1 сентября каждую неделю учителя должны начинать с поднятия флага и классного часа на тему «спецоперации». С помощью алгоритма машинного обучения мы проанализировали мероприятия, которые провели почти 9 тысяч российских школ с 2012 года и выяснили, как за десять лет идеологическое воспитание стало ключевой частью школьной программы.

**7. Где эта улица, где этот Рейх ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/12/20/gde-eta-ulitsa-gde-etot-reikh))**
Нападение России на Украину вызвало волну переименований улиц в странах, когда-то входивших в СССР. Возможно, и самой России когда-нибудь придется обсудить и сменить названия улиц. Мы изучили, как этот процесс организован в стране, которая почти 80 лет пытается осмыслить свое трудное прошлое. На примере семи городов, 126 улиц и 105 исторических личностей рассказываем, как была устроена и чем закончилась денацификация Германии.

**8. Сделано в Евразии ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/12/05/sdelano-v-evrazii), [eng](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/12/07/made-in-eurasia-en))**
После резкого падения в феврале Россия почти вернулась на довоенный уровень импорта. Заменой ЕС стал Китай и страны ЕАЭС, Соединенным Штатам ― Турция. Однако санкции все равно дают о себе знать. После начала войны Федеральная таможенная служба засекретила статистику внешней торговли, поэтому мы самостоятельно собрали данные по 45 странам — крупнейшим торговым партнерам России. 

**9. «Яндекс.Новости» сыграли в ящик ([rus](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/05/17/iandeks-novosti-sygrali-v-iashchik))**
Война нанесла по «Яндексу» тяжелый удар. Многие из этих проблем связаны с единственным активом — агрегатором «Яндекс.Новости». С помощью сервиса Wayback Machine мы выгрузили более 800 тысяч новостей с начала 2000-х и проследил на данных, как транслируемая миллионам русскоязычных пользователей новостная картина оказалась полностью подконтрольной государству.

Несогласные с вторжением в Украину россияне с 24 февраля провели под арестом как минимум 3,5 тысяч суток и заплатили государству более 55 миллионов рублей. Даже фраза «нет войне» и цитаты из речей Путина оказались вне закона. Мы изучили, как 10 лет власти планомерно сворачивали гражданские свободы и к чему это привело сегодня.

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,Participant,,Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Digital Story Innovation team,"The ABC’s Digital Story Innovations team is a collection of journalists, developers, a designer and social media and video specialists. The team is focussed on data-driven, visual storytelling for Australian audiences.
 
Since its inception in 2017, we’ve used data to investigate and visualise stories on a broad range of issues from the invasion of Ukraine to illegal logging, to political donations and telling the story of severe shortages within Australia’s childcare system.

The DSI’s portfolio for 2022 showcases the team’s expanding repertoire of visualisation and data analysis techniques.

We’ve used 3D models to tell the story of Russia’s war on the Ukrainian population and its culture, and to explore the aftermath of the enormous volcanic eruption off of mainland Tonga. We’ve used data-mining techniques to continue our investigation into money flowing from the gambling industry into Australia’s political system.

The portfolio is more than a showcase of different data-visualisation techniques, it highlights our commitment to meticulously researched journalism and using data to enhance investigations.","In “Culture in the Crosshairs”, we followed the efforts of volunteers and human rights workers to document the destruction of treasured Ukrainian buildings.

We took point cloud data (gigabytes worth of material and billions of individual points) captured on the ground in Ukraine using a LiDAR laser scanner and drone, and painstakingly processed it down to a point where we could build a fly-through of the buildings using 3D javascript animation libraries.

Because of the size of the point clouds, we had to use innovative techniques that allowed the data to load in blocks that allowed the visualisations to work for audience members without fast internet connections or older mobile devices.

In the ‘Syria Playbook’, we used 3D building footprint data to analyse and show the devastation caused by the Russian attack on Mariupol. We used this to quantify the number of buildings destroyed in central Mariupol, using this an entry point into the wider story of the tactics used by Russian forces in Ukraine.
In Mapping Australia’s childcare blackspots we used exclusive data to expose the massive divide in access to early education in Australia.

This project aimed to show users why the research mattered, not just tell them. Rather than simply reporting the key findings, we combined Mitchell Institute data with ABS census data to create a series of beautiful maps and graphics that illustrated, through striking visuals, the stark link between access to childcare and broader disadvantage. Our story sparked significant public debate and shaped policy in the lead up to Australia’s federal election in May election.

In “How a Tongan Volcano Shocked the World”, we used seafloor elevation data to create a model of the underwater caldera that produced the enormous volcanic eruption and resulted in shockwaves rippling through the Earth’s atmosphere.

In 2022, we continued our series “Hitting the Jackpot” which combined sophisticated data mining techniques with meticulous research and shoe-leather reporting to examine, in unprecedented detail, the money flowing from the gambling industry into Australia’s political system. The team produced what was the first investigation to analyse gambling-related political payments across all seven state and territory databases in Australia.

In a piece looking at one the world’s best female football players, Sam Kerr, we built a database from scratch by tracking down footage of nearly every single one of her professional career goals. A challenging task given many games in the early days of professional women’s football in Australia were rarely televised. We then visualised this data to trace the evolution of her game from a promising 15-year-old to seasoned professional.

We also analysed housing rental data to show just how widespread the nation’s rental crisis had become, using geospatial data analysis we interrogated a government’s claim that it was protecting old growth forests and in another year of extreme weather in Australia the team explored how these escalating climate risks could affect insurance premiums.

This portfolio demonstrated a breadth of application of non-standard story-telling techniques that required a combination of journalism skills to unpack, investigate and explain stories, and design, geospatial and development skills to create and adapt the visualisations so that the end result could reached by a wide audience using without compromising the user experience.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-25/the-hi-tech-3d-fight-to-save-ukrainian-culture-from-destruction/101262720,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-26/damage-data-reveals-extent-of-vicious-russian-tactics/101070918,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-22/mapping-australia-s-childcare-blackspots/100894808,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-21/sea-floor-map-reveals-huge-cavity-left-behind-by-tonga-volcano/101674708,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-23/how-gambling-industrys-biggest-political-donors-influence-votes/100592068,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-10/gambling-industry-political-donations-to-states-and-territories/100988954,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-10-15/how-sam-kerr-became-the-greatest-striker-in-women-s-football/101523604,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-21/australia-is-in-the-grip-of-its-worst-rental-crisis/101453246,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-11-13/our-vanishing-old-growth-forests/101641964,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-17/how-climate-change-is-pushing-insurance-stress-to-new-extremes/101336302
Latvia,Daria Talanova,Small,Participant,,Daria Talanova,"Two years ago, I wrote a text about the authorities' attempts to ban single pickets, the only form of protest available to Russians at that time. The text was published by Novaya Gazeta, where I have been working since then.
In what conditions prisoners live, how many people have died from the coronavirus, how the authorities are fighting freedom of speech on the Internet - I tried to answer these questions using open data: court decisions, state registers, information from websites.
On February 24, the war began. From Moscow, I moved to Riga with my editorial staff. Since then, most of my texts are about the war and its consequences. We write about falling incomes of the population, attempts by officials to evade sanctions, and count the number of Russian soldiers who died in the war.
I consider my work, especially now, extremely important. We are trying to preserve the opportunity for Russians to navigate the agenda, since for them the few independent media are the only source of information.","In the text ""Terror trouble and colonels"", I, using data from the Russian FSB, the Prosecutor General's Office and the Judicial Department, told how the fight against terrorism in the North Caucasus turned into the persecution of schoolchildren, Muslims and protesters throughout Russia.
In the text ""When it comes to weapons, age isn't just a number"", using open international data, I analyzed the state of Russian military equipment at the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine.
For the ""Kids with guns"" text, I parsed the websites of 9,000 Russian schools to understand how education and extracurricular activities are becoming more militaristic and how propaganda is infiltrating schools.
Before the start of the autumn conscription into the army, I analyzed the texts of lawsuits against military registration and enlistment offices over the past six years. It turned out that many conscripts are drafted into the army with asthma and diabetes.
At the moment when the “grain deal” between Russia and Ukraine is under threat, we decided to analyze how grain is exported from the Black Sea ports and what role the deal plays for the whole world. In the text ""The Kremlin diet"" I described how Russia manipulated grain prices and deliberately delayed grain ships for inspection in Turkey.","English, Russian",https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/12/14/terror-trouble-and-colonels-en,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/08/26/when-it-comes-to-weapons-age-isnt-just-a-number,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/09/05/kids-with-guns,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/10/18/the-people-v-the-draft-en,https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2022/11/07/the-kremlin-diet-en,,,,,
Russia,[«Важные истории»](https://istories.media/),Small,Participant,,Катя Бонч-Осмоловская,"Я всегда была максимально далека от журналистики: училась в инженерно-физическом институте и работала с компьютерными играми. В 2018 году я разочаровалась в прежней работе и стала искать что-то новое.

За компанию с подругой я пришла на хакатон «Новой газеты» — старейшего независимого издания в России, где появился один из первых российских дата-отделов. Вместе с командой мы изучили десятки тысяч приговоров, вынесенных женщинам в России за убийство, и выяснили, что большинство из них попали в тюрьму за защиту от домашнего насилия. Наше исследование помогло понять масштаб проблемы в стране: российские власти такую статистику не публиковали. Тогда я поняла, что могу использовать свои технические навыки, чтобы делать что-то действительно важное.

В 2020 году я начала работать в дата-отделе «Новой газеты». Мы выпустили исследования о полицейском насилии, коронавирусе, лесных пожарах, фальсификации выборов в Беларуси и других проблемах. За материал о том, как российская пропаганда нагнетает ненависть к мигрантам, мы с соавторкой Алесей Мароховской получили [премию](https://redkollegia.org/archives/text/kak-propagandisty-nagnetayut-nenavist-k-migrantam-a-mvd-obvinyaet-v-etom-inoagentov) «Редколлегия», а также [премию](https://refugee.ru/actual/marohovskaya-winner-award/) имени Лидии Графовой.

В январе 2022 года я присоединилась к команде «Важных историй». После начала полномасштабного вторжения России в Украину мы вынуждены были покинуть страну, чтобы продолжать рассказывать правду о войне. Наше медиа признали нежелательной организацией, по российским законам работа в таком СМИ — уголовное преступление. Российские власти запретили называть эту войну войной и публиковать любую информацию, которая противоречит официальной: за это журналистам и всем, кто выступает против войны, грозит до 15 лет лишения свободы.

Несмотря на это, я вместе с командой «Важных историй» продолжаю исследовать происходящее и с помощью данных рассказывать о том, какой ущерб Россия нанесла Украине и своим собственным гражданам за время войны. Я надеюсь, что мои исследования помогут задокументировать преступления российской армии и властей.","1. [Черная дыра на карте российской статистики](https://istories.media/interviews/2022/02/03/chernaya-dira-na-karte-rossiiskoi-statistiki/)

В начале 2022 года глава Чечни Рамзан Кадыров стал публично угрожать журналистам, правозащитникам и активистам, которые расследуют и критикуют внесудебные казни и преследования несогласных в республике. Чечня — один из самых закрытых регионов России, о жизни в котором мало что известно. Я изучила официальные данные нескольких российских ведомств, чтобы найти аномалии и объяснить, почему в Чечне почти не случается самоубийств, больше всего в России людей с инвалидностью и пропавших без вести, а убийства в регионе почти не раскрываются. 

2. [Во сколько Россия оценивает готовность рисковать жизнью за Родину](https://istories.media/investigations/2022/04/15/vo-skolko-rossiya-otsenivaet-gotovnost-riskovat-zhiznyu-za-rodinu/)

После начала вторжения в Украину российские солдаты, которые выжили в боях, стали возвращаться в страну и получать статус ветеранов, многие из них — искалеченные. Мы собрали данные о господдержке ветеранов и выяснили, что в среднем Россия выплачивает им всего 4 тысячи рублей в месяц ($60), а обещанных государством квартир приходится ждать десятки лет.

3. [Юные, бедные, мертвые](https://istories.media/investigations/2022/05/04/yunie-bednie-mertvie/)

Российские власти скрывают данные о числе погибших на войне в Украине. Мы составили свой список погибших: верифицировали сообщения о гибели военных в соцсетях и установили их возраст и место жительства. Эти данные показали, что из-за войны смертность молодых мужчин в регионах России выросла в разы. 

4. [На войну через биржу труда](https://istories.media/investigations/2022/07/07/na-voinu-cherez-birzhu-truda/)

Еще до объявления мобилизации российские власти активно привлекали людей на службу в армию с помощью сайтов для поиска работы. Объявления размещали и на биржах труда, предназначенных для учета безработных. Я изучила десятки тысяч объявлений о поиске военнослужащих на биржах труда и выяснила, что людей набирают в том числе подразделения, воевавшие в Украине. Например, 64-я бригада, которую подозревают в зверствах в Буче, нанимала более 300 человек.

5. [Сколько российские регионы заплатили за войну](https://istories.media/stories/2022/11/07/skolko-rossiiskie-regioni-zaplatili-za-voinu/)

Пока жители российских регионов годами ждут ремонта больниц, школ и дорог, местные власти выделяют деньги на компенсации семьям погибших в Украине военных и закупку экипировки для мобилизованных. Я изучила данные о расходах бюджета и выяснила, что за 8 месяцев войны регионы потратили на поддержку войны в Украине как минимум 22 миллиарда рублей. На эти деньги небольшой российский регион может жить целый год. 

6. [Какие регионы отдали больше всего мужчин на войну](https://istories.media/stories/2022/10/05/kakie-regioni-otdali-bolshe-vsego-muzhchin-na-voinu/)

21 сентября в России началась мобилизация. Власти обещали отправить на войну с Украиной 300 тысяч человек, но скрывали цифры, сколько людей заберут из разных регионов. Мы собрали максимально полные данные из разных источников, чтобы подсчитать число мобилизованных в каждом регионе. Мы выяснили, что больше всего людей забирали из наиболее бедных областей, а также тех, где уже было наибольшее число погибших на войне в Украине. 

Материал сделан в соавторстве с моей коллегой Соней Савиной и командой Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT). За это исследование мы [получили](https://journalist.name/winners-2022/) премию «Профессия — журналист».

Investigation: How Nigerian states government poorly interacted with citizens via email, despite ICT advancement

The series reports addressed a critical issue of public interest. It looks at how the Nigerian government, in the face of the global pandemic, interacted poorly with citizens electronically despite numerous announcements and publications that the government has put in place to address people’s concerns and inquiries during the pandemic. The story’s depth exposes governments at all levels continuous lack of understanding of the advancement of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) in ordinary citizens’ day-to-day lives.
The story, to my surprise, has started making an impact. After the report, Borno and Cross River states websites came alive. See the link below for more information. This has further demonstrated that investigative journalism is done for the public good and not journalists' good.",English,https://edutorial.ng/investigation-how-/nigerian-state-governments-poorly-interacted-with-citizens-via-emails-during-covid-19-pandemic-despite-ict-advancement-part-1,https://edutorial.ng/report-how-nigerian-tertiary-institutions-failed-to-respond-to-several-email-enquiries-part-2/,https://edutorial.ng/after-edutorial-report-cross-river-borno-states-websites-come-alive/,https://www.icirnigeria.org/gombe-communities-decry-water-scarcity-diseases-as-govt-abandons-multi-million-water-project/,https://halalreporters.wordpress.com/2022/12/31/robberies-potholes-extortions-rule-abandoned-gombe-dukku-darazo-road-despite-fund-releases/,,,,,
United States,"The Marshall Project, but with many partners on the various projects",Big,Participant,,The Marshall Project,"We’re proud to submit a selection of the work created by data journalists at The Marshall Project: Weihua Li, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Ilica Mahajan, Anna Flagg, Anastasia Valeeva, Susie Cagle, Liset Cruz, and Cid Standifer. 

We have a few rules on the data team that help guide our work, and you’ll see that spirit in the projects submitted for your consideration.

* Most stories should not have solo bylines. We work as a team.

* Robustly defensible findings are generally preferable to fragile superlatives (e.g. “the worst in the country”), even if they aren’t as splashy.

* We work in public and show the full context. In a world of misinformation, this is part of how we build the audience’s trust. And most of the data that we work to liberate belonged to the public in the first place.

A great example of our team’s approach can be found in the story “Paroled People Can Vote in Colorado. Why Did Forms Say They Couldn’t?” and its comic-style followup, “Out on Parole in Colorado? You Can Vote.”

The project builds on Sigma-winning work produced by The Marshall Project in 2021 looking at registration rates for formerly incarcerated people in several key states. Working off a tip sparked by that earlier reporting, we learned that Colorado was distributing outdated forms with incorrect information about the voting rights of people on parole. We wrote a story about a man who was affected by the problem along with his crusading mother then we remixed the content into an informative comic. 

The initial story had impact before it was even published when the state finally corrected the forms and informed us a few days before publication, a simple but meaningful change that affects thousands of people. 

It was highly collaborative. There’s four bylines on the story and six bylines on the comic, reflecting a broad mix of data and visual reporting skills. The piece was co-edited by our partner, digital news startup The Colorado Sun. The Sun’s Sandra Fish also made data contributions.

We weren’t particularly worried about how Colorado ranks. Compared to the few other states we have looked at, Colorado’s registration rate was relatively high. But what does “high” mean when over 70% of the eligible population hasn’t registered to vote? 

The project also took full advantage of the reporting material to create compelling visuals. The incorrect information was stored in world-accessible PDFs on public websites. So we just screenshotted the incorrect information and included it as visual evidence in the stories.

After the story was published the state has contacted us to discuss using the comic as part of their efforts to educate people when they are freed from incarceration. And reporters Alex Arriaga and Andrew Rodriguez Calderón were interviewed by incarcerated radio hosts in the country’s only statewide prison radio program to discuss their voting rights if they are paroled. “This is what makes The Marshall Project so impactful, because it’s for people on parole in Colorado,” said one of the hosts. 

Every project in our portfolio has a story like this: A notebook where we shared data and methods or a clever visual remix, or some way of finding impact and engagement beyond the article.","It’s a bit reductive to break this down by each person since many of these projects involve overlapping collaborators, but it also reveals our team’s unique skills and approach.

Weihua Li brought attention to a developing crisis in national crime data by writing a national story and partnering with Axios Local to investigate the data locally months before the issue came to a head when the FBI published national crime stats. She has written national stories, built look-up tools that automatically surface local conditions for the visitor, and driven dozens of local stories around the country based on her savvy data work. 

Andrew Rodriguez Calderón dealt with a mind-bending reporting challenge in Texas by analyzing how data used to justify Operation Lone Star changed between requests as well as the challenge of managing data and graphics for a three-newsroom partnership. Later, his code and analysis powered a major on-going project about books banned in prisons that launched in December.

Ilica Mahajan built a strong portfolio of traditional investigative storytelling with Wesley Lowery, Rachel Dissell, and others by looking at the repeat defendants who make up the bulk of people in Cleveland’s felony courts along with a spatial analysis of who is voting for judges. She also conceived and built a data-powered engagement product that answers the community’s questions about the courts and a special graphic explainer of the demographics of repeat defendants.

Anna Flagg doggedly fought for years to acquire data on child immigrant detentions for her story with Julia Preston about the border detention crisis. Once she obtained it, she found that detention records contradicted public statements about the treatment of children. Then she created compelling maps and charts using the data. Finally, she illustrated the story herself, painting watercolors to represent situations that could not be photographed.

Anastasia Valeeva, an international fellow in the Alfred Friendly Press Partners program who spent her year unpacking American Rescue Plan Act funding spent on criminal justice (also localized by Axios), as well as developing an analysis that shows that mass shootings are increasing in the US. In the latter half of 2022, her work had some of the greatest reach of any Marshall Project reporter.

Susie Cagle, an illustrator, reporter, and editor who joined us on contract, worked closely with Valeeva to unpack and explain ARPA, and continues to investigate the program. Her work exemplifies how data and visuals can intersect in interesting ways. In addition to conceiving and editing several ARPA pieces, she illustrated points taken from different databases we obtained in reporting on the subject. 

Cid Standifer, a reporter with a background in data with The Marshall Project’s expansion in Cleveland, OH, contributed crucial analysis and open methodology to an investigation of racially biased traffic stops in a wealthy Cleveland suburb. Her meticulous handling of incredibly dodgy data gave the piece the strong evidentiary spine it needed. 

Liset Cruz was our Dow Jones News Fellow; she continues to contribute research and reporting to the data team as a freelancer.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/06/14/what-did-fbi-data-say-about-crime-in-2021-it-s-too-unreliable-to-tell,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/03/24/paroled-people-can-vote-in-colorado-why-did-forms-say-they-couldn-t,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/03/21/texas-says-its-multi-billion-dollar-border-operation-is-working-the-evidence-tells-a-different-story,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/26/who-s-really-cycling-in-and-out-of-cleveland-s-courts,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/05/09/we-re-answering-your-questions-about-cleveland-s-court-system,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/06/16/no-place-for-a-child,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/09/07/how-federal-covid-relief-flows-to-the-criminal-justice-system,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/07/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-rise-in-u-s-mass-shootings,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/11/21/ohio-cleveland-traffic-tickets-black-drivers-bratenahl,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-list-find-your-state
Russia,Медиазона,Small,Participant,,Дата-отдел «Медиазоны»,"«Медиазона» — это небольшое независимое интернет-издание на русском языке, которое запустилось в 2014 году. Главный фокус «Медиазоны» — освещение нарушений прав человека в России. Изначально мы писали про политические уголовные дела, суды и пытки в правоохранительной системе, но с годами наша тематика расширялась — по мере того, как расширялись репрессии. 

Первые дата-исследования в «Медиазоне» появились в 2020 году на фоне эпидемии коронавируса. Мы искали способ достоверно рассказать о росте числа заболевших — и поняли, что график в этом случае будет нагляднее, чем текст. После первых таких публикаций мы поняли, насколько мощный инфографика инструмент, и решили не останавливаться.

Главный предмет нашей гордости — это то, что мы смогли создать дата-отдел, используя нераскрытые таланты тех, кто уже работал в «Медиазоне» — то есть, не нанимая других людей и без привлечения сторонних ресурсов. То, что начиналось как хобби нескольких журналистов, теперь похоже на редакцию внутри редакции, которая выпускает качественные и узнаваемые дата-материалы. 

В 2021 году мы выиграли European Press Prize за расследование об избитых участниках протеста в Минске. 

У нашей команды есть несколько подходов, которые отличают нас от других. Во-первых, всю нашу графику мы создаем сами, не используя готовые решения вроде DataWrapper или Flourish — это дает нам творческую свободу и уникальный стиль. Для создания графики мы используем D3.js, часто обращаясь к уже существующим опенсорсным элементам и настраивая их под себя. Во-вторых, мы добываем информацию там, где ее не находит никто другой. Мы используем расширенный парсинг сайтов, OSINT и старый-добрый ручной сбор информации для особых случаев. 

С 2020 по 2022 год мы выпустили 34 больших дата-материала. Они касались коронавируса, вакцинации, проблем правоприменения, репрессий и политических заключенных в России. Самым продуктивным для нашего дата-отдела был 2022-й — мы выпустили 14 дата-материалов, в том числе несколько больших расследований. 

Мы хотим представить жюри Sigma Awards портфолио из наших лучших материалов за 2022 год — они касаются войны и всего, что с ней связано. Мы были бы счастливы получить эту премию — она напомнит нам о том, что наша работа ценится не только читателями, но и коллегами и профессиональным сообществом. Это чувство особенно важно для нашей команды, так как мы оказались в вынужденной эмиграции и чувствуем себя оторванными от других.","**Кто гибнет на войне с Украиной. Исследование «Медиазоны»**

Первое дата-исследование «Медиазоны» о войне вышло в [апреле](https://zona.media/article/2022/04/25/bodycount) 2022 года. Совместно с командой волонтеров мы изучили больше 1 700 публикаций о гибели российских военных в Украине. Число реальных потерь выше — но наши данные позволяют судить о том, что происходит с российской армией во время вторжения.

_Замечание для жюри: Мы хотим обратить внимание на то, что у этого проекта есть развитие. Вместе с командой волонтеров мы продолжили следить за списком потерь и создали отдельную обновляемую публикацию, которая выходит до сих пор. Эта публикация подана нами на Sigma Awards отдельно, так как мы считаем ее главной нашей работой в 2022 году. Та ссылка, что мы приложили выше — это исследование только на апрель 2022 года, которое наметило контур для дальнейшей работы. Если это не противоречит вашим правилам, мы бы хотели, чтобы эта апрельская публикация была в нашем портфолио, а обновляемый подсчет — отдельно._

**Путин награждает погибших в Украине секретными указами. Число закрытых документов стало рекордным за последние 20 лет**

Небольшое [исследование](https://zona.media/article/2022/05/05/topsecret), которое пришло нам в голову во время работы над предыдущим материалом. Большинство указов президента Владимира Путина о награждении погибших солдат засекречены — мы решили посчитать долю таких указов.

**Самая полная карта мародеров. «Медиазона» проследила, как военные за три месяца отправили от границы с Украиной 58 тонн посылок (и один «Орлан»)**

Второе (после подсчета погибших) самое крупное и ресурсоемкое [расследование](https://zona.media/article/2022/05/26/marauders) «Медиазоны». Российские военные использовали транспортную компанию СДЭК, чтобы отправлять домой от границы с Украиной сумки с неясным содержимым — вероятно, с похищенными во время оккупации Киевской области вещами. Используя сайт СДЭК, мы перебрали около 18,5 млн заказов и изучили десятки часов видео с камер в офисах СДЭК, чтобы расследовать это мародерство. Мы нашли подозрительные связи между городами, посчитали общий вес посылок и даже смогли заглянуть в некоторые из них.

**«Как он чеки покажет, он же в Украине». «Медиазона» выяснила, что именно слали военные от границы — и поговорила с ними**

 Продолжение предыдущей статьи. После первой публикации с нами [связался](https://zona.media/article/2022/06/27/km3) сотрудник СДЭК и передал нам накладные на отправленные военными грузы. Мы изучили сотни документов, чтобы узнать, что именно военнослужащие посылали от границы — и смогли дозвониться до них самих.

Число подобных атак увеличилось после объявления о мобилизации. «Медиазона» [изучила](https://zona.media/article/2022/09/27/burn) всю доступную информацию о подобных нападениях, чтобы разобраться, кто и почему поджигает военкоматы и как силовики пытаются погасить эту волну.

**Давай поженимся. Рост числа свадеб показывает, что к середине октября в России мобилизовали как минимум 492 тысячи человек**

[Исследование](https://zona.media/article/2022/10/24/wedding-season) «Медиазоны», основанное на очень остроумной находке одного из наших журналистов. 

После начала мобилизации 21 сентября получившим повестки россиянам разрешили заключать брак в день обращения в загс, а не ждать месяц, как обычно. Мобилизованные массово воспользовались этой возможностью. Мы обнаружили этот свадебный бум в большинстве регионов страны — и смогли расчитать по нему общее число мобилизованных, сравнив информацию от загсов с данными Росстата и переписи населения. По нашей оценке, к середине октября в России мобилизовали как минимум 492 тысячи человек.

Работы 7 и 8 — это не большие расследования, но мы хотим приложить их, чтобы показать жюри наши быстрые иссследования на открытых данных с простой графикой.","Russian, English",https://zona.media/article/2022/04/25/bodycount,https://zona.media/article/2022/05/05/topsecret,https://zona.media/article/2022/05/26/marauders,https://zona.media/article/2022/06/27/km3,https://zona.media/article/2022/09/27/burn,https://zona.media/article/2022/10/24/wedding-season,https://zona.media/article/2022/12/08/papers,https://zona.media/article/2022/12/11/espch,,
United States,"CNN, As Equals",Big,Participant,,CNN As Equals Gender & Elections Series,"In 2020, CNN received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to build a team to advance its already-award winning work in gender journalism that started in 2018. With a new dedicated team and resources, headed by Eliza Anyangwe, From January 2021 As Equals set for itself the goal of not just telling stories about women but telling engaging, human-interest, visually strong, multimedia stories about patriarchy: uncovering the winners and losers of sexist norms, practices, markets etc. We set out to focus on underreporting stories, from underrepresented voices, prioritizing deeply reported features, explainers and investigations over breaking news. 

Headquartered out of CNN International’s EMEA office in London, team is composed of reporters in Nigeria and India, a senior video producer leading the development of video content, a producer working on our collaborations, panels and other ways to engage the public, policymakers or media peers in the stories, and editors in Amsterdam, London and Nairobi. 

We are an all-woman team inspired by the work of newsrooms dedicated to public interest reporting and engaging storytelling on any subject such as ProPublica; we are focused on the “majority world” like media organizations such as Rest of World. We believe deeply in collaboration, working closely with other team at CNN from data and visuals to TV programmers and newsgathering, and working closely with non-journalistic organizations who provide us exclusive information, important context and access to strong characters.","As Equals gender and elections series was a year-long project based around one important question: “with this election, what is at stake for the women (and gender minorities) in this country?” The expression that women are “half of the sky” is commonly used and yet when you look at media coverage of elections, the needs, concerns and aspirations of half of the population never feature highly in the election agenda. Media producers and audiences rarely consider (outside of exceptional horrific events) what life is like for women in any particular country. The objectives of this project was to answer that question indiscriminately for every national election of 2022; to have a quick way to understand (in)equality in each country through a data graphic; to make that graphic shareable so that it could be embedded in journalism produced by other CNN teams – so you needn’t explore the gender components yourself to have them; and catalyse discussion on the gender elements of an election as a direct consequence of CNN casting its powerful spotlight on the topic. 

As ‘As Equals’ managing editor, I was lead on this project, working closely with the visuals editor, the staff and freelance writers that covered each story, and the newsgathering colleagues across the world who would be covering the election in more traditional ways. 

Centering women’s lives in election coverage was a challenge as was finding reputable sources of transparent, gender disaggregated data and up-to-date sources on demographic information in all the countries we covered. The solution for the latter point was to be flexible: rather than use the same metrics in every graphic, we would represent visually what was available, recent and relevant. 

It became necessary to read many reports and compare research from human rights organizations in the country and international institutions (UN, WHO). Where quantitative data was lacking or out-of-date, we used qualitative social research about the minority groups featured (for example queer and indigenous people in Brazil) to stand up the reporting. 


Metrics and impact: 
The data widgets were featured in numerous other CNN stories for which we cannot specify the reach but recognise the value of multiple outlets for the information. 

We were not able to cover all the elections (some snap elections were called for example, giving us no time to prepare) but we reported 7 stories, which received a total of over 450,000 unique visitors. (We have included just five stories in the portfolio submission). 

Off the back of our reporting, journalists who authored the analyses were invited to comment on air, for the Amanpour show on CNN and France 24 in English as was the case for our French election analysis writer, Megan Clement. The France 24 package used the identical title to our story. 

The stories were picked up and shared by human, and women’s rights groups, policymakers, academic institutions, Politics Twitter",English,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/05/asia/john-lee-hong-kong-gender-feminist-movement-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/07/europe/macron-french-presidential-election-gender-equality-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/27/americas/brazil-election-women-voters-asequals-intl-cmd/index.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/09/asia/philippines-election-online-sexual-abuse-as-equals-intl-cmd/index.html,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/19/australia/australia-election-older-women-homeless-intl-dst-hnk/index.html,,,,,
Brazil,Nexo Jornal,Small,Participant,,Nexo’s Coverage of the Brazilian Elections with Data Visualization,"Nexo is a Brazilian digital news outlet established in 2015 with the goal of providing context to the news. It has a Graphics section and team since the beginning, aiming to increase data literacy in Brazil and increase access to data and statistics. 

Data Visualization is the core focus of the Graphics Team. We apply the visual approach to every possible topic, covering a wide range of subjects, mainly about Politics, Environment, Science, Culture, and Entertainment. 

At Nexo, we work collaboratively on all our publications, and no single person is the only responsible for any piece of work. To manage the variety of tasks with a small team, we divide our efforts into two subgroups: one focused on design and the other on data science. This division is flexible and can adapt to the needs of each project, but it allows us to efficiently handle a wide range of topics.

We have been present on Sigma's shortlist since its beginning, for single projects and a portfolio. In 2021, we received an honorary mention for a publication on Covid-19.","The Brazilian General Elections in 2022 were a pivotal moment in the country's history, as voters had the opportunity to decide on the continuation of the Jair Bolsonaro administration. The protection of the Amazon Rainforest was a key issue that divided candidates, making the elections a tense and significant momentalso for the world. 

For the news outlet like Nexo, it was also one of the highest peaks for audience engagement. The campaign officially began in August, and from then on, readership increased. 

Until the results of the second round (at the end of October), almost all of our graphics materials were focused on the Brazilian elections. They are generally identified by their orange teasers and color palette in our website. 

The visual identity is a central is a central part of any planned coverage and portfolio, and in a Electoral coverage it is even more relevant. Bad choices of color and visualizations can be deceitful and mislead readers in a sensitive topic.

We covered all possible topics, from the general profile of candidates (race and gender, mainly) to party alignments, expenditures on Google Ads, campaign donations, etc. With a small team, we published more than 40 publications (the 10 links here are a selection of them). That volume is comparable or even superior to the data coverage of large newsrooms in Brazil. 

**Planning was essential**

To accomplish that, planning was essential. We divided the coverage in different moments: pre-electoral, electoral and results coverage. The latter being the most critical moment. Brazil adopts Electronic Ballots and all the results were available within few hours. In the 24 hours after polls close, we produced almost the same quantity of a month of work. 

Some contents were “pre-made”, we just changed numbers in the electoral day, and others demanded a quick response and midnight work from our team. The order of publication was also unpredictable and demanded some flexibility. 

**No paywall and everything on Social Media too**

One important thing to note is that all of our Electoral contents, with no exception, were adapted to social media. We also adopted this social media strategy to increase the number of people impacted by our work, specially in a place where misinformation spreads quickly. Bring high quality data visualization to social media was our way to fight fake news.

We had six Graphics publications on Nexo's Instagram with more than 10k likes, with the most liked with 45k (Resultado das eleições presidenciais no 1º turno de 2022). Which is a lot, considering that we are a small newsroom.

We cannot publicly disclose audience numbers, but the number of readers on the website increased. The newspaper took off the paywall from its Electoral coverage and the demand. In our specialized newsletter, the open rate stayed around 30%, however the number of clicks on links doubled in the two special editions, in October and November.


**Technologies**

Regarding technologies, we used mainly Adobe Illustrator and R. Interactive contents were made using JavaScript. In 2022, was also the first time that we get data directly from Superior Electoral Court server (and not from third-party applications).

As the sole editor, I balance my commitment as a full-time Environmental Engineering college student at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, United States, with creating science stories with real-life impact. All the skills I use for our data journalism are self-taught. Yet, we consistently produce in-depth, collaborative projects that other more established, more robust newsrooms cannot. 

We are proud of being a platform for marginalized and unconventional voices in science writing, and that starts from the top. 75% of the writers I work with are women/ non-binary, 40.6% are people of color, and a whopping 50% are of Gen-Z. In addition, drawing from my own trilingual upbringing, we publish our work in six languages, most notably Nepali and Chinese. I am committed to making a difference through my reporting work as I contemplate journalism school as my next step.","I provided edits and visuals from all of the following projects:

1. Cross-pollinating for the Collective -- Carolyn Bernhardt reports on how Indigenous knowledge in stewarding native bees in Southern Mexico can provide a model for animal and cultural conservation.
2. Heat Waves, Wildfires, and Downpours: San Diego is Changing and Climate Change is One Culprit -- Hanna Webster looks at how global warming, extreme weather, and Santa Ana Winds combine to create a dangeous future in San Diego, one of the most productive agricultural regions in the US. 
3. Are Our Sierra Nevada Towns Destined to Go Down in Flames? -- Published in collaboration with the Sierra Nevada Ally, Richard Bednarski goes back to Quincy, CA, a small alpine town he grew up in with a population of 5,000, to understand the impacts the past years of devastating wildfires have had on rural Califonians. 
4. ""Official Negligence"": Floods in Nigeria Threaten Millions, Quarter of Country's GDP -- Reported by Samuel Ajala, for the first time, The Xylom is able to quantify the scale of damages brought to Nigeria by flooding.
5. Perspective: China’s Zero-COVID Policy Is Destructive But Reopening Without A Plan Is Even Worse: This is an explainer piece by Cherry Cheung, a Ph.D. student from Hong Kong at the Indiana University School of Medicine on the various negative impacts Zero-COVID has brought to China, and the uncertain path forward as China does a 180-degree turn with its policies. A Chinese version is in the works.
6. In Chicago, Health Advocates Flood the Streets With Opioid Antidotes: I created a database of all the locations where Illinois residents can obtain the opioid antidote Narcan for Jennifer Clare Ball's piece.
7. A Pyramid Frozen In Ice: We got the scoop on what the world's higher laboratory in Nepal looked like after COVID and budget crunches, a month ahead of Scientific American. The sory is published in English and Nepal

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,,PÚBLICO,"Fundado em 1990, o PÚBLICO é um dos jornais de referência em Portugal. Com uma aposta forte em jornalismo de qualidade, o jornal foi pioneiro na infografia e, mais tarde, no jornalismo de dados em Portugal. Ao longo dos últimos anos, essa aposta revelou-se um importante componente do que é a marca PÚBLICO, com produtos inovadores e que definem o jornalismo de referência pelo qual se pauta.

O mesmo se aplica aos leitores, com quem o diálogo a partir da informação e dos trabalhos publicados se revela mais frutífero com a criação de trabalhos diferenciadores e que oferecem novas perspectivas de analisar e observar o mundo - seja na política, na economia ou na saúde.

Daí que peças jornalísticas como o “Prometómetro”, que cumpre o requisito de escrutínio às propostas eleitorais exigido pelos cidadãos, ou o “Conheça o impacto da inflação no seu carrinho de compras”, que acompanha o impacto da inflação no bolso dos consumidores portugueses, sejam exemplos de um jornalismo que não perdeu proximidade com o digital - ganhou sim, mais uma ferramenta de contacto.

A atenção ao contexto político e económico a nível nacional e internacional também faz parte do que é o jornalismo de dados do PÚBLICO, contribuindo e colaborando com todas as secções do jornal para identificar as melhores histórias. O caso do artigo “Como a seca afecta Portugal e o seu concelho”, em que a partir dos dados reflectimos sobre um problema abordado anualmente no país, é um espelho desta prioridade de incorporar os dados nos grandes projectos e temas do PÚBLICO. Outro exemplo desta relevância é a peça “Mais infelizes, mais nervosos. O que se passa com os adolescentes?”, onde se mostram os resultados de um inquérito que mostra como os adolescentes estão mais infelizes.

Tal como não é possível pensar no jornalismo de referência sem o seu carácter reflexivo e contextualizador, também já não o podemos fazer sem a pertinência dos dados e da análise de informação que o jornalismo de dados permite. O valor acrescentado que oferece à informação e ao debate público é essencial num órgão como o PÚBLICO, que se inscreve numa tradição jornalística de exigência, qualidade e diversidade.","1 - [Os números que resumem a época 2021/22]
O PÚBLICO olhou para os dados quantitativos que ajudam a explicar o essencial do campeonato de futebol que agora chegou ao fim. A esta análise juntamos também uma retrospectiva de todas as edições da prova e dos vencedores das demais competições. 

2 - [Borboletas, um reflexo colorido da perda de biodiversidade]
Estudos feitos ao longo dos últimos anos revelam números alarmantes: um deles mostra que, em 27 anos, desapareceram 75% dos insectos voadores que existiam em reservas naturais. Há ainda estudos que indicam que, nas próximas décadas, cerca de 40% das espécies de insectos podem ficar extintas a nível mundial.

3 - [Mais infelizes, mais nervosos. O que se passa com os adolescentes?]
Os resultados dos últimos inquéritos a 5809 alunos portugueses do 6.º, 8.º e 10.º anos, numa amostra representativa destes diferentes anos de escolaridade, são claros: os adolescentes sentem-se mais infelizes.

4 - [O espectro da democracia portuguesa]
As eleições para a Assembleia Constituinte, em 25 de Abril de 1975, foram as primeiras realizadas de forma livre e com sufrágio universal. Desde então, organizaram-se mais 15 eleições legislativas, que viram surgir novos partidos e coligações e que ditaram o fim de muitas outras organizações políticas. Eis a “manta de retalhos” de que é feita a democracia em Portugal.

5 - [Actualização semanal da covid-19]
O Público segue a evolução da pandemia em Portugal. Uma infografia onde se mostra esta evolução. Os dados que eram actualizados diariamente passaram a sê-lo semanalmente mas continuaram a ser informação relevante. 

6 - [Prometómetro]
Após as eleições, o acompanhamento do trabalho do governo também é importante. E perguntamos: está a cumprir o prometido? Elegemos 150 medidas emblemáticas do programa do governo português e acompanhamos regularmente o progresso (ou cumprimento) destas propostas eleitorais.

7 - [Com que programa eleitoral sairia para jantar?]
Se fosse jantar, qual era o programa eleitoral que levava? O PÚBLICO transformou as propostas dos partidos num clone do Tinder para responder a esta pergunta e mostrar com quem os leitores mais concordam.. 

8 - [1926-1974-2022. Como evoluiu o país da ditadura à democracia]
Os dias de democracia superaram os dias que Portugal viveu em ditadura - um dos principais motivos elencados para o atraso estrutural do país. Com um século de dados, analisámos as diferenças em 14 indicadores estruturais da população portuguesa. 

9 - [Conheça o impacto da inflação no seu carrinho de compras]
Com a onda de inflação a afectar praticamente todo o mundo, procurámos os bens essenciais. A pergunta é simples: como tem encarecido o carrinho de compras dos portugueses? Todas as semanas, é actualizada a inflação em 63 produtos essenciais.

10 - [Braga é o distrito onde a diferença entre alunos mais pobres e os outros é menor]
Todos os anos, o PÚBLICO olha para as escolas portuguesas e as notas dos alunos. Desta vez, com dados anonimizados como o nome da escola, o género e os apoios sociais, pudemos identificar em que regiões as diferenças sociais persistem na educação.",Portuguese,https://www.publico.pt/2022/05/16/infografia/numeros-resumem-epoca-202122-704,https://www.publico.pt/2022/04/26/infografia/borboletas-reflexo-colorido-perda-biodiversidade-676,https://www.publico.pt/2022/12/14/infografia/infelizes-nervosos-passa-adolescentes-722,https://www.publico.pt/2022/01/23/infografia/espectro-democracia-portuguesa-659,https://www.publico.pt/2022/05/20/infografia/actualizacao-semanal-covid19-portugal-705,https://www.publico.pt/interactivos/prometometro/,https://www.publico.pt/eleicoes-legislativas-2022/propostas-partidos,https://www.publico.pt/interactivo/ditadura-democracia-portugal,https://www.publico.pt/interactivo/inflacao-portugal,https://www.publico.pt/rankings-escolas-2021/interactivo/notas-internas
United States,Numlock News,Small,Participant,,Numlock News by Walt Hickey,"Numlock News is a daily morning data journalism newsletter that highlights numbers in the news. It's got tens of thousands of subscribers, the majority of whom open it every day. Not only does it spotlight the best in data journalism on a daily basis, it also highlights the commonality of data in the more traditional avenues of journalism, by bubbling up the interesting numbers that undergird the news of the day. 

Written in a compelling and inviting voice, the newsletter introduces data to people who otherwise may shy away from it, serving as an on-ramp for our field.

Numlock is published every weekday morning at 6 am Eastern Time. It has no ads, and is self-sustaining based on subscription revenue from over 1,500 paid subscribers. Each edition is seven entries linking out to journalism and directly crediting the writer for it. Each has a bolded number or piece of data from the story. The seven entries are in one of four different categories based on what type of data they are, be it currency amounts, sums or averages, percentages and fractions, or projections and estimates. In this manner the contextual framework for the data is preseved. 

The newsletter's support comes from readers who recieve a special Sunday edition which features a journalist responsible for an especially interesting story. Numlock platforms data journalists and sites for a broad audience, in 2022 interviewing data journalists and spotlighting work from Christopher Ingraham, Rachael Dottle, Clare Malone, Philip Bump, Mandy Zou, Ben Lindbergh, Maggie Koerth, Amanda Shendruk, Taylor Orth and Hannah Weinberger. The hope is to introduce the best in a generation of data journalists to a wider audience. 

Each winter, the Numlock Awards Supplement continues the work from my FiveThrityEight Oscar model to prognosticate and cover the Oscar race. This newsletter is read by thousands of people and offers an appealing way to talk about data and modeling to an audience underserved by data. 

Numlock strives to elevate the most compelling data journalism being done on a given day, whether or not the work in question categorically considers itself data journalism. The goal is to lower the barriers of access to our profession, to make our work unintimidating and downright entertaining. It hopes to give the best in our field a platform to reach a wide audience, and to serve as a daily digest of our fascinating and ever-evolving world. Numlock readers come to appreciate the best goals and techniques of our craft, and can do so at any level of familiarity. 

I have been a professional journalist for ten years as of 2022, and I have written a daily morning data journalism newsletter for eight of those years. Numlock, which I founded after leaving FiveThirtyEight, will turn 5 years old in May 2023. 

I graduated William & Mary with a degree in Applied Mathmatics in 2012. I started my career at Business Insider, joining FiveThirtyEight when it was bought by ESPN in 2013, and serving as their chief culture writer. I left in May 2018 to start Numlock, and later that year I joined Insider as the senior data editor. I am a proud member and boardmember of GALECA: The Society of LGBTQ Entertainment Critics, and in 2022 I won the Pulitzer Prize in Illustrated Reporting for my work on _I Escaped A Chinese Internment Camp,_ a comic that told the story of a Uyghur woman surviving persecution in Western China. I have a book about the intersection of data and pop culture, _You Are What You Watch_, to be published by Workman in October 2023.","Project Link 1 is a direct link to Numlock News, a daily morning data journalism newsletter read by tens of thousands of people every day.
