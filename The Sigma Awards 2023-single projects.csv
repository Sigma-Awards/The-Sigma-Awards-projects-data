Netherlands,"El Pais, Lighthouse Reports, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, Enass, The Independent",Big,Winner (joint),"The Prize Committee jointly recognized two entries on the same topic, and with overlapping partners, for their groundbreaking investigation into the inhumane treatment of asylum seekers and migrants attempting to enter Europe.

The teams comprised Lighthouse Reports and its partners, El País, Le Monde, Der Spiegel, SRF Rundschau, and Republik. 

In the first entry, the team used advanced visual investigation techniques to reveal the tragic events that led to the deaths of 23 people and the disappearance of 77 others at the border post in Melilla, Spain. The investigation’s impact was significant, resulting in extensive questioning of the interior minister in Parliament and follow-up reporting that confirmed the deaths on the Spanish side. This story sheds light on the challenges that asylum seekers and migrants face when seeking protection in Europe.

In the second, the team obtained the internal Joint Operations Reporting Application (JORA) database via a Freedom of Information Request and conducted a data-driven investigation that confirmed Frontex’s involvement in 22 pushbacks concerning 957 people. This investigation was remarkable in its combination of data mining, cross-referencing, and visual evidence to expose the secret agency’s illegal activities. The investigation led to the resignation of Fabrice Leggeri, Executive Director of Frontex, the day after the publication, as the evidence presented was damning.

These projects are a testament to the importance of collaborative, data-driven investigative journalism in exposing abuses of power and holding those in authority accountable.

Despite the appalling death toll,
serious questions remain unanswered by Spain and Morocco over what happened. Lighthouse Reports and partners El País, Le Monde and Der Spiegel undertook the most advanced visual investigation to date to establish what happened at the border post and how an attempt to seek protection in
Europe led so many people to a violent death.","Our report, published initially in El Pais in Spain, was which featured made headlines in the entire country, the interior minister was extensively
questioned in Parliament and accused by all but two parties of having lied. Spanish MPs used photos and evidence from our film to question the minister.
Our film was showed by an MEP at a European parliament debate on the issue and there was extensive follow up reporting on the death we were able to prove happened on the Spanish side.","The shock, confusion and sheer number of people involved in the Melilla deaths left behind a fragmented trail of
digital clues. Graphic but often meaningless in isolation, once located in time and space these clues can begin to
be pieced together forensically to make sense of an event and compare conflicting accounts of what has
happened. Our team sourced and analysed 145 video clips, mainly shaky phone camera footage, scouring all
available online platforms related to the events of June 24. By spending time on the ground we were able to trace
40 survivors (many of whom are visible in the videos of the day) and obtain previously unseen visual evidence. We
then geolocated, and synchronised this material, placing it on a timeline. Our reporters gained access to the
border post at the centre of the deaths and took footage of its interior and layout. Using this material as a
reference alongside LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data, we built a detailed animated model of the border
crossing and the surrounding area. We used this model to understand the layout of the crossing and to map the
video evidence onto it, as well as to help survivors walk us through the events, allowing them to place the incidents
on each side of the border.","There was secrecy and defensiveness on both the Morrocan and Spanish side around the border deaths, which meant we had to go to great lengths to obtain the information we needed. Spain essentially wanted to cover up the events and Morroco considers all its migration related security activities to be highly sensitive and confidential. It was extremely difficult to access the border post of Barrio Chino, our team was initially declined access by Spanish officers and even removed from the site during a visit with the EU Parliamentary left. It tooks months of work to persuade officers to give us a tour. The inside sources that agreed to speak with us on the Spanish side took great personal risks to do so and show us footage that no other journalists were able to see. On the Morrocan side, human rights activists warned us not to speak to any locals ourselves because that would put them at risk of retaliation by the country's security forces. Along with our Morrocan media partner, Enass, we had to be extremely cautious to make sure the victims we spoke to on the ground would not be at risk for agreeing to be interviewed.","The takeaway is that combining emerging techniques and working with newsrooms from different countries make these complex and highly sensitive investigations possible. Journalists can learn from the methods and technologies we used to create a timeline of events, to reconstruct the border post and to match videos filmed on the day onto it. The fact that we had journalists from both Spain and Morroco on the team meant that we had unique access to sources and inside knowledge on both sides and Le Monde's and Der Spiegel's commitment to the story helped other partners withstand internal pressures. None of the partners we worked with could have done an investigation on a topic this sensitive and obtained so much information individually. This is a great example of the practical and political gains that come with collaborations.","English, French, Spanish, German, Arabic",https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/reconstructing-the-melilla-massacre/,https://elpais.com/videos/2022-11-29/documental-tragedia-en-la-frontera-de-melilla-el-papel-de-marruecos-y-espana-en-las-muertes-del-24-j.html,https://www.lemonde.fr/international/video/2022/11/29/morts-de-dizaines-de-migrants-a-melilla-ce-qu-il-s-est-vraiment-passe-a-la-frontiere-entre-l-espagne-et-le-maroc_6152186_3210.html,https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/fluechtlinge-in-melilla-was-am-grenzzaun-wirklich-geschah-die-rekonstruktion-a-3c5e7ffa-6035-4a1f-bdc8-c2e1a92d90d3,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/melilla-spain-border-morocco-asylum-seekers-b2234673.html,,,"Jack Sapoch, Beatriz Ramalho da Silva, Bashar Deeb, Maud Jullien, Klaas van Dijken Arthur Weil-Rabaud, Aziz Alnour, Alison Killing, Javier Bauluz, José Bautista, Javier Bernardo, Maud Jullien, Salaheddine Lemaizi, Steffen Lüdke, María Martín, Georgia Bempelou, Stefanos Bertakis, Javier G.

",Frontex Involved in Illegal Pushbacks of Hundreds of Refugees,2022-04-28,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, OSINT, Politics, Immigration, Human rights","Animation, Google Sheets","A joint investigation of Frontex’s internal database by Der Spiegel, Lighthouse Reports, SRF Rundschau, Republik and Le Monde – shows that Frontex is implicated in illegal pushbacks of refugees in the Aegean Sea on a big scale.

Data recorded in its internal Joint Operations Reporting Application (JORA) database, when cross-referenced with other sources, indicates that Frontex was involved in at least 22 verifiable cases between March 2020 and September 2021. The real number is likely to be much higher. In the same time period, Frontex recorded its own role in 222 incidents involving 8,355 people.","Across Europe, mainly in German, Switzerland and France, hundreds of thousands users read or watched the investigation. It directly lead to the resgination of Fabrice Leggeri, who was Executive Director of Frontex at the time. Leggeri was forced to step back by the Management Board of the agency the day after the publication since the investigation showed that Frontex's involvement in illegal pushbacks was much bigger than previously proven. Leggeri had been under intense pressure due to other investigations by Lighthouse Reports, DER SPIEGEl and other partners.

The investigation and the downfall of Leggeri triggered headlines all over Europe. It put the Greek pushback campaign and the use of violence at EU borders into the spotlight. And it led to increased scrutiny by the European Parliament and Frontex having to proclaim a ""fresh start"" for the agency including a new leadership.","The reporters obtained the JORA database via a Freedom of Information Request. Frontex sent a redacted version of the database and deleted all descriptions of incidents, but accidentally provided descriptions for 145 incidents which took place in the Aegean between April and August 2020.

The database, in use by Frontex since 2011, includes more than one million lines and 137 columns. The reporters analysed the information contained and were able to identify reporting patterns which point to cases of pushbacks.

The incidents have an almost identical description: a Frontex asset (plane, helicopter, vessel or drone) detects a migrant boat crossing from Turkey and warns the Greek Coast Guard. The Coast Guard informs the Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Greece and Turkey, after which the Turkish Coast Guard returns the boat to Turkey. The incidents are registered in JORA as “prevention of departure”, and include the estimated number of people stopped from entering the EU, and a tick-box to signal Frontex involvement.

Cross-referencing incidents in JORA with those recorded in other databases, such as the Turkish Coast Guard’s or NGO reports, plus gathering additional visual evidence, we confirmed Frontex was involved in 22 pushbacks concerning 957 people. They were put in life-threatening situations on the open sea, left adrift on inflatable vessels without engines until the Turkish Coast Guard picked them up.

But between March 2020 and September 2021, Frontex was involved in a total of 222 incidents which it recorded as “prevention of departure”, amounting to 8,355 people. Sources within Frontex, the Greek Coast Guard and the police all confirmed that the term “prevention of departure” is used to indicate pushbacks.","Work on border violence and illegal pushbacks has become increasingly difficult in many states in the EU, especially in Greece. Reporters operate under the shadow of possible legal threats, law suits and public defamation campaigns. Frontex, on the other hand, is a notoriusly secret agency who is trying to limit its answers to FOIA requests to the bare minimum.",The investigation was built on top of several investigative cross-border projects that proved Frontex's involvement in illegal pushbacks. The investigative work started in spring 2020 and led to us having a superior understanding of how the pushbacks at sea work and what happened in specific incidents. The information gathered from the internal database was onl useful in combination with our knowledge and sources from past investigations.,"German, English",https://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/frontex-involved-in-illegal-pushbacks-of-hundreds-of-refugees-a-9fe90845-efb1-4d91-a231-48efcafa53a0,https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/frontex-the-eu-pushback-agency/,https://www.republik.ch/2022/04/27/inside-frontex-die-geheime-datenbank-der-eu,https://www.srf.ch/news/abstimmungen-15-mai-2022/finanzierung-frontex/migration-frontex-in-pushbacks-in-aegaeis-involviert?wt_mc_o=srf.share.app.srf-app.unknown,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/28/revealed-eu-border-agency-involved-in-hundreds-of-refugee-pushbacks,https://www.spiegel.de/ausland/frontex-in-illegale-pushbacks-von-hunderten-fluechtlingen-involviert-a-086f0e5a-0172-4007-b59c-7bced325cc75,,"Emmanuel Freudenthal, Bashar Deeb, Gabriele Gatti, Francesca Pierigh, Htet Aung, Eva Constantaras, Klaas van Dijken, Jack Sapoch, Giorgos Christides, Steffen Lüdke, Julia Pascual, Tomas Statius, Lukas Häuptli, Michael Zollinger, Carlos Hanimann, Keto Schumacher","Lighthouse Reports is a non-profit investigative outlet that works with traditional media organizations to investigate and uncover wrongdoing.

United States,"The Associated Press, FRONTLINE",Big,Winner,"Wars are hideous moments of history. In wars with more civilian casualties, where basic civilian rules are disrespected, things are even more detrimental.

Showing war crimes is a way to reveal that it’s about way more than a power contest involving military forces. That’s what the Associated Press team presented in partnership with FRONTLINE.

In a war scene, between struggles to access information and, first of all, to confirm data which depends on government clearance that are contaminated by political interests, Journalism can fulfill a fundamental role allowing people to know about what is really happening.

The product complies with several requirements to be recognized as Data Journalism. Although it’s a hard subject, the team found interesting ways to present the history to the public. By using icons and filters resources, it allows to scale the problem. More than that, it presents proofs of each case quoted. It uses video, through the documentary, as a visual synthesis, by not letting any doubts that war crimes were committed. The special material is aligned to a trend of transparency, where the public was invited to know which was the methodology used to release the story.

It’s another example of great Journalism. It’s a reference. ",Putin's Attack on Ukraine: Documenting War Crimes,2022-03-16,"Investigation, Long-form, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Database, Fact-checking, Infographics, Video, Map, Satellite images, Audio, Agriculture, Crime, Human rights, Terrorism","3D modeling, Drone, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","The Associated Press and FRONTLINE spent 2022 documenting evidence of potential war crimes committed in Russia’s war in Ukraine, and reporting on the atrocities and the search for justice. Just 30 days after the war started, we launched War Crimes Watch Ukraine, an interactive web experience where reporters documented visual evidence of targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure that likely violates the laws of war.","The reaction to this body of work has been widespread and ongoing. Early on, two groups affiliated with the U.S. State Department asked AP to meet about this work because they were impressed with our documentation and verification standards. 


An adviser to Ukrainian war crimes prosecutors told the AP, “You have described the beginning of the criminal enterprise and Putin’s role in it.” A team of lawyers pursuing civil litigation on destruction of property in Bucha said they are including the “Crime Scene: Bucha” video in their filing with the European Court of Human Rights. 


A prominent Russian dissident journalist living in Ukraine, Alexandr Nevzorov, urged his followers, “Watch without fail. Very strong but simple and intelligible material about Bucha. Created by the Associated Press. If anyone had any “doubts” about the criminality of Putinites there will be none left.” 


The Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine asked the Centre for Information Resilience (whom we worked with) to compile a dossier of evidence for them on General Chaiko, specifically his presence in Zdvyzhivka.","For War Crimes Watch Ukraine, AP and FRONTLINE built a database of wartime incidents that likely were violations of international humanitarian law and the laws of war. Reporters analyzed the open source images and claims using satellite imagery, facial recognition apps, reverse image searches and other open-source reporting techniques to verify that the images and claims were real. The database was built using a combination of Google Sheets and Airtable, a cloud collaboration platform made up of a database, a web interface that resembles a spreadsheet for reporters to use, and an API to support building external applications. 


We then built a public interface using a static site generator, Gatsby. Gatsby is based on React, a popular front end framework. These tools allowed for the application to be built efficiently and flexibly as the nature of the war in Ukraine and its crimes evolved. For instance, as we better understood the nature of the war crimes, we were able to dynamically add different facets and categorizations to incidents and display those with little additional work on the web application.
 
For Crime Scene Bucha, AP and FRONTLINE partnered with SITU Research and the Ukrainian citizen research group Jus Talionis to document the patterns of violence in the Ukrainian village. Over a period of weeks, researchers from Jus Talionis flew drones extensively documenting the city of Bucha. SITU took this unique city-wide dataset and built a digital model of the town and layered in evidence, including locations of bodies, CCTV footage of Russian soldiers, photographs from AP photographers and video from FRONTLINE filmmakers to create an immersive short documentary that shows the magnitude of the horror that befell this single community. This effort cost tens of thousands of dollars.","This was a true cross continental, multi-format effort that involved dozens of people from two news organizations. It demanded major coordination and also creativity.

When Russia invaded Ukraine, there was almost immediately a flood of visual evidence of potential war crimes appearing on social media. AP and FRONTLINE sought to verify what was happening to separate fact from hoax, and also to counter Russia’s efforts to deny what was happening. We moved quickly to train reporters both in reporting techniques that would allow them to verify events and claims using open source techniques, and also to familiarize the team with international humanitarian law and the laws of war. 

Just 30 days after the invasion, we launched War Crimes Watch Ukraine, an interactive web experience where reporters documented visual evidence of targeted attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure that likely violates the laws of war. For ten months the catalog was updated daily. 

As our teams in the US and the Middle East worked from afar, AP’s investigative reporters and FRONTLINE’s film team went to Ukraine and worked with local staff to document the atrocities on the ground. AP reporter Erika Kinetz worked tirelessly to develop sources in Ukraine, an effort that eventually paid off when she obtained hundreds of hours of CCTV footage from the city of Bucha during Russia’s occupation and thousands of audio intercepts of Russian soldiers calling home and talking about their actions and the fighting conditions.","In the age of social media, journalists can report on and document events in faraway places and don’t have to be constrained by geography. However, that kind of reporting requires the same rigor and fact checking that on-site reporting requires. Using open source verification techniques and resources can allow that kind of rigor. Our reporters started with an image, video or claim found online, or in other news reports. They then used satellite imagery, Google maps and Google photos, reverse image searches, facial recognition apps and other techniques, along with traditional reporting via phone calls and interviews, to verify what they had found. 

In building War Crimes Watch Ukraine, AP and FRONTLINE created a data set that didn’t otherwise exist and we were able to use that to tell additional stories of the war. The database led directly to stories about hospital bombings, attacks on schools and their effect on children, and the destruction of energy infrastructure.

It also pays to weigh the best medium for each story. For the investigation into grain smuggling, for example, it was clear that visual storytelling that shows each step in the smuggling operation would be most revealing.",English,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/interactive/ap-russia-war-crimes-ukraine/,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-business-lebanon-syria-87c3b6fea3f4c326003123b21aa78099,https://apnews.com/article/Ukraine-Russia-war-violence-investigation-1e242681582e523126456f1da8286661,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-europe-middle-east-government-and-politics-e3756976cf33cf5de29aa62d61ea7eb6,https://apnews.com/article/bucha-ukraine-war-cleansing-investigation-43e5a9538e9ba68a035756b05028b8b4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW8YYhUIK0s,https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/putins-attack-on-ukraine-documenting-war-crimes/,"Authors: Erika Kinetz, Tom Jennings, Sasha Stashevskiy, Annie Wong, Vasilisa Stepanenko, Michael Biesecker, Beatrice DuPuy, Sarah El Deeb.

We created an innovative web application —inspired by the HBO television series ""Game of Thrones""—which investigates the connections between wealthy families and political campaigns. We reveal political clans' money trail and interests ahead of elections, aimed to captivate first-time voters. 

GoV exposes the candidates of these political Houses that seek a seat in Congress and are running for office. CP cross-referenced, analyzed, and visualized information from at least 22 databases in Colombia and abroad.","Game of Votes (GoV) was launched ten days before the congressional elections and was widely republished in local media, precisely in the influence region of the Political Houses investigated. Cuestión Pública's team participated in two Instagram live shows hosted by three popular Instagrammers to disclose the GoV's findings. The shows reached 3,500 people in real-time.

The Game of Votes app's release put on the media agenda the political dynasties/houses candidates in the Congress elections. Four mainstream and independent media outlets covered this topic ahead of legislative polls after our publication.

Three regional media outlets republished our investigations according to the 'house' of influence in their territories: Atlántico, Magdalena, and Norte de Santander departments.

Regarding presidential elections, we introduced ""The Game"" containing two interactive tools for both runoffs to help citizens create their presidential election forecast. Those tools had 3.6K unique visitors to the page.

Furthermore, we paid for digital advertising —Instagram & Facebook— published in the regions where these political families/houses have territory control (Atlántico, Magdalena, Norte de Santander, Santander, Valle del Cauca, Sucre, Antioquia, Córdoba, and Bolívar). Our information reached young and first-time voters between 18 and 34 years old.

Digital advertising obtained an average of 300 to 350 thousand impressions on social media. Ads reached 47% of men and 36% of women between 18 and 34 years old. In addition, we advertised in an independent digital media outlet with more than 500K followers on Instagram, whose audience is composed mainly of young people.
In some way, the GoV application helped citizens unveil the traditional political houses punished in the ballots. The actual Congress is composed of a greater plurality of political forces.

This app has hit 41.9K unique visitors to the whole GoV website.","The Game of Votes (GoV) application was built in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Next framework. GoV wireframes were created in Figma. A UX/IU designer worked for three weeks to design and improve the platform's user experience.

For the ""Game"" section, we used Power BI as a tool for the 2022 first presidential runoff and our in-house development for the second one.
We created a database to track networks, members, enterprises, public resources, and candidates of Political Houses. We cross-referenced it with different public databases to identify connections between their members (relatives, allies, associates) and, government branches & control entities, and local public procurement. In addition, we published findings on abuses and irregularities in public resources.

Cuestión Pública scrapped open government databases, through R and Python scripts, for the massive extraction of information on public contracting and Congress bills.

The consolidated data of each Political House was compiled in Google Sheets files to facilitate the visualization of information and content control by journalists and editors and its integration with the web platform. 

 The Google Sheets connected to a test environment where we made all changes and updates on it before migrating to the public web application page. We could do this thanks to a script written in the Google Apps Script environment that works as a custom API for the data. Besides, we created a 'custom' application to cross-reference our reference list with the Colombian Electronic Public Procurement System procurement through an API.

A video producer made the GoV trailer video in 3D modeling based on HBO's Game of Thrones intro. A Colombian musician recorded the original ""Game of Thrones"" song in Colombian Caribbean folklore —Vallenato— version and granted us its use for the main video of ""Game of Votes.""","For generations, political families have controlled territories in Colombia. They have maintained their power through the accumulation of money, abuse of power, and holding public resources management.

Through organized structures of politicians, business people, contractors, political cronyism, and, in some cases, paramilitaries and drug traffickers, a few families - political clans - who own large tracts of land have appropriated public business and the administration of the resources of the cities, the regions, and the Nation.

In a medieval universe, GoV shows how the clans manage to stay in power over time; how their relatives and allies are strategically placed in public positions in all branches of power; how the members of these political structures sign contracts while their partners or relatives govern; exposes the interests of the Houses in the economic sectors, their business assets and points out their nepotism.

Every election year, the same clans return with their —""Trojan horses""— candidates to obtain votes —with questionable practices— and hold power without changes, which is an obstacle to new local leaderships.

The Colombian National Streak in 2021 was a turning point in the political spectrum. Protests were led by young people fighting against rising inequality, police brutality, and abuse of power during the Iván Duque presidential term. Most of them were first-time voters. For this reason, young people gained importance during elections.

Game of Votes (GoV) translates to young citizens, the power game played by political houses running for general and local elections. We crossed popular cultural symbols —Game of Thrones and Colombian Caribbean folklore music— with political reality to expose the mighty political families controlling territories and reach a younger audience, determining the 2022 election results in Colombia.

GoV explained the complex phenomenon of power accumulation and political-business structures in a way that is understandable to a citizen, how their vote contributes to the powerful machinery of these families.

After publishing, we were disturbed by two people involved in our investigation. They requested to be retired from the Political House's network in our publication because it affected their reputation. Supported by our methodology, we refused any changes. 

For this investigation, Cuestión Pública explored campaign funding, public contracts of the Political House's members, the clan's companies in Colombia and abroad, the criminal activities documented in their environments, and the ""jobs for mates"" of those who participated in the 2022 elections that defined the political course of the country.

In 2022, a leftist president won office for the first time in Colombia.","There are many lessons. The Game of Votes application was designed for mobile-first use; this is part of its success. We added a user-centered design to optimize displaying information and enhance user experience. Inspired by a medieval universe, we handled to engage a young audience curious about political and electoral issues in an innovative approach. Crossing popular culture and data-investigative journalism without losing rigor is a winning product that new audiences appreciate and consume.

Another lesson is to be inspired by gamification functions. The Game of Votes app displays data visualizations to explain simply the complex phenomenon of the accumulation of power in the Political Houses in Colombia. This application makes it easy for citizens to consume a large amount of data and information collected, organized, analyzed, and investigated through a unique methodology that combines classic investigative journalism, data-driven journalism, OSINT techniques, and a legal filter. GoV integrates 499 nodes of people and 316 companies.

Taking advantage of the new HBO TV series ""House of the Dragons"" hype, we created TikTok and Reel videos of some GoV Political Houses to increase engagement with the app and its information —even after Congress and the Presidential elections—.

The story of soil contamination and air pollution from nearby highways  in the Logan barrio could have stopped there. But Cabrera went further, using historical deed restrictions, zoning regulations and other archives to show how policies implemented throughout the industrial era created systematic discrimination against people of color, barring them from healthier neighborhoods and isolating them in the harmful pollution.",Ghosts of Polluters Past,2022-01-13,"Investigation, Long-form, Environment, Health","QGIS, R, Python, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer, Tableau, Mapbox, SVG, HTML/CSS/JavaScript","Centuries of industrialization and racial inequities have shaped American cities. Minority communities have long found themselves segregated to areas zoned for the heaviest-impact industrial uses -- and they’ve suffered, with high rates of cancer, asthma, and cognitive impairments.
 
In “Ghosts of Polluters Past,” Grist’s Yvette Cabrera and Clayton Aldern paint a poignant portrait of the Mexican-American Logan neighborhood of Santa Ana, California, and its residents’ multigenerational struggle to fight industrial pollution that blighted their livelihoods.","Alongside calls from residents, the project, published in partnership with the nonprofit news site Voice of OC, prompted the Santa Ana city council to approve a plan in April that commits to comprehensively address lead contamination hazards. The work also provides a model for how enterprising journalists can uncover the hidden history of relic industrial sites and soil-lead contamination, making it accessible to residents and empowering them to take control of their environment. The series received the 2022 Breaking Barriers Award from the Institute for Nonprofit News, awarded annually for “reporting that brought new understanding to an issue affecting people who are historically underrepresented, disadvantaged or marginalized, resulting in impactful change.”","""Ghosts of Polluters Past"" and its partner story, ""Toxic Churn,"" combine original soil sample collection, innovative spatial data analysis, archival work, academic and scientific partnerships, and classic shoe leather reporting to produce a humanizing, yet data-forward look at the hidden threat of lead contamination in the soil of America's cities.
 
Yvette Cabrera spent five years independently gathering and analyzing more than 1,600 soil samples, as well as combing through six decades of historical business directories and industrial siting and zoning data. Her richly detailed research and reporting, aided by Clayton Aldern’s data analysis and visualization, revealed that more than half of the samples she collected in the city’s poorest neighborhoods contained levels of lead that California considers unsafe for children. Through historical documents, she traced Santa Ana’s legacy of discriminatory policies (including racial covenants) that exposed areas such as Logan to freeway emissions and polluting industries. To convey the findings in question, the team conducted a series of spatial interpolations and regressions on Cabrera’s raw data, thereby generating ‘hot spots’ that lent themselves to a bold visual treatment.
 
In “Toxic Churn,” Cabrera and Aldern apply their findings, outlining how the toxic legacy of historical industry in urban neighborhoods has largely escaped regulatory scrutiny throughout the United States. Because of the way small industrial operations spread through urban areas during the 20th century without any oversight, many (perhaps most) city dwellers unknowingly live in neighborhoods burdened by toxic contaminants – like lead, arsenic, and cadmium – which remain in soil long after the businesses that dumped them are gone. Via temporal and spatial statistics, Cabrera and Aldern illustrate how official databases (like the EPA’s Toxics Release Inventory) represent drastic undercounts of this cumulative pollution.","Santa Ana is a city of 335,000 people in Orange County, California. Its population is more than 75 percent Latino. It’s been nearly a century since the city zoned the already-established residential barrio of Logan for industrial use. As the neighborhood’s agricultural roots gave way to industry, products like petroleum, aviation gasoline, lead ore, heavy metals, chemicals, herbicides, and pesticides came and went on the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroad lines — but a part of them never left.
 
Today, the Logan census tract is identified as a “disadvantaged community” by the state Environmental Protection Agency’s environmental health screening tool because it’s among California’s most pollution-burdened areas. While generations of Mexican Americans battled the encroachment of industry in the Logan barrio and won several major victories, the neighborhood remains filled with scrap yards, recycling centers, auto repair shops, and other industrial and commercial businesses that continue to take their toll on the neighborhood.
 
As in other urban centers across the country throughout the 20th century, city leaders’ decisions transformed Santa Ana’s built environment, leaving a cumulative legacy of lead contamination in neighborhoods where Mexicans and Mexican Americans were forced by segregation, discrimination, and historical social norms to live during the first half of the 20th century — and where Latino residents continue to reside today.","Yvette Cabrera has been reporting on Santa Ana’s lead contamination for more than five years, and over that time she has continuously dug deeper into both the community and the issues it faces. This project is a reflection of those years of cultivating deep source relationships with residents, nonprofits, and community leaders. Her pairing up with Grist data reporter Clayton Aldern allowed Cabrera to tell not just the human and justice story, but to use original empirical research to create a piece of journalism capable of influencing real change – which we saw by the city council’s response last year.",English,https://grist.org/project/equity/california-lead-soil/,https://grist.org/project/equity/california-lead-soil-historical/,https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&v=335591865239104,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnMggSaNXWM,,,,Yvette Cabrera & Clayton Aldern,"Yvette is a former senior staff writer at Grist, where she reported on the intersection of of justice, equity, and the environment.

What the Markup's Still Loading project did was quantify those disparities, and show how they disproportionately affect poorer neighborhoods and communities of color.  It showed the injustice didn't stop there: slow internet connections cost the same as fast ones, meaning communities are disadvantaged twice. In laying out the scale and inequity of the issue, the Markup did outstanding work in the public interest.

GeoPandas, Shapely, and Matplotlib for geospacial data. For statistical models we used statsmodels.org. For mapping: scikit-learn. And for interactives: Kepler, Datawrapper, and JavaScript.","An investigation by The Markup found that AT&T, Verizon, EarthLink, and CenturyLink disproportionately offered lower-income and least-White neighborhoods slow internet service for the same price as speedy connections they offered in other parts of town. The project includes our main investigative story, methodology, and story recipe. We also updated an earlier story called “Why Is My Internet So Slow?” to include more specific information to help consumers.","Following publication, the reaction to this story was overwhelming. The Markup reporters Leon Yin and Aaron Sankin were interviewed on national public radio shows like Marketplace Tech, On The Media, Oregon Public Broadcasting, and All Things Considered. They were invited to give presentations to the National Digital Inclusion Alliance and have briefed local, federal, and state-level lawmakers and regulators about our findings.

Leon and Aaron also created a guide showing other journalists how to localize the story for their own communities, which many publications did. Dozens more republished the story, mostly through The Markup’s partnership with the Associated Press. Aaron also updated a story he wrote earlier in the year to add explanations on how individuals can check if they’re able to switch to another internet provider and get better speeds, and how people might be eligible for a monthly subsidy to help with their internet bill.

The investigation has also proved a crucial resource for government officials working to bring more Americans online. Detroit’s director of digital inclusion told The Markup that the data would help the city decide which neighborhoods to prioritize for the construction of its in-progress open-access municipal fiber network. 

The investigation also came as the Federal Communications Commission is in the midst of a rulemaking process aimed at “preventing digital discrimination.” This process gives the agency broad leeway to take action to rectify digital inequality. Our reporting has the potential to directly influence this rulemaking process—especially since the story and data were formally submitted for consideration by the California Community Foundation.","Our data collection method is modeled on a 2020 Princeton study that used an often overlooked information source: the “broadband availability tools” from internet service providers’ own websites. We used those lookup tools—by finding and using the underlying APIs—to collect granular information on internet plans offered by ISPs to individual addresses. This allowed us to join information about price and offered speed with the socioeconomic data of the surrounding area and test for patterns among consumers receiving the worst value for the same monthly fee. 

Between April 15 and Oct. 1, 2022, we gathered internet offers from AT&T’s, Verizon’s, EarthLink’s, and CenturyLink’s websites for 1.1 million U.S. residential addresses for 45 cities that we had collected from open sources. We focused on the largest city served by at least one of the four ISPs in each state. 

We used Census block group data and historical redlining maps, where available, to determine the socioeconomic characteristics of areas that were disproportionately offered the worst deals. To do this, we grouped addresses by their area’s median income, racial/ethnic demographics, and redlining grades to compare the proportion of slow speeds offered to each of these groups for each city and ISP. 

In addition, we conducted a logistic regression to determine whether business factors such as competition and customer adoption (explanations that ISPs have said play a role in where they choose to upgrade equipment) affected the disparities in who got the worst offers. Even after adjusting for these factors, lower-income, least-White, and historically redlined areas still got the worst offers in the vast majority of cities we examined.","We filed 46 public records requests asking cities, states, and counties across the country to provide any franchise agreements they had with the internet service providers that were the subject of our investigation. The initial goal was to determine if any of these providers were violating the terms of their franchise agreements by offering inequitable service across a municipality.

Through this process we learned that internet service is not regulated at the local level, as is cable service. None of the cities provided franchise agreements that covered internet service, even though there were agreements with some of the companies covering cable service. 

There were also challenges with gathering the data.

**Address data difficulties**: For each address we gathered from OpenAddresses and NYC Open Data, we identified both its Census block group and whether it was within the boundaries of the city by plugging its coordinates into the Census.gov geocoder API. We chose this approach because zip codes or city names were often absent from the open-source data we used.

**Address selection difficulties**: For each city and ISP, we went through each Census block group and took a random 10 percent sample of the addresses we had collected (called a stratified sampling). If a lookup tool told us that an address was not served, or invalid, we continued to search new addresses until we reached a 10 percent sample of each block group. This is how we collected a representative sample of offers (speed and price) for each city and ISP in our investigation.

**Difficulties with historical redlining maps**: We relied on the University of Richmond’s Mapping Inequality project, an online repository of residential “mortgage security” maps and other associated documents from the Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC), to categorize historically redlined neighborhoods. We merged HOLC grades to addresses by checking if an address’s coordinates fell within the boundaries of graded areas to which we had access. The digitized maps don’t include every map created by the HOLC, since some were never digitized by the researchers at Mapping Inequality. Further, some cities in our data were never mapped by the HOLC. As a result, we have maps for only 22 cities. 

**Data gathering difficulties**: ISPs make the process of querying an address a slow and multistep process; they also block IP addresses that make too many sequential requests. We reverse-engineered their websites by finding and using up to five APIs that make up the process of querying an address for internet plans. To prevent overloading the ISP servers or getting our queries rejected, requests were delayed and routed through a network of residential IPs provided to The Markup by The Bright Initiative.","All of the data collected for the story was published to The Markup’s GitHub page, and The Markup also published the methodology for the investigation alongside the story. We hope that our transparency at every level of this project helps cement showing your work as an industry standard, especially because it helps newsrooms without the same resources or access.

We also wanted to make sure we got our findings into the hands of local reporters and to carve out time to help them publish their own stories. First, we loaded the address-level data into interactive maps and produced granular and summarized output files organized by city and provider. Then, alongside Leon and Aaron’s investigation, we published a how-to guide (a “story recipe”) so that local journalists could use our findings, combine it with their own reporting, and get more specific, localized reports to their readers. We’ve been in awe at the impact we’ve seen from helping local reporters parse this data we wrangled, including in the comments from their readers expressing that they’ve long suspected internet inequities and now finally have something to affirm their suspicions.",English,https://themarkup.org/still-loading/2022/10/19/dollars-to-megabits-you-may-be-paying-400-times-as-much-as-your-neighbor-for-internet-service,https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2022/10/19/how-we-uncovered-disparities-in-internet-deals,https://themarkup.org/story-recipes/2022/10/19/journalists-investigate-which-neighborhoods-in-your-city-are-offered-the-worst-internet-deals,https://themarkup.org/the-breakdown/2022/04/12/why-is-my-internet-so-slow,,,,"Leon Yin, Aaron Sankin, Evelyn Larrubia, Joel Eastwood, Gabriel Hongsdusit, Paroma Soni, Jeremy Singer-Vine, Maria Puertas, Jill Jaroff","Leon Yin (primary reporter, investigative data reporter)

The project from Amenaza Roboto is a great example of journalism as a trigger for good as the team’s findings will very likely shape Uruguay’s climate related policies for the years to come. This is also a data effort that can inspire others across the world to tackle the same issue in the same clean and visually compelling way. ,La ciudad sumergida (The submerged city),2022-11-22,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Map, Satellite images, Environment","Animation, Scraping, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, ArcGIS","For the first time in Uruguay’s history, a team of scientists and journalists analyzed different databases on the flood line and its impact on the population and fundamental facilities on the Montevideo coastline.
The investigation found that the country's critical infrastructures, the most vulnerable neighborhoods and the wealthiest ones are at risk of being flooded if the effects of climate change are not curbed.
Amenaza Roboto's team developed a data analysis methodology that uncovered relevant information for citizens hidden in public documents of the Uruguayan State. 
This investigation inaugurated the data and climate journalism vertical of Amenaza Roboto.","This is the data and climate journalism project with the greatest social and media impact in the history of Uruguay. 

**I) Awards.** “The submerged city” won the Open Climate Data Contest organized by the Ministry of the Environment, Agesic, Open Data Charter and the Inter-American Development Bank. This investigation laid the groundwork for our next project which has already won the Pulitzer Center’s new reporting grant that focuses on climate change and its effects on workers and work.

**II) Presentation before authorities.** Our investigation was presented at Torre Ejecutiva, headquarters of the Executive Branch of Uruguay, where the offices of the Presidency of the Republic are located.

**III) Academia.** ""The submerged city"" was presented in the master 's degree in Journalism Innovation at the Miguel Hernández University (Spain). The results were also presented at ORT University (Uruguay), INPE (Instituto de Pesquisas Espaciais, Brazil), and at the ""18th International gvSIG Conference and the GeoLIBERO 2022 Conference"" of the Polytechnic University of Valencia (Spain). In 2023 we will present our investigation at three local universities: UDELAR, UTEC and UCU, and at CUNY, the City University of New York.

**IV) Media.** Radio shows, newspapers and the most relevant TV news show echoed the results of Amenaza Roboto’s investigation.

**V) Regional impact.** We have distributed the results of our research at a regional level in podcast format (According to Spotify’s Wrapped: our podcast has been in the top 15% of the most listened to in the world)

**VI) International impact.** The Reuters Institute and the World Federation of Science Journalists have shared our work on social media.

**VII) Open Data.** We’ve created a GitHub so colleagues, academics and authorities can check or source the open databases that we’ve used, and the open data that's a direct product of our research.","One of the objectives of the present investigation was to calculate the population exposed to flood hazard due to sea level rise in Montevideo. We used data downloaded from the National Environmental Observatory (Ministry of Environment of Uruguay), the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the Ministry of Social Development, Municipality of Montevideo, among others. Flood surfaces were extracted from the National Adaptation Plan to climate change and variability of coastal zones in Uruguay (2021) report. The investigation was conducted in four stages: (1) data acquisition, (2) development of an integrated database; (3) generation of thematic maps; (4) narrative.
 
In the first stage, data relating to population by age and genre, flooding surfaces under maximum climatic scenarios, infrastructure, and irregular settlements were aggregated. Infrastructure and demographic data were georeferenced by using ArcGIS software. Data acquired from the above sources were used to develop an integrated database (2). Gathered data were linked with population grids according to the territorial division system applied by INE. Information from the 2004 and 2011 census were intersected to reclassify boundaries of the population grid cells not available in the 2011 dataset. The results of the analyses conducted in the previous stages were visualized on thematic maps (3). Kernel density, raster reclassify, and raster calculator tools were used for this purpose. All the information was reclassified on the same scale by using geographic information system (GIS) software. Thematic maps represent the intersection of demographic and infrastructure dataset with the flooding surfaces calculated for 2100 from RCP 8.5 pathways for a 500-years return period. The maps generated were finally integrated with the interviews to scientists and representatives of governmental agencies and the review of the public information (4). The GIS project and full dataset were published in an open data repository (GitHub).","Although Uruguay has good international indicators of open government data, it is hard for citizens to access relevant and updated databases. In addition, if the data exists and is accessible (as it was in the case of our investigation), the necessary technical capacities to process it are not usually available. If we add to these difficulties, the approach to complex issues such as climate change, the mission becomes even harder. 

In the context of a climate and open data contest organized by Open Data Charter, The Inter-American Development Bank, the Ministry of Environment of Uruguay and AGESIC (Uruguay’s e-Government Agency), we assembled an interdisciplinary and multicultural team (with professionals from Uruguay, Argentina and Mexico), unusual by the standards of not only local but also Latin American media. Our media organization is staffed with journalists, geologists and data scientists that use cutting edge methods to collect and analyze evidence to show how climate change will affect different communities of Uruguayan.","Journalism exists to serve the public. In the Global South, small newsrooms have the chance to cover what big media outlets can’t. Through our work in Amenaza Roboto, other colleagues can learn to develop climate and data-driven research units. 

From our investigations, local, regional and internationals media outlets can learn:
I) How to build an MVP team.
II) How to integrate scientists from different backgrounds to the day-to-day journalism process. 
III) How to work ethically with open-data.
III) How to publish the underlying datasets that are used in investigations, as well as a detailed methodology describing the data, its provenance and the statistical techniques used in analysis.
IV) How academics, journalists, policymakers, and community organizers can better engage with the findings of the investigations.
V) How to serve as a tool to empower and promote behavioral changes in society based on the appropriation of a problem. In this context, the dissemination of the effects of Climate Change aimed to place the populations involved as relevant actors, integrating them along with technical knowledge into the sphere of political decision making.","Spanish, English",https://www.amenazaroboto.com/uruguay2100/montevideo,https://www.amenazaroboto.com/uruguay2100/montevideo/eng,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AIHtT5rLN4-gj1Ch2oYW5AD_ACeJAa-Y?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvfzbI0XkeKDxNYYV49XKSwEVRW1sNC2/view?usp=share_link,https://github.com/AmenazaRoboto/Uruguay2100,,,"Gabriel Farías

United States,Streetsblog,Small,Winner,"This investigation into dangerous accidents near New York City schools pulled in data from nearly one million car crashes over more than five years, logging every collision within 250 feet of a city-run public school. The findings not only revealed the dangerous journey to school each day by thousands of children, but also that the streets near schools serving poor students and students of color are seeing even more accidents. All of this despite millions spent by the city to make school streets safe. What’s stunning about the work here is the size of the outlet – Streetsblog – a small, nonprofit, with just one person on the byline. Yet Streetsblog leveraged the power of available public data and invested in a deep dive into understanding what was putting children in harm’s way and told a compelling story along the way.",Always Scared,2022-05-24,"Investigation, Long-form, Database","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, CSV, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Tableau","In this six month investigation into traffic violence around schools, Streetsblog built a spatial database of nearly one million car crashes in New York City, which revealed alarming rates of crashes and injuries outside city schools, especially those serving majority poor students and students of color. Through extensive reporting across the five boroughs, the story also showed how the city’s efforts to reduce the dangers posed by cars outside schools have been insufficient, leaving children vulnerable in places where they have no choice but to be.","Following the release of this story:
The city Department of Transportation announced plans to redesign streets outside schools in poor communities of color to make them safer.
The governor of New York cited the story's findings when signing a bill to expand a school-zone speed camera program in New York City.
The mayor of New York City and the city’s top transportation official said the city must do more to keep children safe from cars outside schools.
Local lawmakers expressed outrage about the story’s findings and called on the city to do more to protect children from cars outside schools.","This story is built on an analysis of more than a dozen datasets and other data sources published by New York City, most on its open data portal. Using PostgreSQL, PostGIS, QGIS, and Excel, Coburn merged these disparate data sources into a novel database that listed every car crash near a New York City public school since July 2015—excluding the first 15 months of the pandemic, when city students were largely learning remotely—as well as information on the enrollment and demographics of each school. This yielded startling insights into the dangers that children face navigating city streets on their way to and from school every day.

To begin, Coburn acquired and cleaned datasets on: car crashes in the city; the locations, enrollment and demographics of more than 1,000 city schools across six school years; and school calendars, which Coburn had to scrape from PDFs. He then wrote a 70-line Postgres query to join all this data into a single database. For every car crash in the city since July 2015, excluding the early pandemic period, the database indicates whether the crash occurred within 250 feet of a school, whether it occurred during student arrival and departure hours, and how many poor, non-white, and total students were enrolled in each school at the time.

The database required extensive cleaning before it could be analyzed. For example, Coburn had to manually reclassify crashes that occurred near schools but posed no threat to pedestrians or cyclists, such as those on grade-separated highways. Finalizing the data took weeks.

Once finished, this database led to previously unknown discoveries about the extent of traffic violence around schools, including that there are 57% more crashes and 25% more injuries per mile on school streets than other city streets at 8 a.m. on school days, and that injury rates from car crashes are 43% higher outside majority Black or brown schools than majority-white schools.

Coburn also created interactive maps for the story using Tableau.","New York City agencies were hostile to Streetsblog’s efforts to examine the threat that cars pose to children outside city-run schools. The city departments of transportation and education declined to make any officials available for interviews or to answer many questions for the story. The Department of Education even kicked Streetsblog out of a press conference instead of answering basic questions about the dangers children face walking to and from city schools (link: https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/09/29/department-of-education-kicks-streetsblog-out-of-media-event-instead-of-answering-question-on-school-street-safety/).

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,Winner,"Culture in the Crosshairs is a unique angle on a side of the Ukraine War that has not received as much attention as some other topics: the loss or damage to important cultural heritage sites. It’s a clear example of where data journalism can really add to our understanding of modern war and its impact, including documenting war crimes.

The team had no prior experience of using such large amounts of data — over a billion data points in some cases— and had to deepen their technical abilities in order to create this innovative piece of storytelling. The judging panel was very impressed that the team pushed themselves technically in order to provide an experience that is innovative and engaging for readers. The result is an extraordinarily compelling look inside the destruction of Ukrainian heritage sites, worthy of a Sigma award.
",Culture in the Crosshairs,2022-08-25,"Investigation, Long-form, OSINT, Satellite images, Culture, Human rights","3D modeling, Three.js, QGIS, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","We followed the efforts of volunteers and human rights workers to document the destruction of treasured Ukrainian buildings.

We took point cloud data captured on the ground in Ukraine using a LiDAR laser scanner and used it to construct a fly-through of the buildings.

Because of the size of the point clouds, we had to use innovative techniques that allowed the data to load in blocks that allowed the visualisations to work for audience members without fast internet connections or older mobile devices.

The resulting story gave readers a close-up look at the damage inflicted on Ukraine's historic buildings.","In our piece “Culture in the Crosshairs”, we followed the efforts of volunteers and human rights workers to document the destruction of treasured Ukrainian buildings.

We took point cloud data (gigabytes worth of material and billions of individual points) captured on the ground in Ukraine using a LiDAR laser scanner and drones, and painstakingly processed it down to a point where we could build a fly-through of the buildings using 3D javascript animation libraries.

The resulting piece provided our audience with a unique insight into the devastating toll of war and also the tactics employed by Russian forces accused of trying to eradicate Ukrainian cultural identity.

The piece also went beyond the data to look at the real world efforts of Ukrainians on the ground looking to hold Russian forces to account for alleged cultural war crimes. We spoke to lawyers and human rights workers compiling briefs of evidence on the alleged deliberate targeting of treasured Ukrainian cultural sites.

We also geolocated all of the sites listed on UNESCO’s compilation of damaged cultural monuments and buildings (there were about 170 in August, 2022), in order to map just how widespread this damage was across Ukraine. For several of the worst hit sites, we obtained satellite images and Google street view images to show them before and after the destruction.

The work inspired similar work on the same topic from other visual teams around the world.","For this project, we relied almost entirely on open-source software in the processing of the point cloud data, the 3D modelling and also for the front-end visualisations.

We used Cloud Compare(CC), both the GUI and command line interface (CLI), to drastically reduce the size of the point cloud data. The file size for each building capture was around 1.5 gigabytes or more than 1 billion points. Obviously, displaying data of that size would be nearly impossible in the browser, so we used Cloud Compare’s CLI to write a script that reduced the number of points in the files so that data points were no closer than a few centimetres to each other. In the original file, some points were as close as a few millimetres apart. 

We then converted the files to a more common point cloud filetype (LAS/LAZ) and brought that into CC’s software that allowed us to tidy up the noise in the model, remove any unnecessary areas that had been captured and also run an ambient occlusion filter over the model to enhance its colours and shading.

This whole process whittled the file size, for each building, down to about 20mb/1 million points rather than 1.5gb/ 1 billion plus points.

We then used the LAStools software suite to split the data into tiles so that we could load the file in chunks rather than forcing our audience to wait for the whole thing to load at one time.

This project was then brought into ThreeJS, where we modelled what the users would see as they scrolled through the piece.

We also used QGIS to map the sites on UNESCOs list of damaged cultural sites, as well as processing satellite images.

Adobe Illustrator and Blender were also used.","One of the biggest challenges we faced bringing this story to life was that none of us had done much work visualising point cloud data in the browser. We have little to no budget, so everything we created had to be in house and open source. We had experience creating and visualising 3D models, but in the past we had presented that data as image sequences or videos rendered from Blender or other 3D software. For this piece, we wanted to present the data in its purest format - the point cloud. This approach brought with it a whole series of challenges.

The first were the enormous file sizes, which we tackled using the approach I listed above. Then, we didn’t want our audience to have to wait for the whole file to load, so we came up with a way to split the data into tiles, so it could load in smaller sections at a time which meant people could see the models constructing themselves while they read through the story.

This meant the piece worked smoothly across all devices, mobile and desktop and through relatively poor internet connections as well.

The geolocation of damaged cultural sites was a significant undertaking as the location of sites wasn’t immediately obvious from the names supplied on the UNESCO list. For various reasons simply googling the name of the site to find the location was not always an option. We often had to trawl through social media, scour local news reports, check satellite imagery and cross check locations with sites listed on the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture’s own database.

We then used these sites and matched them up with satellite images and Google street view (a painstaking task in itself) to present before and after images for several of the worst hit sites across Ukraine.","Two of the big takeaways for other journalists for the piece are:

1. We did this using entirely open-source software and code libraries. So everything we did could be entirely recreated without any budget constraints, other than the time it took us to pull it all together.
2. The other is that, at the beginning of this project none of us were 3D experts. But we were able to get our heads around the various different programs available and pull everything together.

Norway,NRK,Big,Winner,"This entry turned an in-depth, technical investigation into how TikTok's algorithm shows or hides videos about the war against Ukraine, based on where people live, into a beautiful, organic, and captivating presentation. Despite going into it expecting the result (that young men in Russia do not see TikTok videos about the war), seeing the side-by-side comparison of what TikTok showed to different users based on geography was striking and emotionally resonate. ",Worlds Apart,2022-04-05,"Investigation, OSINT, Politics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Python, Selenium, Azure Computer Vision API, Elasticsearch, Kibana.","When Russia went to war against Ukraine and the media withdrew from the area, the dance app TikTok suddenly became an important channel for news from the war.
But did TikTok show the war to everyone? With the help of innovative and advanced programming, artificial intelligence, local proxies and a good dose of creativity, NRK was able to send TikTok robots to the war zone to document what the Chinese company showed young men in the neighboring cities of Belgorod (Russia) and Kharkiv (Ukraine).
Finally we could reveal that TikTok did not show the war to its Russian users.","The article has around 360,000 readers in Norway. It also went viral and was translated by various users all over the world. Therefore, we also made an English version to ensure that the translation was correct. This meant that we reached a new 85,000 readers and received, among other things, a recommendation in the New York Times newsletter.
The fact that the case received so much attention abroad also led to several people contacting us to learn more about how we worked or to offer cooperation. We have held a number of lectures for data journalists in Norway, Sweden and Germany. We have also shared our methods in an interview with the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN).
Since publication, TikTok has quietly started showing new videos from both Russian and international users – completely contrary to what has been the company's stance externally.","First of all, we used ""residential proxies"" to make the TikTok algorithms believe that our traffic came from the Russian border city of Belgorod and the Ukrainian border city of Kharkiv.
The next step was to build a TikTok bot with the Python programming language that could scroll through thousands of records and extract information. This was very challenging, since TikTok has strict monitoring of all activity, and kicks out users who engage in bot-like behavior.
It quickly became clear that the Ukrainian bot got to see videos from the war from the start, while the Russian one didn't see a single tank. We therefore tried to ""help"" the Russian bot to see more of the war.
TikTok's algorithm works in such a way that you train it to serve more of what you like. We therefore collected subject tags and keywords that were associated with the war. In addition, we used Microsoft's tool Azure Computer Vision, which is an artificial intelligence that can look at images and provide a description of what is in the image. We fed this AI words like guns, tanks, the military, soldiers, explosions and so on. Then we programmed the bot to look longer at videos that contained the topic tags and keywords we had collected or images that the AI recognized.
Yet the war never appeared in Russia. We then tried via our proxy in Russia to view the videos of acts of war that the Ukrainian bot had seen, but it was not possible. So we could state that TikTok does not show the war to its Russian users.","Ethical considerations

Use of videos from TikTok
We wanted to show readers a selection of the actual videos TikTok served to the Russian and Ukrainian user. Especially the very first videos the bots saw, because already there we saw a huge difference. We believe we can use the news right to show the videos, because it is very important to make people understand how the algorithms help to give people in Russia and Ukraine a different picture of the war. The videos were also publicly available to everyone. However, it has been important to carefully go through each video to be shown, and assess how much of, among other things, faces, text and recognizable features/clothing that we can show. For example, one of the first videos shows a child donning military gear. Here we have covered the face, and we have also done this in many of the other videos. We have gone carefully 9 through all vid

Fake users
We violate TikTok's guidelines when we create fake users and create software that automatically scrolls through TikTok. We did it anyway, because we believe it is important that someone checks and shows how the algorithms work. TikTok is also an important source of news for young people in particular – in our case young men who have to decide whether to participate in a war. It is critical for democracy and society that citizens understand how the algorithms determine what content you get in your feed.

Residential proxies
Residential proxies make it possible to ""trick"" a website or service into thinking you are somewhere else in the world than you really are. It is more difficult to see through residential proxies than, for example, VPN solutions, because the internet traffic goes through the IP address of a regular internet user. However, this also creates ethical challenges. An internet user can potentially share internet traffic with others without knowing it. It would have been very unfortunate if NRK contributed to something like this. Therefore, it was important for us to use one of the largest providers of such services, even if this also meant one of the most expensive.","How to tell a data story?
It is nice to have a lot of data, but in order for many people to take it in, you must also be able to communicate it in a good way. That's why we thought about the storytelling right from the start. The reason why we sent the bots to Belgorod and Kharkiv was that we had navigated the Russian-Ukrainian border in Google Maps to find war-affected cities in Ukraine that had a Russian city just over the border. This geographical proximity (only 8 miles between the towns) gave a stronger nerve than if we had covered the whole country. We also chose to let our own work process play an important role in the matter. That way the reader could join in and see how we built the bots, what kind of properties we gave them, how things changed when we changed the settings and how different videos the bots Alexei and Nykolai got.
It was also a point that the reader should feel that he or she was in the TikTok universe. That's why we chose a presentation template where you scroll down one card at a time - just like in the TikTok app.

United States,The New York Times,Big,Shortlist,,Extreme Heat Will Change Us,2022-11-18,"Long-form, Cross-border, Infographics, Chart, Video, Environment","Sensor, QGIS, Canvas, R, RStudio","Extreme temperatures will soon transform the lives of half the world. But those effects are still largely invisible. We traveled to two of the hottest cities in the world — Kuwait City and Basra, Iraq — to measure the toll that extreme heat already takes on people’s health, their cities and their lives. Through a rich combination of on-the-ground reporting, video and sensor journalism — including heat loggers, thermal imaging, temperature probes and heart rate monitors — we offer readers a unusually personal glimpse of what the future will look like.","The effects of extreme heat are largely invisible, even to those who experience them. Years of exposure to high temperatures can silently lead to kidney problems, heart problems and other health issues. This project went to extraordinary lengths to make the risks clear, showing the promise of combining sensor reporting with rich narrative journalism.

Teju Cole wrote that the piece is “impressive and helpful, particularly for the way it focuses attention on concrete examples: two cities (Basra and Kuwait City), and on two individuals.”

Michael Oppenheimer, a prominent climate researcher, wrote that the piece was a “shocking visual preview from places where the future is now.”

The impact may seem simple, but it is in fact difficult — making the danger of something you may know intellectually really hit home. To do this, the project used elements that are rarely combined: personal, narrative writing; sensor journalism; explanatory video; and data visualization. It was a measure of the project’s success that these elements felt seamless.

“Love the integration of video and temp data in the piece,” wrote Jeff Goodwell, an environmental journalist at Rolling Stone. “This is where journalism is headed.”","This story weaved together video and on-the-ground reporting, video and the novel use of sensor journalism to capture the hyperlocal conditions across each city.

We worked for months with heat researchers, doctors, climate scientists and other researchers to carefully design our reporting and measurement protocol and make sure our use of these measurements was scientifically appropriate.

We carried a data logger everywhere we went to capture the air temperature and humidity at each location we visited. These loggers captured measurements every 15 seconds and stored them in CSV files with timestamps. By combining these readings with the metadata of the video files, we could report the exact conditions our subjects were experiencing while we filmed them. 

To add to our understanding of the pernicious effects of heat, we used a combination of thermal imaging cameras and a temperature gun to capture the surface temperature of objects in our subject’s environment, such as scaldingly hot metal benches and a children’s swing that reached 180°F. 

Working closely with several experts who study heat exposure, we also estimated the effect that this extreme heat was having on our subject’s bodies. We fitted a welder with a heart rate monitor while to estimate how his core body temperature rose while he worked in direct sunlight as the feels-like temperature reached 125°F. By working with heat stress researchers, we estimated his core body temperature rose by 3°F, putting extreme stress on his heart. 

After demonstrating the danger of heat stress for people’s lives and bodies, we analyzed exclusive data from Harvard researchers to produce visualizations of what a typical year will look like in 12 global cities by 2100 under three different emissions scenarios. The data was analyzed using R and we produced the charts using ggplot2 and Adobe Illustrator.","Using sensors to collect all of these different datasets reliably is a challenge. It’s even harder when you need to rapidly move from one location to another as your subject goes about their day. We had to experiment with a number of different sensor setups to find the right technology, and, crucially, workflow that would work on the ground in Kuwait City and Basra. 

Due to the project’s focus on Basra, Iraq as one of the two locations, we also had to contend with strict export restrictions which prohibited the use of certain sensors, such as high resolution thermal imaging cameras. After weeks of research, we concluded that perfect thermal imaging product didn’t exist for this project, so one of our graphics editors sourced an appropriate thermal imaging sensor and soldered it onto a circuit board himself.","Sensor journalism offers data and visual journalists the opportunity to create their own datasets, rather than relying on datasets from governments or scientists. 

One of the main benefits to capturing your own data is that it allows your stories to have a much closer connection between the data visualizations and the on-the-ground reporting. Instead of showing city-level trends using available weather data, we were able to quantitatively show readers the conditions inside the home of the subjects we were reporting on and capturing video of. It allowed us to not just describe but visualize how the second-by-second temperatures in the room were dangerous for the people we were following.

Capturing your own data also allows you to find hyperlocal differences that aren’t visible in any existing datasets. We learned just how localized weather conditions can be. We are used to seeing weather conditions represent the temperature in a city as a single number, but we found that two streets just a mile apart could have significantly different temperature and humidity readings because of differences in air flow, nearby waterways and the different buildings on the street.

United Kingdom,Unearthed,Small,Shortlist,,Big oil's dirty secret in Iraq,2022-09-29,"Investigation, Long-form, Satellite images","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","Unearthed combed through data on Iraq’s oil industry to reveal how its emissions vastly exceeded those that Big Oil acknowledges. At the same time, BBC journalists worked on the ground to tell the story of how the lives and health of ordinary Iraqis have been affected by flaring.

BP claims to be reducing emissions from flaring. But analysis of BP’s figures and independent satellite data showed that BP’s official emissions figures do not include those from a vast field in Iraq. If it did count its Iraq field, Unearthed found that BPs flaring emissions would be doubled.","Oil companies activities are under more scrutiny than ever before, but the way firms report their emissions lacks transparency and gives a misleading view to the public and to investors. 

Our reporting raised awareness of oil companies hiding the true scale of their emissions from investors and the public by not counting emissions from assets they do not operate on a day-to-day level. We found that if BP included its share of flaring emissions from its field in Iraq, its overall flaring emissions would be doubled. 

The reporting - shown in an hour-long BBC News Arabic documentary called 'Under Poisoned Skies' (Producer Owen Pinnell and Director Jess Kelly) that featured Unearthed's reporting and our longread article - offered an unprecedented insight into the public health problems caused by rampant gas flaring. 

The story led Iraq’s environment minister to acknowledge, for the first time, that there is a link between the high number of cancer cases in southern Iraq and out-of-control gas flaring. This had previously been denied by the government. 

BP, in response to the story, promised to “work with partners on any necessary interventions”.

As a result of the reporting by Unearthed and BBC News Arabic, teams of lawyers are exploring litigation against BP over the public health damage of gas flaring in southern Iraq.","We had to adopt a variety of approaches to reveal the scale and impact of Big Oil’s operations in Iraq, and to measure how this compared to the companies’ publicly stated positions. 

Unearthed used open-source satellite imagery to map flare stacks and show that oil producers in Iraq were less than 10km from people’s homes, in breach of Iraqi law. 

We analysed company emissions data from BP and Italian firm Eni and identified gaps in both companies reporting by pairing this information with publicly available emissions tracking data, sourced from proprietary databases. This process enabled us to spot that BP and Eni were not counting emissions from flaring in Iraq in their annual emissions figures. 

Unearthed, together with scientists from the Greenpeace science unit, advised on on-the-ground pollution monitoring in southern Iraq, which, for the first time, gave an insight into the public health impact of rampant gas flaring on the people of southern Iraq.","The oil industry is not transparent in how it discloses its emissions, and working on a data-led story on this sector was a challenge. We had to painstakingly piece together emissions data from proprietary databases and then combine that with partial company emissions data disclosed in annual reports. 

Ensuring that the data was properly reported required detailed consultation with experts and industry insiders, in addition to those quoted in the piece. 

Added to that, through our work alongside BBC News Arabic we were working with teams of journalists based in Iraq, who had to deal with an array of security challenges both for themselves and for sources on the ground.","This is an example of how to combine rigorous data journalism with powerful on-the-ground reporting. 

It shows the real-world impact of fossil fuels and climate change, a topic that can often feel removed from people’s everyday lives. 

We hope journalists use this story as a jumping-off point to further interrogate Big Oil’s emissions figures and find other parts of the world where companies are making millions from fossil fuels, while not taking responsibility for the climate and public health damage stemming from their activities. 

We also hope the piece demonstrates the value of combining a huge range of innovative approaches - going beyond corporate disclosures and public data to include on-the-ground pollution monitoring, and satellite data - to provide a robust evidentiary baseline supporting powerful first-person testimony.",English,https://projects.unearthed.greenpeace.org/big-oil-iraq/,,,,,,,"Joe Sandler Clarke, Gurman Bhatia, Aidan Farrow, Owen Pinnell","**Joe Sandler Clarke**

USA Today Graphics created a visual overview, showing trends and summaries from this unique and collaborative project. The overview is evergreen, and updates are automated each time an incident is added to the database or an earlier incident is modified. The data pipelines and presentation are elegantly coded and built to be easily updated in perpetuity so that data on this important subject will be available for all to download, free of charge.","The USA TODAY/AP/Northeastern University mass killing database contains information on incidents, offenders, victims and weapons for all multiple homicides with four or more victims killed within a 24-hour time frame in the United States from 2006 to the present. The database is designed to exist in perpetuity, and we commit to updating it, so the findings will change. At current, we have learned the following: 

- There has been a spike in these types of killings over the past few years, but the rate of occurrence has remained relatively flat since the mid-2000s. 
 
- Public mass shootings are only part of the story. 
 
- Victims of mass killings are more likely to have been killed by someone they know. 
 
- Most mass killings are committed using handguns. 
 
- Most mass killers are men. 
 
- Mass killings aren't confined to big cities.

The database and visualization system has made possible dozens of subscriber-converting stories covering this important subject, and the main presenation has drawn over a quarter million visitors since launch who each spend two mintues on average with the page.

In addition to the primary presentation, a publicly accessible data download portal, and set of modular data visualizations that are updated daily with any new information have been provided free of charge. It has been covered in several publications, including Nieman Lab. The project has also been named “Best community service project/reporting” and runner-up for “Best use of data/infographics” by Editor and Publisher. It was also on the Data Visualization Society's Information Is Beautiful longlist. Deeper analysis of the database including visual stories, additional data visualizations and a breaking news response kit are planned for 2023.","The database is constructed and maintained using sound social science methodology, including a detailed codebook with explicit instructions on data collection protocols (this hyperlink is to a summary codebook, the full codebook is included at the end of this document.) In addition, determinations pertaining to certain subjective variables (e.g., underlying circumstances and motivation) involve judgements of multiple coders with any disagreements settled through consensus. Also, we avoid promoting data that depend on unreliable sources (e.g., reports by family and friends about mental health issues) that weaken other datasets.

The full database currently consists of four linked data tables with a total of 59 data fields (not counting indicators for the availability of offender/victim identity)—18 fields for each incident, 20 fields for each offender, 13 fields for each victim killed, and 8 fields for each weapon used. Most variables, with the notable exception of victim names, are available for public download. The remaining data are reserved for individuals affiliated with the Associated Press, USA TODAY/Gannett, and Northeastern University’s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, and others by permission of all three organizations. Moving forward, additional variables may be added to the full database as well as the public subset. 

The presenation is coded and designed in an elegant and resilant manner that should stand the test of time, and inevitable platform and technology shifts. Updates run automatically, the vizualiztions are responsive, and the project will be easy for some future graphics journalist to maintain and improve if they should discover it long after we are no longer working at USA TODAY.","This project is over a decade in the making and work on the most recent iteration of the database and presentation took longer than a year to complete. 
The effort started nearly a decade ago at USA TODAY when Paul Overberg, Meghan Hoyer, Mark Hannan, Jodi Upton, Barbie Hansen, and Erin Durkin contributed to an original 2012 data reporting effort. In 2016, primary data collection and verification efforts shifted from USA TODAY to Northeastern University. Northeastern researchers conducted extensive searches for incidents not reported in the SHR during the time period, utilizing internet search engines including Lexis-Nexis, Google News, and Newspapers.com. Northeastern University researchers also independently verified data collected by USA TODAY staff and filled in missing information, sometimes involving updated reports on older cases. 
 
In December 2018, a Memo of Understanding (MOU) was signed by The Associated Press, USA TODAY and Northeastern University to formalize a joint initiative to maintain and expand the mass killing database previously housed at USA TODAY. The Associated Press hosts the database and maintains the data entry tool; USA TODAY has developed and maintains the public website containing visualizations and interpretations of the data; and Northeastern University manages data collection and updates. At USA TODAY, the torch was passed from Jodi Upton and Meghan Hoyer to John Kelly, and subsequently Shawn Sullivan and Mitchell Thorson who remained committed to a complete overhaul of the project. It published in August 2022.

Researchers at USA TODAY first identified potential incidents using the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). Homicide incidents in the SHR were flagged as potential mass murder cases if four or more victims were reported on the same record, and the type of homicide was coded as “murder or non-negligent manslaughter.” Cases were subsequently verified utilizing media accounts, court documents, academic journal articles, books, and local law enforcement records obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. 
 
Each data point was corroborated by multiple sources, which were compiled into a single document to assess the quality of information. When sources were contradictory, official law enforcement or court records were used, when available, followed by the most recent media or academic source. Case information was subsequently compared with other available mass murder or mass shooting databases to ensure validity. Incidents listed in the SHR that could not be independently verified were excluded from the database (many SHR records, contrary to the protocol, include injured victims along with those who were killed, giving the false impression of a mass killing). 
 
Finally, as an important step in checking for completeness, cases in our database are compared side-by-side against other available datasets (e.g., the Gun Violence Archive, Everytown for Gun Safety, The Violence Project, Mother Jones), finding no qualifying cases in other databases that are missing from our database but many in our database that are missing in others.","In short, the value of taking your time to get something right, willingness to collaborate across organizations, and honoring commitments.

Given the surging interest in mass killings, including those incidents that involve a firearm, as well as the lack of an official, government database on such cases, several news organization, academic collectives, and advocacy groups have launched their own database projects. In terms of the breadth of cases and range of variables, the USA TODAY/AP/Northeastern University Mass Killing Database is the most comprehensive, including incidents with four or victims killed regardless of location, motivation, victim-offender relationship, or weapon since 2006. Unlike other databases on the topic, tallies of injuries are not conflated with data on victims who are killed. Similarly, data on assailants who are killed at the scene or take their own lives are not blended with those on victim fatalities. 
 
There are several other features that make our database unique and of significant value to journalists, social scientists, and policy makers alike: 
 
It is the only relational database linking incident, offender, victim, and weapon characteristics—spanning more than five dozen data fields. 
 
It is the only database that includes the 20 percent of mass killings that are committed with means other than guns, recognizing that these victims are just as dead as those who are fatally shot and often suffer especially painful deaths. 
 
It is the only database that follows a case through the criminal justice process and eventual sentencing. 
 
It is the only database that features an interactive, visual website that is updated daily with the ability for others easily to download incident, offender, victim, and weapon data files.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2022/08/18/mass-killings-database-us-events-since-2006/9705311002/,https://data.world/associatedpress/mass-killings-public,https://query.data.world/s/mrodwdqxrjtz6fakei5c2stdvpljld,https://www.niemanlab.org/2022/08/how-the-ap-usa-today-and-northeastern-built-a-database-of-mass-killings-that-tracks-more-than-shootings/,https://news.northeastern.edu/2022/11/22/eppy-awards-mass-killings-database/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/graphics/2022/11/23/chesapeake-walmart-shooting-mass-killings-database/10762179002/,,"Core team members from USA TODAY include: Mitchell Thorson, Karina Zaiets, George Petras, Veronica Bravo, and Shawn Sullivan.

The package, consisting of nine stories delving into the most troubling findings of our analysis, reveals how this nation’s legal system has failed transgender people at all stages, from police to prosecutors, and from judges to juries.","“Deaths in the Family” has contributed an unprecedented body of data about the killings of transgender and gender nonconforming people, filling a shameful gap in federal collection of crime data. The project exposed bias in the legal system, from law enforcement to prosecutors and judges. And it has prompted public conversations about how we as a nation report and track violence targeting transgender people.

The project has been embraced by scholars and advocates steeped in the issue of anti-trans violence. Orie Givens of the Anti-Violence Project said on Twitter, “This is an amazing and also gut-wrenching series of stories by the @thisisinsider team. We have so much work to do to help make the world safer so our transgender siblings live free from harm.” The ACLU’s Gillian Branstetter posted, “This is incredible, and I’m sure an enormous amount of work. I can’t thank you and your team enough.” And Leigh Goodmark, director of the Gender Violence Clinic at the University of Maryland School of Law posted, “Read the story, read the series. Trans women face violence at every turn — from partners, from society, and from police, prosecutors, and judges.” 
The project won the December Sidney Award from The Sidney Hillman Foundation, whose judges said the project was “the most comprehensive accounting of the transgender homicide crisis to date” and called Insider’s findings “shocking.” The reporting has been cited by The Marshall Project and the National Criminal Justice Association. 

Insider’s reporting has already spurred the newly elected Mobile County District Attorney in Alabama to commit to reopening one cold investigation, and pushed LA County prosecutors to file manslaughter charges in a case that had languished for a year after a suspect was identified.","We relied on sources including the Human Rights Campaign, Remembering Our Dead, the National Center for Trans Equality, and Out.com, as well as social media posts and searches of local news coverage through Google and Nexis to come up with a list of potential homicides. After submitting public records requests for all of these potential cases and reaching out to all the law enforcement agencies involved, we ultimately corroborated 175 transgender homicides over a 5-year period. We depended heavily on PACER, Westlaw, and dozens and dozens of county court websites in seeking out court records related to the cases where suspects were indicted. We used DocumentCloud to share some of our documents with the public.

We also hand-built a database from the documents we obtained from police, prosecutors, and courts, and supplemented by press reports and source interviews. The biggest difficulty with the data was making sure we were consistent during the hand coding process. We constructed a methodology for what our reporters needed to look out for while going through the documents we collected, and continued to iterate those categories as documents came in. For instance, we accounted for whether the case involved intimate partner violence, or if law enforcement was involved in the death; we tracked the demographics of each victim and suspect. Our team worked together to make sure we were as thorough and accurate as possible while building the database.

Based on that working document, we created a separate spreadsheet from which we pulled our data findings, with a glossary defining how to code each cell. Reporters then hand input the data into that new sheet, with dedicated cells for sourcing notes, and a team of fact-checkers verified our entries cell by cell.","Amid a spike in anti-trans legislation and hate speech, Insider's investigations team set out to explore anti-trans violence, gathering information on homicides targeting transgender and gender nonconforming, nonbinary, and two-spirit people from 2017 through 2021 across the United States and Puerto Rico.

Identifying each case was difficult, since the FBI does not track crimes by gender identity. Over the course of 13 months, a team of editors, reporters, and researchers attempted to fill in the gaps. We compiled a list of potential homicides of transgender and gender nonconforming people, then sent public record requests to police and prosecutors in every case, in addition to compiling court records. We ultimately documented 175 transgender homicide victims over a 5-year period — almost certainly an undercount. As we read through the documents and pulled preliminary findings, we began to map out our package, taking note of clusters of intimate partner killings, killings of sex workers, killings by law enforcement, and killings driven by transphobia. As we tracked the outcome of each case, we developed stories that would examine unsolved killings and prosecutorial failures.

In many instances, law enforcement officials refused to hand over their homicide investigation files. In several cases, records were released only after Insider threatened to sue the investigating agency for violating state public records laws. Our reporters supplemented these records with conversations with friends, family, witnesses, jurors, judges, attorneys, law enforcement officials, and advocates to determine what happened. 

The resulting reporting is the most comprehensive accounting of transgender homicides ever assembled. Insider’s findings are shocking: Between 2019 and 2021, as political attacks on the transgender community escalated, transgender homicides doubled. We found that most of the victims were Black women, while most of the killers were young men in their teens and 20s. We found a striking failure of accountability — only 16% of cases led to murder convictions, and only one killing over five years resulted in a hate-crimes conviction. Another 61 cases — mostly involving Black transgender victims — remain unsolved to this day. 

We found that nearly two-thirds of those killed were misgendered or misnamed by law enforcement in the records we reviewed. This not only showed disrespect to the dead, we found, but, Insider found, disrupted investigations and impacted outcomes in court.

We sent reporters across the country, who dug into cases from Alabama to Washington State, on law enforcement killings, hate crimes, intimate partner violence, the vulnerabilities of sex workers, unsolved cases, prosecutorial missteps, the troubled history of police and the transgender community, and the lethal attack on Club Q, stories that collectively expose the myriad ways that transgender people are at higher risk of violent crime, and face an uphill battle in receiving justice in the courts.","No news outlet has made a comprehensive effort to obtain primary documents to determine the demographics of victims and suspects in transgender homicides, the circumstances surrounding the killings, and the outcomes of the cases. Nor has any news outlet created a body of work deeply investigating more than a dozen of these homicides to expose in vivid detail how this nation’s legal system has failed transgender people.

There is also no federal agency that tracks homicides against transgender and gender nonconforming people, so we had to compile our 175 cases by hand, using disparate sources and incomplete and sometimes inaccurate press reports. 

We submitted public records requests to police and prosecutors in every case, but were frequently stymied by uncooperative agencies. We spent months cajoling custodians and clerks, visiting courthouses around the country in person, and handing over thousands of dollars to secure documents. In several cases, records were released only after Insider’s attorneys threatened to sue the investigating agency for violating state public records laws. We are still pursuing legal action to obtain several key records, post-publication. When our record requests were unsuccessful, we worked with family members who submitted those requests on our behalf as next of kin, or sought out prosecutors and law enforcement officials who might share documents with us directly.

As with most trauma-related reporting, we knew we had to take special care with our human sources, many of whom were still grieving their loved ones. The team completed trainings on trauma-informed reporting, and spent many months working with sources to make sure they understood the scope of the project and the questions we wanted to answer before asking them to sit down for interviews.",English,https://www.insider.com/transgender-violence-deaths-database-murder-cases-2017-2021,https://www.insider.com/transgender-hate-crimes-homicides-transphobia-insider-investigation-2022-11,https://www.insider.com/police-deaths-transgender-people-officer-killings-mental-health-crisis-2022-11,https://www.insider.com/transgender-sex-work-discrimination-violence-2022-12,https://www.insider.com/police-failed-to-solve-a-third-of-killings-targeting-transgender-people-2022-12,https://www.insider.com/killings-of-transgender-people-transphobia-in-the-criminal-justice-system-2022-12,,"Project Members:

Nigeria,West Africa Weekly,Small,Shortlist,,"Suicide, Fraud and Phillips Consulting: The Story Of West Africa's Chinese Loan Shark Mafia",2022-05-30,"Investigation, Long-form, OSINT, Crime","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","In the light of the growth of illegal app-based loan sharking operations in Nigeria and West Africa, this story investigated the origins of these loan sharks and for the first time ever, revealed the personal and corporate identities of the key people and organisations involved in data theft, harassment, blackmail and financial fraud inherent in these operations.

Specifically, Soko Lending Company - a Chinese parent entity of several such loan app brands - was identified and tied to a physical location, as was Phillips Outsourcing, an otherwise respectable corporate consulting firm which was revealed to be an active collaborator.","Following my story which was published on May 30, Nigeria's National Data Protection Bureau (NDPB) announced on August 15 that it was carrying out an investigation into the activities of Phillips Outsourcing and an unnamed Nigerian Bank suspected of aiding online loan sharks.

Shortly after my story was published, Soko Lending Company was forced to abandon its newly acquired office space and go dark in the light of intense public scrutiny. It also scrubbed all its presence off social media, deactivating its Twitter and Facebook accounts. 

In the week after the story was published, Ken who was mentioned at the outset, suddenly woke up to find his loan balance with Sokoloan mysteriously cleared, following months of harassment and defamation which had persisted up until that point.","In verifying the information provided by the whistleblowers, I made extensive use of the semi-public Nigerian Inter Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) database, which contains the Bank Verification Number (BVN) details of all corporate and individual Nigerian bank customers.

By design or by accident, it is the case that when making an account to account transfer in Nigeria, one is able to pull up the name on an account by entering the account number into the bank app. This meant that using this functionality, which pulls data from the central NIBSS database, it was possible to independently verify the account details provided by the whistleblowers and thus produce solid evidence of a financial relationship between the illegal loan shark and Phillips Outsourcing.

This use of technology also provided empirical evidence that despite it being clearly against the law and regardless of prior denials by the banks involved, illegal online loan sharks also had access to formal banking services in Nigeria.

I also made extensive use of photo editing software to manually redact the sensitive financial information contained in the data samples and screen captures that I published, which were taken from the loan shark's leaked internal customer data dump. This way, I was able to prove that Soko Lending Company was guilty of severe data privacy and data protection violations without exposing the affected customers to increased risk.","The major constraint that made this story so challenging to work on was the sheer amount of time involved in cultivating sources and whistleblowers. I began working on this story back in July 2021, and it was not until April 2022 that I finally got my biggest breakthrough with a whistleblower. https://twitter.com/DavidHundeyin/status/1420316734913974272?t=20I_7uQKhj0X2_dHGgoQqQ&s=19

The reason for the long delay was the trust gap that exists between the Nigerian media and Nigerian audiences, who believe Nigerian journalists to be corrupt, compromised or mediocre. Only after sufficiently differentiating myself from the perceived mainstream with my work over the intervening 8 months did the most important whistleblowers begin to trust me enough to reach out with the key information.","The major takeaway for other journalists working under similar circumstances is to do away with the expectation that investigative projects will necessarily produce the type and scope of results they generally expect. For example I certainly did not expect a respected mainstream corporate consultancy brand like Phillips Outsourcing to show up anywhere in this story, much less end up at the very centre of it, resulting in an unprecedented federal investigation, but that is exactly what happened.

After a few months of research and hunting for information, it might have been easier to accept defeat and turn in a significantly less impactful story centred on the human angle side of things. The problem is that such a story - focusing on the impact of the illegal actions of loan sharks on their victims - had already been done multiple times before, and would have resulted in little more than empty sympathy. Keeping the hook in the water until something that significantly progressed or elevated the conversation came up turned out to be the correct decision.",English,https://westafricaweekly.substack.com/p/suicide-fraud-and-phillips-consulting,https://pmnewsnigeria.com/2022/08/15/phillips-consulting-bank-under-probe-over-violation-of-data-regulations/,https://twitter.com/davidhundeyin/status/1531189793908047874,https://twitter.com/DavidHundeyin/status/1420316734913974272?t=20I_7uQKhj0X2_dHGgoQqQ&s=19,,,,David Hundeyin,"David is a writer, investigative journalist and broadcaster whose work has appeared on CNN, The Africa Report, Al Jazeera and The Washington Post.

United States,USA TODAY,Big,Shortlist,,Broken Adoptions,2022-05-19,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Infographics","Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, R, RStudio","Broken Adoptions revealed how and why adoptions fail, creating anguish for everyone involved. It tapped a massive federal database of foster children to quantify the problem and identify, using statistical regression, key risk factors for failure. The project highlighted how states have been allowed to supply bad data that undermines any effort to judge the efficacy of $3 billion a year in federal adoption subsidies.","This project exposed breakdowns at every point in the adoption process. Many parents wait years for children who never arrive thanks to failures by adoption agencies. Social workers and agencies lie about children’s backgrounds to move their adoptions along faster. And, when something goes wrong, a common pattern emerges: Parents, prospective parents and the children often find themselves without support or recourse.

The project produced the first (and highly conservative) estimate of failed adoptions in America. It also identified major shortcomings in the collection of data on children returned to foster care from failed adoptions, pointing the way toward potential reforms. 

There was an overwhelming response from readers. The series was one of the top subscription-drivers for USA TODAY all year, and subscriber pageviews also ranked highly. Each installment of Broken Adoptions was followed by an outpouring of appreciation, from social workers and policymakers, parents and adoptees around the country. Some became sources for the ongoing work. Others just wanted to thank the reporters for uncovering such a hidden tragedy and making them feel seen.

The series also set the stage for data reporters at other organizations to plumb the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis Reporting System for accountability stories no one has yet told. AFCARS can tell how long a child remains in foster care, how many are diverted for years to group homes state-by-state, and how these outcomes vary by race, ethnicity, gender and age of the child.","We learned early on that no one had quantified how many U.S. adoptions fail. Building on work of previous USA TODAY reporters, Aleszu Bajak scoured the obscure Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, or AFCARS. The multi-million-record database shows the status of each child in foster care each year, including whether a child was previously adopted. Although unique identifiers are meant to link records across years, Bajak found states inconsistent about flagging a kid’s past adoption and preserving IDs. Any responsible estimate required painstakingly weeding out nonsensical cases, such as those that went from “Adopted” to “Never adopted” in one year.

Tallying up 66,000 failed adoptions was only the start, however. Bajak wanted to know why they failed. The breakthrough came when he unearthed a study finding 16 states with reliable IDs in AFCARS over time. Suddenly, we could track trips from foster care to adoption and back with confidence. Bajak decided to see what happened to a cohort adopted from 2008 to 2010. Using Cox proportional hazards regression, Bajak found statistically significant, independent risk factors predicting failure. The results might help child welfare workers know which kids need the most support at the time of adoption placement. Yet no one had done this analysis to tell them.

The reporting begged one last question. Why did states so frequently delete child identifiers from AFCARS, seemingly breaking from guidance laid down for this federally funded database? It was one of those irritating data flaws that, in this case, had newsworthy consequences. Bajak tracked down the bureaucrat who designed AFCARS three decades ago, and she had a lot to say. Through this and other historical research, Bajak showed how a deliberately obfuscated dataset undermines our ability to see whether billions in adoption subsidies are working.","The federal data underlying this series included records of 3.4 million children who spent time in foster care from 2008 to 2020, culled from the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System. It was complex and dirty, requiring months of effort to wrangle down. 

The database was enormous, requiring us to first pare down pieces we needed using Google Big Query. Although extensive guidance exists for states to follow when submitting data, our quality checks (and numerous federal audits) showed their submissions often go awry. All children entering foster care are supposed to be flagged if they’ve been through a prior adoption, but reporters detected many erroneous flags and had to painstakingly weed them out. Washington officials acknowledged and promised to fix a major flaw in their reporting system that we brought to their attention.

Using and describing the results of a Cox proportional hazards regression was also an enormous challenge. Aleszu Bajak learned from his research that this method was appropriate for our longitudinal dataset, but he wanted to be confident he did it right. For this, he consulted closely and repeatdly with an array of statisticians who understand the technique. 

To present the data in an accessible way, we worked with USA TODAY's Storytelling Studio to create ""scrollytelling"" animations that wove together dataviz and illustrations in narrative form. These scrollies were built using Adobe Illustrator, After Effects and Svelte.

In story form, the reporters breathed life into their data and findings by telling deeply personal narratives of adoptive parents and adoptees themselves. Those stories came through extensive efforts to seek out those affected, including creating an online questionnaire for adoptees, adoptive parents and officials and mailing postcards to thousands of adoption center clients with a Q/R code thatlinked to a survey. 

Building trust took time and determination as did unearthing records to bolster – or sometimes debunk – shaky memories of childhood and trauma.

One article recounted the tragedy of a family adopting out of foster care who could not get government approval for the mental health care their daughter needed. Before her adoption became final, 11-year-old Becca took her own life.

Another looked back at a California-based adoption agency that went bankrupt, leaving hundreds of families in the lurch. The investigation found the Independent Adoption Center’s leadership knew what was coming but continued to enroll new clients up to the week it closed itsdoors. California state officials knew, too, but their investigation went nowhere.

The final installment traveled home to Africa with Charles, whose American adoptive mother discovered she had been misled: His biological mother had not agreed to give him up and hewas four years older than his records indicated. The State Department and the adoption agency offered no help.

Because reliable resources are hard for adoptive parents to come by, USA TODAY published links to nonprofit advocacy groups that specialize in this field as well as testimonials from adult adoptees who have drawn lessons from their own broken adoptions to help others fare better.","Understanding the shortcomings of your data is essential. Get to know the people who built a database, the user manuals for people who submit data to it, the academic experts who use it for research and the process that its owners use to test it for errors. We made all of these contacts, and it ensured we were on solid ground.

Since February 24, 2022, there has not been a single day in our country when the Russians did not bombard Ukrainian territory with rocket, air, or artillery strikes. On the map, you can sort the shellings by type and by dates or specific time periods. In some cases, we provide satellite images, right by clicking a rectangle on the map. The dataset is our own, gathered since February 24 from news in media.","Missile, aviation, artillery. Since February 24, Ukraine has not had a single calm day - Russians are come with various types of shelling of Ukrainian territory every day. How many of them, these different types of shelling, and how were they distributed over the territory of Ukraine during this time?

To find out, we created a data journalism project with an interactive map. The map shows the shelling by date and area, and satellite images y click.

This project gives a general overview and does not aim to show absolute accuracy since some instances of shelling were not mentioned in the news we processed. Our database was created on February 24, 2022 and constantly updating.","The project is based on the information about Russian shelling in Ukraine shared in the news. In the first days, there were several sources of information such as the leading news sites, including the local media. However, the information in there was always duplicated, so in a few weeks’ time, we decided to continue monitoring only www.pravda.com.ua/news. Some data also came from verified eyewitness reports (i.e. friends and relatives). 

As for the data extracted from the news items, the algorithm was as follows: we listed the names of all settlements that were shelled. We then checked them all against the corresponding date on the fire map. If we saw a fire that day, we indicated its coordinates in the table and marked the entry as accurate. In most instances, fires recorded on NASA satellite maps corresponded with the locations of shelling.

All the strikes are divided into three groups: rocket strikes (along with the air launches), air strikes (projectiles and bombs dropped from aircraft, helicopters and drones), as well as artillery (either barrel or rocket), mortar and tank strikes.

As a source for satelite images we used Planet.com which kindly provided us access to their database.","We aware that there are other maps on the web, shows shelling of Ukrainian territory, but as far as we know any of them is considered as official. Our work to gather data started on Febuary 24 and still continues. Based on this dataset we also developed other projects, as well are open to share the dataset with researches.","We started collecting data for this map on 24 February when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At that time, we focused on comparing the cities that have been mentioned in the news after being hit by the Russian missiles with the map of fires to determine the locations and the extent of the damage.

It renewed calls for greater transparency and accountability of Australia’s federal political donations laws and gave impetus to the introduction of two separate bills for political donations reform at the federal level.""","""At the heart of the project is our gambling payments database, which brings together, for the first time, the political donations registers for every state and territory. 

Our “master dataset” combined and then expanded on datasets used in previous research. We uncovered dozens of new gambling entities by undertaking forensic examination of company records, annual reports, media archives, financial statements, etc. and consulting extensively with researchers, gambling reform groups, and other experts. 

Many of these individuals and organisations had been excluded from previous analyses because they own or operate other business or political interests alongside gambling ventures.

From here, we built our database by: 

1.Matching our gambling client list with 22 years of data and metadata scraped from the AEC Transparency Register. 
2.Combing through hundreds of PDF scans of original disclosure forms on the AEC website, manually collecting additional payment details missed or excluded from the online database. 
3.Matching the master list with records extracted from each of the seven state and territory political donations registers, some of which had to be collated by hand from PDFs.

Various statistics analyzed in this way were implemented with graphs and fact check system. Based on these results, interactive news was visualized using HTML, css, and javascript. We collaborated with illustration designers to create a separate web page where readers can record their experiences, and to break the conventional notion of ""why women who have experienced domestic violence can't escape from the perpetrators of violence,"" we expressed the seriousness of the problem online.
The SNS response on the web page (https://stop-femicide.hani.co.kr), which allows victims of domestic violence to experience the possibility of a ""safe breakup"" with the perpetrator, was also very hot. Tens of thousands of cases were shared on Twitter, and messages of sympathy poured out to the victims, regardless of gender.
On the special web page (http://speakup.hani.co.kr), titled ""Let me hear your surviving voice,"" hundreds of ordinary citizens wrote about their experiences with gender violence and femicide.
If you search on Facebook or Twitter with keywords such as 'femicide' and 'murdered women', you can easily find articles related to 'Hankyoreh 21's Femicide reports or web pages.","There are no statistics on women being killed in close relationships in Korea. Femicide is also a relatively underdeveloped topic in domestic academia. Even the police and the prosecution, which are investigative agencies, have been recording statistics on cases in old-fashioned way, so they have not even been able to figure out in what context women are killed by and how many women are killed by thier boyfriend, spouse or husband.
This is why we manually searched and found the ruling in the court library for more than a month. 
In order to ensure that our records do not end up with flat data trapped in the 'judgment sentence', we met with those who lost their mothers or daughters to femicide crimes, and listened to women who survived from their own threats to death. 
From January 2016 to November 2021, media reports (including news agencies) combined words such as ""lover, girlfriend, woman, dating, wife, couple, murder, suicide, extreme choice, abandonment, police"" to find 73 cases in which a man killed a woman and killed himself. 
And also we consulted with domestic and foreign experts, activists, and investigative agency officials who were thinking about how to prevent violence against women, and received professional manuscripts for articles.","When the murder of a woman was dealt with in Korea, it was often provocative and sensational like yellow journalism. A woman's tragedy was also used only as a tool to increase the number of views. When looking at the forest without just looking at the trees, I think we can find the structural causes of repeated killings of women and come up with various measures to decrease this kind of murder. We hope that there will be a lot of this type of article about crimes against minorities.
Also, I think it is meaningful to use various devices to capture the voices of women directly who have experienced gender-based violence as much as possible. I think it's an example of how an article can interact with society.
The report complied with the Code of Media Ethics. While revealing the horrors of crime in the reporting process, we thought deeply about journalistic ethics on how not to end up with sensational criminal reporting. I think we have also achieved results in proving the truth with data and urging attention through storytelling, toward a society that ignores the clear reality of violence against women, distorts, and encourages debate. In that sense, we are confident that we have created a norm for crime reporting that is useful at any time beyond the theme of Femicide.",Korean,https://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/COLUMN/2757/,http://stop-femicide.hani.co.kr/,https://speakup.hani.co.kr/,,,,,"Park, DaHae (doall@hani.co.kr)

The story reveals how the complex ownership of companies that are partly state-owned involve US investment funds, that at the same time have shares in their rival US military companies. It’s a fully data-driven project about one of the most important topics at the moment – defence. Data has been leading us and we were following the money and looking into ownership of dozens of companies involved.","One of the strengths of this investigation is the fact it was at the same time a cross-border story and individual, it is not possible to divide it in pieces, not by country, neither by players. It is a puzzle that makes sense only when all the pieces are together and only then reveals for the first time how EU money for military development has been spent and how those companies are co-owned by EU governments and US investment funds that are at the same time shareholders of their rival US arms companies. 
This story offered to the citizens true about how their money is being spent for so called military development. The supposed anti-corruption mechanism weren’t really applied and digging deeper into projects has shown how fair competence wasn’t assured and “the European military industry is like a Russian doll” where companies own companies that own companies.
The story was originally published by the European media outlet Investigate Europe and its partners infoLibre in Spain and Publico in Portugal. Besides that, story was republished in various media outlets in different countries, such as in Poland (https://frontstory.pl/wojsko-unia-europejska-ue-arma-nato-rosja/), Hungary (https://telex.hu/komplex/2022/03/29/nobel-bekedijtol-a-fegyverexportig-az-eu-militarizacioja), Italy (https://valori.it/industria-militare-europea-fondi-usa/).","OSINT – this is how we started, by researching all available information about the topic we were looking into and identified where the data we need lays. And it was not just for the data, using OSINT technique led us to a lot of findings and information that we needed to build the story, to put the data in context, to identify all the problematic dots in the big EU defence development projects.

Scraping with RStudio – once the data has been identified, some of it was suitable for scraping, so we collected one part of the data by scraping it with R programming language.

Collecting data from all possible sources – for the data that we didn’t feel secure to scrape, to avoid any possible mistakes, we were collecting it manually. We were building excel databases from carefully collected data from the reliable sources on the web. 

Data analysis in RStudio which has led to conclusions that actually made the story – by using the R programming language, we were able to clean data, to analyse it and to make draft visualizations to see what it actually shows.

We used Flourish for data visualizations in our story, choosing carefully the best ways to present different kinds of data – the graphs were talking themselves, but we needed explanations and comments from the experts from the field.

Interviewing experts – we were looking for different kinds of experts to analyse and comment on our findings, including experts for competition, for complex ownership structures, for finances and the ones that should be taking care actually of the whole thing described.","In the sense of political context, just a month before this story was published, Russia attacked Ukraine and the war in Europe has started. Military issue has become topic more important than ever. And still, so many holes haven’t been reported. Instead of reporting only on single deals or exports, we wanted to catch the full scope, to measure this arms business in its full size and to clearly identify who has been profiting from money intended for military development of Europe. Identifying the concrete players, companies that won the biggest share of the fund allocated, actually led to discovering the whole network that has been profiting by securing most of the money for these military development projects in the EU. 

And data was there. It was all around, on the EU websites, on companies websites, on websites with market data. The crucial was to pull all that data and to analyse it piece by piece. And once we have put all those pieces together, we got the puzzle that revealed the network of the biggest players in arms market. 

Innovative technologies that we applied while working on this story were scraping data at the very beginning, and present it in the modern way using the most suitable data visualization form that Flourish has developed for so many different ways to present the data in the best possible shape.","First thing – power of data is unimaginable in any area that can cross your mind.

Secondly -- keep digging as far as possible.

Third but crucial part – when team is good, teamwork is priceless. Combining different skills of three journalists was really powerful and inspirative because at every stage, one of us could see a step forward and that’s why we came to the story much deeper and way further than we planned at the beginning and than we actually expected. 

Questioning each other in different stages was empowering the story itself, by brainstorming and factchecking during the work process. Although we are all journalists with financial expertise, all of us came with some kind of different skills, and combining data skills, financial skills, identifying right things and finding reputable professional people to interview, it all lead to this story which we have built from the root and by going further every time showed us the real story that had to be revealed and told.","English, Spanish, Portuguese",https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/money-for-eu-defence-development-went-to-a-small-group-of-arms-producers/,https://www.infolibre.es/politica/pequeno-grupo-empresas-beneficia-mayor-parte-dinero-ue-destina-defensa_1_1223737.html,https://www.publico.pt/2022/03/27/mundo/noticia/militar-ue-medese-euros-tropas-2000085,,,,,"Ana Curic, Paulo Pena and Manuel Rico","Ana Curic is an investigative and data journalist based in Belgrade, Serbia.

His name has never appeared on any document and officials deny he owns anything.

But our investigation found a network of companies, holding assets worth $4.5+ billion, which appears to benefit Putin. These 86 companies, identified by reporters through their email domain, llcinvest.ru, hold all the major assets ever ascribed to him.

Many of these assets were supplied to the system by wealthy businessmen/the president’s friends, suggesting massive conflicts of interest. And it shows how, while not formally “owning” anything, Putin and his inner circle benefit through this informal arrangement.","The project was published in over a dozen media outlets (see above) and reached a wide international audience in many languages, including Russian.

In the country, where political and press freedoms are suppressed, we rarely see any real results of journalistic investigations. In an interview, a spokesperson for Putin referred to our investigation as “stryapnya” (meaning something not tasty that you cook. This word is used to describe unfair reporting). However, no factual comments were ever made to explain the existence of LLCInvest group and Putin’s involvement in it.","Reporters obtained several leaked email archives and used them as a starting point to map out the network of LLCInvest companies holding Putin’s assets. We found that the llcinvest.com domain is hosted by an IT company called Moskomsvyaz that is linked to Bank Rossiya. Moskomsvyaz appears to be a kind of in-house provider of technology services for the Bank Rossiya universe. On examining the full range of IP addresses that includes LLCInvest.ru, reporters found dozens of other email domains representing other companies, which encompassed assets linked to Putin. 

Moscomsvyaz's IP range gave us the initial list of companies, some were familiar to us. Our hypothesis: all of them are parts of one group. We checked if directors and shareholders of these companies are using LLCInvest emails, we noticed that all LLCInvest addresses have the same pattern: the first letter of the name and the surname of the user. We used a web resource to check if an email exists and found dozens of existing addresses: Hunter.io, Email checker 

That gave us about 40 companies and we researched all available data about them, their subsidies, directors and shareholders. 

We used numerous official and commercial corporate databases:

National Tax Service, biggest commercial database Spark, https://companies.rbc.ru/, https://vbankcenter.ru/contragent) 


Final list of LLCIncest companies consisted of 100+ companies. We used many databases to find their purpose and assets, including

Official Land Registry
Official Russian registry of boats 
Ship Tracking and Plane tracking resources
Custom Records

Odnoklassniki 

OCCRP’s entity extraction and database tool, Aleph, was invaluable; we uploaded thousands of leaked emails and made them searchable. Aleph helped us cross-check these emails with other available datasets, such as custom, corporate, and land records. We used Google’s spreadsheet functionality to build a database of all companies making up the LLCInvest system.","This story is based on hundreds of corporate records and thousands of leaked emails. It was a complicated analysis of big data in an effort to establish the wealth of the president of Russia. It was hard to nail the story and to present all the facts in a way that a reader who is not familiar with complex corporate structures would understand. 

While working on a story one of the main reporters, Olesya Shmagun, was designated by the Russian authorities as a foreign agent, an label that many vocal critics of Putin received in the last two years. This makes it much more difficult to conduct journalistic work in Russia.

Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine started when reporting was finished and the piece was being edited. Very shortly after the invasion, the website of our Russian partner, Meduza, was blocked in Russia and OCCRP was proclaimed an undesirable organization. That made any cooperation with OCCRP illegal for any Russian citizen, including reporters, editors and even experts who provided comments for the story. 

Russian partner Meduza published the story even though open association with OCCRP put them at risk of criminal prosecution.","The biggest lesson is the amount of meticulous organization required. Such a project has so many different leaks, moving parts, and bits of information that it requires a systematic way of collecting and analyzing that information, otherwise it would be impossible to extract anything useful.

It’s also very important for investigative reporters to have an ongoing dialogue with their editors about how to interpret the data, how to shape the narrative, and how to make sure they’re extracting what would make the best story. This needs to be done throughout the reporting process, not just afterwards.

The complexity of this story required very careful storytelling to make sure the subject matter — and especially the exact level of proof obtained by reporters — is communicated to readers. We rewrote the story what seems like a dozen times until we were satisfied that we were conveying exactly what we found in a way that our readers can understand and learn from.

It is also important to be clear about which elements of the story are not fully understood. There is a lot of value in being clear and up-front, communicating what is known and what is not, rather than trying to cover it up. This ensures that other journalists will have opportunities to add to the story, and also that we are transparent about what we can prove and what we cannot.","Meduza (Russia, in Russian), Le Monde (France, in French), Der Spiegel (Germany, in German), Profil (Austria, in German), Investigace.cz (Czech Republic, in Czech), Siena.lt (Lithuania, in Lithuanian), Eesti Ekspress (Estonia, in Estonian), The Guardian (U.K., in English), Information.dk (Denmark, in Danish), FTM (The Netherlands, in Dutch), Infolibre (Spain, in Spanish), Tijd (Belgium, in Flemish), Tamedia (Switzerland, in German), Tamedia (Switzerland, in French), Dagbladet Information (Denmark, in Danish), NDR/WDR (Germany, in German), IRPI (Italy, in Italian), YLE (Finland, in Finnish) and Inside Story (Greece, in Greek)",https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/mysterious-group-of-companies-tied-to-bank-rossiya-unites-billions-of-dollars-in-assets-connected-to-vladimir-putin,https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/we-cannot-use-it-leaked-emails-show-how-russian-petrochemical-giant-sibur-paid-for-villa-linked-to-putin,https://www.occrp.org/en/asset-tracker/putins-dacha-on-lake-ladoga-is-growing-under-supervision-of-non-profit-linked-to-llcinvest,,,,,"Olesya Shmagun (OCCRP), Denis Dmitriev (Meduza), Miranda Patrucic (OCCRP), Ilya Lozovsky (OCCRP)","Olesya Shmagun has worked with OCCRP for the last seven years.

The investigation found that European vessels have exported more than half of all fossil fuel shipments from Russia since the start of the war. 

The project started as a data monitoring mechanism into how Greek shipping dominates seaborne transports from Russia. With the collaboration of Investigate Europe, it evolved into a cross-border investigation which revealed how this network of European ships continued to help provide profits to Moscow.","The investigation series resonated across borders. It revealed how European ships - and their high-profile owners - helped to fuel Moscow’s war machine by exporting fossil fuels after the invasion of Ukraine.

Combining in-depth data analysis, investigative reporting, unique visualizations, multimedia elements and traditional storytelling, the 9-months long investigation is presented in a diverse and creative way across several platforms.

Beyond Greece, the main findings were also published with nine media partners in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Russia and in 10 languages, offering not only a European perspective but also unique national narratives.

In Greece, the investigation prompted fiery parliamentary debates. It was used by a famous stand-up comedian in several of his gigs. It stands at the core of a big SLAPP lawsuit filed by one of the most active shipowners in the Russian fossil fuel transport against a member of the parliament.

The series attracted the interest of international media companies such as Japan’s Nikkei and Germany’s DW that traveled to Greece to follow up on the Greek reporters’ leads. [DW made a video report for its “Focus On Europe” programme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6RuDhWaWso) filming Greek reporters while they investigated in the waters south of Greece.

Other colleagues were inspired by our investigation. The head of investigations at a hub of African journalists reached out to us to ask for a potential collaboration in the expansion of the project to Africa. A Moroccan freelance journalist contacted us to request research support and our dataset.

After publication by our media partner in Portugal, Publico, Portugal’s Prime Minister was confronted with the findings by an opposition politician during a parliamentary session.

The series has also been highlighted and shared by notable organisations including the [Global Investigative Journalism Network](https://mailchi.mp/gijn/newsletter-oct12-2022) and Global Witness.","The starting point for our investigation was the [Russian Tanker Tracker](https://twitter.com/RUTankerTracker): A Twitter bot of oil and gas tankers leaving Russian ports, automated by Greenpeace. The bot retrieves and publishes shipping data (such as a ship's position, movement, name, IMO number and other unique identifiers) in real time from the online ship tracking service [Marine Traffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/).

To download Greenpeace’s bot Twitter feed we used the online tool vicinitas.io. To retrieve details about the performance of each vessel and its managing companies, we scrapped [Equasis](https://www.equasis.org/). We did that by feeding the unique IMO number of each ship (extracted from Marine Traffic) to the search box of Equasis using selenium. 

With more reporters from different countries joining the team, with new editorial challenges and on-the-ground developments, and with our drive towards enriching and diversifying our sources, we needed to review and rebuild our methodology to meet the new circumstances that greet our investigation's long-term objectives. That’s why we decided to merge our data with data acquired data through [CREA’s API](https://energyandcleanair.org/). A valuable addition that came with this hybrid methodology was entries regarding coal transportations by bulk carrier and general cargo ships, previously not available in our analysis.

After collecting all the data, four different datasets were created:

* One with the bot's tweets.
* One with the position and course of ships as reported by Marine Traffic.
* One with ship ownership data as registered with Equasis.
* One with CREA’s tracking of ship movements.

Each dataset had to be cleaned and corrected in order to create our master dataset. This was done in Python (pandas) and OpenRefine.

For the publication of our graphics, we built a framework using d3. All graphics were translatable and customizable in a purpose-build backend built with Django REST-API and a frontend built using Vue and a UI framework (Vuetify).","Finding all the relevant data provided many levels of challenges, mainly due to a lack of transparency in the sector and the complexity of tracking a ship's movement in an automated way and in almost real time. In our hunt for data on European shipping firms we have used a wide range of techniques. In addition to scraping websites or extracting structured data from APIs, human handling was also required to eliminate duplicate records and to match the managing company of a vessel with the people behind it. 

The resulting “Fuelling War” project is an ongoing cross-border and data-driven investigation of Investigate Europe and Reporters United with 8 media partners and contributions from more than 20 investigative reporters, data journalists and visualisation experts in 10 languages. It comes with a subheading that gets straight to the point: “How European ships keep Russia’s economy afloat.” 

In fact, hyprocicy is the main issue of this project. We didn’t want to show how many millions of tonnes of fossil fuels European vessels have shipped from Russian ports since the invasion started without examining the bigger picture. Our team of “national” reporters confronted companies and shipowners, challenging their hypocrisy as most of them in their public stance condemned “Russian atrocities” while profiting from the war and enriching Putin’s regime. [The series exposed several high profile shipowners](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/shipping-tycoons-trading-with-russia/). Among them well-known owners of national media outlets, global art benefactors, football club owners and other public figures.

The focus of our stories was shaped by the data we used. This structure allowed us to combine on-the-ground reporting with exclusive data wrangling and visual storytelling in a compelling narrative across countries, platforms and formats. 

In Italy, the key was to look into the ports of arrival for bulk carriers and oil tankers. As a result, we were able to pinpoint specific locations on the map and send our Italian reporter to Sicily with his camera on hand to capture [the arrival of an oil tanker at the port of Milazzo](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/it/2022/sanzioni-ue-cosi-l-italia-ha-aumentato-l-import-di-greggio-milazzo/). Both the main article and visual reportage were also published by the Italian daily newspaper il Fatto Quotidiano. 

In Greece, we detected multiple ship-to-ship (STS) transfers – where ships unload cargo onto another vessel at sea and switch off tracking systems to evade detection and country sanctions. Our Greek team travelled to the Laconian Gulf in the south-eastern Peloponnese, which has become an international hotspot for STS loading, to investigate those transfers. 

In Norway, our team look into the data to investigate [the issue of sanctions and the key role of the insurance industry in stopping oil exports from Russia](https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/eu-sanctions-will-still-allow-half-of-european-insured-russian-oil-shipments/). They found that more than 20% of all fossil fuel shipments leaving Russia between 24 February to 31 August were covered by Norwegian insurers.

This contextualisation was highlighted by the shared visual language of all publications. The shared data visualizations by the Innovation Lab at Tagesspiegel allowed for each graphic to be translated and adapted to match the language and the look and feel of the publication medium.","We see this as a project about the ethical and – with new sanctions, and EU bans on Russian fossil fuels in effect – legal implications of topping up Putin’s war chest, despite his brutal invasion of Ukraine.

While there is no shortage of write-ups about Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels, follow-ups on recent attempts to cut Moscow off of Europe’s energy budgets, and reports on sanctions against the Kremlin, our long-term cross-border investigation shines a light on the European shipping companies and operators that continue to export fossil fuels from Putin’s Russia.

Central to the series is data. Our teams of reporters and researchers have spent months analysing ship movements, ownership details, vessel routes and import records to document the extent of Europe’s role in shipping fossil fuels out of Russia. The visualisations were produced in partnership with the Innovation Lab at Tagesspiegel, our media partner in Germany, and are being updated on a regular basis.

By making our methodology and data openly accessible, journalists can contextualize the extent of the European shipping sector’s involvement in exporting oil, gas and coal from Russia since the invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Journalists can also monitor seaborne exports of Russian fossil fuels to their own countries or transfers carried out by companies registered in their countries. Further, links between European shipping firms and their owners can be observed and investigated in detail.","English, Greek, German, Russian, Norwegian, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Spanish",https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/fuelling-war/,https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/european-ships-bolster-russian-fossil-fuel-trade-despite-looming-eu-sanctions/,https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/shipping-tycoons-trading-with-russia/,https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/eu-sanctions-will-still-allow-half-of-european-insured-russian-oil-shipments/,https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/russias-multi-million-euro-nuclear-exports-untouched-by-eu-sanctions/,https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/europes-problem-with-russian-energy-explained/,https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2022/gateway-to-europe-milazzo-russian-oil/,"Chris Matthews, Lorenzo Buzzoni, Nico Schmidt, Amund Trellevik, Maria Maggiore, Paulo Pena, Ingeborg Eliassen, Sotiris Sideris, Nikolas Leontopoulos, Konstantina Maltepioti, Thodoris Chondrogiannos, Kirk Jackson, Lennart Troebs, David Meidinger, Hendrik Lehmann, Helena Wittlich, Aleksey Kovalev, Bendik Nagel Støren, Manuel Rico","**Investigate Europe** is a consortium of reporters from 12 EU countries.

Most of them are Black, and most of them have been there before.

The Cleveland community has been blindfolded in trying to understand how systemic unfairness stacks up — including arrests and charging decisions, access to bail, plea bargains, and sentencing. With our ground-breaking local investigation, “Testify,” The Marshall Project is uncovering the inner workings of justice in the historically opaque Cuyahoga County Justice system.","Like many places, felony court data in Cleveland is both completely open — anybody can look up a case on the docket — and extremely opaque because the court refuses to release the data it collects. The Marshall Project built a scraper to collect 70,000 court records and counting and instead of hoarding the data for its own stories, journalists created a tool where residents and community members could ask questions that the journalists would answer. 

We held a virtual community office hours event where we connected with Clevelanders to get feedback about our upcoming tool answering data questions about the courts. Cleveland Documenter Seanna Denee said she wanted us to provide data that “proves the theory on the street” — evidence that helps us understand our own senses. 

Our on-the-ground engagement reporting and collaboration with Cleveland Documenters (soon to be part of a new publication called Signal Cleveland) built trust in the community and reflected the community’s questions and concerns about the court system and judges across many platforms. 

The Marshall Project provided the community with a first-of-its-kind analysis of voting patterns that highlighted the fact that mostly white, suburban voters were electing the judges presiding over the cases of mostly Black Cleveland residents.

To get around them we launched thousands of individual scrapers in the cloud. That also made things slow. Patience was a virtue because it took months of continuous operation to scrape just a few years of case records.

Solving the technical problem was only part of the battle. We still needed to validate whether our scraped data was a comprehensive record of cases with limited cooperation from the court. Through dogged reporting efforts of the entire team, we were able to obtain a list of case numbers from court administrators. While the court would not confirm or deny many of our findings, comparing the list of cases known to the court to the cases we scraped gave us full confidence we had captured the full universe of cases successfully.","While Cuyahoga County allows anyone with access to the internet to look up a person’s case records, there's no way to use those individual records to assess the records of individual judges, and the court has not released that data publicly. We were able to access and analyze that data. This is what we found:

* Court outcomes worsen existing racial disparities. Though Black people make up only about 30% of the county's residents, almost two-thirds of the people who are arrested by police and charged with felonies by prosecutors are Black. Then, after judges impose sentences, state records show three-quarters of people in state prisons convicted in Cuyahoga County are Black.

* Individual judges make a big difference — for example, some judges almost never send defendants to prison for common charges like theft and low-level felony drug possession, while others incarcerate 30% or more.

* While Cleveland residents make up two-thirds of defendants in the court, votes from the city account for less than a quarter of those cast in judges’ races. That means the vote in the predominantly White suburbs in judges’ races effectively carries three times the power of the vote in the majority Black city.

* Voters have more power than they may think. If everyone who showed up to vote had cast ballots for judges as well, that could have swung the outcome in 9 of 15 contested judicial races since 2016 — without turning out a single additional voter.

Judges play a key role in the way justice is dispensed. Bringing transparency to how they do their jobs is essential to understanding flaws in the larger system. It’s also urgent for voters, who have the task of electing them or voting them off the bench. That’s what The Marshall Project heard from a chorus of academics, attorneys, people who have experienced the system firsthand, and more than 40 residents we worked with Cleveland Documenters to interview.

We also spent months gathering questions from the community, answering their questions and further trying to shed a light on the imbalance in power when it comes to electing judges.

Finally, our reporting on the court system continues: Our most recent investigation, by Wesley Lowery and Ilica Mahajan, found the majority of cases in the system feature defendants with at least one prior charge, and nearly a third have at least five prior criminal cases. The crimes are mostly not violent. A review of hundreds of cases found that most included a defendant who cited drug addiction, mental illness, or both as a factor in their crimes.","1) Courts are worth investigating. After policing, courts are the most important gear in the machinery of mass incarceration in the United States. They are also one of the most opaque. 

2) Analyze geographic concentrations of power. When our understanding of the data was still limited, we were able to rely on easier-to-use public voting datasets combined with geocoded defendant addresses. 

3) Make the work a two-way street. Through our community “office hours” virtual meetings and our FAQ product, we’ve built channels for engaging with the community.

4) Target tons of platforms and audiences. We’ve shared our reporting in printed fliers, as an illustrated explainer, as an interactive chart, as a page of audio voices, on social platforms like Instagram, in Spanish, at local civic data events, and more.","English, Spanish",https://testify.themarshallproject.org/,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/26/who-s-really-cycling-in-and-out-of-cleveland-s-courts,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/27/testify-repeat-defendant-profile,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/26/how-we-analyzed-cases-of-people-cycling-in-and-out-of-cleveland-s-courts,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/05/09/we-re-answering-your-questions-about-cleveland-s-court-system,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/01/27/who-s-electing-judges-in-the-cleveland-area-not-those-ensnared-in-the-system,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/01/27/we-asked-people-in-cleveland-what-they-want-to-know-about-judges,"Rachel Dissell, Ilica Mahajan, Anna Flagg, Wesley Lowery, Elan Kiderman Ullendorff, Katie Park, Celina Fang, Ashley Dye, Raghuram Vadarevu, John G., Kellie Morris, Michelle Pitcher, Nicole Lewis, Ryan Murphy, Ariel Goodman, Aaron Colby Williams",Available on request.
United States,The Washington Post,Big,Shortlist,,"More than 1,800 congressmen once enslaved Black people. This is who they were, and how they shaped the nation.",2022-01-10,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Human rights","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Node.js","More than 1,800 people who served in the U.S. Congress in the 18th, 19th and even 20th centuries owned human beings at some point in their lives, according to a Washington Post investigation. The Washington Post has compiled [the first database of slaveholding members of Congress](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/) by examining thousands of pages of census records and historical documents.","[The Post’s list of enslavers in Congress investigation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2022/congress-slaveowners-names-list/) is the first of its kind. In the process. This project uncoveres facts that alter the way many historical figures have been depicted. The Post’s work clarifies the record on many men whose relationship to slavery was previously hidden to the public, like Sen. Rufus King, who signed the Constitution and ran for president. Someone who walked past the plaque honoring him in New York City might have searched for him online and found the Wikipedia article extolling his anti-slavery activism. Before The Post’s project, they would not have found any mention of the fact that he once enslaved someone, too.

The Biographical Directory of the U.S. Congress, which is the country’s official source of information on every person who has ever served in Congress, makes almost no mention of slavery. The Post’s journalism provides a much-needed comprehensive reference.

This story has been strengthened by a unique level of reader involvement. Upon publication of the initial database and analysis, The Post asked readers to help research other possible slaveholders in Congress, eliciting hundreds of responses. Readers sent in remarkable documents: an enslaved grandmother’s oral history, a great-great-grandfather’s letter from a Civil War battlefield, newspaper clips showing congressmen seeking the return of escaped enslaved people and handwritten birth certificates showing babies born enslaved.","Journalists from every department of The Washington Post gathered to turn the resulting list of more than 1,800 slaveholders in Congress into a searchable public database and a series of richly designed articles exploring the ways Congress’s investment in slavery resonates today.

The newsroom-wide effort had more than 40 contributors: from copy editors who checked listings for all 1,875 congressmen in the database, finding and fixing wrinkles in the historical dataset along the way.

The Washington Post built a customized searchable database unique to this project to allow readers to explore the data on their own. The database is one of the largest The Washington Post has ever built and published. Its construction was a painstaking effort, calling for hours of work to combine and check spotty pre-existing datasets on members of Congress and the votes they cast. Technoliges such as R, JavaScript and React were used to process and render the data.

The Washington Post also illustrated this data in creative and compelling ways, including an interactive timeline showing how the share of slaveholders in Congress changed in response to historical events, and a richly detailed map illustrating the trends in all 40 states that sent slaveholders to Congress. The visuals were built using JavaScript's library d3.js, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.","When D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser proposed renaming city buildings because they honored racists, Washington Post reporter Julie Zauzmer Weil scrutinized the list, finding several congressmen who were enslavers. But when she Googled: “members of Congress who were slaveowners,” she discovered there was no list. So she set out to create one – and to explore the impact those enslavers had on America’s laws in pursuit of their own wealth and self-interest.

The new availability of factual information on slaveholders in Congress serves the public in many ways as America continues to grapple with how it understands and teaches its history.

Washington Post readers have used the database to learn about their own ancestors. They have looked up the namesakes of their towns’ schools and parks, providing an easy-to-use source of factual information to give context to the ongoing debates in communities across the country about whether to rename public institutions that honor slaveholders. The Post’s richly designed and intensively researched tour of the art that depicts historical figures inside the U.S. Capitol also contributes to important public debate about who the country honors.

To share this resource with students, The Post commissioned a curriculum guide available to teachers. The Zinn Education Project also promoted the project, leading to invitations for reporter Julie Z. Weil to speak with students at a wide variety of schools.

The database is simple enough to serve people of all ages in becoming better-informed participants in one of the most serious conversations in America today: the dialogue about our past and how it shapes our present.","While much has been written in recent years about the systemic and long-lasting effects of slavery, other publications have not explored the relationship between lawmakers’ own economic interests, the laws they passed, and the ramifications of those laws. This database allows journalists and historians alike to explore that crucial aspect of the American story in a way that was previously inaccessible.

The Washington Post took the unusual step of making the entire dataset from this project publicly accessible on [Github](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-congress-slaveowners). The freely available data offers a brand-new tool useful for many forms of analysis. For instance, a reporter or a historian writing about any vote in Congress can now use this data to analyze how slaveholders and non-slaveholders voted, providing a valuable new lens that will further scholarship on American history.

Brazil,Agência Pública,Big,Shortlist,,Mapa dos Conflitos - Uma década de violência e injustiça fundiária na Amazônia Legal,2022-04-27,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment, Agriculture, Human rights","Animation, QGIS, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Flourish, Figma","O Mapa dos Conflitos é um projeto da Agência Pública de Jornalismo Investigativo em parceria com a Comissão Pastoral da Terra (CPT) que, por meio de análise de dados, investiga ocorrências de conflitos no campo na Amazônia Legal na última década (2011-2020).

Neste especial, foram analisados os conflitos no campo em comparação aos dados públicos relacionados a outras temáticas socioambientais como desmatamento, queimadas, mineração, água, agrotóxicos, violência e desigualdade.

O projeto faz parte do especial “Amazônia sem lei”, que investiga a violência relacionada à regularização fundiária, à demarcação de terras e à reforma agrária na Amazônia Legal e no Cerrado.","O Mapa dos Conflitos busca estimular o interesse dos leitores pelos conflitos no campo brasileiro por meio de uma visualização de dados intuitiva, interativa e com um visual que remete a um jogo de videogame. Mais do que isso, a plataforma também fornece uma base valiosa para jornalistas e pesquisadores produzirem suas reportagens, artigos e análises. Por esse motivo, publicamos o projeto em português, espanhol e inglês. O mapa é também uma ferramenta que pode ser trabalhada em sala de aula por professores.

Esse projeto realizou a missão de reunir e visibilizar os dados fruto do importante trabalho da Comissão Pastoral da Terra, única entidade a realizar tão ampla pesquisa sobre os conflitos no campo em âmbito nacional. Não fosse a CPT, não saberíamos quem sofre injustiças fundiárias e, principalmente, não saberíamos quem morre no campo no Brasil — sobretudo na Amazônia.

O Mapa dos Conflitos venceu o prêmio Design for a Better World 2022 na categoria Design Gráfico, Design Digital, UX, UI e Comunicação, conquistou o segundo lugar no Prêmio Direitos Humanos de Jornalismo 2022 e foi finalista no Prêmio Claudio Weber Abramo de Jornalismo de Dados na categoria Visualização.

O projeto também apareceu no Top 10 de reportagens de jornalismo de dados mais populares no Twitter em uma seleção do Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN). O Mapa foi repercutido por sites de jornalismo nacional e internacional, como Portal Imprensa, Mídia Ninja, Associação Brasileira de Jornalismo Investigativo, LatAm Journalim Review, do Knight for Journalism in the Americas, e IJNet. Foi ainda recomendado na newsletter Chez les indés do site de notícias francês Basta! e na newsletter do Bellingcat, veículo de jornalismo investigativo com sede na Holanda.","Para o tratamento e análise dos diferentes dados, foram utilizados softwares e linguagens de programação. Inicialmente, exportamos bases de dados públicas para cruzamento com os dados de conflitos por terra fornecidos pela CPT. 

Para os dados de IDH-M, consideramos a classificação do Pnud - Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento. Os processos minerários foram extraídos dos dados abertos da Agência Nacional de Mineração; a quantidade de focos de queimada e o incremento de desmatamento por município foram calculados a partir dos dados do Inpe; os dados de intoxicações por agrotóxicos e de violência foram obtidos pela plataforma Tabnet — DataSUS, do Ministério da Saúde; por fim, os dados de outorgas de uso de água foram baixados dos dados abertos da Agência Nacional de Águas.

Por se tratarem de fontes distintas de dados, foi necessário padronizar as bases para que elas fossem comparáveis. Para isso, utilizamos editores de planilhas e pacotes das linguagens R e Python para a limpeza e análise.","A Comissão Pastoral da Terra divulga anualmente o relatório de Conflitos do Campo no Brasil, com informações sobre as ações de resistência e enfrentamento que ocorrem em diferentes contextos sociais no âmbito rural, envolvendo a luta pela terra, água e direitos e pelos meios de trabalho ou produção. Esses conflitos se dão entre classes sociais, entre os trabalhadores ou por causa da ausência ou da má gestão de políticas públicas.

A ação pastoral da Igreja Católica é de extrema importância pela profundidade, cobertura temporal e espacial dos conflitos. Além disso, é um trabalho perigoso, pelos riscos de se debruçar sobre um problema que atravessa décadas no Brasil e que ainda é atual. Tornar público esses dados confronta estruturas de poder nas lutas pela terra-território e fomenta o debate e defesa sobre os direitos dos trabalhadores da terra.

Essa foi a primeira vez que os dados da CPT foram sobrepostos com outros fatores socioambientais que ocorrem espacialmente nos locais dos conflitos. Combinado à experiência da Agência Pública na cobertura e na investigação de dados relacionados ao tema, e na visualização interativa possibilitada pelo estúdio Café.art, o Mapa dos Conflitos pretende ser uma ferramenta para atrair mais atenção para os conflitos no campo na Amazônia Legal.

Após o lançamento do mapa, membros da equipe realizaram um webinar para a Escola de Dados, da Open Knowledge Brasil, explicando a metodologia do projeto, o tratamento dos dados, mapas e visualizações, além dos softwares utilizados.","O Mapa dos Conflitos é um trabalho que uniu diferentes áreas de conhecimento. Unir coleta de informações, análise de dados, apuração jornalística e o desenvolvimento de uma visualização de dados interativa com diferentes equipes é um desafio, porém o resultado dessa colaboração é muito proveitoso para o ambiente jornalístico. Desse modo, acreditamos que jornalistas podem aprender como criar laços com equipes de diferentes backgrounds (como a ação pastoral da Igreja Católica e estúdios de design).

Além disso, o Mapa dos Conflitos pode ser uma ferramenta para jornalistas buscarem pautas a respeito da Amazônia Legal a partir das questões levantadas pelas lentes disponíveis, atrair a atenção para os conflitos na região amazônica e pressionar autoridades pela formulação de políticas públicas. No site do especial, também disponibilizamos a metodologia usada para cruzar as bases de dados e os cruzamentos feitos para serem baixados em formato de planilha, estimulando assim o uso por outros jornalistas, pesquisadores e demais profissionais interessados.","Português, Inglês, Espanhol",https://mapadosconflitos.apublica.org/en/,https://mapadosconflitos.apublica.org/,https://mapadosconflitos.apublica.org/es/,https://www.dfbwaward.com/premiados-2/,https://www.direitoshumanosbr.org.br/home/premio.php,https://premio.jornalismodedados.org/edicoes/2022/,,"Thiago Domenici, Bruno Fonseca, Bianca Muniz, Rafael Oliveira, Itamar Vieira Junior, Anna Beatriz Anjos, Caetano Patta, Fernando Guimarães, Clarissa Levy, Victor Brasileiro, Flávio Marcos Gonçalves de Araújo","A Agência Pública é a primeira agência de jornalismo investigativo sem fins lucrativos do Brasil e foi criada por repórteres mulheres em 2011.

Brazil,g1/globo,Big,Shortlist,,As eleições brasileiras em 11136 vídeos personalizados | The Brazilian elections in 11136 customized videos,2022-10-02,"Breaking news, Database, Open data, Video, Elections, Politics","Personalisation, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Python, Javascript, Google Compute Engine, Big Query, Pytesseract, Nexrender","g1 generated and published 11136 customized texts and videos with Brazilian two rounds election results hours after the votings in October 2022. Each had the results for a specific city, including votes and percentages for the President, Governor, and other elected officials. Delivering fast and detailed information for voters was crucial to counter coordinated attacks on the voting systems and false claims of election fraud that had been spreading before the ballot. It was the first time a news outlet released this number of automated election videos in such a short time. The content reached millions of people.","The fast release of 5568 automated texts and videos with results of each Brazilian election round in October 2022 played a significant role in g1/globo effort to inform voters during the fiercest presidential election in the country's history. At that time the fear of massive countrywide protests to overturn the elections was real, and the quick and efficient way the press and Electoral Justice inform the public about the results are tought to have played a key role in preventing demonstrations to scale.

g1/globo managed to deliver text and video with specific data for each Brazilian city, making the results more accessible and easy to search. One of the goals in automating content was to reach very small towns that compose two-thirds of Brazilian cities and are not used to get customized content from the press. 

The strategy of releasing automated content with citywide results was proven right when false messages started to spread showing fake presidential vote counts for Bolsonaro or Lula in specific cities. They could be easily disproven by the automated texts and videos.

Millions of people viewed the automated texts and videos with Brazilian election results.","g1/globo already had experience publishing automated texts in 2020 municipal elections - with great results. Automated videos were the next step to ensure a broader reach, specially on social media. But the format presented many technical challenges, such as processing power, data quality and CMS integration. 

To tackle those technological challenges, a complex data processing pipeline was developed, relying most on cloud technologies using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The advantage of this approach is the possibility of scale by demand besides the resilience of the operation. All data was landed in the JSON format, and the buckets service from Google Cloud Storage was used to store them, the JSON files were converted to AVRO format which is a better format suited for querying and processing with Python scripts, and beyond that, the data is stored in Big Query tables to be consumed by front-end applications such as dashboards, the pipeline flow management is handled by the Dataflow. 

For the video rendering process, virtual machines from Google Compute Engine were used to build a render farm, running on Windows OS. The rendering processing relies upon Adobe After Effects. It is automated by the Nexrender framework, which is written in Javascript and is responsible for ""gluing"" all the data to the videos. At the end of the rendering process, the videos are encoded through the FFMPEG framework. 

For the data quality insurance, an OCR layer is added to the pipeline flow, which is responsible for extracting information from each frame of the video and guaranteeing that it matches the correct data of each city and candidate polling numbers. This system is developed using the Pytesseract framework for the OCR part, and the OCV library for image treatment, such as grayscale tunning and noise reduction.","Brazil held in October 2022 the fiercest presidential election in its history. In a runoff Brazilians ousted President Jair Bolsonaro and elected former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after months of disinformation campaigns, coup threats, and violence among voters. Coordinated attacks on the voting systems and false claims of election fraud had been spread by Bolsonaro supporters years before the ballot. 

There was a widespread notion among electoral authorities and the press that after the votes were counted time was of the essence to disperse any attempts to overturn the elections. Delivering the election results in a fast, detailed, and reliable way was essential to assure the public confidence in the voting systems and Democracy itself. 

g1/Globo has been publishing for years detailed election data supplied by the Electoral Justice in charts and interactive pages as soon as they are available, with great success. But not all people find charts friendly and accessible. Many prefer to read a text or watch a video. Besides, specific results for each city are not easily found in search engines.

With that in mind, g1 started publishing automated texts with election results for each of the 5568 Brazilian cities in the 2020 municipal election minutes after the numbers were released. The response was very positive and the content reached a broader public.

The logical step was to adopt one more time text automation to amplify content production in the 2022 elections. Given the political climate though, reaching the maximum possible number of people was not a goal but the top priority. The text was not enough. It had to have a video.

Nonetheless, automating video has a series of challenges, such as processing power, data quality, and CMS integration. And it had never been done at this scale by a news outlet, at least in Brazil.

The project took nine months until it was ready to go live on election day. 
It involved different departments and suppliers, a series of test to ensure the data was going to be correct and passed by sampling audit before publishing and a complete review after that found no data errors. 

The content was viewed by millions of Brazilians after the election and helped inform the public with speed, precision and customization.","The use of tools to automate the creation of news texts and videos can massively improve speed and volume of a newsroom production while also allowing news organizations to offer customized content that otherwise would be impossible to make. That can prove to be specially relevant when there is a need to adress many small groups of people with specific information, such as desagregating national election results to a county level.",Português,https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2022/noticia/2022/10/31/g1-publica-reportagens-e-videos-com-a-votacao-em-todos-os-5568-municipios-no-segundo-turno-das-eleicoes-2022.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2022/noticia/2022/10/03/g1-publica-reportagens-com-a-votacao-em-todos-os-5568-municipios-no-primeiro-turno-das-eleicoes-2022.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/ms/mato-grosso-do-sul/noticia/2022/10/31/eleicoes-em-aquidauana-ms-veja-como-foi-a-votacao-no-2o-turno.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/ms/mato-grosso-do-sul/noticia/2022/10/02/eleicoes-em-aquidauana-ms-veja-como-foi-a-votacao-no-1o-turno.ghtml,,,,"Coordination: Felipe Grandin, Guilherme Gomes, Mariana Mendicelli, Renato Franzini, Ricardo Gallo, Tatiana Caldas e Thiago Madeira

United States,Bloomberg News,Big,Shortlist,,Google Maps Regularly Misleads People Searching for Abortion Clinics,2022-08-15,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Infographics, Map, Women","Google Sheets, Python, Node.js, Javascript
Svelte",Bloomberg exposed how services such as Google Maps and Search deliver misleading abortion-related information and how abortion foes collect data on people seeking pregnancy help online. Google changed their practices in response.,"Bloomberg’s data journalism reporting on abortion information provided by Google Maps and Google Search drew lawmakers’ attention and changed the tech company’s policy. 

In August, Bloomberg published the story showing that in a quarter of abortion searches, Google Maps – the most widely used US navigation tool – led users to crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs), non-medical organizations that seek to persuade women not to get abortions. In 13 states where abortion was newly criminalized, at least half of the top search results were for CPCs. Ten days later, Google said it will clearly label facilities in the US that provide abortions in search results and in Google Maps.

In September, Bloomberg published another story showing that Google didn’t do enough to clearly label when advertisers don’t offer medical services to terminate a pregnancy. In this joint analysis by Bloomberg and the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, we found that in many abortion-related searches, Google still doesn’t apply the labels for CPCs. That means Google is still collecting ad revenue from CPCs without disclosing that such places do not provide abortions or refer patients to clinics that do. In November, citing Bloomberg’s reporting, US Senators Mark Warner and Elissa Slotkin wrote to Google’s CEO to urge the end to deceptive advertising and misrepresentation in search results, and to ensure accurate information for those seeking abortion support.","To determine a users’ experience looking for abortion-related information in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C., we wrote a script to generate Google search results by state. Those results were confirmed by searches using virtual private networks with location set to those states, as well as searches by Mechanical Turk workers located in those states.

That technique allowed us to create a database of 510 medical centers that appeared in the top 10 results for each state’s Google Maps. We then checked them against existing publicly available databases of crisis pregnancy centers and abortion clinics. We then confirmed those categorizations by making calls to experts and clinics themselves.

We built a quiz with Javascript and Svelte that asked readers to see if they could determine whether something was an abortion clinic or a crisis pregnancy center simply by looking at their website. We randomized the visual examples from the database of 510 medical centers that we built for reporting. That quiz was a crucial tool for readers to understand how someone could be easily manipulated by inaccurate results – even though Google, through its advertising business, knows which clinics do and don’t provide abortions.","A historic rollback in reproductive rights turned Google, Snapchat and other tech firms into gatekeepers for information on health care in moments of crisis and confusion. We investigated whether consumers would be well-served by the answers and found that the tech companies had avoided improving the accuracy of their information despite years of warning from advocacy groups and journalists. Bad information could have serious health implications for those in states with new time limits on legal abortion especially. 

The Bloomberg reporters wanted to be the first to quantify and define the tech firms’ lapses, so that the companies could see how they were failing pregnant people at their most vulnerable.
We needed to figure out how the Roe reversal led to geographic inequality in information for the users of tech products, as multiple states outlawed abortion or restricted access to care. We were based in New York, California and Washington, D.C., but found technical ways to understand the experience of someone using their phone to set up an appointment for an abortion in Florida or Texas, for instance. 

In order to accurately map and quantify the results for readers, we went through a meticulous fact-checking process to define which options online were, in fact, crisis pregnancy centers as opposed to legitimate abortion clinics.

United Kingdom,BBC News,Big,Shortlist,,Heat hazards: Is your area vulnerable to extreme heat?,2022-07-18,"Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Health","QGIS, Json, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap, Others, please state","As UK temperatures soared to a record 40C in July 2022, the BBC analysed satellite data to reveal those living in deprived areas were more than twice as likely to be in places vulnerable to high heat levels.

The data analysis provided the basis for a news story and an interactive map that helped put people directly into the story of last year’s summer heat wave. 

Satellite analytics company 4 Earth Intelligence (4EI), provided the data, which the BBC analysed.","As well as being used widely across BBC News outlets, the story was featured on the Apple News daily spotlight.

The Red Cross, plan to use the map as a tool to assist with future planning for heatwaves. It was also shared with the charity’s Community Resilience Team.","We used two levels of data for this story, postcode (zipcode) level to build the interactive map, and neighbourhood level (lower super output area or LSOA) data for the deprivation analysis.

4 Earth Intelligence used a statistical method published by academics to standardise land surface temperatures for each postcode and LSOA area, which involved combining satellite images for different dates over the past three years.

The temperature data was then adjusted to consider the different average temperatures of each region, to highlight hotter areas across the country, despite varying climates and temperatures.

A score, ranging from one to five, was then assigned to each postcode and LSOA. The score is an indicator of how likely it is that the area will experience high temperatures during hot weather, when compared with other areas in the surrounding neighbourhood.

The data team took the score for each LSOA area and cross-referenced it with the Index of Multiple Deprivation for each country, to establish if people living in more deprived areas were more vulnerable to high heat.

The design and development team took the postcode-level data and created an interactive map, allowing audiences to bring the story to their doorstep and make it more relevant to them.

Meanwhile, using the data our reporting team went to areas in England, Scotland and Wales experiencing high heat and high levels of deprivation to learn about the impacts this was having on people's wellbeing. They gathered moving case studies of vulnerable people suffering in the heat, giving voice to those who struggle in heat waves each year.

This project was achieved through the use of R, QGIS, Zoomstack, Adobe XD, Photoshop and traditional broadcast reporting.","The data was exclusively released to the BBC by 4 Earth Intelligence shortly after COP26, which had been held in Glasgow.

The granularity of the data was such that processing the data and boundaries for 1.8 million unique postcode files presented major technical challenges for our developers. They came up with an innovative solution not to use a vector map showing the heat scores/zones of each area, but to render the map as a series of image tiles. We layered the postcode polygons on top. 

So, when a postcode was searched only the immediately relevant data was shown. This took the burden of rendering the map and all associated data away from the user, as it was handled by our servers.","- It’s easy to forget satellite data can be used in ways beyond just mapping

Brazil,Aos Fatos,Small,Shortlist,,"Em 1.459 dias como presidente, Bolsonaro mentiu 6.685 vezes",2022-12-29,"Investigation, Database, Fact-checking, Chart, Elections, Politics","Scraping, Google Sheets, Python","Durante os quatro anos de governo de Jair Bolsonaro, uma equipe de mais de 20 profissionais do Aos Fatos se engajou em acompanhar diariamente o que ex-presidente do Brasil dizia. Com um time de repórteres, editores, programadores e líderes de inovação, a organização desenvolveu métodos e novas tecnologias para dar conta da empreitada.

Desse modo, Aos Fatos analisou ininterruptamente discursos, entrevistas, lives, redes sociais, entre outras aparições públicas de Bolsonaro, para entender quais foram os principais alvos de sua batalha contra a verdade factual. O resultado foi um trabalho abrangente e meticuloso que mostra a ascensão do golpismo no Brasil.","Um dos impactos mais notáveis da cobertura sobre todas as mentiras ditas por Bolsonaro foi o então candidato à Presidência Lula mencionar, durante o principal debate das eleições de 2022, ao vivo, que Bolsonaro havia mentido, até então, 6.498 vezes durante o seu mandato, atribuindo o dado ao Aos Fatos. Isso gerou repercussão sem precedentes:

- O portal UOL repercutiu nas suas redes (TikTok, YouTube, Twitter) o registro de Lula (https://www.tiktok.com/@uol/video/7159763525135600902) alcançando cerca de 10 milhões de seguidores;
- O debate gerou recorde de audiência, a maior em 16 anos, segundo o jornal Valor Econômico;
- Jornais como Correio Braziliense e Diário de Pernambuco também repercutiram.

Outro impacto substancial da cobertura foi ter subsidiado um pedido de abertura de inquérito que apura a participação de Bolsonaro na incitação aos atos que culminaram na invasão do Congresso Nacional, do Palácio do Planalto e do Supremo Tribunal Federal em 8 de janeiro de 2023. Esse documento, encaminhado em 12 de janeiro de 2023 ao procurador-geral da República, Augusto Aras, afirma que ""Bolsonaro tem sugerido em diversas manifestações públicas, desde setembro de 2021"" que as ""instituições democráticas não são confiáveis"". A informação foi retirada deste projeto. Esse pedido foi acatado e, hoje, o ex-presidente está sob investigação.

A investigação também foi mencionada em veículos internacionais, como Poynter, Deustch Welle e Washington Post. O que é mais notável na imprensa brasileira, no entanto, é que Aos Fatos criou uma cultura de acompanhamento sistemático das falas de Bolsonaro, tornando mais comum no noticiário do país análises críticas de declarações falsas ou enganosas dele e de demais políticos que se utilizam da mentira como arma política.

O projeto também foi uma ferramenta útil para mapear o golpismo de Bolsonaro e produzir investigações que ajudam a explicar o contexto dos atos golpistas de 8 de janeiro: https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/bolsonaro-mentiras-quatro-anos-de-golpismo/.","Em 2019, diante da perspectiva de que Bolsonaro emularia Donald Trump e seria um mentiroso contumaz em seu governo, Aos Fatos preparou um banco de dados público de declarações do presidente, organizado por temas e por origem das declarações: https://www.aosfatos.org/todas-as-declara%C3%A7%C3%B5es-de-bolsonaro/. O banco de dados foi desenvolvido em Django e era primeiramente integrado a uma tabela dinâmica do serviço Google Spreadsheets. Em 2021, devido à enorme quantidade de dados e dificuldade de sincronização, foi integrado totalmente ao CMS nativo do Aos Fatos.

Também no início da cobertura, Aos Fatos vasculhava manualmente veículos jornalísticos, páginas oficiais nas redes sociais e documentos do governo em busca de declarações públicas do presidente. Isso demandava um gasto de tempo e de recursos humanos muito grande: ao menos um repórter e um editor usavam mais de dois dias inteiros de trabalho na semana entre o mapeamento das falas, a checagem e a publicação. No fim de 2021, Aos Fatos desenvolveu a ferramenta Escriba (https://escriba.aosfatos.org/), de transcrição automática de vídeos e áudios com grande acurácia. Isso acelerou o processo de acompanhamento das declarações. O ganho de produtividade para essa atividade foi de aproximadamente 150h/mês, em média.

Foi assim que conseguimos chegar ao número de quatro mentiras por dia ditas por Bolsonaro.

Ou seja, além de ter gerado impacto externo, mudando a cultura de cobertura de declarações de políticos no Brasil, o projeto de monitoramento das mentiras de Bolsonaro causou uma revolução interna de produtividade no Aos Fatos.","Aos Fatos considera o contador de mentiras de Bolsonaro um projeto de longo prazo cujo impacto só poderia ser medido ao fim do mandato do ex-presidente, em 2022. Portanto, seria impossível dizer em 2019, quando planejamos essa cobertura, o potencial que ele teria, tanto do ponto de vista de repercussão, quanto da capacidade de finalizá-lo e consolidá-lo como um documento completo.

Com um projeto semelhante, o Washington Post teve dificuldades em finalizar sua cobertura: https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/. Aos Fatos, com uma equipe de 10 a 15 jornalistas e metodologia de checagem consistente, publicou seus resultados pontualmente em 29 de dezembro de 2022.

Imprescindível ressaltar que, por conta de sua cobertura de desinformação, Aos Fatos foi severamente atacado ao longo dos anos Bolsonaro. Não só este projeto, mas todas as operações do Aos Fatos – da checagem de fatos às investigações de campanhas de desinformação – sofreram com assédio judicial e campanha de ódio nas redes. Desde 2018, antes do início oficial da campanha presidencial daquele ano, jornalistas do Aos Fatos já sofriam doxxing e ameaças de violência por conta de seu trabalho. Também como resultado de seu trabalho, o perfil do Aos Fatos no Twitter foi bloqueado pelo perfil oficial de Bolsonaro, dificultando o mapeamento de suas declarações. 

Em 2022, Bolsonaro afirmou em entrevista o seguinte: ""Geralmente, quem busca tolher a liberdade e impor um regime de força é o chefe do Executivo. Aqui é exatamente o contrário. Aqui é o chefe do Executivo que resiste a agências de checagem, a arbitrariedades estapafúrdias. Duas ou três pessoas passam a valer mais do que todos nós juntos, que a Câmara, que outros órgãos do Judiciário. Vamos ceder para dois ou três?"" Este é só um exemplo. 

Quando do planejamento desta cobertura, Aos Fatos não sabia que eventos como os de 8 de janeiro de 2023 poderiam vir a ocorrer. No entanto, já era possível ver o valor deste projeto à medida que as eleições de 2022 se aproximavam e que os ataques golpistas de Bolsonaro ficavam mais virulentos. 

Só em 2022, por conta deste projeto, Aos Fatos produziu as seguintes reportagens, comprovando uso de dinheiro público para patrocinar atos golpistas, negacionismo e conspiração contra o sistema eleitoral brasileiro:

- Secom pagou R$ 3,2 mi para veicular discursos golpistas e mentiras de Bolsonaro na TV Brasil (https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/secom-tvbrasil-mentiras-bolsonaro/)

- Mesmo diante de adversidades financeiras, investimento em cobertura de longo prazo se traduz em impacto na indústria e na política, com retorno de leitores fiéis;
- Projetos de monitoramento constante mudam a cultura política brasileira. Nunca se falou tanto em volume de mentiras e da necessidade de respaldar políticas públicas com evidências verificáveis;
- É importante integrar projetos à rotina da empresa jornalística: o contador de mentiras de Bolsonaro gerou demanda por investimento tecnológico na redação, o que, com o Escriba, facilitou a vida de todos os repórteres da organização.

Fazer checagem sistemática de declarações também cria um constrangimento à tradição do jornalismo declaratório e estenográfico. Embora ele ainda exista, fica cada vez mais claro que é necessário ter critério sobre as declarações de políticos que se escolhe publicar.",Português,https://www.aosfatos.org/todas-as-declara%C3%A7%C3%B5es-de-bolsonaro/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/mentiras-bolsonaro/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/desinformacao-urnas-abasteceu-artilharia-bolsonaro-contra-sistema-eleitoral/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/retrospectiva-mentiras-governo-bolsonaro/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/secom-tvbrasil-mentiras-bolsonaro/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/bolsonaro-usa-encontro-com-embaixadores-para-repetir-informacoes-falsas-sobre-eleicao/,https://www.aosfatos.org/noticias/sete-de-setembro-brasilia-bolsonaro-mentiras-corrupcao-ideologia-de-genero/,"Tai Nalon, Bernardo Moura, Luis Felipe dos Santos, Ana Freitas, Ana Rita Cunha, Amanda Ribeiro, Luiz Fernando Menezes, Bruno Fávero, Priscila Pacheco, Marco Faustino, Carolina Cavaleiro, Rômulo Collopy, Erico Rosa, Guilherme Lobo, Sérgio Spagnuolo, Bárbara Libório","Tai Nalon, diretora executiva, estratégia

React
Shapr3D","The story outlined the looming threat of space debris in low-Earth orbit and the consequences of not addressing or mitigating the problem. We built the story as a 3D, scrolling explainer, constructing a number of scenes in orbit to explain important concepts that would be difficult to articulate through text or static charts alone.

The project was produced in collaboration with Peggy Hollinger, International Business Editor at the FT, who has covered the commoditisation of space extensively. The reporting involved conversations with officials from ESA and NASA, as well as various other researchers, experts, and astronauts.","The article was a hit with readers, with roughly a quarter reading the entire piece. The article was also published to coincide with the FT Investing In Space conference and used to frame discussions about how we can best mitigate against the growing issue of space debris.

The piece was also widely shared on social media and repackaged into one of the FT’s best performing Instagram reels of the year. The combination of in-depth reporting and 3D visuals helped us take the FT’s reporting — and the complex world of space — to a younger audience.","The project is built within a React frame, using a scrollytelling component developed by our team. The main visuals use the ThreeJS/React-Three-Fiber libraries to manipulate and navigate around complex 3D models. 

Some of these models were constructed by us, while others were sourced from third-parties and modified in Blender. Aligning the events and camera for each section to work across devices involved a lot of work, as did navigating performance concerns. 

We had to make concessions on detail and accuracy to ensure that the page could load in a reasonable amount of time and run relatively smoothly across a range of mobile devices. We also had to consider tradeoffs between literal and conceptual accuracy, a challenge magnified by the physical scale of many of the concepts.

We outlined the project in Figma and wireframed out each “scene” in the story, determining which concepts benefitted from complex 3D scenes and which were better-served by short text sections or static charts. In one particularly complex section, we determined that explaining the impact of various anti-satellite missile tests would work best as some kind of chart, but would benefit from incorporating the scale of the 3D scene, so we constructed a dynamic chart in 3D space.

For the views of all satellites and tracked debris, we used real positional data from www.space-track.org to calculate real point-in-time positions based on orbit ascensions, inclinations and periods.

The lighting and colour palette were of particular importance against a dark background, as was the positioning and styling of text cards. But to address accessibility concerns, we offered readers who struggle with dark text on light backgrounds an alternative reading experience via a toggle on the landing page.","Accumulation of space debris in low-Earth orbit is a considerable threat to our future livelihoods, but it is an issue that we have the time to mitigate or solve. One researcher we spoke to equated it to “climate change in the early 20th century”.

One challenge we faced in the piece was conveying the importance of an issue that is, literally, very far away and explaining that we have come to rely on this area of space for much more than space travel. 

We tried to communicate some of the ways that satellites in low-Earth orbit impact our lives through a mini “tour” of satellites at the beginning of the story. Should more collisions, minor or catastrophic, occur and debris continue to accumulate, we risk creating an environment in which satellites are unable to effectively operate and the services we have come to rely on them for — navigation, communication, climate modeling — become difficult or impossible to maintain. 

Additionally, while the current volume of active satellites and debris represents a concern, plans by SpaceX and others to put tens of thousands of new satellites into orbit pose an even greater challenge. 

NASA has raised concerns about the volume and capabilities of these satellites, but Musk has brushed them off, stating that he believes there is room in low-Earth orbit for “tens of billions” of satellites to operate (NASA and many experts disagree).

We devoted a long section at the end of the piece to potential solutions, but many of these rely on regulations or restrictions that no single entity has the power to enforce. Ultimately, operators such as SpaceX (or Amazon’s Project Kuiper) will largely be able to do as they please until enforceable and consistent regulations are in place.

Space debris is an issue many consider distant or unimportant, but a failure to take action could have disastrous consequences for life on Earth. We believe that through providing a visually-compelling explanation of the threat it poses we can correct these misconceptions.","We hope that this story serves as a compelling example of incorporating 3D models and visualisations in a way that aids understanding, rather than distracts. For the right kind of project, breaking outside of the axes and working with a truly blank canvas can make for a more compelling or precise explanation of a concept or complex topic (if time allows!). 

While our project pushed up against some performance limits, we were also surprised by how much we were able to get to work reasonably well across browsers and devices. The speed of even the slowest mobile devices get better every year and can handle increasingly complex formats. It is an exciting time for journalism, and we hope this story serves as inspiration for those who want to produce cutting edge visual stories in the digital age.",English,https://ig.ft.com/space-debris/,,,,,,,"Sam Learner, Peggy Hollinger, Sam Joiner, Caroline Nevitt, Ian Bott","The visual components of the story were created by members of the FT's visual storytelling team, an interdisciplinary group of journalists combining data, design, coding and reporting skills. The team focus on projects where visual elements play an essential role in communicating the story, working on everything from investigations to explainers across the spectrum of news and features.

Women Face Wage Discrimination In Both The Public And Private Sectors,2022-12-19,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Audio, Women, Human rights","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python","The investigation relies on analyzing wage bulletin data issued by the Egyptian Statistical Center, during the last five years, to prove the gap in wages between women and men in the public and private sectors in various professions, in violation of Egyptian law.
The data showed that, the wage gap did not narrow, but rather increased. 
According to data analysis, this disparity is equivalent to a 28% difference in income between men and women in the public and private sectors.
in light of the absence of any role from the workforce, and the Manpower Committee in the House of Representatives.","When he spoke with the National Wages Council in Egypt, the official told me that this is the first time he has heard about this problem and that they have not discussed this issue before, so I am one of the first to talk about this issue in a data-driven investigation.
I also spoke to the head of the Parliament’s Manpower Committee, Adel Abdel-Fadil, and they are now in the process of finalizing the new labor law, and he said that he had never heard of this problem and they did not discuss it in the House of Representatives, and after publishing the investigation, he told me that he would discuss this issue in the House of Representatives, and during the discussion of the law new work.
She also sent the investigation to the head of the National Council for Women and officials in the workforce and civil society to discuss this topic in the new law.","First we used PDF scraping tools like Tabula and Python.
We also used Excel to clean and analyze the data, and Fluorish and DataRubber were used to represent the data.
And I used audicity to lead the podcast.
We used Photoshop for graphics, and Adobe Premiere for video editing.","First, everyone knows that Egypt and the Middle East have become an unsafe environment for the work of journalists, especially investigative reports. It is enough for you to criticize any responsible party to refrain from dealing with you again, in addition to the difficulties in dealing with official sources and their fear of talking to journalists so that they do not lose their jobs, too. Dealing with cases of women, especially those working in government agencies, so we had to hide their identities so that they would not be subject to prosecution. One of the officials asked me for the information of the employee who spoke to me and works in the Tax Authority, and I refused and told him that you do not have the right to pursue women who suffer from discrimination in wages. So instead of resolving the crisis, you pursue them and dismiss them from their work?

Officials also deny that there is discrimination in wages between the sexes, even the Ministry of Manpower, although the ministry has established a unit to combat gender discrimination!
Also, the difficulties that journalists face in developing their work and skills, as there is very little material in the Arabic language, so I hope that we will be given more training and resources to hone our skills in data journalism.","We can use open source and official data to create a data-driven investigation that condemns the very entity that issues the data.
We used labor force data to confront the Ministry of Manpower itself with wage discrimination between men and women.
Data journalism can also be used to support gender and marginalized groups. Officials often tell us that these cases in our investigations are an individual case, but with data over several years we can prove that the problem is not an individual case and many women suffer from it in all Egyptian governorates. over different years, and that the wage gap increases rather than decreases with the passage of years.",Arabic and English,https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2022/12/14/%D9%81%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%8F%D8%B3%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%87%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%8A/,https://en.sharikawalaken.media/the-wage-gap-cannot-be-bridged-women-face-wage-discrimination-in-both-the-public-and-private-sectors/,,,,,,Menna abdel Razek,"An Egyptian investigative and data reporter with more than eight years of experience.

Sweden,Sveriges Radio Ekot/Swedish Radio News,Big,Shortlist,,For sale: your health,2022-04-09,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, Podcast/radio, Audio, Health, Human rights","Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Python, Vue.js","By investigating the Meta Pixel, we revealed that the largest pharmacy in Sweden, state-owned Apoteket AB, for several years shared personally identifiable data and information about over-the-counter pharmacy purchases of approximately one million online customers with Meta.

We also exposed leaks by several other actors in the health sector.

When we asked Meta what happened with the data, they responded, “[O]ur systems are designed to remove potentially sensitive data”. By creating our own virtual, fake online pharmacy and a robot customer, we showed that Meta in fact, and contrary to their claim, stored such information.","As a direct consequence of the first part of our project, all actors mentioned in our stories reported their data breaches to the Swedish Data Protection Authority, removed or deactivated the Meta Pixel and initiated internal investigations.

The Swedish Data Protection Authority opened formal investigations into three pharmacy chains and the online health care provider Kry/Livi, which had shared, for example, e-mail addresses of patients and doctors with Meta. Kry told us that their data breach had affected an estimated 90,000 users across several European countries. All of the authority's investigations may or may not lead to fines under the GDPR.

We were also able to use the software we developed in the project to expose leaks from membership application forms of two political parties in Sweden.

In the second part of our project, we showed that Meta – despite filters, their own data policies and claims to notify advertisers who send them sensitive data – in fact stored information about medications, diagnoses and illnesses sent from our fake pharmacy via the Meta Pixel, contradicting their statements made to us. 

Our investigation was the first to test the robustness of Meta’s filtering systems for health data, raising questions such as which languages they had trained it to work on and whether it worked in Swedish at all.

“For sale: your health” was shortlisted for the 2022 edition of the Swedish Grand Prize for Journalism as Innovator of the Year.","We developed several tools. In 2021, we created a “first detection” tool in Python and Selenium to identify websites that share data with third parties. Essentially, it is a scanner that:

1. goes to a given website, 
2. stays there for a while, and then 
3. downloads, among other things, the network traffic between the browser and third parties.

In 2022, we added a function that automatically interacts with cookie boxes in multiple languages. If our scanner finds certain third parties in the network data it can, for example, determine if there is a high likelihood that the website shares personally identifiable data with Meta.

We also have a tool in Python that identifies personal data a website has shared with a third party. We built the first version of this tool in 2021, and in 2022, we added support to include metadata (about, for example, pharmacy products).

We built our fake pharmacy using Vue.js, and our robot customer using Python and Selenium. We manually compiled the sensitive data used in our pharmacy and by our robot. To analyze what Meta was doing with the data, we mapped API calls made within the Facebook Ads Management tool and found that one of them contained names of medications, types of diagnoses and more – stored on Meta’s servers. We regularly made requests to this endpoint, and could see that Meta repeatedly stored the same kind of sensitive information they had told us their systems remove.

After confronting Meta with our results, we noticed that employees at the company began visiting our pharmacy. When the company got back to us, they did not answer our questions (for example: can the filter detect sensitive health information in Swedish?) but emphasized the responsibility of the advertiser.","In 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that health apps were transferring sensitive health information to Facebook. Two years later, New York State investigators issued a report saying that Facebook had taken measures to block the collection of sensitive data. A central component was a filtering mechanism designed to prevent Facebook from storing sensitive health data. As far as we know, we are the first journalists to investigate how robust this filtering mechanism is.

Our reporting on the Meta Pixel began in 2021. In June of that year, we exposed leaks of user data (i.e. emails) from the websites of two Swedish banks. We believe this was the first time that journalists had reported on the contents of specific parameters (i.e. user emails) being transferred through the Pixel over the web (whereas the WSJ had looked at app traffic).

In early 2022, we began to investigate actors that handle sensitive health information, resulting in the revelations submitted here for your consideration. The first story, about a mental health charity passing on personal data submitted by users of its online forum, was published in early April. Among other things, Meta collected the users’ emails when they registered or logged in, at time including the “anonymous” nickname that the charity had auto-generated for each new forum user.

We then continued to publish stories in the investigative series “For sale: your health”.
A few weeks after our first story in the series, other outlets, including The Markup, began to report on US examples of sensitive data collected by Meta via the Meta Pixel. Those stories raised awareness of Meta's data gathering in the US, resulting in political scrutiny of the company’s practices and class-action lawsuits","Our investigations into personal data breaches via online tracking usually follow a pattern that has become almost too predictable:

**Step 1.** We tell the company/actor what they are doing.
**Step 2.** The company/actor denies this, and tell us that they cannot reproduce our results.
**Step 3.** We provide a step-by-step manual on how to verify our claims.
**Step 4.** The company/actor stop their transfers and report themselves to the data protection authority.
**Step 5.** The company claim they were completely unaware of the transfers.

All of this shows that even though the GDPR became law five years ago, companies and actors entrusted with sensitive data lack the tools and knowledge to survey their own handling of such data on their public platforms online. 

In addition, we believe that these types of breaches are generally under-reported by the media, yet of great public interest judging by our audience’s engagement with what we have published so far. In other words, finding and exposing data breaches and digging deep into what happens with the information once shared with a third party has proven an area ripe for exploration by investigative journalists.

For two years, we have asked Meta questions relating to what happens with data after they have received it. Their responses have seldom been clear-cut, and often lead to more questions that they either do not answer or answer with more ambiguity. This could often be where the investigation ends, unless you have sources from within the company. 

Our work shows that there is an alternative: sometimes you can use the tech company’s own products to investigate their claims when they refuse to answer your questions.",Swedish,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/ekot-byggde-fejkapotek-avslojar-hur-facebook-lagrat-kanslig-information?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/du-kopte-klamydiatest-apoteket-berattade-for-facebook?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/apoteket-delade-kunders-uppgifter-med-facebook-det-var-fel-vi-beklagar?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/kry-lanserade-saker-tjanst-lackte-till-facebook?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/efter-facebook-lackorna-myndighet-granskar-tre-apotek?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,https://sverigesradio-se.translate.goog/artikel/efter-ekots-avslojande-kry-ska-granskas-av-myndighet?_x_tr_sl=sv&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=sv&_x_tr_pto=wapp,,"Sascha Granberg, Sven Carlsson","Sascha Granberg works as an investigative data journalist at Sveriges Radio Ekot.

Besides the ecological damage, this pollution flows into dams supplying drinking water to citizens. Further, data shows drinking water fails to meet minimum standards in two thirds of all municipalities responsible for potable water supply, and many fail to provide any water for days, sometimes weeks at a time. Through a series of stories, we exposed this systemic national failure and its devastating effects.","The project had a series of significant impacts.

Our focus on sewage pollution and its impact on residents contributed to Cape Town’s new mayor, who was elected on 1 November 2022, declaring sewage pollution a top priority during his campaign. He removed the previous political head of water and sanitation in the city, and spent his first day in office visiting particularly egregious sites of pollution. The city now makes the results of its inland and coastal water quality tests public.

The nationwide Green Drop Report, which is a national regulatory audit of the country’s wastewater treatment, was resumed in 2021 after being halted in 2016. We believe these stories, and others which led up to these, may have had some influence.

The project had widespread distribution, as many of the stories were republished by some of the most respected news outlets in Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, Nigeria, The Gambia, Mali, and the United States. It earned professional recognition, being named one of the best investigative projects in sub-Saharan Africa for 2022 by the [GIJN](https://gijn.org/2022/12/08/2022s-best-investigative-stories-from-sub-saharan-africa/). 

Teamembers were invited to talk about the research at universities, conferences and debates. This included a successful application to speak at the continent-wide African Investigative Journalism Conference (AIJC) in Johannesburg, SA and the University of Lorraine in Metz, France, among others.

Finally, researchers, NGO’s, advocacy groups and other colleagues got inspired by our work and approached us for our methodology and data. Most notably, InfoNile, a non-profit cross-border group of data and geo journalists, contacted us to follow up on our investigation and methodology to cover the situation in the Nile River Basin.","* We used our [Wazimap NG](https://wazimap-ng.com/) platform to build an instance called [Water Wazi ZA](https://water-wazi-za.openup.org.za/), that showcases Effluent and Potable Water data.

These municipalities, predominantly managed by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) or a political coalition headed by the ANC - with the exception of Cape Town - are essentially dysfunctional and would either fail to respond to queries, or have no channels of communication with the media. In order to determine the causes of water and sanitation failure and gain insight into the state of sewage and water treatment plants, we often had to go outside of official channels and speak to workers and supervisors at the respective plants. This required gaining their trust, where possible, and protecting them as sources as they would lose their jobs for speaking to the media.

We also had to contact community activists or local opposition politicians in order to gain a better understanding of local water and sanitation issues. In order to speak to residents hardest hit by water and sanitation failure, we had to knock on doors in the poorest areas which, in the context of South Africa’s high crime rate was often a dangerous undertaking given these areas are known to suffer from high levels of crime within a country with the [third-highest global crime ranking](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/crime-rate-by-country).

Despite its importance, the need for hard data on water access and quality remains high to this day, even 13 years after the [United Nations declared](https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml#:~:text=On%2028%20July%202010%2C%20through,realisation%20of%20all%20human%20rights.) access to water and sanitation a universal human right. The lack of localized data makes it difficult to pinpoint problems within specific communities. This project is part of our long-term commitment to build a repository of water-related articles, where civil society actors can actively source and share accurate water-related information. We do that by creating an open platform that regularly monitors South Africa’s online news media for water-related articles.

For Open Up, the project represented the latest development in its ongoing work on Water Wazi, a tool that seeks to integrate various levels of demographic and water data. This year’s feature included geo-locating a series of water-related articles. Together, our team mines the data to identify noteworthy communities, locations, events, organizations and themes, and maintains an open water data repository to provide the public with reporting resources.

We want to be clear that we see this as a first example of how to build similar resources for this and other topics in other countries. In addition, we used the project as an opportunity to continue to deepen our presence in the metaverse. We are one of few journalism organizations in the world that has a metaverse designer as a core team member. She worked closely with the rest of the team to develop that innovative technology, distribution, and conversation space. This included using Google Street Map to create a truly immersive space that closely resembled physical conditions on the ground.","Across South Africa, there are weekly reports of water and sanitation failure in local and regional publications, but these often lack contextual reporting, and are reactive. By making journalists aware of the availability of national water and sanitation data which is granulated down to every sewage treatment works and water purification plant in the country, journalists can contextualize these failures both historically and within a broader geography. Journalists can also monitor water and sanitation performance in their town, city, or region and proactively report on the dangers to human health and ecology. Further, links between failure in sewage treatment and drinking water standards can be observed and investigated. 

The Water Data Repo is a project led by CCIJ in collaboration with OpenUp to address the data needs of journalists, activists, academics and technologists working on water-related projects in South Africa and beyond. We do that by creating an open platform that regularly monitors each South Africa’s online news media for water-related articles.

United States,"KHN, NPR, CBS News",Big,Shortlist,,"Diagnosis: Debt, from Noam Levey / KHN in partnership with NPR and CBS News",2022-06-16,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Podcast/radio, Crowdsourcing, Mobile App, Infographics, Map, Audio, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","More than 100 million people in America are saddled with medical bills they cannot pay. It was the first headline finding of KHN senior correspondent Noam N. Levey’s yearlong investigation into a staggering failure of U.S. health care: It systematically pushes patients into debt.
 
KHN’s **Diagnosis: Debt** project pulled back the curtain on this crisis, the true scale of which had been obscured even from many policymakers and medical practitioners. The investigation – in digital, audio and broadcast stories – exposed what is now an epidemic of medical debt that is now a defining feature of the nation’s health care system.","**Diagnosis: Debt** has catalyzed a growing national discussion about medical debt. KHN’s findings were cited prominently in a successful November ballot initiative in Arizona to expand patient protections. And federal regulators at the CFPB asked subjects from Levey’s story to provide public testimony about nursing homes suing friends and families of residents and then stepped up investigation of the industry’s debt collection practices. 

The stories prompted good Samaritans to come forward to help relieve the debts of people profiled by KHN, several of whom had their entire debt settled, KHN learned. In December, Aledade, a physician-led company that supports primary care providers, cited the project when it paid to help retire the debt of more than 85,000 patients in Louisiana and Mississippi. In the announcement, Aledade founder Dr. Farzad Mostashari called the series “a complete and utter indictment of the financial structures in our health care system.”

The project found a large and engaged readership. As a public service, KHN provides all of its coverage to any news outlet to re-publish. And hundreds of media outlets picked up our **Diagnosis: Debt** stories. The stories frequently appeared in the “Top Stories” in Apple News. Our coordinated social media posts with NPR garnered hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of comments. Key stories were translated for Spanish and Chinese audiences. 

Levey’s findings informed an episode of Tradeoffs, a health care podcast. A callout to readers pulled in hundreds more heart-wrenching stories, which we expect to inform further reporting this year.","The guiding imperative of **Diagnosis: Debt** was to bring to light the sacrifices of Americans victimized by a system that is supposed to take care of them. Building on hundreds of interviews with patients and families, KHN and our partners at NPR and CBS News gave voice to families forced from their homes, new parents driven to take on extra work, and retirees pushed to bankruptcy because of debt. They were people like Monica Reed, a Knoxville woman whose cancer left her with $10,000 in bills. “I just don’t buy a lot of food, just plain and simple” she said. Or Penelope Wingard, a North Carolina woman who could not book appointments when she fell behind on bills. “My hair hadn’t even grown back from chemo,” she said, “and I couldn’t see my oncologist.”
 
The project drew on a nationwide poll designed with KFF, new research into debt and hospital finances, and original investigations by KHN reporters. These included a review of thousands of court records to expose debt collection by nursing homes, an analysis of hospital contracts obtained through public records requests, and a yearlong examination of billing policies at hundreds of U.S. hospitals, many of whom resisted public disclosures.","One of the health systems – Atrium Health, a public hospital system based in Charlotte – threw up multiple barriers to our requests, bringing in an outside counsel and threatening that our records request would cost thousands of dollars to fulfill.

Our investigation of nursing homes that sue the friends and family of residents was based on a database KHN constructed from New York court records. Working over many months, Levey looked at four years of records in one New York county, searching for cases in which nursing homes in the county filed debt collection cases. Each case was entered into a database with key pieces of information, including the debt, who was sued, what allegation was made and how the case was resolved.

We also built a database with public records we obtained from public university hospital systems to analyze how these health systems were using a patient financing company. We entered data from several years’ worth of biweekly reports filed by the company that outlined which loan products patients were in at each hospital. We then analyzed this data to explore how growing numbers of patients were ending up in higher-interest loans the longer each hospital system used the financing company.

The largest database KHN created was built with information gathered about the financial assistance and collection policies of more than 500 hospitals nationwide. We looked at thousands of pages of hospital policies to find what standards hospitals were using to grant assistance and what kind of things hospitals would do to collect unpaid bills, such as suing patients or denying them care. Thousands of pieces of information were entered into the database and analyzed to better understand the prevalence of aggressive collection actions and the wide variation in hospital policies. The database also informed an online interactive map that allows readers to see information about each of the hospitals we researched.","Collecting and verifying the data in the project’s databases was extremely laborious and time consuming. While it relied on deep thinking and a lot of digging, the tools of the data work were not technically sophisticated. Asking the right questions and methodically organizing the answers can create powerful reporting tools.","English, primarily.

Mapbox: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/","Many public schools across the country fail to provide required support to homeless students, decreasing the odds of reaching graduation — and increasing the risk of long-term housing instability. Our analysis suggests that roughly 300,000 students are falling through the cracks of a system meant to help. As one district found, the right support makes a big difference in graduation rates. But federal funding for this work is so low that it doesn’t come close to covering the true cost.","Our investigation, launched in November, had an immediate impact.

U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees efforts on homelessness, [vowed to discuss undercounting with federal officials](https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/government-helping-homeless-students-mckinney-vento-funding/). Staff for U.S. Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska contacted superintendents in his district for answers after Public Integrity’s analysis showed likely undercounts there. And in December, Congress increased funding for homeless-student support by 13%.

A robust reporting collaboration also put information about the little-known and often-misunderstood requirements to serve homeless students in the hands of more people.

The Center for Public Integrity partnered with The Seattle Times, Street Sense Media and WAMU/DCist, each newsroom producing stories that made use of Public Integrity’s data analysis. 

We also made the data and other resources available to additional newsrooms pre-publication, part of an innovative national-local collaboration that included a detailed reporting kit and Zoom office hours for reporting help. 

All told, nine newsrooms produced stories with the data. 

The pieces were published in November and December. The potential for more impact is high. 

Both in interviews and the later follow-up by staff for a member of Congress, some school officials responsible for serving homeless students showed confusion about who should be identified and helped. The federal definition includes children doubled-up with friends or extended family out of economic need after losing their home, for instance. Our stories laid out who qualifies and what’s required.

The December funding increase is a start, but Congress could increase identification and improve support by putting more money toward the effort.


Meanwhile, enforcement of the law is weak. The federal and state departments of education could use a benchmark like ours to flag districts likely undercounting and investigate further. Michigan has guidelines for that.","We used federal education and census data, with acquisition and analysis in the R programming language. We used functions from packages that can be found on https://cran.r-project.org: 

* tidycensus
* tidyverse
* educationdata
* broom
* MASS
* DescTools
* optparse
* assertthat

Our analysis had to overcome a variety of difficulties. Districts that count zero homeless students are permitted to not report that number to the federal homeless enrollment dataset; they simply don’t appear in it. We created a dataset that adds the missing districts as long as they had actively enrolled students in a given school year.

We then had to gauge the consistency of homeless enrollment data. Education researchers and state departments of education often use eligibility for the National School Lunch Program as a benchmark: The state of Florida, for example, advises school districts that they should “consistently identify at least 5% of their [free- or reduced-price lunch] enrollment as homeless in a school year.” We derived this benchmark at the school district level using federal data and calculated correlations between the share of students who are homeless and the share of students who are eligible for free- or reduced-price lunch.

To address possible criticism of the limitation of using lunch eligibility as a proxy for poverty, we calculated correlations (using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient) to evaluate the relationship between homelessness and two other poverty variables. In addition, we calculated separate simple linear regressions in each state and school year. 

In nearly half of states, tallies of student homelessness bear no relationship with poverty, a sign of just how inconsistent the identification of kids with unstable housing can be.","This investigation breaks new ground: Despite reporting about undercounts of homeless students over the years, no media outlet has tried to quantify the gap nationwide. It was quickly apparent why.

Quantifying a lack of data – the serious undercounting of homeless students, blocking children and youth from needed help – was possible in this case. But it’s challenging, requiring a deep understanding of the context of what or who is being counted and the process of the count itself.

What it took for us: months of interviews and re-interviews, a lot of internal conversations about methods, then writing a white paper long before publication so experts could review and offer feedback. (We made the [white paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/141hZ3a6gYtBCT5IFk_dzkUklVw2zIcXr/view) public.)

Understanding how schools try to identify which of their students are homeless, as well as what support they provide to those they identified, should have been less challenging than the data – at least for gathering anecdotes. But this, too, was hard. 

Rarely were school officials eager to discuss this, even though we didn’t only reach out to districts whose numbers suggested they were doing a poor job at step one. Reporters persisted, both by increasing the number of districts contacted and by not giving up on ones we thought really needed to explain themselves.

This is also where national-local newsroom partnerships shine. At Public Integrity, we had the benefit of time to work through the kinks of the data and keep calling districts; the two reporters from our newsroom worked full time on the project for months. The Seattle Times, Street Sense and WAMU/DCist had the benefit of deep expertise in the context of homelessness in their regions, deep local sourcing and communities who know their reporting well.","Several of the lessons:

* Looking at the way homelessness intersects with something unrelated to housing, such as education, is a powerful way to see how the country ensures (or does not ensure) bedrock concepts like equal access.

* All datasets are missing information. You can potentially piece datasets together to fill in the blanks or create benchmarks to quantify the size of the gap. Additional detail regarding our analysis (including an extended discussion of our assumptions, statistical methods and results) is described in our white paper, linked above.

* Collaborative projects are more powerful than working alone. Reporters and other journalists at each of the partnering newsrooms brought ideas, sources and questions that made the project stronger.

* Housing insecurity is both traumatic and heavily stigmatized. Be especially mindful of that when interviewing sources who are currently experiencing or have experienced homelessness. Fully explain your story and aims. Affirmatively discuss with your source what they are comfortable having printed or aired. If you’re talking to a family, remember that some members might be OK with you naming them and others might not – or, for instance, a parent might be OK being named but not their child or children. Our investigation included a parent who decided, after mulling over it, that it was best not to name her son or show photos of him that showed his entire face. We made sure to accommodate that and – because this came up after the photos were taken – met with our design editor to figure out which should not be used.",English,https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/schools-fail-to-count-homeless-students/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/one-wa-school-district-helped-homeless-students-graduate-can-others/,https://dcist.com/story/22/11/16/dc-schools-homeless-students-mckinney-vento/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/housing-one-of-biggest-predictors-of-getting-kicked-out-of-wa-schools/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/wa-has-high-number-of-homeless-students-gets-lowest-federal-funding/,https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/government-helping-homeless-students-mckinney-vento-funding/,https://publicintegrity.org/education/unhoused-and-undercounted/grim-numbers-on-homeless-students/,"Reporters: Amy DiPierro and Corey Mitchell, Center for Public Integrity; Greg Kim and Anna Patrick, The Seattle Times; Amanda Michelle Gomez, WAMU/DCist; Kaela Roeder, Street Sense Media

Germany,Zeit Online,Big,Shortlist,,"Outer Space, our garbage dump",2022-10-18,"Explainer, Chart","Animation, Node.js","Space debris poses a threat to both satellites and future space missions. The littering of space with defunct satellites and old rockets has accelerated dramatically these last years, mainly due to space launches from the private sector, above all Elon Musk’s Starlink project. Experts warn that soon a chain reaction could unfold, where fragments from collisions make parts of Earth’s orbit dangerous to use. With the help of interactive storytelling and an exclusive data analysis, our project shows how big the problem already is, while also describing what is at stake and what could be done to improve the situation.","For the first time, we are making the entire extent of the space debris problem visible with this project. Comparable projects often only show actual satellites and not even the smallest pieces of space debris that have been created by collisions, for example. We therefore turned to the European Space Agency (ESA) and obtained the data set that ESA itself uses to produce its forecasts. It contains all space debris collisions of the past, as well as sophisticated simulations for the time evolution of the debris cloud.","For the transformation of Kepler to Euclidean coordinates, we used a slightly modified version of the ESA tools Orekit and Orekit Labs (for python bindings). Moreover, we developed a simple physical model for debris particles (ignoring e.g. atmospheric friction) in Orekit to simulate the particle orbits for short time spans. This was necessary to classify the particles according to their orbit types (GEO, LEO, and so on). Since the dataset contained several million rows, we additionally experimented for visualization with an aggregation of particles to a cubic space grid (density) using a self developed search algorithm.

For the representation of the collision, we used 3D models that corresponded to the actual satellites of the 2009 crash. The representation of the Earth in Lower Earth Orbit was realized using an HDRI file. The moving particles showing the distribution of the scrap metal were simulated using X-Particles. For the static satellites and scrap parts we placed light points at the correct position data of the satellites. Detailed 3D models and especially visualizations with hundreds of thousands of points, as used in this project, are much too large to download, let alone animate performantly on cell phones. Therefore, we rendered the data directly into the animation software Cinema 4D and Redshift. This video in turn was then saved in many thousands of frames and displayed on scroll events. This turned out to be the smoothest playback method - especially on older, less powerful smartphone devices.","The data is more accurate and complete than many publicly available catalogs of space debris, which often include positions only for objects that can be tracked by radar. However, this is not possible for debris less than ten centimeters in diameter. Here, only simulations of past collisions and explosions can estimate how much debris was created in each case and how it has spread in orbit over time. Esa uses a model called Master (Meteroid And Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference) for this purpose. In the dataset we used, more than 500 space debris events from the past were tracked and combined with data from measuring stations, according to Esa. The computational effort for this is considerable, but in the end a fairly accurate picture of the space debris situation emerges.

When working with large datasets it might be useful to have mathematical and computer science knowledge in the team, as we at ZEIT ONLINE do.","A topic is more nuanced than you might think at first glance, which can pose challenges when showing a visualization of your data. Many media reports about space debris paint a sort or caricature of the problem: A cloud of debris so thick that no rocket can pass through it anymore. In fact, this will probably never happen, as space is really really big. Still, debris is a problem, but more in the sense that it increases the risk from negligible to noticeable: Over time, more and more satellites (and space stations) will be hit by debris, causing them to fail, making spaceflight more expensive and unreliable. 
To the broad public, however, this will probably only become noticeable in a few decades, the experts we interviewed emphasized, while preventive action is required today. The problem is therefore reminiscent of climate change: We have to change our course of action now in order to avoid severe problems in the future.

This was a challenge when developing the visualization of the junk cloud we show in the first part of the story. We wanted it to a) give the right impression while b) still creating a strong visual effect. In the end, we decided to show just those objects from our data set that surpass a specific size, while discussing the balance between alarmism and the long winded nature of the problem openly our story.",German,https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2022-10/weltraumschrott-satelliten-raumfahrt-gefahr-forschung,,,,,,,"Paul Blickle, Robert Gast, Nicolás Pablo Grone, Andreas Loos, Axel Rudolph, Julius Tröger, Benja Zehr","Robert Gast is an astrophysicist turned journalist, he is the space reporter of ZEIT ONLINE.

Canada,CBC/Radio-Canada,Big,Shortlist,,Here's who lives in your city's worst heat islands,2022-07-13,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Environment, Health","D3.js, Three.js, Json, R, Node.js","As global warming increases the frequency and intensity of heat waves, knowing where heat islands are in our cities — and who lives in them — becomes a crucial public health issue. We used satellite imagery to pinpoint the areas with the hottest land surface temperatures across 17 Canadian metropolitan areas. Then, we overlayed the temperatures with the Canadian census data, showing that immigrants and people with low income are most likely to live in the hottest urban areas. As one expert told us, ""this is evidence that there is injustice in who will be more vulnerable to climate change.""","Altogether, this series garnered more than 700,000 page views. In ‘Here’s who lives in your city’s worst heat islands’, almost every reader typed in their postal code to get information about their neighbourhood. They also interacted with the chart arrows three times on average. User engagement was well above average for all pieces in the series. On top of the stories, we also published all of our analysis data and code, allowing anyone to review our work and reuse it. Shiab was contacted by the University of Calgary (Canada), McMaster University (Canada), Laval University (Canada), UQAM (Canada), the University of Waterloo (Canada), the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (UK), and Data journalisme Paris (France) to talk about the project.","First, we had to answer the question: Where are Canada’s urban heat islands and who lives in them?

To do this, senior data producer Naël Shiab and data scientist Isabelle Bouchard used satellite imagery to estimate land surface temperature in Canada’s biggest metropolitan areas. Land surface temperatures in metropolitan areas were estimated using Landsat 8 imagery. Three cloud-free images were selected for each metropolitan area from the summer months. The land surface temperature of each pixel was then calculated and averaged.

The project was looking at urban heat. So anything that didn’t fit that definition needed to be excluded. Natural Resources Canada’s 2015 land cover data was used to crop out lakes, rivers, fields and other non-urban areas. 

Various factors (highly reflective surface material, residual cloud, measurement errors, etc.) can create very high or very low land surface temperature. These outliers were also excluded for each metropolitan area.

The final stage involved overlaying Canadian census information. Because the 2021 census was not yet out, the analysis was based on 2016 data. Dissemination areas were used to ensure the smallest geographic unit of aggregation for variables like income and immigration status publicly available.

These steps were done with the R programming language.

For the dataviz, we used ThreeJS and custom shaders to create a high-performance visualization with more than 28,000 animated dots.","Reporter Jaela Bernstien also worked with the HealthyDesign.City program out of the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health to access then-unpublished maps that used census data and information about the way cities are built to illustrate where the most vulnerable populations live. 

Using this data allowed us to expand the project to look at access to shade and pinpoint neighbourhoods that would best tell the stories of those living in extreme heat.

The series was published in July 2022 in English and French. It combined data-driven storytelling, user personalization, illustrative and photojournalism techniques to engage audiences on topics from the national implications of urban heat to stories of those in sweltering apartments without AC.

The data also enhanced our ability to engage readers. In ‘Here's who lives in your city's worst heat islands,’ users can see how their neighbourhood compares to overall trends, before jumping into city and then national findings.

In 'Sweltering cities' and 'Cooling canopy,' mapping from HeathyDesign.City allowed us to explore areas of Vancouver and Montreal and visualize the difference between neighbourhood tree cover and, with it, access to cooling shade.","CBC/Radio-Canada wanted to show Canadians the growing dangers and existing inequalities when it comes to urban heat. We wanted to answer the question: Where are Canada’s urban heat islands and who lives in them?

We found that, in the space of a decade, corporate landlords had gone from owning nearly zero houses in North Carolina to owning more than 40,000. In Charlotte, these companies own one out of every four rental homes, putting pressure on would-be homeowners and tenants alike.

Our reporting revealed a business model designed to squeeze every drop of profit out of renters. And we demonstrated how both federal policy and state pension investments fueled the industry’s rise.","Until our project, there had never been an accurate count – much less precise geospatial data – on corporate ownership of single-family housing in any U.S. state.

Months of tedious data work allowed reporters to lift this veil of obscurity and answer critical questions for the first time, revealing stories about the single-family rental industry’s growth, its impact and the expanding number of people affected by it.

David Szakonyi, an assistant professor at George Washington University and co-founder of the Anti-Corruption Data Collective who reviewed our findings, called the project the “best exercise I’ve ever seen trying to identify properties owned by large institutional investments.”

Our reporting prompted swift reaction. A virtual town hall to answer reader questions attracted hundreds of live viewers. Raleigh’s mayor pro-tem [called for action](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/wake-county/article261036377.html) from the city council. Mecklenburg County officials [pledged half a million dollars](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article261634477.html) to study the problem and [pushed for federal action](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article264692029.html). Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., [entered our investigation into the Congressional record](https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article261378217.html) and announced that she was authoring related legislation. A national watchdog group cited our work [in a call](https://www.newsobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article268767412.html) to end state pension fund investments in the largest corporate landlord’s major private equity backer.

Because we published [our data and methodology](https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/security_for_sale), as well as [a toolkit for reporters](https://mcclatchy-southeast.github.io/sfr-toolkit/), newsrooms around the country could uncover the scale of corporate landlords in their backyards. Our work aided and inspired new and in-progress reporting in [California](https://www.sfchronicle.com/about/newsroomnews/article/Year-long-Chronicle-data-project-reveals-who-owns-17453051.php), [Kentucky](https://www.leoweekly.com/2022/08/a-corporate-landlords-takeover-spotlights-racial-inequities-and-displacement-fears-in-west-louisville/) and [New Jersey](https://www.app.com/in-depth/news/local/how-we-live/2022/08/25/nj-real-estate-housing-market-prices-investors-llc-newark-asbury-park/9793039002/); and Law360 used our toolkit [in a six-part series in Arizona](https://www.law360.com/articles/1541888?scroll=1&related=1).

Our reporting also prompted researchers to further study the impact of corporate landlords. Two, from Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania, are studying the rise of institutional investors in rental housing, and they’re basing their research in Charlotte largely because of what we revealed there.","Although there are just a handful of national corporations buying on a large scale across the state, they use a myriad of subsidiaries and holding companies to conduct business. There's also variation – misspellings, mixed punctuation and the like – in how these subsidiaries are recorded in property records, making simple counts and matching impossible.

We got around this problem by creating an expansive lookup table of more than 1,600 name variations that link back to just 22 companies.

We first cleaned and manually scoured property records to create a database of parent companies and their most common subsidiaries, which can often be connected by naming convention, corporate mailing address and company officials. We then used that list to create a machine learning model to find other name variations.

Data pulled from eviction proceedings, scraped from utility records and matched against corporate registration data from the nonprofit OpenCorporates was used to add more names.

Almost all subsidiaries identified by the N&O and Observer's reporting were matched – either with statistical software or manually – to corporate registrations filed with the N.C. Secretary of State's Office to verify their ties to specific parent companies.

We then used statistical software to match the list of investor subsidiaries with property owner names recorded by the North Carolina OneMap, a state project through the N.C. Geographic Information Coordinating Council to collect and publish property parcel information from all 100 counties in the state.

Data scraping, cleaning, matching and analysis was all completed in R and RStudio.

Our two main datasets – a lookup table of subsidiaries tied to parent companies and a table of more than 40,000 properties with corporate ownership and geospatial coordinates – were published via Git and GitHub alongside a detailed methodology and toolkit for reporters looking to replicate the work.","We started reporting this story in November 2021 after real estate sources told us that corporate landlords were upending Charlotte’s real estate market. We immediately began hearing stories about how these institutional investors, armed with piles of Wall Street cash, were hoovering up single-family homes, pricing out homebuyers and charging premium rent to tenants. We quickly found that their business model was designed to squeeze every drop of profit out of their houses, often to the detriment of tenants.

What we didn’t know was the scale of the industry in North Carolina. So we dove into data to identify the biggest corporate landlords and their most common subsidiaries, which we linked using naming conventions, corporate mailing addresses and company officials listed in business formation documents, along with other state filings. We used that list to create a machine learning model to find other name variations. We supplemented our list of subsidiaries and holding companies with data from other sources, including the UNC-Charlotte Urban Institute, MIT researchers, court eviction proceedings, state utility records and the nonprofit OpenCorporates. 

By unraveling the true ownership of hundreds of subsidiaries and holding companies, we identified the largest single-family landlords. With that, we used county-level and statewide property records databases to count how many homes these companies owned across North Carolina, a figure not previously known. We discovered that about 20 corporate landlords owned more than 40,000 houses in North Carolina, including a quarter of the rental homes in the Charlotte area.

Once we knew the scale, we wanted to decipher how these businesses work and affect people in our communities. Our reporting turned up neighborhoods where the companies owned a significant percentage of houses; first-time homebuyers without a hope of competing against Wall Street money; a new financial instrument created by these investment firms to rake in more money; and tenants living in filth because their landlords prioritized profits over people. We captured the industry’s origin story during the Great Recession by tracking changes on deeds from one local subdivision. That made plain how the federal government unleashed the industry by changing rules to allow investors to scoop up many foreclosed residential properties at one time. 

On May 1, we published the first installment of a three-day series called Security for Sale. In addition to all described above, we reported that local and state officials, despite receiving complaints, do nothing to constrain the industry. In fact, the state pension plan is an enabler, investing millions in the industry’s rental-backed securities. Other stories explained tenants’ rights and the fragility of local governments’ strategy of depending on homeowners associations to slow the industry’s growth. 

Transparency was at the core of this project. Upon publication, we made both our methodology and the data powering our investigation public to allow journalists, researchers and the public to investigate corporate homeownership themselves. We’ve also published a detailed toolkit with resources and walkthroughs to help journalists use our data and code to replicate our investigation for their own cities and states.","The rise of the single-family rental industry is not unique to North Carolina.

You’ll find these companies in almost every state, but their spread is concentrated most wherever there’s a competitive housing or rental market. That makes this story ideal for local reporters, who are best positioned to detail the impacts on their communities on the ground level.

Not all of the lessons learned during the Observer and N&O’s six months spent tracking and documenting large single-family rental companies in North Carolina will apply to every market. But because this industry has standardized the way it buys and manages homes across the country to increase its profit margins at scale, many techniques will be similar whether you’re covering Charlotte or Chula Vista, Raleigh or Richmond.

That’s why we built a toolkit for reporters, funded in part by the Pulitzer Center, for journalists with a variety of skill levels interested in probing the extent of corporate homeownership in their cities, regions and states.

The more we collectively understand how these corporate landlords are buying and operating in our communities, the better positioned we’ll be to ask important questions about their impact on homeownership – still the key path to wealth-building for American families.",English,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/topics/security-for-sale/,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article260732907.html,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article261064492.html,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article260743117.html,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article261378217.html,https://github.com/mcclatchy-southeast/security_for_sale,https://mcclatchy-southeast.github.io/sfr-toolkit/,"Tyler Dukes, Payton Guion, Gordon Rago, Cathy Clabby, Adam Bell, Sohail Al-Jamea, Rachel Handley, David Newcomb, Jeff Siner, Khadejeh Nikouyeh, Melissa Rodriguez, Travis Long, Julia Wall, Alex Slitz, Loumay Alesali, The' Pham and Scott Sharpe","Tyler Dukes is an investigative reporter at The News and Observer.

Ferramenta interativa, é possível clicar na ficha de cada município para saber detalhes sobre substâncias detectadas, além das principais classificações de risco sobre cada uma delas. A ferramenta destaca ainda um “alerta máximo” para os locais onde a mesma substância esteve acima da concentração máxima nos 3 anos analisados – segundo especialistas, os casos mais preocupantes são de contaminação contínua.","O interesse público pode ser comprovado pela audiência, republicação e impacto. Foram mais de 400 mil visualizações únicas no mapa e suas matérias apenas no site da Repórter Brasil, além de mais de 600 republicações e reportagens sobre o mapa em sites, canais de TV e estações de rádio – em mais de 20 casos, a reportagem foi consultada e contribuiu diretamente dando entrevistas e passando dados específicos de interesse local.
 
Como resultado direto da pressão provocada pela publicação do mapa, foram promovidas diversas audiências públicas, além de requisições de deputados federais, estaduais e vereadores que pediam providências aos órgãos responsáveis pela fiscalização da qualidade da água para consumo humano. Um destes apelos chegou ao Ministério da Justiça, que acionou o Instituto Nacional de Criminalística da Polícia Federal para refazer os passos da reportagem e periciar os dados do Sisagua.
 
Cinco meses após a publicação do mapa, 300 empresas de saneamento básico foram notificadas a apresentar um plano de adequação e convidadas a assinar um Termo de Ajustamento de Conduta. O problema foi identificado em mais de mil municípios. Em contato com o Ministério da Justiça, a reportagem obteve a confirmação de que a operação foi originada pela repercussão do Mapa da Água.","O trabalho foi feito em Google Colab Pro, para conseguir processar os arquivos do Sisagua, sistema de vigilância da água do Ministério da Saúde, que estão em CSV e cada ano tem mais de um milhão de linhas – cada linha é um teste feito em algum município do Brasil. No total, de 2018 a 2020, são 5.126.181 linhas. Foram analisadas todas essas linhas para criar as quatro novas colunas de avaliação, que indicam se o teste é Consistente ou Inconsistente e se está dentro ou acima do Valor Máximo Permitido para uma substância danosa à saúde.

Esse grande tratamento de dados, que foi feito com a orientação e regras do Ministério da Saúde, não pode ser feito em programas normais de planilha, que têm uma limitação de linhas para processamento. Usamos então a linguagem de programação Python 3, rodando no Google Colab com aumento de memória RAM.

Os scripts em Python usaram bibliotecas voltadas para ciência de dados e envolveu trabalhos de limpeza de dados, estatística, análise exploratória de dados e cruzamento de dados com informações geográficas do IBGE, para obter nomes oficiais dos municípios e a latitude e longitude de cada um.
 
Com um algoritmo de mais de 30 passos foi possível: processar milhões de dados; compreender quais testes da água eram realmente válidos, com padrões rígidos; entender quais municípios de fato têm testes válidos, e dentro destes saber quais mostram bons padrões de qualidade da água ou abaixo do permitido por órgãos de saúde pública; conseguir mostrar onde não havia informação - seja por falta de testes ou por terem um número excessivo de medições ineficazes; obter diversas estatísticas sobre municípios e suas respectivas substâncias maléficas para saúde, com informações geográficas, de cada substância e das empresas responsáveis pelo tratamento de água em cada cidade do país.","O Mapa da Água foi a primeira publicação jornalística brasileira que revelou a presença de substâncias químicas na água que sai da torneira em todo o país. Após mais de um ano de apuração, a reportagem entrou em contato com as maiores empresas de abastecimento do país, além das cidades onde os dados revelaram as piores violações, não encontramos casos de empresas ou órgãos de abastecimento que divulguem esses resultados. Sendo assim, chegamos à conclusão de que o Mapa é, hoje, a única ferramenta no país que dá acesso a esses dados de forma não codificada.

O maior esforço da nossa equipe foi o de traduzir uma informação que é disponibilizada de forma fragmenta e codificada. Para isso, foi preciso a colaboração entre jornalistas investigativos, jornalistas de dados, programadores, designers, um professor universitário de química e um técnico em saúde coletiva especialista no banco de dados em questão.

Além disso, como referência, usamos classificações dos órgãos reguladores mais reconhecidos para as substâncias encontradas na água: Organização Mundial da Saúde (International Agency for Research on Cancer), União Europeia, agência ambiental dos Estados Unidos (Environmental Protection Agency) e agências de regulação do Canadá e da Austrália. Todos os estudos e classificações utilizados estão linkados na descrição de cada substância, nas páginas dos municípios.

Depois do extenso trabalho de apuração e cruzamento dos dados, houve a etapa para traduzir as informações ao público geral. Com um conteúdo cheio de termos técnicos e científicos, a equipe teve a preocupação de construir textos simples e sem jargões. Cada palavra usada nas fichas e nos cabeçalhos foi testada entre especialistas e não especialistas para garantir que era tecnicamente correta e compreensível.

O mapa é uma versão ampliada e com metodologia aprimorada de um primeiro mapa focado na presença de agrotóxicos na água, publicado em 2019 (por usa vez, a primeira publicação dos dados de agrotóxicos na água de todo o país). Importante ressaltar que os dados do Sisagua passaram a ser publicados no portal de transparência do governo federal após solicitação de nossa equipe em 2018. Mesmo assim, trata-se de um banco complexo e inacessível para o público não especializado.

Além dos dados por município, o Mapa da Água traz ainda uma série de reportagens que desfiam os resultados e avançam a investigação em diferentes contextos. Revelamos que o maior problema entre as substâncias químicas acima do limite são justamente aquelas derivadas do tratamento da água. E descobrimos a sua origem: falta de tratamento do esgoto. Justamente porque a água chega para o tratamento misturada ao esgoto, as empresas usam mais produtos para desinfecção, aumentando assim a presença de substâncias perigosas à saúde humana. A página do mapa traz um menu com as principais descobertas feitas pela nossa equipe, publicações que continuam sendo produzidas.","Outros jornalistas podem aprender de diferentes formas com este projeto. A primeira é utilizando as informações do próprio Mapa da Água. Eles podem analisar os dados que estão na plataforma para produzir novas reportagens com abordagem regionais ou até municpais para passar mais informações sobre a qualidade da água para a população. Além disso, eles podem entender quais são as susbtâncias que são analisadas, seus riscos e até onde encontrar essas informações com base científicas.

Poor oversight by the authorities prevents the final destination of this waste from being known.","It helped the public to know, to understand and measure the problem of plastic waste importations.

The most complex part of the development however was on the data analysis and data explorer. We had to query a private registry of global shipping entries. Then proceeded to analyze the resulting datasets with various tools ranging from excel sheets to more advanced tools like pandas, NumPy and others. The final dataset was comprised of 59110 entries. 

We didn't want to just present the data as a table or some charts. We wanted the user to explore each entry individually. After looking for alternatives, we found inspiration for our data explorer in Flavio Gortana's Coin museum. The making of the data explorer was challenging. We decided against other data oriented toolsets as D3.js performance concerns. Just like the coin museum, our data explorer uses Pixi.js which is a 2d WebGl renderer. This means we had to code the whole thing from scratch e.g. the positions of each data-point, their animations, mouse interactions, etc. 

We tried to offset most of the heavy calculations from the browser by calculating positions, categories, and the circle-area chart data ahead of time using Pandas and NumPy. During this step we also cleaned the datasets and translated them to spanish using a meta-translator available for python.

As for the graphical assets, we used both StableDiffusionV1-4 and MidJourney for image generation. We used MidJourney to generate representative images of each country filled with pollution. This was an interesting process that was not as straight forward as we initially thought it'd be. As for StableDiffusion we ran the AI in our machines to generate a collection of 996 different landscapes of a future filled with trash and pollution. We used this gallery to illustrate each data point in our data explorer.","For six months, more than 100,000 shipments registered on an international trade platform were reviewed. This analysis had to be done one by one, since it includes the information that each exporter registers and is not standardized. In the end, we only used half of the information, since there were containers that included other materials, which made it almost impossible to determine how many kilos corresponded to plastics. But that review allowed us to see the large amount of garbage that enters our countries. Another problem is that governments do not provide information in such detail and tend to report fewer kilos. And the companies, not being obliged to provide this information publicly, simply did not provide it, nor did they respond to our interview requests.","In this work we combine the use of technologies, but we also resorted to a data-by-data review carried out by two people, which helped us to have a complete picture.
We also believe that it is important to look at these practices that are harmful to the environment and health.","Spanish, English",https://ojo-publico.com/especiales/latin-america-the-repository-for-other-peoples-garbage/,https://open.spotify.com/episode/0uQQf0SOnUOR6wD56EfNZf?si=ae7c98d053ee4dbb,,,,,,"Kennia Velázquez, Mónica Cerbón, Iván Ruiz, Nelly Luna, Nicolás Aranda, Miguel Cabrera, Marco Garro, Juan José López Plascencia, Emilio Jiménez","This work was led by OjoPúblico, one of the most recognized media outlets in Latin America, in alliance with the Public Opinion and Journalism Laboratory (Poplab.mx), a media outlet with barely 3 years of existence located in Guanajuato, Mexico made up of 15 people.

Nigeria,Premium Times,Big,Participant,,"Facing High Wheat Prices, Nigerian Bakers Turn to Potato Puree",2022-07-14,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Video, Business, Agriculture, Health, Economy",Microsoft Excel,"The story is the fruit of months of intense research, interviews and studies about how Nigerian bakers are adopting the puree from a new breed of potato called orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) in bread-making as a cheap, timely intervention in mitigating steep costs of baking materials. The development is coming at a time food inflation is hitting record highs and the costs of wheat are forcing many bakeries to shut down.
That is compelling bakers to improvise various foods from the nutrition-dense spud that is making affordable innovative food products available to low-income Nigerian households.","The report is having a far-reaching impact in combating food insecurity in Nigeria, which spends the largest part of its annual food import bill on wheat. Maryann Okoli, who runs the bakery that produces the most OFSP bread in Nigeria and who was the main baker that was interviewed for the reporting project, said she was inundated with calls from all over Nigeria after the report was published. Bakers grappling with steep costs of baking materials contacted her and requested she arrange training sessions for them where they could learn several foods that could be innovated from OFSP puree. Okoli, through her training sessions, is helping create awareness of the health benefits of the potato and its products, the impact that could have in boosting profitability in the baking/confectionery business and how innovations in the OFSP value chain could help keep bakers in business at a time a good number of them are going under. Within weeks of publishing the report, BBC Africa contacted us at PREMIUM TIMES, asking us to link them up with Okoli with a view to doing a documentary on her OFSP bread and her other efforts in enhancing the potato's value addition. She later said the BBC was firming up plans to produce the documentary.
Schools in Nigeria are including both OFSP bread and porridge made from the potato in their school feeding programmes in an effort to provide affordable nutrition to pupils.
World-renowned economist and Johns Hopkins University scholar Professor Steve Hanke shared and referenced the story on Twitter while making commentary on inflation in Ghana.

We analysed 300 cases, numbering about 5,000 pages, of the 900 published by the court and extracted details about each of the applicants and their reasons for seeking upward mobility in Canada.

Using pivot table and other excel commands we were able to determine the reasons the immigrants are giving. We categorised them into thirteen.

Majority of the applicants said they were driven because of the persecution related to sexual orientation and religious and political persecution.","The story tapped government officials on the enormity of the efforts that must be put in place to make Nigeria safer for all class of people as well those in the diaspora.

In its first week of publication, the story reached over 50,000 readers, the most read for the week of publication on Premium Times website.

It triggered reactions among Nigerians, especially on Twitter, with dozens of users sharing it on their accounts with over a million of cumulative followers.

Many of these said they've been educated (https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=Canada%20Rush%20premiumtimesng.com&src=typed_query&f=top) and would make informed decisions when seeking refuge abroad. 

Likewise, the story picked the interests of Reaching Out Assisting Refugees (ROAR), a Vancouver Island community group working to resettle LGBTQ refugees.

Likewise, we got reaction from journalists colleagues who said they were impressed by the efforts put into the story, with some saying they were inspired to tell more of such important stories.

The story was awarded best story in the online category of this year's Migration Reporter Competition organized by the United Nations International Organisation for Migration. 

It was also adjudged as Premium Times story of the week and month it was published, and now in running for the newspaper's story of the year.","Adobe Acrobat Pro

We used Adobe Acrobat Pro's “Combine Files into PDF” function to select multiple the PDFs for one volume, combined them, then saved the file.

For the ones the command didn't download, we downloaded them manually. 

Based on the website's random selection of cases, we were able to analyse 300 cases, which was about 5,000 pages, of the 900 published by the court.

Reading the cases one after the other, we extracted details about each of the applicants and their reasons for seeking upward mobility in The Great North White.

Having extracted the data, which were entered into an excel sheet, we analysed it using pivot table.

After that we categorised the reasons the immigrants gave into thirteen. 

Majority of the applicants said they were driven because of the persecution related to sexual orientation and religious and political persecution. 

Our analysis showed that majority of the applicants were dismissed largely because authorities said their stories were not convincing and they had internal flight alternatives where they could relocate to within Nigeria if where they stayed was unsafe.

We used Venngage to visualise our findings as well as the existing data we used in spicing up the story.","The story was told from start to finish by two journalists with barely one year of data journalism experience. But what we lacked in experience they made up for in determination and willingness to learn. 

Despite having limited data analysis training, we self-tutored ourselves using online materials to analyse the large trove of data we collated.

The data on the rate of migrations of Nigerians to Canada was the first ever collated, analysed and published by a Nigerian media. It was also the first primary data on the subject published in the country — the other available one is a survey. 

Likewise, the editorial process of this project had diversity in mind. Apart from the two journalists who worked on the story, one of us a conservative and the other a liberal, the two editors who worked on the story mirrored similar ideological leanings.

Likewise, the characters in the story were diverse. They included both men and women with an expert slicing through the character's statement and making meaning of their applications.","Journalists colleagues can learn the art of data storytelling and how to weave a prose from a bulky data chunk.

Also is teamwork. A team doesn't have to be a dozen. Two can make all the big difference — as this project has shown. It requires a strategy and willingness to press on even when there are reasons to stop.

This project has also demonstrated that you don't have to wait for officials or firms to publish data — you can generate yours! If we had written the Canadian court or embassy, we might have had delays or never have gotten anything.

* PDF2Text
* Tabula
* Adobe Acrobat Pro","“The Price Kids Pay” is the broadest look at school-based ticketing in the United States, documenting roughly 12,000 tickets issued to students over three years as officials exploited a loophole in Illinois law to punish children. Instead of fining students directly, which is banned, schools referred students to police, who issued tickets for violating local ordinances.

The team built a [first-of-its-kind database](https://projects.propublica.org/illinois-school-police-tickets-fines/) for public use.

Ticketing, reporters determined, was often disproportionately applied to Black students. And reporters identified dozens of districts that had broken a state law that explicitly prohibits schools from referring students to be ticketed for truancy.","“The Price Kids Pay” had swift and powerful impact. Hours after the investigation’s first story was published, the state superintendent told schools to stop ticketing students. The next day, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker vowed to make changes to prevent further harm to students.

State lawmakers pledged to revisit the legislation that had tried — and failed — to prevent students from being fined at school. [The Illinois attorney general later launched an investigation](https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-will-investigate-possible-civil-rights-violations-in-student-ticketing) into whether the state’s largest high school district had violated students’ civil rights in issuing hundreds of tickets. Officials had noticed that the district stood out in the database that ProPublica and the Tribune built and published, both for the number of tickets issued there and for racial disparities. And [the Illinois comptroller said her office](https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-school-discipline-ticket-debt-collection) would ban local governments from using a state program to collect debt from students who were ticketed for truancy.

Some school district officials were shocked to learn how commonplace the ticketing of students had become in their high schools — and how costly the practice was for many families. Some vowed immediate changes.

Finally, some municipalities reduced the fines associated with violations of local ordinances. One severed ties with a hearing officer after reporters detailed his caustic, dismissive treatment of ticketed students.

Another story that prompted change exposed how employees at a school for students with behavioral disabilities frequently called police — and sought students’ arrest — for misbehavior. After receiving reporters’ questions, the state board of education conducted an on-site visit at the Garrison School, confirmed an overreliance on police and plans to require intensive training.

Newsrooms across the state, including at least one high school newspaper, used the data reporters had collected to publish their own stories about ticketing.","The only way to comprehensively investigate school-based ticketing was for the Tribune and ProPublica to build a first-of-its kind database based on the records obtained through FOIA. 

Reporters designed the database so they could not only log and analyze the data but present the information to the public in an interactive format. Some data was processed using optical character recognition tools including Tabula and PDF2Text for the command line, and Excel and Google Refine were used for some cleaning tasks.

The sources of the data were records from more than 500 school districts and police departments as well as municipalities that set the fines and penalties for tickets — thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of spreadsheets and even copies of actual tickets that officers had written.
 
Reporters used data points from those records to document more than 11,800 tickets issued by police in 141 school districts during three school years. In addition to logging the number of tickets issued by each police department at each school examined, reporters documented the reasons tickets had been issued, how the tickets are adjudicated in each community, fines and fees, and whether the community attempts to collect unpaid juvenile debts.

Reporters built a second database to allow analysis of the race of ticketed students. This information also was incorporated into the interactive online tool that was published with the investigation.

Data analysis was conducted using R.

To verify the accuracy of reporters’ data collection, ProPublica data staff took a sample of reporters’ database entries and compared them to the original records. The results of the reporters’ analysis and descriptions of the data findings in the stories were fact-checked by ProPublica data reporters.","Reporters confronted challenges in obtaining information from more than 500 different sources. Many local agencies cited juvenile privacy laws as a reason to withhold even de-identified records, and the team successfully challenged those claims.

In creating the database, reporters often had to go through handwritten records to determine whether a ticket was issued at a school and then log the relevant data points. Some agencies had separate, antiquated systems for recording information about where tickets were issued, the types of tickets issued and the fines imposed. Reporters had to match up those records by hand to identify school-based tickets and related information.

Reporters also felt it was important to examine the race of students who were ticketed. Many agencies did not record that information, but when it was available reporters documented it in a separate database. That process often involved standardizing the many ways police officers had described a person’s race when documenting the citation. In addition, because race was included less frequently, reporters had to consider the best way to draw meaningful, but not overstated, conclusions from a smaller set of data. After consulting with a well-known researcher who studies race and discipline, reporters excluded from the racial-disparities analysis schools where tickets were rare and those where race information was missing for more than 25% of tickets. That way, schools that were outliers would not unduly influence the analysis. 

To identify potential racial disparities in ticketing, reporters calculated the total enrollment for the schools in the database, as well as the total enrollment for various racial groups. They then calculated how many tickets were issued for each racial group and compared those rates to those groups’ share of total enrollment, leading to powerful findings about race and ticketing at school. 

Finally, there were challenges in reporting on the ticket hearings and on the consequences of ticketing.

Illinois does not have municipal courts, and each city or town can decide how and where to adjudicate police citations. The dates and times of the hearings are often not made public, and they operate with little to no scrutiny. It is rare for attorneys, advocates, journalists or any other observers to attend. When some officials tried to eject reporters from the hearings on privacy grounds, reporters successfully argued that those laws did not apply to hearings on local ordinance violations. The news organizations’ attorneys got involved in several instances and argued that the reporters had a right to be there. Reporters ultimately attended about 50 hearings across the state, observing hundreds of cases and traveling thousands of miles.","With a project rooted in hundreds of FOIA requests, a tracking system is crucial. Reporters created a database to log each request filed, the date it was due and whether the records were provided. 

Journalists don’t have to take no for an answer. In cases where agencies denied records requests, reporters negotiated to obtain records that, while incomplete, were still valuable to the investigation. 

The data itself is not enough; it is a starting point. Reporters showed up all across the state of Illinois to learn about ordinance violation hearings that previously received no scrutiny. They cultivated sources and met families affected by school-based ticketing. At one branch court, sheriff’s deputies said they hadn’t had a reporter attend a hearing in at least eight years. 

It’s important to be open to sharing your reporting process and methods with others, including the subjects of your stories and the public.

United States,Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism,Small,Participant,,Duterte's freedom of information is not so free,2022-05-03,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Chart, Politics","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, Python",I scraped the Philippines' freedom of information portal to assess how many of the requests are being granted or denied under former president Rodrigo Duterte. The story contains my findings and reporting.,"The project was published by PCIJ in time for World Press Freedom Day at the time. One of our findings showed how the FOI website became an avenue for people to ask for cash assistance at the height of pandemic lockdowns. It shed light to what was already anecdotally known fact that people were using the website to ask for assistance at the time, which was being scrutinized by congress.","This is originally a class project for Columbia which I submitted to PCIJ. I scraped the Philippines freedom of information website to collect FOI requests filed online. The scraper still runs every three days and still fetching new data. 

These data are collected and compiled with CSVs from the government showing requests from the FOI website since its inception in September 2016 to 2021. To date, around 120,000 FOI requests are in the database, and still counting. The story itself only covers FOI requests from September 2016 to April 2022.

I then analyzed the entries using pandas and created visualization through Adobe Creative Suite.","For decades, journalists, academicians and other civil society groups have called for a freedom of information (FOI) law in the Philippines, yet Congress has failed to act on them. When then president Rodrigo Duterte entered office in 2016, one of his first acts was to issue an Executive Order (EO) to establish FOI in the Executive branch, supposedly as an answer to rampant calls for transparency in government. Under this order, the FOI website was established as one-stop shop to file FOI requests to various agencies.

But while the EO was a welcome development, our report showed that many of the requests were being denied or not being acted upon. Most interestingly, controversial requests like data on war on drugs, infrastructure project contracts are being rejected. Corruption is pervasive in the Philippines and for many years, FOI was seen as a way to shed light on government dealings yet Duterte's FOI seemed to have failed on this front. 

For all the controversies that hounded his administration, from the drug war to shutting down the Philippines' biggest media network, Duterte takes pride on institutionalizing FOI during his term and used that as a shield to critics who said his government didn't respect freedom of speech or lack transparency. Our findings show that his defense using the FOI is flimsy at best. 

I did this project as a student in Columbia and while in school in New York. I scraped the website and analyzed the results using pandas. I scheduled interviews with key people from back home and talked to them via Zoom, following my findings. 

One constraint was the FOI website. It's supposed to contain all entries since 2016, but when I tried scraping, the scraper stops at a dead end at some point. I was told by the FOI management that they are pulling down old requests from the site because it tends to be heavy to load. I ended up just scraping entries for this year and using the CSV file they provided containing entries from 2016 to 2021.","This is the first journalistic piece that clearly and methodically assessed how the freedom of information regime in the Philippines has been faring under Duterte. 

Before the story was published by PCIJ, the repo for this project is already on Github. On April 2022, a journalism student from the University of the Philippines reached out to me via email asking if she could use my FOI scraper to assist her undergraduate thesis (see attachment please). I immediately obliged. The code for this is available publicly and the scraper is still running. The CSV file containing all entries is also available for download. This just goes to show that this can beneficial not only for journalists themselves, but even for scholars.

United Kingdom,Carbon Brief,Small,Participant,,Analysis: How UK newspapers changed their minds about climate change,2022-04-12,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Politics, Environment","Animation, Scraping, JQuery, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","In April 2022, Carbon Brief produced an analysis looking at the past decade of editorials in UK newspapers that discuss relevant topics about climate change. 

Drawing from Carbon Brief’s database of more than 1,300 editorials, which are the formal “voice” of a newspaper, this work examines how the language used to describe human-caused climate change, as well as renewables, fracking and nuclear power, has shifted since 2011. 

The interactive article features multiple data visualisations, evidencing the shift in sentiment over time, and includes animations, video and other inline designs.","This analysis marked an important era in climate change in the national press, published soon after COP26 Glasgow, 2021. Media coverage of climate change was at its peak, and the previous decade had seen a seismic shift in attitudes within the editorials of many major newspapers, from climate scepticism and anti-renewables, to the green recovery and net-zero targets. 

The COP26 President Alok Sharma, tweeted “Interesting analysis from @CarbonBrief about the evolving attitude of UK newspapers to tackling #climatechange”. In a keynote address at the Society of Editors conference 2022, Sharma went on to say: “Analysis by Carbon Brief…shows that the number of editorials in UK newspapers calling for more action to tackle climate change has quadrupled in three years…”. The international climate finance lead for COP26 Camilla Born, described it as “...a fascinating read…”.

Journalists shared the piece with their audiences too. Chief lead writer at the Times, Simon Nixon, tweeted: “Interesting analysis of shifting UK newspaper editorial attitudes towards climate change. Also pleasing to see newspaper leading articles being treated with the seriousness that they unquestionably deserve”. Other reporters from the Washington Post and the Independent also praised the work. Press Gazette wrote up the piece. 

The story, combined with the database that serves the analysis, has been viewed over 20,000 times since publication. The database has subsequently gained a Google page position of ~4, resulting in an increase of people able to find and search through 1000’s of climate editorials.","Carbon Brief has been running its editorial database since April 2016, capturing leading articles in the UK press on matters relating to energy and climate change.

Prior to this analysis, the database was based on monitoring UK newspaper coverage for the Carbon Brief Daily Briefing newsletter, which is released every weekday morning. This is maintained using a collection of RSS feeds to monitor global climate and energy coverage, supported by Factiva and PressReader to allow Carbon Brief staff to track UK editorials. For the purpose of the analysis, the database was expanded for the years 2011-2021 with more detailed Factiva searches. In total, Carbon Brief identified 1,364 editorials relating to climate or energy, of which 711 were used for the climate change analysis and 653 for the energy sources analysis. Some editorials were assessed for both analyses.

The content analysis informs the charts within the piece, which are built with the Javascript library Highcharts. We designed a custom webpage with many scroll event triggers, which allow readers to analyse the data whilst reading through the article. 

The look of the article is based on the halftone print effect of newspaper print, which is incorporated throughout the piece in the charts, video thumbnails and text highlights. We added a ‘ragout’ effect to the screenshots of text to give them a torn-paper look, and created animations of some examples of the newspapers in the database. 

We also made the database available by building an interactive table, using the Datatables Javascript library. The database is an ongoing archive of UK editorials on climate change, which can be searched, filtered and links through to the original article.","Carbon Brief worked with Sylvia Hayes, a PhD researcher at the University of Exeter who specialises in climate change communication in the news media, to undertake a qualitative content analysis of the editorial database. This was the first time we worked with an external researcher in this manner. 

Hayes created a coding schema (a framework for categorising and quantifying different themes present in the text) to rigorously assess the language and themes used in editorials concerning climate change and three energy technologies in UK editorials. Her codebook includes details of the precise methodology used and links to scientific literature that helped guide its creation, which we link to within the article. 

We also sought expertise and guidance from Dr James Painter, Research Associate at the Reuters Institute, Dr Saffron O’Neill, Associate Professor in Geography at University of Exeter and Dr Travis Coan, Associate Professor in Computational Social Science at University of Exeter.","The analysis highlights the unique type of reporting that comes from an extensive collection of data over a sustained period of time. The original purpose of maintaining a database of climate editorials was for the benefit of the Carbon Brief team, and for readers to explore via a simple spreadsheet. The database continued to grow through other outputs, such as the morning email sent to subscribers of the Carbon Brief newsletter, which summarises the past 24 hours of climate and energy news coverage from around the world. The public database currently includes 1,778 editorials. 

This database has become an essential resource for the Carbon Brief team and other journalists interested in how papers and other journalists have framed climate debates over the past decade. The database includes links to the online versions of the editorials, but also long quotes from the pieces, which is useful should the original sources be removed or change location. 

It was essential to work with a researcher in the field of climate communication, in order to develop a codebook to do the sentiment analysis of the final dataset. Once the analysis was finalised, the writers could work with the multimedia and digital teams to build a custom webpage to create an interactive ‘scrolly’, and lead the reader through the findings. Collaboration was key to this project to grow from an internal spreadsheet to the final feature.

The outcome is a truly original piece of reporting, considering no other news organisations would have this rich dataset to hand.",English,https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/how-uk-newspapers-changed-minds-climate-change/,https://www.carbonbrief.org/editorials-where-uk-newspapers-stand-on-climate-change-and-energy/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onmEj29BgAmXFuRWo5uoyHq_dBZw_Yi-/edit,https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/newspapers-climate-action-surge-2019/,https://www.public-sector.co.uk/article/27aa931a60004d81eeb434a13e69d746,,,"Josh Gabbatiss, Sylvia Hayes, Tom Prater, Joe Goodman","Carbon Brief is a UK-based website covering the latest developments in climate science, climate policy and energy policy.

At this commemorative time, through this project, we review the historical changes in the Okinawa Islands since the 14th century. Being part of the First Island Chain, from the emergence of an independent country to the development of belonging to different countries, Okinawa Islands have passively accepted the fate arranged by others in the past 500 years.","Similar to Okinawa Islands, Taiwan is part of the First Island Chain. Both have a close relationship and many exchanges in history. In addition, as tensions rise in the Pacific region with the growth of China and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Okinawans are concerned that they might once more end up on the front lines. By introducing the fate of the Okinawa Islands over the past 500 years, we aim to inspire Taiwanese readers to reflect on the future of Taiwan.","We use Svelte to build the wireframe to save production time.

United Kingdom,Nightingale Magazine - The Journal of the data visulisation society.,Small,Participant,,Inspiring a Movement: The Warming Stripes,2022-12-01,"Infographics, Chart, Environment, Culture","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Flourish","A visualisation evaluating the global impact of The Warming Stripes graphic by climate scientist Ed Hawkins. The visualisation assesses how Hawkins’ graphic has grown in popularity over time and has been used as a visual symbol for the climate movement, with stripes appearing on a vast collection of items across the world. Google Trends data was used to track search interest for terms related to the Warming Stripes, with more than 80 notable uses identified and analysed to reveal trends, patterns and connections. Shown in the finished product is a timeline of search term popularity, interest by country and categorisation.","Claire Santoro and I were asked to collaborate on this project which would be featured within the Nightingale magazine and the response so far has been overwhelmingly positive. The Nightingale magazine was born out of the data visualisation society which is a non-profit organisation that supports the growth, refinement, and the expansion of data visualisation knowledge regardless of expertise level. It has a following of over 236.6k across LinkedIn, Twitter and instagram.

The magazine is being distributed currently (December 2022) so the impact of the audience isn't visible yet however the anticipation on twitter after the release of the first issue is exciting. 

Because the data visualisation and article theme covers climate data and global warming activism, the hope would be that it continues to spur people on in using the Warming Stripes as a symbol for change. 

My hope is that after viewing the data visualisation, readers realises how powerful the unique Warming Stripes graph can be and how it can have such global impact on society despite breaking all the traditional graph rules (no axis, no labels etc) with the aim to inspire others to follow suit.","The tools, techniques and technologies used to create the final data visualisation started by interviewing Ed Hawkins with Clare Santoro who was writing an accompanying article. This enabled us to hear first hand the rational behind why he created the Warming Stripes in the first place and to hear his take on the global impact it’s had already.

After the interview I scraped the internet to find and document every possible item that used the Warming Stripes graphic. Items were recorded in Google Sheets alongside the publishing date, location, category, creator/company, total social media following and reference links. 

After this process, I cleaned my spreadsheet, analysed the data and started to sketch possible layouts and graphs in my sketchbook. This progressed to playing around with wireframes in Adobe Illustrator. Once I knew the structure of the graph needed, I used Flourish, an online data visualisation tool, to create an SVG of the main timeline graph which I then manipulated back in Adobe Illustrator.

Designs and tweaks were completed in Illustrator and after proof checking with copy editors and Nightingale art director, Julie, print proofs were sent back for final checks before sending off to print.","In regards to contextual restraints and difficulties, the data of each item was not readily available or documented and so scraping and sorting the data was a challenge. 80 notable items were identified but this list is not indefinite, with the challenge then to quantify the impact of each item arose. How can you measure something without a numerical metric? How can you document the size of an item when you aren’t to know all the possible online locations for said item? To overcome this we found a common metric to use across all items: total social media following from the creator or company. This gave us a steady and consistent dataset to compare and work from.

Creating such a dense visualisation that was still legible for print was highly challenging but an exciting one to work with. Knowing what to keep in the visualisation vs adding something in as copy within the article was a challenge but enabled a refined and strong body of work.","The hope would be that other journalists can learn the power of data visulisation for the advocay of the planet.

Netherlands,RTL Nieuws,Big,Participant,,The Underworld Map: mapping vulnerability to criminal subversion,2022-12-08,"Investigation, Map, Corruption, Money-laundering, Crime","Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, Python","""Drug crime is internationalizing, getting more violent and involving billions of euros. That money is taking hold of our society. It is one of the major problems of our time"", says criminologist Henk Ferwerda.

Governments are allocating funds to tackle subversive crime. But it is a problem that remains largely invisible. For example, drug money is laundered through shady shops or by recruiting vulnerable youths at schools.

RTL Nieuws created The Underworld Map to address a problem most people do not see. Journalists developed a model to measure the vulnerability of residents, businesses and municipalities, thus making the invisible visible.","Our research was hot news for over a week. We produced several online articles based on the outcomes and specific phenomena we found. Most of these also led to items on television, even on prime time for a public of over one million viewers. Our articles and maps online have been read and viewed by more than 750,000 visitors.

Our investigation led to several questions from members of the House of Representatives, who wanted to know how Minister of Justice and Security Dilan Yesilgöz will tackle the problems outlined earlier. The minister herself also responded to the inquiry and stated that the investigation makes it clear that criminal subversion takes place all over the country and is often closer to home than many people think.

In addition, many experts and policy makers from Dutch provinces and municipalities have asked us to work with the results on a local level. Many local and regional journalists have also used our research to write regionally specific articles based on the outcomes.

We also recieved lots of compliments from other media outlets. A colleague on LinkedIn wrote that investigative journalism 'has been taken to a higher level' thanks to our research.","We used common tools like Excel and R to collect, merge and clean the data. During our research (which took about six months), we frequently spoke to experts in the field to verify data sources and check whether the data were usable. The most difficult part of the research was creating a model that measured something that had never been measured before, and is often invisible and elusive. Therefore, our contact with experts in criminology as well as data science was extremely important. Thanks to their help, we have been able to develop an innovative, tailor-made method.","With the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp around the corner, the Netherlands are one of the largest drug transit countries in the world. Because of the excellent infrastructure and moderately lenient drug policy, internationally operating drug criminals know where to go. The concerns about this development are great, especially when it comes to the extent in which this affects Dutch society. But this is a problem that does not only occur in the Netherlands and does not stop at the border. Our research can therefore be seen as a starting point for similar analyses in other countries dealing with subversive crime.

We have tried to translate most of the texts from Dutch to English as best as possible. However, that is not our native language and the language in which we communicate with our audience. We ask the jury to take this into account. We have published many more stories associated with The Underworld Map (in Dutch: Onderwereldkaart). At the fourth attached link they are accessible in 'Google Translate English'.",The methodology we developed shows that it is possible to make invisible phenomena visible.

As the pandemic roils the economy in ways that disproportionately affect low-wage workers and people of color, more and more families in the city are struggling to get by.

In this special report, the NYCity News Service, part of the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY, documents the spread of housing insecurity and the need for government-aid programs. We also share the data underlying our reporting.","The project shined a light on how the housing costs increases slamming New Yorkers in recent years reached a new level of crisis during the pandemic, as many people in the areas hardest hit by COVID grappled with illness, unemployment and an emergency safety net plagued by gaping holes.","For our story examining delays in pandemic-releated emergency rent assistance in the Bronx, N.Y., we gathered and analyzed data on applications for the New York State Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) between 06/2021 and 10/2021, sourced via the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. We also looked at data detailing population, race and evictions executed in 2019. Using datawrapper, we created charts and maps showing emergency rental applications in NYC by ZIP Code, as well as by county. 

For our story on housing insecurity, we analyzed New York City's unemployment rate for the year of 2020 by census tract and median income and market rental rate data sets from 01/2014 to 08/2020. We looked at estimates of unemployment and labor force participation by race, education, age, gender, marital status, and citizenship, via census tracts.

United States,The Maine Monitor,Small,Participant,,Eavesdropping in Maine Jails,2022-01-26,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Crime, Human rights","Scraping, Google Sheets, PostgreSQL","The series exposed how jails across the State of Maine recorded nearly 1,000 attorney-client phone calls in a single year and shared recordings with police and prosecutors, who were able to listen to parts of those private calls before trial.

Defendants have a constitutional right to privately consult with an attorney in order to build a defense, but the risk of having those conversations recorded has undermined that right to the point some defense lawyers have reported their clients will no longer speak to them on the jails' telephones.","Gov. Janet Mills instructed the state Department of Corrections to work with legislators on a solution. While lawmakers entertained a bill that would penalize a person who “knowingly eavesdrops” on a conversation between an attorney and a defendant, lawmakers formed a study group to review policies for attorney-client contact and recommend changes. 

That study group recently recommended a series of policy changes to sharply limit the practice. Among the proposed changes are that county jails confirm for defense lawyers and incarcerated people the attorney's phone number is private and will not be recorded by the jail’s phone system. The group urged law enforcement and prosecutorial offices to adopt policies and write a uniform procedure to prevent the recording of attorney-client phone calls. The state may develop a centralized website for attorneys to register their numbers to be shared with jails and prisons. Currently, the policy proposals lack an enforcement mechanism or penalty. Lawmakers will consider these recommendations in the legislative session beginning in January 2023.

The reporting prompted several county sheriffs to restrict access to recordings made by the jails' phone systems to only top jail administrators. Securus Technologies, providing inmate phone services to most Maine jails, added new warnings at the start of phone calls to notify the parties if the call is private or will be recorded, or if it can be monitored. 

Deputy Attorney General Lisa Marchese, once dismissive of the severity of the release of confidential attorney-client phone calls, has instructed prosecutors to make note of the date and time of potentially privileged calls. She agreed to have her office draft and adopt a policy about handling of privileged materials, which until now was an informal procedure. Changes will be made at the criminal justice academy to better train correctional officers about defendants' constitutional rights.","Samantha made 100 public record requests to county sheriff's offices to collect records about the state’s 15 jails’ contracts, policies, revenue, usernames, call logs and recording access reports with their private phone vendors. 

Jails in Aroostook, Androscoggin, Franklin and Kennebec counties fully released data on how many times their phones recorded defense attorneys. For each suspected attorney call recorded by a jail, the Monitor identified who the phone number belonged to using annual registration information attorneys submitted to the Board of Overseers of the Bar. 

A list of 439 defense attorney phone numbers compiled by the Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services in the spring of 2020 supplemented the registration records. Samantha contacted each of the 46 law firms and lawyers identified in the data and many said it was their first time hearing that their calls were recorded by a jail. She compiled the call records into a searchable database, which The Maine Monitor made available for free online so the public could search to see if their attorney-client phone calls were recorded.

The first draft of the database was compiled into Google Spreadsheets. The newsroom then contracted with a developer to build us a Wordpress plugin version of the database that could be hosted on our website.","The digging into this story began when a criminal defense attorney reported that the attorney general's office had received and listened to part of a recording of one of his phone calls with a client in the Somerset County Jail. Monitor reporter Samantha Hogan immediately wanted to know whether the recording was an isolated incident or if it was a sign of a systemic problem of Maine jails recording privileged conversations. To answer her question, she made more than 100 public records requests to county sheriff's offices and jails for call data, policies, inmate handbooks and emails and conducted three dozen interviews with attorneys, defendants, sheriffs and the former chief justice of the Maine supreme court, which together revealed that Maine county jails were routinely recording private attorney-client phone calls and sometimes sharing those recordings with police and prosecutors.
 
County sheriffs were reluctant to release data that would show how many times their jail's phone system had illegally recorded attorney-client calls. Samantha doggedly pursued the release of this data, which several counties ultimately shared, and The Maine Monitor made public online through a searchable database. 

The Monitor even went to court to fight for the release of these public records. In August 2021, the Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic at the Yale Law School and local counsel helped the news organization sue York County after it denied multiple requests for data about attorney calls recorded by the York County Jail. The county settled and agreed to release some data showing at least one attorney-client phone call was accessed. Our litigation to release more records is ongoing. 
 
Samantha traveled up and down Maine to courthouses in Aroostook, Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Knox and Lincoln counties to review paper case files — since Maine has no online repository of criminal court records. She spent dozens of hours reading thousands of pages of court filings and transcripts.

Prior to publication, two county lawyers threatened to sue The Maine Monitor if it named county employees who had listened to confidential recorded attorney-client conversations. Neither county has followed through on their threat to file a lawsuit after the articles were published. 

The Maine Monitor is a small newsroom and a still growing one. In order to create the public database of information about the recorded calls, we had to contract with a coding developer to build the database and the Wordpress plugin for the database. Aside from getting external financial assistance from three foundations (International Women's Media Foundation, Report for America and Pulitzer Center), the project largely came to fruition thanks to the editorial guidance of Rose Ciotta from the Investigative Editing Corps.","The truth is out there, it's only a matter of getting the records and data to back up what you may already know. The path to getting those records, though, may be daunting -- but well worth it. Being denied your records request should only make you want to doggedly pursue the records more, as records request are largely denied because of a fear of what journalists will uncover. Yes, there are some records that cannot be provided, or provided without redaction, but it is the job of the newsroom to determine which records should be public and fight for those records. People will try to persuade you off the path, but that should fuel your drive even more. Remember, the potential impacts can be great. In the case of the Eavesdropping in Maine Jails series, constitutional rights are being restored to inmates because of our reporting. Lawmakers have the opportunity to overhaul the attorney-defendant process at Maine jails. A national phone company has taken steps to implement new safeguards, and is looking at implementing more in the near future.",English,https://www.themainemonitor.org/eavesdropping-in-maine-jails/,https://www.themainemonitor.org/attorney-calls-recorded-by-maine-jails/,https://www.themainemonitor.org/one-man-fights-to-undo-plea-deal-due-to-jail-recording-of-attorney-calls/,https://www.themainemonitor.org/a-maine-jail-recorded-hundreds-of-an-attorneys-calls-he-wants-to-know-why/,https://www.themainemonitor.org/lawyers-outraged-that-sheriffs-office-listened-to-recordings-of-confidential-phone-calls/,https://www.themainemonitor.org/maine-group-recommends-phone-numbers-be-collected-to-prevent-more-recordings-of-attorneys/,https://www.themainemonitor.org/maine-lawmakers-defense-attorneys-say-jails-must-stop-recording-and-listening-to-attorney-calls/,"Samantha Hogan (reporter), Rose Ciotta (editor), David Dahl (editor), Eric Conrad (editor), George Harvey (multimedia editor), Hal Madsen (copyeditor), Christina Leonard (social media), Joe Pavlik (database coding), Caleb Horton (research assistance), Zhiwei Hua (research assistance), Isaiah Murtaugh (audio editing).","Samantha Hogan focuses on government accountability projects for The Maine Monitor.

Calculate your inflation for your groceries",2022-12-19,"Explainer, Database, News application, Illustration, Economy","Personalisation, D3.js, Google Sheets","This project lets users calculate their own inflation based on their regular grocery shoppings.
* It allows them to see which items are the most inflation-affected ones in their basket.
* It illustrates how their own inflation stacks up against the overall inflation figures in Germany.
* The user's selection is saved and the calculator is constantly updated. Therefore, one can use this as his or her personal dashboard for months to come.","The (ongoing) impact is that users are enabled to make informed choices to reduce their exposure to the sky-rocketing inflation. Instead of having the simplistic assumption that everything became more expensive by the same amount, they can see that the specific inflation varies greatly from product to product. Instead of using a highly technical Excel sheet from the Office of National Statistics that defines inflation for subgroups of products using indices, they can learn about inflation in an environment that resembles their shopping experience.","We are using scrapers to get the latest data from Germany's Office of National Statistics. And we used scrapers and self-drawn samples to collect a database with base prices for around 300 products. Having these base prices and the inflation indices of the German ONS, we can update for each product what it should cost now, e.g. what the price of a sack of potatoes, of a pack of minced meat should be at the moment.

For the viz, we are using Svelte and D3. For the illustration, our designer Wanda has hand-drawn all of them to give the calculator a consistent look-and-feel.","We think that the crucial part of this calculator is that it is closer to the habits and average lives of users than most inflation calculators that are out there. Few of us know exactly their gas bills, their weekly spending on groceries or how much one has paid for leisure activities.

By analyzing data from the most important American chart and barometer of the popularity of songs in the United States, the Billboard Hot 100, we have created a playful project, but rich in visualizations and information, just in time for Christmas.","Our project validated a common perception and made it possible to visualize a trend that had been building for a few years using data on the popularity of music. This can be a light subject, but highlighting it with a playful format made it possible to put into words and graphics a change that is taking place in our society. The music industry is turned upside down by the arrival of streaming, while album sales are at an all-time low (with the exception of vinyl sales) and even the sale of digital tracks has been superseded. But, aside from decreasing income for artists (widely reported in the media over the past few years), streaming doesn't just have negative effects. 

Our project demonstrates how songs released years or even decades ago can regain in popularity, and even reach unexpected heights during the holiday season. It also immortalizes a phenomenon that we do not necessarily think about every day, but whose treatment lends well in this period of festivities (at the time of publication). The whole project is also supported by the testimony of experts in the musical field which sheds new light on this trend.","Our project opens with an oversized data visualization in which you have to scroll to observe the trend. It is also associated with the snow falling from the top illustration, since annual graphs on the number of Christmas titles charting on the Billboard Hot 100 take the form of snow banks, as if the snow was accumulating to construct the curves, year after year. You can even open each of them to consult the data. Our custom API allowed us to organize all the data needed and to return it to the web page. 

All the elements of the project were developed using a variety of technologies, including Node.js, React.js, D3 and Material UI. It is designed to be as easy to use on a computer as on all mobile devices. Everything has been imagined, designed and illustrated by our own team with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, to offer an inviting, colorful and instructive environment. The main visualization is then followed by a series of other graphs, created with Datawrapper, which help to learn more about streaming trends related to Christmas music. The story is also punctuated with various quiz questions, allowing interaction with Internet users and ensuring that they keep their interest throughout the course of the article.","Few data on the popularity of music, cumulating figures on purchases, radio broadcasts and streaming, are available online. We had to opt for an analysis of American data, with the Billboard Hot 100, since they were the only ones publicly accessible and over a historical period. Canadian data is only available in free access for the current week. It was therefore impossible for us to go back in time to have access to all the data necessary for our project. The data was even more difficult to find for Quebec, but our approach made it possible to identify the needs. 

Our many exchanges with the Observatoire de la culture et des communications du Québec lead us to believe that improvements in the delivery of the data they obtain will be made in the coming years to facilitate analyzes of the popularity of music. Our project has also demonstrated the difficulty for the media and researchers to have access to data on music, for free. This kind of data is often held by private companies, which sell it at high cost to the industry. However, we managed to tell a story and multiply the relevant visualizations with the data we had at hand. We opted for a series of custom graphics developed by our team, but also other graphics made using an external tool. This combination allowed us to publish quickly, since we had a time issue : we had to publish before Christmas.","Access to historical data can sometimes be difficult for free, whether for their availability or for their consistency over time. This is why we had to create our project on Christmas music, and build all our analysis, from American data. However, it was possible to observe a similar trend in Canada, thanks to the few data we had on hand and the observations of the experts we consulted. 

We managed to build our project thanks to the data we got, and to highlight both the trends illustrated by the figures and some facts about popular culture that the data came to support. We offered a wide range of visualizations from the same database, in order to cover the many aspects of the same subject and draw different conclusions.

They have been under political pressure to inflate statistics on the presence of “illegal foreigners” from Bangladesh, which has led to them identifying in detail—but often at random—the state’s Muslim residents. non-state actors such as right-wing Hindu vigilantes and Assamese nationalists have been aiding state agents in this process. Together they’ve drafted a playbook for the BJP government to profile and criminalize ethnic and religious minorities, relegating them to a legal purgatory of statelessness in perpetuity.","81,900 impressions on Twitter

""Judiciary is one of the important limbs of democracy and democracy without an independent judiciary is hollow,"" Justice Singh, who was the chief guest of the august gathering, said. https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/democracy-without-independent-judiciary-is-hollow-gauhati-high-court-judge-3189766","I analysed over a 100 police inquiry reports (procured with great difficulty through a source) establishing the thin grounds on which allegedly illegal foreigners were being reported by the police. Even when documents—like land deeds, the 1951 NRC, voter lists, panchayat certificates, or high school admit cards—were produced, the inquiry officers ignored these, my data analysis showed. I also spoke to former and present members of the the All Assam Students Union on how they were once involved in profiling the Muslim migrants/residents to the Border Police. It was also crucial to highlight the role of an independent institution like the High Court, which doesn't come under the Executive in India, and how Border Police’s faulty inquiries were going unchallenged.

I analyzed all the Gauhati High Court orders on foreigner cases passed between 2010 and 2019 that were originally procured through the RTI Act. Of the 1,536 orders, only 50—or 3.3 percent—cited the findings of the Border Police inquiry official. In Siddique's case, the foreigners' tribunal found a linkage issue because of spelling differences in his grandfather’s name in different documents. Gauhati High Court found his affidavit clarifying that they were the same people to be “self serving”. 

On March 24, 2021, the Gauhati High Court for the first time laid down the requirements of a fair trial and investigation before a notice is issued by a tribunal. The opinion passed by a tribunal in Baksa against Sona Khan was set aside on the grounds that the reference made must be specific and materials collected during the investigation to be produced before the tribunal. 

The court was of the view that “if no materials are available before the Referral Authority to doubt or question the citizenship of the person concerned, no reference can be made to the Tribunal”.","I filed request for Border Police inquiry reports through India's Right to Information Act, 2005 and exposed the myriad ways in which information to do with people's right to life and civil liberties are denied under everything from 'national security' to 'privacy'. My RTI request, however, yielded figures from the home department that were contradictory to the data released by the state government nine years ago. This again exposed how government's own record of tracking data was flimsy and unreliable.

The anger against the government that was once so palpably visible in Assam has died down and people voted to bring in the same government for a second term. Much of that anger has since been directed towards the already vulnerable Bengali Muslims who have been vilified as Covid super spreaders, illegal squatters and terrorists. To lay these facts bare to people in Assam has resulted in their wrath and social media trolling – a group of local journalists once included me in a public list of ‘anti NRC’ journalists. https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/08/28/what-the-spam-dossier-on-journalists-covering-nrc-tells-us-about-assamese-supremacy

Despite this attempt at defaming me, I continued working and cultivating my sources on the ground. The most difficult and an unsuccessful part of the project was not being able to access the police inquiry forms of both my primary characters (something they hadn't seen ever or owned a copy of) because of the opaqueness of the Border Police.","It took me four years to publish this investigation for two reasons. Despite trying all funding options, grants and fellowships, no agency showed any financial support for this project until The Baffler commissioned it in July 2021. Secondly, it took me a year to find a bulk of police inquiry reports for a data based investigation after years of applying for RTIs that were rejected by the government on one or the other grounds. The sensitivity of the cases (many of them pending) also didnt allow many lawyers to share their client's police report and most of them had never managed to gain access to it. 

I'm most proud of this investigation because hardly anyone believed in it and I had no resources or even a great incentive to finish it other than bringing out the truth of this institution. What other journalists can learn from this project (particularly those who are freelance) to persist on their curiosities and pursuit for truth for no greater reason than to speak truth to power.",English,https://thebaffler.com/salvos/strangers-in-their-own-land-sitlhou,,,,,,,Makepeace Sitlhou,"Makepeace Sitlhou is an independent journalist reporting human rights, gender, politics and culture in long form, investigations and documentaries.

Germany,"NDR, zenith Magazine",Big,Participant,,The business with bloody cotton,2022-05-05,"Investigation, Documentary, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Video, Satellite images, Business, Agriculture, Economy, Human rights","Isotope Analysis, Satellite Imagery, Trade Data Bases","In this report, Manuel Daubenberger and I were able to proof that cotton from farms in Xinjiang, China is still being used in product of German clothing brands such as Adidas, Puma and Hugo Boss – even though they publicly denied using this cotton, which is prone to forced labor. In order to deliver this proof, we partnered with a chemical laboratory and traced the isotopes that are unique to the Chinese region of Xinjiang and found them succesfully in cotton product of the companies named above.","Our report was published both with NDR, German public television, and zenith, an independent magazine focusing on the wider Muslim world. To date, an estimated audience of around five million was exposed to the news, that major German clothing brands such as Adidas, Hugo Boss and Puma still use cotton from the Chinese region of Xinjiang, despite their repeated claims not do so. Cotton, which we illustrated in our reporting, that is closely tied to forced labor working conditions.

The CEO of all three companies faced scrutiny from shareholders and investors at their annual conferences, citing reputational and financial risk. Our findings were internationally recognized, as the Guardian reported them. Since then, a number of major news outlets – such as Bloomberg in the US – started their own investigations, employing the method of isotope analysis, which we pioneered with regard to cotton for our investigation.

Also, several NGO consulted with us, to learn more about our research, as they are preparing legal cases against a number of clothing companies worldwide. More and more countries introduce legislation against the use of products that are the fruit of forced labor, isotope analysis and supply chain analysis might prove crucial tools to link the product of big clothing brands with sources in Xinjiang, China.

Additionally, we are now coordinating international efforts to help fellow journalists in more than half a dozen countries to prepare their own reports, using isotope analysis and supply chain analysis. We have compiled a handbook with best practices and aiming for a joint publication later this year. An effort, we hope, has the potential to unravel the claims of an entire industry, that has for years denied the use of cotton that is likely the fruit of forced labor.","Our research pioneers the use of a technique that allows for the tracing of cotton fibers found in clothing of Western brands back to its geographic origins. Employing the scientifically proven method of isotope analysis for cotton fibers took us over a year and is a first in journalism.

This method allowed us to back up our findings – using more traditional investigative methods such as the use of trade databases – that were already linking the products of German clothing brands such as Adidas and Hugo Boss with China's Xinjiang region, despite their repeated denials.

Additionally, by analyzing massive amounts of satellite imagery, we could prove that high quality long stable cotton is still picked by hand in southern Xinjiang. A harvesting method that is labor intensive and thus prone to the use of forced labor.

This highly specific analysis of large swath of farming land is a first both in science and journalism and allowed us to prove Chinese state media wrong, that had previously claimed, almost all cotton is harvested by machines nowadays.","The situation for most Ethnic minority people Xinjiang is dire. It is our hope that the methods pioneered in our report will contribute towards more accountability and help shine a light on Western brands that profit on the back of modern-day slaves, that are working on the fields and in the factories of Xinjiang.

It comes as no surprise, that access to Xinjiang is and remains limited – to say the least. Numerous attempts to gain access ultimately proved futile. In our reporting we were thus forced to circumvent these limitations. We flew to Turkey and the U.K. and travelled Germany extensively to meet people, that could provide insights into a tightly sealed system, that is the forced labor complex of Xinjiang, China.

The general lack of physical access to Xinjiang forced us to become creative and explore new avenues. This is how we came up with a multi-layered system to investigate the allegations. Firstly, large scale satellite imagery analysis helped prove, that much long-staple cotton is still being picked by hand, not by machine. Secondly, records found in data bases were linking Chinese companies and German clothing brands. Thirdly, isotope analysis showed a direct link between products in German stores and the chemical fingerprint of Xinjiang cotton, that we managed to obtain.

These finding were discussed and verified by dozens of interviews. We managed to talk to people that have been forced to pick cotton and others that had to sew clothing while imprisoned. We interviewed a Chinese whistleblower who had helped build the surveillance state that is nowadays Xinjiang and thus holds unique insights into this very system. We spoke to an auditor with decades of experience in the Xinjiang and learned how Chinese companies and their Western clients avoid scrutiny – and the length to which they would go in order to trick auditors.","Currently, our report serves as a blueprint for other journalists in many more countries around the world to investigate the claims of clothing brands in their respective countries. After this publication, we plan to publicize the exact isotope fingerprint of all our Xinjiang cotton samples, thus allowing journalists and laboratories from all over the world to use the data in their own research.

We feel that the use of remote sensing technology like satellite imagery, the use of trade data bases and especially isotope analysis will prove useful in order to investigate allegation in regions, that are notoriously hard to access. They also tend to provide forensic evidence, that is of value in court cases as they satisfy the need for basically scientific levels of certainty.","German, English",https://magazine.zenith.me/en/business/risk-forced-labor-are-german-clothing-brands-using-cotton-xinjiang,https://magazin.zenith.me/de/wirtschaft/risiko-von-zwangsarbeit-xinjiang-baumwolle-wohl-kleidung-deutscher-marken,https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&feature=youtu.be&v=w0bhOilZ29Q,"https://daserste.ndr.de/panorama/archiv/2022/Adidas-Hugo-Boss-Puma-Baumwolle-aus-Zwangsarbeit,zwangsarbeit262.html",https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/panorama/zwangsarbeit-baumwolle-markenkleidung-101.html,,,"Manuel Daubenberger, Florian Guckelsberger","Manuel Daubenberger is an investigative reporter and filmmaker.

Tunisia,Arab Center Washington DC,Small,Participant,,Sand and Dust Storms in the MENA Region: A Problem Awaiting Mitigation,2022-07-29,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Environment, Agriculture",Personalisation,"The phenomenon of sand and dust storms (SDS) remains poorly understood and has received relatively little scientific or policy attention. Considering the growing prevalence of SDS across the Middle East and North Africa, the storms’ impact on health, society, and the economy must surely be addressed, and policies need to be instituted to alleviate their effects.","2022 UN Climate Change Conference (COP 27) placed SDS higher on the climate change agenda, both in terms of scientific research on the phenomenon and the development of effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. I strongly believe that my paper contributed to this achievement.","To write my paper, I have used a variety of techniques including data journalism, fact checking, and story telling.","While there is now a significant body of literature that considers questions of climate change communication in the global north, there remains relatively little work that takes seriously how climate change messaging might need to be adapted to non-Western contexts and audiences. This is all the more pressing seeing as such communities are often located on the 'front line' of the climate crisis and face existential threats to their livelihoods and ways of life. My paper contends that climate change communication must attend to the relationship between global processes and local effects, and be carefully adapted to speak to particular communities’ needs, concerns and threats. To help unpack how such situated climate communication might be forwarded, the article considers the case of sand and dust storms in the MENA region. 

The Middle East and North Africa offers an illuminating case study, which shines a light on broader questions of climate change communication. The region represents the confluence of a range of interlinking political, economic and environmental realities and relations that extend across a number of scales (local, national, regional and global). These include (but are not limited to), the region’s oil and gas reserves, its history of colonialism and neo-colonial resource extraction, climate migration, desertification and agriculture, and the significant effects that climate change will have on the region’s climate. All these factors work to make climate change communication in the region a particularly knotty problem.","Sand and Dust Storms (SDS) challenge our understanding of climate disasters, demonstrating the linkages between the local, national, regional, and global levels that together make up climate and ecological systems. Journalists can learn from this paper that only through climate change policies that successfully travel between these different levels and scales of operation will it be possible to build resilience to future climate stresses.",English,https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/sand-and-dust-storms-in-the-mena-region-a-problem-awaiting-mitigation/,https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/confronting-water-scarcity-in-north-africa/,https://timep.org/commentary/analysis/tunisias-low-carbon-energy-transitions/,https://timep.org/commentary/analysis/from-the-river-to-the-sea-water-management-in-libya/,,,,"Achref Chibani, a Tunisian journalist","Achref Chibani is a Nonresident Fellow at TIMEP focusing on climate change in the Middle East and North Africa region.

We translated the prices paid at the checkout for 45 products into an amount of minutes worked, based on the evolution of the average hourly wage of Canadians. At the end, they can see if their basket costs them more or less than before. They can then remove or add items to see the impact of their choices. Our file also comes with eight additional texts on issues related to food and finances.","At the start of 2022, « foodflation » was already on everyone's lips. However, the price at the grocery store checkout is only one part of the complexity of the cost of our food. But do we really pay more for our food today? This is the question we wanted to answer. Different factors come into play with prices, from seasonality to the weather, even transportation, money currency and markets. Another element to consider over time is inflation and the cost of living. Yes, prices are increasing. But wages are also rising, and people sometimes forget about that. This is why we translated the prices paid at the checkout into an amount of minutes worked, based on the evolution of the average hourly wage of Canadians, and why we invited Internet users to navigate through a virtual grocery store, where they could see which products really cost more than before in labor time, and which actually cost less. Our virtual clerks are there to clarify what factors affect prices and put periods of fluctuation into context. We even give the option to users of removing or adding items to their basket to see the impact of their choices, since the consumption profile also has an impact on the evolution of the cost of the grocery cart. Our file also comes with eight additional texts on issues related to food and finances because we really wanted to make a series which would leave no questions unanswered.","The prices of the products in our virtual grocery store are taken from a Statistics Canada food database. These are monthly data representative of the whole country. We also used another database from the federal agency on average salaries. However, to simplify the interpretation of the data, we have created an index from these two datasets, which translates the cost of food into a number of minutes worked and which then makes it possible to simply show if a product costs more or is cheaper than before and to quantify the percentage of change. We used our custom API to scrape all the data needed and also to return it to the web page. All the elements of the project, taking the form of a virtual grocery store, were developed using a variety of technologies, including Node.js, React.js, GraphQL, D3 and Material UI. Our interactive project is designed to be as easy to use on a computer as on all mobile devices. It takes up both mechanics associated with online shopping and browsing on social networks. Everything has been imagined, designed and illustrated by our own team with Adobe Photoshop, to offer an inviting, colorful and instructive environment. We have also created a series of posts on Instagram to provide a different experience for Internet users.","Finding food price data was a more complex task than it seems. There is only one historical and publicly accessible database : the one from Statistics Canada. Other companies doing similar collection of data offer them at cost and only go back a few years. We therefore opted for the one from the federal agency, even if it was the subject of criticism. A limited number of products are listed and only a few details are known about the methodology. The same price collection is also used to measure the consumer price index on food purchased from stores, which would underestimate the real price increases, according to an article in the Toronto Star published shortly before our project. Even Statistics Canada cautions against using its average price data on a historical perspective. In the weeks following the publication of our project, the federal agency ended the monthly updates of its database on average food prices and archived it. It has been replaced by a new database, with a different methodology and a revised list of products. The new data is only available from 2017 and is not compatible with historical data from the other dataset. Several experts we consulted believe that our project has highlighted the difficulties of accessing reliable and historical data on the price of food in order to follow its evolution over the years.","The goal of our project was to deal with a subject widely covered in an original way. All topics, simple or complex, can be made into an interactive experience increasing the engagement of Internet users. Through a virtual grocery store, which incorporates the codes of online shopping and social networks, they can learn while having fun. Our project not only presents them with historical information on the evolution of food prices and wages, but also on the reasons behind the price fluctuations of several products. Internet users can even draw their own conclusions by modifying the content of their cart, making it a customizable experience. It is a fun and rewarding way to visualize data, but also to allow less familiar Internet users to navigate into a complex database.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, contractors and agencies of government took advantage of the COVID-19 restrictions to steal public funds, hoard contract information from the public and misled the people. 

This entry, however, establsihed how the law was breached by the culprit - the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital. Contrary to its claim, it clearly revealed the exact sum management of the hospital got as part of COVID-19 interventions to manage the pandemic.","Through the article, members of the public, especially medical practitioners became familiar with the huge investment made into the health sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. This became more interesting to them because a lot of Nigerian doctors were leaving the country for the United Kingdom (UK), Saudi Arabia due to poor welfare and facilities. The findings in the report, however, generated reactions and public engagements.

The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) and other stakeholders in the health sector began to ask critical questions from medical directors and officials of the Federal Ministry of Health. 

One of the findings in the report was that Nigeria, with a population of over 200 million people has only two modern cancer treament machines. This has largely contributed to poor management of cancer patients. This finding was also validated by the former Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole.","Open Source Investigation Techniques - through this, I was able to identify and analyse Covid-19 procurement data housed in the Nigeria Open Contracting Portal (NOCOPO). 

Canva - I used this tool to design and showcase almost the exact equipment the culprit bought without adhering to the procurement law. 

Photo paint - From the backend of word press, i embedded photographs into the article. 

Scribd - With this tool, i was able to embed a 5-page document listing the amount released to each federal hospital from the government coffer.","For a fact, the management of the hospital was unwilling to open up for this reporter to check its COVID-19 support expenditure. This was after initial appointments, and repeated emails. As a result, this reporter went undercover for the investigation. 

In the process of the fact-finding mission, the photo camera which serve as a major work tool accidentally dropped and crashed. It almost ended the investigation because the whole exercise had become a covert operation. I ended up procuring another before the investigation could resume.

Worthy of note is that Nigeria is struggling with brain drain in the heath sector. Most health officials including nurses are migrating to the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, most of the interventions provided through public donations might end up in rots because of low workforce to manage them.","The right use of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act, and the need to go undercover when the source (public office) decides to hide information of public good from the public.

Also, the need to ""show"", rather than ""tell"". This methodology is so important to boost credibility of your report. Beyond telling stories, people are more interested in evidence. It will enable them make informed decision, and to take the appriopriate action.

United States,City & State New York,Big,Participant,,New York’s Once-booming Oil Industry and the Risky Wells it Left Behind,2022-05-09,"Investigation, Long-form, Open data, Map, Environment","Adobe Creative Suite, R, RStudio, Python","Western New York towns, once built around oil production, are now grappling with the remnants of a declining industry: abandoned wells dot the region in backyards, nearby schools and the woods. In this project, we found that Allegany County, the state’s one-time powerhouse for commercial drilling, had more abandoned and unplugged wells than active ones. Around the country, these ownerless, orphaned wells became the state’s responsibility, posing a billion-dollar problem and risking air pollution, contaminating groundwater and releasing greenhouse gases. In New York, the act of plugging wells presents not only a financial hurdle, but an emotional one.","The story localized an ongoing national conversation surrounding abandoned wells, giving a nuanced look at how Western New York communities were facing both the dangers of these wells and nostalgia for a declining oil and gas industry that helped create their towns. It highlighted the origins of US oil drilling and the ensuing pivot drillers have since made to keep their businesses alive. The story was published in City and State NY’s magazine and circulated to its print readers throughout the state, as well as published online. Additionally, the story was featured in Politico’s New York Playbook, an email newsletter sent out to readers interested in New York news. 

This January, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced the creation of a new office focusing specifically on the cleanup of abandoned wells. Plugging wells can reduce methane emissions and protect those living nearby from pollutants in their air and water. While our story is certainly not the only piece highlighting the need to plug abandoned and orphaned wells across the country, it is the only one we know of that focuses on New York — a state not typically associated with oil production. 

New York's oil history is often masked by nearby Pennsylvania's reputation for drilling. Nevertheless, western New Yorkers have their own lasting love of the industry. Our piece stands out among other reporting on this topic by leaning into this complexity: How do you pay homage to an industry that has left behind tens of thousands of structures that could be releasing pollution into the air you breathe and the water you use? Our story attempts to answer this question. We go beyond the environmental danger these wells pose to explain the community's attachment to their legacy — in a place few would expect to find it.","We performed the data analysis for this story in Python, primarily using pandas to dive into two separate datasets. We looked into the number of wells by regions, counties and towns. We created two charts and one map using R/RStudio’s tidyverse and various other mapping libraries, including rgdal, sf and tigris. The charts showed the number of unplugged wells compared to active wells in New York counties, and how long New York wells were open before being plugged.

Our analysis used two datasets, each made public by the New York Department of Energy Conservation. Our first dataset showed all abandoned and unplugged wells in the state, while a second dataset of all wells in the state since 1860 and their statuses allowed us to count and map active wells in the state.","We were graduate students when we reported this piece and lacked the financial resources and time to make a reporting trip to western New York to speak in person with our sources and to visit the places discussed in the article. As a result, we relied on photos provided to us by sources.

Furthermore, the topic of abandoned wells contains nuance and uncertainty anywhere, but in New York, where methane leaks from abandoned and orphaned wells have not been calculated, that uncertainty became an everyday challenge. We hope our piece serves as an example to other writers for how to explain a real risk to readers without alarming them, and how to understand the scope of that risk without hard numbers.","This story stemmed from an open dataset that we dove into out of curiosity. In that dataset, we made a key finding: the number of abandoned oil wells in Allegany County now far exceeds the number of active wells. By following our journalistic instinct and asking questions of this observation, we unearthed an compelling history of New York’s oil industry and its legacy — which is still top-of-mind for many people throughout Allegany County. 

Through this project, we learned it is always worth exploring open data portals and running basic analysis in our spare time, as there is always a chance of uncovering reporting threads to follow in the midst of thousands of rows.

“Bolsonaro has become famous for expressing openly homophobic, 
unapologetically misogynist, shamelessly racist
 and hysterically anti-communist views”.


And the result of the 2022 elections in the south of the country, especially Santa Catarina State, shows great sympathy for him. He represents the ugliest and most violent face of the global far-right movement through terrorist demonstrations.

But not just any terrorism. Especially digital terrorism demonstrations.
In October 2019, President Jair Bolsonaro signed a decree compelling all federal bodies to share most of the data they hold on Brazilian citizens, from health records to biometric information, and consolidate it in a vast master database, the Cadastro Base do Cidadão (Citizen’s Basic Register). With no debate or public consultation, the measure took many people by surprise.
Bolsonaro's government allows military intelligence
to exploit WhatsApp data information on “suspected” civilians.

Data journalists are supported by 
non-governmental organizations to 
denounce the Excel Project 
on social networks.

But At Santa Catarina, the “New Silicon Valley of Brazil”,
 it is better to work individually on GitHub.
 At Santa Catarina it is better to work individually because the public debate about AI is weakened by authoritarianism and the promise of success of hundreds of startups.
 
 By the way, we need to understand how the success of
Digital authoritarianism affects other countries like Nepal, China,
India and the Arabic World. The promises of development

Trustworthy AI is about increasing
 public understanding of how APIs should be followed,

With a population of over 200 million, Uttar Pradesh is one of the worst states in India as far as access to public health is concerened. However, there is very little reporting highlighting how this human right is denied to a large section of the society. Following this theme, we published six articles, each addressing a distinct crisis plaguing the public health system in Uttar Pradesh.","The most important impact of the series was on the audience. After the stories were published, readers reached out to help the people featured in the stories and we managed to raise lakhs of rupees for them. 
Since it was an underreported subject, we ensured it becomes a part of the conversation ahead of a very important state election.","The data used for the stories was both sourced from anonymous sources and available in public domain. But it had to be sifted through to be put into the right context. 
I mainly used Google Spreadsheets to make hard hitting points with the data available to me.","Uttar Pradesh is a state notorious to threatening and hounding journalists for exposing uncomfortable realities. The administration and sources are tight lipped. Even the people on the ground are afraid to talk against the government fearing retribution.
All of these things posed a challenge that had to be conquered. 
It included persisten efforts and follow ups. And I had to make best use of the data that I could gather.","The most important thing we focused on throughout the series was to not lose sight of the human touch.

This was more than three times the number of policies (6.978 million) surrendered prematurely in 2020-21.

Tras el cierre de las oficinas consulares por la crisis humanitaria en Haití, el 15 de septiembre de 2022, estas agencias continuan ofertando el servicio de visados dominicanos, mientras las autoridades locales no han tomado medidas al respecto.","Solo en la plataforma de Listín Diario, las cuatro historias vinculadas al tema fueron leídas en conjunto unas 70,500 veces . Mientras que los videos publicados tuvieron un promedio de 1,389 vistas. 

Desde la publicación de la investigación, el 28 de noviembre de 2022, medios de comunicación dominicanos, especialmente programas de opinión audiovisuales difundieron los reportajes y criticaron a los cónsules dominicanos por la acción irregular en la emisión de los visados.

Luego de las publicaciones en redes sociales de Listín Diario, cientos de personas denunciaron que los precios de las visas dominicanas superaban los 600 dólares y, a la vez, contaron sus experiencias al momento de la solicitud. 

Para el 1 de diciembre de 2022, Listín Diario hizo un Twitter Space (El negocio de las visas dominicanas en Haití) para explicar más a fondo la investigación a los lectores. La transmisión, de una hora 36 minutos, tuvo buena aceptación y fue escuchada por más de 2,300 personas, incluidos miembros de las Naciones Unidas. 

El reportaje principal también fue publicado en creole haitiano y organizaciones haitianas en redes sociales como Haití en Español (@Haitienesp), compartieron la información y pidieron que se investigue más sobre el tema.

Mientras que el Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) recomendó en su newsletter del 21 de diciembre leer esta investigación publicada en conjunto con Connectas.

Semanas después de la publicación, un medio televisivo realizó un reportaje con los datos extraidos de la investigación Listín Diario, sin embargo nunca atribuyó la propiedad de los datos e informaciones utilizadas a la investigación original.

Hasta principios de enero de 2023, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de República Dominicana no había dado declaraciones sobre el tema.","Para la elaboración del micrositio, el programador web usó una librería de JavaScript llamada React js para construir la interfaz sobre esta además de otra librería llamada Next js, Tailwindcss para los estilos y Framer Motion para las animaciones. 

Para las ilustraciones se utilizó el programa Adobe Illustrator y una técnica estilo 'flat design'. Parte de las ilustraciones fueron implementadas para enumerar, paso a paso, cómo los haitianos aplican a la visa dominicana desde Haití, dependiendo del contexto: por agencias, por consulado y como debería ser. 

Para la edición de videos se utilizaron los programas de Adobe Premiere y After Effects, además de cámaras de video, grabadoras de audio y un Live Switcher o un conmutador HDMI de cuatro canales.

Para las infografías fueron utilizadas las plataformas Genially y Flourish, donde se usaron gráficos en forma de Sunburst, en barras, mapas interactivos y galería.","Desde 2009, cuando ocurrió el mortífero terremoto que acabó con las vidas de más de 316,000 personas en Haití, el país que comparte isla con República Dominicana ha ido de mal en peor: la pobreza, las enfermedades, la inestabilidad política y la inseguridad ciudadana, son solo parte del calvario que ha sufrido. Pero no fue hasta el último año y medio, justo cuando en julio de 2021 fue asesinado el presidente haitiano Jovenel Moise, que la situación ha estado sin control. Desde entonces no hay un gobierno estable ni seguridad y entran cientos de miles de haitianos a territorio dominicano con poco control de las autoridades.

Desde julio de 2022, bandas armadas y peligrosas se han adueñado de las calles haitianas y hasta finales de 2022 más de 2,000 tuvieron muertes violentas. Haití es de hecho el tercer país del mundo con más asesinatos contra periodistas en 2022.

Para realizar esta investigación fueron recibidos fondos del Centro Internacional para Periodistas (ICFJ, por sus siglas en inglés), que tenían como principal prioridad trasladarse a las diferentes ciudades haitianas que tienen consulados. Sin embargo, por razones de seguridad, el equipo de Listín Diario no pudo viajar hacia territorio haitiano, y tuvo que auxiliarse de un periodista residente en Haití para recabar datos. Esto, en definitiva, hizo que el trabajo fuera más complicado. Pero pese a los retos, la investigación salió a flote y fueron expuestos otros ángulos periodísticos que, de no haberse complicado el proceso, quizá nunca hubiesen sido tratados.

Otro de los retos fue acceder a datos oficiales de Haití. La debilidad en el sistema institucional, sobre todo el judicial haitiano junto a la crisis y el desconocimiento del idioma hicieron casi imposible tener acceso a información pública haitiana. Pero, para compensar, fueron buscados datos desde plataformas de libre acceso a la información pública de República Dominicana que revelaron datos que dieron más relevancia a la investigación.

Entre las tecnologías innovadoras implementadas por Listín Diario estuvo la creación de un micrositio, enlazado en la página principal de Listín Diario, donde se utilizaron recursos nuevos para la plataforma de noticias como un administrador de paquetes de nodos en el título principal, con la finalidad de hacerlo más interactivo.

En nuestro caso, otra técnica innovadora fue doblar audios y videos de entrevistas realizadas en el francés o inglés para español. 

Además, para darle una visibilidad internacional al principal público interesado en el tema, el haitiano, el reportaje principal fue traducido al creole.","Este trabajo de investigación es una continuación a reportajes publicados en abril de 2021, por la periodista de Listín Diario, Ashley Ann Presinal, y los cuales despertaron la curiosidad para seguir indagando más sobre el negocio en los consulados dominicanos en Haití. 

Ambos reportajes han sido el resultado de una investigación de más de dos años, que todavía tiene tela para cortar. Y este proceso demostró que con mucha paciencia y determinación se pueden lograr proyectos valiosos, sobre todo bajo el contexto político que vive Haití. 

Un punto que podría servir a otros periodistas es que no es del todo necesario escribir miles de palabras para periodismo de datos. Considero que el uso de herramientas multimedia como videos, infografías e imágenes pueden servir para hacer un reporte más conciso y digerible para el lector. 

En específico, las infografías utilizadas contienen las informaciones estadísticas más importantes proporcionadas por la Cancillería. Y son interactivas para que el lector tenga mejor compresión de los datos. 

Motivo a otros periodistas a seguir buscando ángulos para esta historia, que presionen a las autoridades para que den respuestas ante actos de corrupción e irregularidades en instituciones estatales.

También tener en cuenta que existen plataformas de acceso a la información pública que contienen miles de datos importantes que pueden utilizarse para grandes investigaciones. 

Otra de las enseñanzas es que no es necesario trasladarse a un lugar para hacer una investigación a profundidad, y que no nos podemos cerrar a la posibilidad de hacer periodismo colaborativo con periodistas internacionales. 

Además, trabajos como este permiten tanto al periodista como a los lectores en general analizar desde diferentes puntos de vista cómo funciona el sistema dominicano, y determinar que, en ocasiones, no todo es lo que parece, sobre todo con relación a la migración haitiana en República Dominicana.",Spanish,http://listindiario.com/especial/jugoso-negocio-de-las-visas-dominicanas.html,https://listindiario.com/la-republica/2022/11/29/750551/con-consulados-cerrados-siguen-otorgando-visas-en-haiti,https://listindiario.com/la-republica/2022/11/30/750763/un-millon-de-entradas-legales-de-haitianos-a-rd-en-los-ultimos-seis-anos,https://listindiario.com/la-republica/2022/12/01/751002/consulados-en-haiti-aprobaron-99-de-las-visas-solicitadas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTgyHXNIxc4&t=5s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP1QyCJLaP4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkK3D16pka4&list=PL43m-KuNd38Jx-mlRA0J6qxWhu7-OjUHw,"Carolina del Carmen Pichardo Hernandez (Autora), Milo Milfort (Reportería Haití), Enriquillo Xavier Billini Fernández (Desarrollador web), Kharla Patricia Ceballos Mota (Ilustradora), Rubí Esmeralda Morillo Morillo (Editora de videos), Julio Lavandier González (Editor de videos), Jorge Luis Martínez Arias (Reportero gráfico), Nasha Virginia Cruz Chevalier (Infografista).","Carolina Pichardo se desempeña como coordinadora de investigación de Listín Diario (LD).

Rather than pay the retirees, the governor prefers to spend the money on buying cars to curry political favour. This investigation looked at the plight of these men and women and how the state government misappropriated funds meant for payment of gratuities and pensions.","Before the investigation was published on December 14, the Cross River State governor was not in the habit of paying pensions regularly. Usually, retirees received their December pension by January. But after the report, he paid pensions for November and December even before the month ended. I have had the pensioners call to inform me. What is left is the gratuity. After i shared the story on Twitter and Linkedin, it stirred up conversations, with many questuioning why a government should care less about the welfare of its workers.","To be able to tell the story in way that it will have the greatest of impact, I used Lumen 5 technology to create a video with available images. I used Venngage to create infographics, capturing the remuneration package of the governor and the number of cars, worth millions he has bought and given away when pensioners are dying I poverty. I also provided documents, including newspaper publications concerning the pension issue which were published alongside the story. This is to ensure that the government is pushed to act accordingly and to also help readers have a clear understanding of the subject.","Access to data was a major challenge for me. In telling the story, i needed documents concerning the governor's remuneration package to be able to juxtapose it with the situation of workers in the state. I also needed documents concerning funds that were paid to the state government to be used for payment of retirees that were diverted. In one of the times I had to to the government house to request for access to data. On entry, i had several security operatives question my reason for coming. And when i told them, they threatened me and asked me to go home, that the document was not available.","To be able to tell this story better, I used documents that gave it credibility. These includes documents concerning remuneration and old newspaper publications where the governor made promised to the pensioners. Getting these documents took time and efforts. I kept pushing and meeting people in government who knew how where the documents were but were hesitant to provide them. I had to convince them about the need to tell the story and hiw important the documents were. For the newsapaper publication, I haf to trace the head of the state Library who had retired. I gave the story enough time. What journalist can learn is that there is no need to rush when chasing stories if they must have impact. They must always do well to get every necessaery information because it gives the story credibility. 

Another lesson is that journalist must always define what they want to achieve before setting out to do a story. Before i commenced, i told myself that I wanted to tell a story that will move the government to act. I wanted results. And gradually, my goal for doing the story is being achieved.",English,https://www.ripplesnigeria.com/investigation-in-cross-river-civil-servants-retire-into-poverty-as-govt-looks-away-squanders-funds-on-frivolities/,,,,,,,George Kaduna.

Inflation also triggered income inequality. Also, a large number of urban centric people are going back to villages being crippled with high living cost in the city.

The government also strengthen market monitoring using its relevant institutions including competition commission, Tarriff Commission, Directorate of Consumers' Rights. Market syndicate is one of the major reson of price manipulation of essential commoditites in Bangladesh. 

The news on inflationary impact on healthcare services and chid labour helped to raise awareness. There were a number of suggestions and recomendations from expert groups to minimise the sufferiing of common people due to price hike of essential commodities. Expert groups and law makers considered the suggestions effective and implentable.

https://en.sharikawalaken.media/",Small,Participant,,Sara Gamal,2022-12-06,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Women, Health, Human rights","Scraping, Canvas, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","A data-driven investigation reveals that some women are subjected to forced vaginal examinations without permission, unnecessarily, without respect for their privacy during childbirth.
women are subjected to surgical interventions without painkillers.
Women are exposed to multiple forms of obstetric violence, including verbal and physical violence.
The investigation analysis a database of 1,000 women who gave birth in Egypt, revealing that women with lower incomes and those who gave birth in government hospitals are the most vulnerable to abuse.
The investigation won the Feminist Investigative Journalism grant.
The investigation published in 6 Dec 2022, and updated later, It's appears here:
https://en.sharikawalaken.media/author/saraagamal2gmail-com/","Obstetric violence is a global problem, and despite the high rates of obstetric violence and violations of privacy, the problem is not covered by the media, especially in the Arab region.

There is no official data about the obstetric violence and the vaginal examinations without permission, unnecessarily, without respect for their privacy during childbirth in Egypt.

For the investigation I submitted a database that depends on the data of 1000 women who gave birth in Egyptian hospitals, about their exposure to obstetric violence or not, and it revealed shocking violations.

 Women usually do not disclose that they have been subjected to abuse during childbirth, in order to avoid social stigma and the difficulty of proving that the violations occurred. 

Some women even believe that some of these abuses are normal and do not constitute a violation.

 The investigation resonated among women and civil society organizations, especially those who work on women and health rights, and contributed to raising women's awareness of their rights during childbirth, and what they should do if they are subjected to any transgressions.

 The Cairo Foundation for Development and Law, a feminist organization concerned with women's health rights, has launched a hotline to provide legal and psychological support to women who have been subjected to childbirth violence.

It also organized a campaign to educate women about their rights while receiving health care, during medical examinations and giving birth.","The investigation relies on analyzing data from official health surveys from 1995 to 2021, as well as health studies in which the World Health Organization, the International Population Council and the official Ministry of Health participated, in order to provide data on the general context of health care provided to women, places for women to obtain health care, and their preferences. About places to receive medical services, and the reasons for their reluctance to receive care in government places.

In order to provide more specific data about obstetric violence and violation of privacy, I designed a questionnaire that included 18 questions, and 1,000 women participated in answering it, all of whom gave birth in governmental, university and private Egyptian hospitals and representatives of various Egyptian regions, with the aim of revealing the state of respect for women’s privacy, the extent of their exposure to violence during childbirth, and covering Absence of data addressing this issue.

In writing the investigation, I relied on the digital storytelling method, and I flirted with data with stories to employ the dense data more effectively, and we provided simplified designs for the data to ensure the best comprehension and analysis from the reader.","I was working on a data-driven investigation on the inflated rates of cesarean section deliveries in Egypt, which ranks first in the world at 72% of deliveries, while disciplined global rates estimate the necessary percentage at only 15%.

The main reason for the high rates of cesarean section and the endangerment of mothers and newborns was the guidance of doctors and the lack of controls for resorting to cesarean section, but the other prominent reason is what women states: ""I do not want their hands to enter my body without permission and without reason.""

Women's health rights do not receive much attention, either officially or popularly, in Egypt. Their complaints are ignored on the grounds that they are emotional and exaggerate the impact of Obstetric violence on them! Most women avoid complaining to avoid social stigmatization.!

As for the violations they are exposed to during childbirth, such as breaching privacy and conducting vaginal examinations without permission and without explaining their purpose and sometimes unnecessarily, they are dealt with as an emergency event that ends with childbirth. As for its psychological and physical impact on women, it is not usually paid attention to.

Women who are subjected to childbirth violence suffer more because of their lack of support and understanding that they were affected by the traumatic experience they went through, and because most violations are usually committed against poor women, the violence and pressure is double and of course passes without account.

To prove the extent of the problem and the extent of the damage, it was necessary to present an investigation driven by data. Global data was available, but because the matter does not receive governmental attention in Egypt, there are no official local data available at all. Unfortunately, no data was also available on civil society institutions, except for what they collected from some Testimonies of women who experienced childbirth violence.

I designed a questionnaire for women who gave birth in Egyptian hospitals, and 1,000 women shared their data and experiences. Analysis of their data revealed shocking rates of obstetric violence in its various forms that women face in Egypt.

The poorest women, and those who delivered their children in government or teaching hospitals, were the most likely to have their privacy violated, as they were subjected to vaginal examinations without permission, without a cover, unnecessarily, and collectively, and most of them were unable to refuse on the grounds that they were placed in a government hospital.

Some women underwent surgical procedures (episiotomy and suturing) unnecessarily and without permission, and some were subjected to excessive narrowing of the vagina under the pretext of sexual gratification of their husbands.

Confronting obstetric violence and the violation of privacy during childbirth is one of women's human rights, and it is able to protect hundreds of thousands of women and newborns annually in Egypt from the risks of medically unjustified caesarean section.","I think the most important thing we can talk about in this project is:

 Capturing the story.. the stories on the side of the road as our professor in journalism teaches us. In this project, a woman I met by chance was telling me about her beautiful newborn and her postpartum depression, and suddenly she began to remember how every doctor, medical student or nurse used to put his hand in her vagina to examine her when he was born. This was done without her permission and without explaining the reason, en masse.

 Verifying the story.. This was my second stage to verify that the woman’s story is real first and that it occurs repeatedly second, and here I discovered dozens of violations that affected other women.

 Using data.. The use of data was necessary to reveal the size and forms of violations against women, who commit them, where and their impact on women, and other important details, to highlight the depth of the problem and societal normalization with it as a normal matter despite being a horrific violation that affects the bodies and lives of women, their future and their families.

 Not stopping in front of the lack of data.. The lack of data is, of course, a problem, and in this project, there are no official data at all, just as there is no data available from Local civil society institutions.
 
 The alternative was to create a database that includes data and testimonies of 1,000 Egyptian women who gave birth in Egyptian hospitals, and analyze the data to provide information and data that address this problem for the first time, which revealed a horrific reality faced by women in delivery rooms, especially those who are poorer and who are forced to give birth in hospitals government.","Arabic, English",https://en.sharikawalaken.media/compulsory-medical-examination-obstetric-violence-is-not-held-accountable/,https://www.sharikawalaken.media/2022/12/06/%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%AC%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%91-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8/,https://arij.net/investigations/Caesarean-section-en/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CmB77Inu_rg/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_QMlIuOTHluKymC5F2GcFaAk19OKDMSH/view?usp=drivesdk,,,"Ruba El-Helou, professor of political media and gender, supervised the investigation's production.","I'm an Egyptian journalist with more than 13 years of experience.

Germany,This website is part of a project «Edit Wars» that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (MediaFutures «Artist for media») under grant agreement No. 951962,Small,Participant,,Edit Wars,2022-10-10,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Infographics, Politics","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Tableau 
Google BigQuery",Edit Wars is a project using the analysis of media publications accompanying the growing militarization and manipulation of mass consciousness in Russia for a better understanding of the mechanics of state propaganda and ways to build resilience towards it. The project focus on the use of aggressive narratives in the government-controlled media that isolate public perception from the real state of affairs.,"The aim of our project is to deconstruct, debunk and artistically interpret the narratives of Russian propaganda. We see this as the key to raising awareness and resilience against misinformation among international audiences. Our team consists of 6 media artists, journalists and developers from Germany and Georgia. Some of us are native Russian speakers, with language research and media analysis background. Our personal experience of being subjected to propadanda and fighting against it in Russia for years makes us feel responsible as we see the very real consequences of a growing state propaganda apparatus.
Our project consists of the following components:
- Data research of media headlines during the beginning of the war and the editwars.org media platform for publishing English-language analytical reviews and interactive infographics (ten narrative reviews, we have published three)
- Exhibition with an interactive installation. It includes elements of visualization and sonification of data and tracking of body position in space. It will take place in Bremen, Germany, at the beginning of February 2023.
- Launch of a discussion platform in the exhibition space.

Art can counteract propaganda using non-standard creative interpretations and should not stand aside. It can be a carrier of an anti-war message and a tool to promote critical thinking. 
Our project contributes to the following:
- Raising awareness and drawing the audience's attention to the problem of manipulating mass consciousness.
- Spreading awareness of the importance of critical thinking and media literacy.
- Neutralization of propaganda through deconstruction. We explain in clear language what narratives are and how they work.
- Prevention of stigmatization and dehumanization of Russian society - to reduce the hatred and bring more clarity.","The first iteration of the project is based on data analysis of propaganda narratives created and reproduced by the Russian digital media from January to July 2022. The methodology we developed allows us to replicate the results of our research and contains algorithms for working with data from the source to the end result. We encourage stakeholders to use it as a basis for their own research on propaganda narratives. Link to full methodology https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-l0Eehe_5LkzkVgGjkDR78s6Fi4z-BOFgKY5JUEinQ/edit
By using GDELT Global Difference Graph (GDG) databases, we analyzed more than 250,000 newsheaders of Russian-language media publications. We used machine learning tools (in particular, the BERTopic algorithm) to thematically clusterize data and to obtain relevant topics with the dynamics of their change. Additionally, we also applied Tableau to discover typical words and phrases of propaganda. Finally, we extracted word connections in headlines and visualized the resulting network graph using Spacy library.
GitHub Repository https://github.com/EditWarsTeam","* In Russia in 2022, amid a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, all independent online media have been destroyed or blocked. The monopoly of information allows the state to be a sole storyteller, and to create a distorted picture of the world without any alternative point of view. It displaces any public counterpoint to a cultivation of enemy image, imperial resentment, justification of aggressive war, and ""Newspeak"" of the state propaganda.
* We consulted with independent media representatives to determine the study's content (organized a meeting in Tbilisi in August 2022)
* Our high concept is that we can place the data research results in an artistic interpretation frame by creating an interactive installation. We draw the attention of other artists to the possibilities of such research through scalability.","We explored which key themes, messages and propaganda techniques formed a parallel reality for the Russian audience after the invasion of Ukraine. Using the GDELT open database, we analyzed more than 500,000 headlines with machine-learning tools to understand how the war in Ukraine is covered in the Russian-based state-acceptable media. Using clusteriztion, we extracted 150 relevant topics and grouped them around 10 propaganda narratives. These include toxic ideas about the continuation of the Cold War, accusing the enemy of genocide and supporting neo-Nazism, and the degradation of Western culture.
Narrative as a communication tool which offers an alternative form of history that can be used to interpret reality. It embellishes the causes and development of an event. It creates characters and their features and is built on underlying myths, cultural imperatives and traditions. 
We evaluated the narrative dynamics and their interrelation with events taking place, compared them with media reactions and were able to build contextual networks from the popular word combinations.
After receiving significant input from experts in the fields of art, data analysis and independent journalism, we found important to create a concrete tool to fight misinformation and generate awareness. Therefore the online platform for publishing analysis of propaganda is not only an artistic expression, but also the research media. Our methodology is open-source and can be applied for further research, as well as our Git repositories.",English,https://editwars.org/,,,,,,,"Alberto Harres, Antonio Hofmeister Ribeiro, Lucy Saribegyan, Maiia Guseva, Slava Romanov, Sofya Ozga","Alberto Harres - Artist and Developer based in Germany, studing at the University of the Arts Bremen

When I thought about it, I ruminated on what measurements the Mexican environmental authorities have, which policies are enabled to reduce that pollution, and the roadmap to comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requirements. As part of IMO, Mexico is obliged to achieve its targets. The country lacks nitrous dioxide and sulfur dioxide measurements, its registries of marine incidents in Mexican waters are incomplete, and it doesn’t have a roadmap for the IMO targets.","The investigation was one of the most popular in the Spanish section during the week of publication and its English version moved well too. It was republished by other media outlets. The research exposed an ignored problem by authorities and environmental organisations, and has helped to instill conscience among academics and environmental NGOs. In its Bussiness Plan 2022-2027 Pemex announced it will refine ultra-low sulfur gasolines, including marine diesel, to comply with the Mexican regulation and to lower pollution. In addition to it, some international vessels and cruise ships have begun to install scrubbers to filter pollutants. One of the expectations for 2023 is a new piece of legislation on the use of scrubbers on board.","The research involved 30 FOIA requests to various government agencies on measurement data, incidents registry, and law violations. The research implied the analysis of databases on port traffic, trade by ports, marine incidents and satellite images of non-registered incidents. The whole sets of data served to confirm the hypothesis that Mexico lacks a comprehensive framework for addressing marine pollution, vital for fighting the causes and effects of the climate crisis and for achieving the 13 and 14 SDG targets, of the whole 17 by 2030.","The investigation was challenging, because it involved understanding and analysis of technical and technological issues to have an idea of how to deal with the pollution generated by ships. Also it involved the understanding of the international and national legislation. The analysis of the databases was time-demanding and the tracking of the vessels involved in environmental incidents. As an exclusive research, there was scant knowledge about the issue in Mexico. So it was built from scratch and on novel ideas about it and on the FOIA requests. One effort was to convince the satellite company on the images and analysis sharing, the first to show contamination incidents incorporated into a journalistic investigation.","Colleagues might do a follow-up on the issue. The investigation shows the usefulness to use FOIA requests when there is no available public information and to know what data governmental agencies have on environmental issues, reinforced by the Escazu Agreement –in force since 2021 and to which Mexico belongs– and what type of policies they apply and their results. The research shows the importance of considering different angles to take into consideration, to build a comprehensive picture of the issue. It also highlights the importance of the use of satellite images, a growing trend in environmental studies, and the alliance between media and satellite enterprises for the common good. Finally, colleagues can learn how to use transport tracking platforms to identify ships and their routes to review possible contamination incidents.","Spanish, English",https://www.ipsnews.net/2022/12/an-ineffective-mexico-in-the-face-of-maritime-pollution/,https://ipsnoticias.net/2022/12/mexico-inoperante-ante-creciente-contaminacion-maritima/,,,,,,"Emilio Godoy (author), Amrita Gupta (English editor), Lucy Calderon (Spanish editor), Estrella Gutierrez (Spanish reviewer), Johana Claudio (illustrator)","Emilio Godoy has been a journalist since 1996.

Ecuador,Indómita Media,Small,Participant,,"A vaccine against covid-19 with a gender perspective, please",2022-03-24,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Infographics, Women, Covid 19, Health","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, -Google forms","This journalistic investigation focused on the side effects of the covid-19 vaccine on menstrual cycles, an issue reported by thousands of women around the world, but ignored by the scientific and pharmaceutical industry. It gathered data through a survey made in Ecuador, and contrasted it with other data from other countries, testimonies, interviews with experts and bibliographical sources. It showed that there was a direct relation between the vaccine and menstrual changes and also exposed the lack of gender perspective not only in the creation of this vaccine, but in science in general.","This investigation evidenced, through data, something that thousands of women in Latin America and around the world were feeling without having clear or concrete responses from the medical and pharmaceutical industry. It showed not only that the side effects of the covid-19 vaccines on the menstrual cycles are real, independently of the brand, and that is necessary to include them in the official list of side effects to prevent women and other menstruant people; but also that there was a lack of gender focus in the development of the vaccines. It also clearly exposed the link between this topic and sexual and reproductive rights; and raised awareness on the need to include the gender focus on all scientific investigations and in the pharmaceutical industry in general.
Moreover, it put the focus on the importance of data and investigative journalism with a gender perspective to expose issues like this.
The publication was read by more than 4,000 people from 15 different countries including Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, United States, Spain, and others. For its revelations and rigor, it won the Pfizer Andean Cluster Award on Health Journalism 2022 in Ecuador. After this award, I received dozens of comments via Twitter from people of different countries, saying they appreciated the angle of the story and that this investigation was fundamental for them to understand something that was being neglected by doctors and that was not a priority for traditional media.","For this investigation, I created a survey of 25 questions, answered by 480 menstruating people, mainly women, who received at least one dose of the covid-19 vaccine. 392 of the people who answered the survey were from Ecuador, and the others were from Colombia, Mexico, Spain, Argentina, United States and Peru. The survey was created with the accompaniment of two data experts. They were in charge of processing and analyzing the data, and created a database in Excel and a detailed report of the main findings that was explained and used as one of the main sources in my journalistic piece. For the creation of this report, we previously created 20 guiding questions that allowed the experts to make a cross tabulation to understand the correlation between different variables.

I also conducted individual in-depth interviews with four women who answered the survey, to gather testimonies and explain each case deeply through the development of the narrative piece.

To have a broader vision on the topic and obtain explanation of the data, I also conducted three more in-depth interviews with experts, including a scientist, a lawyer that was leading an investigation on this topic in Peru, and a spokesperson from a NGO specialized in Sexual and Reproductive Rights. I contacted the Ministry of Public Health in Ecuador, but they did not gave me an interview. Moreover, to gather information about the clinical trials, I researched the Clinical Trials database (www.clinicaltrials.gov). This allowed me to confirm that the clinical trials on the vaccines did not consider the gender variable in their development. I also searched for different studies on the topic, published in different scientific journals.

Finally, I created infographic pieces that organize and display some of the most important data of the main findings and are embedded in the main text.","This project was very challenging in a context in which women were not receiving information and validation about something they were experimenting, while there was a lot of misinformation and anti-vaxx discourses being spread through social media. It created the need to reveal information that even when exposing side effects, would not encourage people to untrust science, but question an industry that usually ignores half of the population's needs. It was defying to create a well written and trustworthy piece that presented flaws from the industry but at the same time ensured the need of vaccination against covid-19.
It also was fundamental to understand and explain the context of the fight of women in Latin America to obtain sexual and reproductive rights: the story details how not having information about the effects on menstrual cycle could lead, in worst case scenarios, to unwanted pregnancies, in a context in which women are fighting to have legal access to abortion and were thousands of women lost access to contraceptives during the pandemic.
Moreover, the lack of gender perspective in data and investigative journalism made it difficult to access certain information. For example, in Ecuador, some governmental and official sources are not keen to talk to journalists like me, who specialize in gender stories, because they consider it less important than other matters; as happened with the Ministry of Public Health when I contacted them looking for information. This was especially contradictory because the actual Government used the vaccination campaign as a political tool, saying it was successful.","I think it can help colleagues to understand that journalism with a gender perspective is not only covering gender-based violence and femicide, but that it can be transversal to every topic, including health and science. And most important, that investigative journalism is extremely necessary not only to expose findings but to change realities; and that women's and diversities issues can (and must) be explored with data, in-depth tools and multimedia elements. Also, it is a great example to understand that sometimes the data is not fully available and that we can create databases ourselves, with the help of our audiences and communities and then process the information.",Spanish,https://indomita.media/vacuna-covid-menstruacion-investigacion/,https://docs.google.com/document/d/11rc_HNmQzRPC3sKbxIK2MhSS_R_3vDMscRRI4THpHus/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pTxUqoZDh_b3VqoiVhjN5YA50DxaK0c8-eCog0lQGno/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14lnK_sdt72C_4zD5M69iz8nmAmn8reLoNC487aMVPz4/edit?usp=sharing,,,,"-Investigation, reporting and writing: Thalíe Ponce

Además representa una explicación clara sobre las razones por las que el servicio 12 años después de su inauguración continue en etapa preoperativa, no se puede mejorar ni tampoco cambiar de empresas concesionarias por lo que cuando se termine de construir el sistema de transporte del Metropolitano, los ciudadanos de Lima están obligados a esperar 20 años más a que termine la culminación del contrato.","Este reportaje fue construido en tres partes: 1) investigación y análisis de los informes de la contraloría https://appbp.contraloria.gob.pe/BuscadorCGR/Informes/Avanzado.html desde diciembre de 2020 hasta diciembre de 2021 y contratos entre las empresas y el estado, 2) redacción de los principales hallazgos y razones de los retrasos en la fecha de entrega de la ampliación del sistema metropolitano de transporte de Lima y 3) visualización de datos y construcción del sitio web con HTML/JS/CSS usando tecnologías como Open Street Map para el mapa que recorre el tramo norte, Billboard JS para las gráficas de la diferencia de recaudación y Flourish para la línea de tiempo.","El alcalde que construyó este sistema de transporte, Luis Castañeda Lossio fue procesado por la creación de la empresa Comunicore en donde se encontraron casos de corrupción y lavado de activos que involucró a la Municipalidad de Lima durante la segunda gestión de dicho alcalde, periodo en el que se construyó el Metropolitano. Desde que se inauguró este servicio de transporte hace 12 años apenas ha sido modificado y representa un peligro para los ciudadanos puesto que se han encontrado estaciones sin servicios de emergencia, con escaleras electricas en mal estado y buses que transportan más pasajeros de lo permitido por su capacidad.

En tanto al acceso a los datos, este informe se basó en su mayoría en leer uno por uno los informes de la Contraloría de la nación puesto que la información pública por parte de la municipalidad sobre el estado de los buses, el flujo de trabajo de las empresas concesionarias o la recaudación monetaria es muy escasa. Cabe destacar que en los últimos años los contratos de concesión pasaron de estar a cargo de la municipalidad al gobierno central a través de la creación de la Autoridad de Transporte Urbano por lo que mucha información que estaba en internet fue perdida.","Creo que lo más relevante de este proyecto es poder conectar una necesidad básica de la ciudadanía como es el transporte con la explicación de los problemas engorrosos y burocráticos que no permiten brindar un buen servicio al que puedan acceder todos de forma democrática. En Perú debido a la constitución actual se prioriza la economía y el beneficio a la inversión privada por sobre el bienestar de la población y se ha normalizado que cada uno vea por su propio beneficio en lugar de velar por un bienestar colectivo, de esta manera se ha desarrollado un sentido común que entiende que el sector privado administra mejor que el estado. En este caso, la construcción de este informe demuestra que eso no es cierto, que los procesos están envueltos en incumplimientos contractuales en donde son las mismas empresas, en colusión con entidades estatales, las que dilatan los procesos.",Spanish,https://data.larepublica.pe/metropolitano-irregularidades-y-motivos-detras-del-retraso-de-ampliacion-hasta-carabayllo/,https://twitter.com/LRData/status/1519843805826105345,,,,,,"Milagros Requena en edición

Depended upon by over 20 communities, with more than two million residents and revered for its cultural and religious powers by millions of followers across the world, the River which houses a sacred grove which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, is now a source of concern over the murky waters and toxic wastes widely believed to have been brought about by gold mining activities.","The project ""Saving the Osun River"", which tells a distinct, daring and investigative story bordering on the clandestine activities in the gold mining industry in Ijesaland and its impact on the Osun river, for the first time investigates the truth behind the pollution of the Osun river, by adopting a scientific and data driven apporach with unrefutable results which point out not only the impact of bringing the plight of Nigerians most affected by the illegal mining operations in the country to the fore, but long after its conclusion, the data gathered and evidence produced in this first of a trilogy has led to the placement of a ban on all mining activities in Osun state, Nigeria in December 2022. (https://bit.ly/3Gk2q71 ). 

This groundbreaking investigative documentary, has also opened up the conversation on other pollutants of the river; which hadnt happened before, beyond findings showing the presence of heavy metals such as Lead, Cyanide and Mercury are prevalent in the waters, much more alarming and largely underreported; which this investigations unveils is the presence of Arsenic 0.08mg/l which is higher than the WHO standards of 0.01mg/l brought about by the tie and dye industry right there at the grove, as well as farmlands where DDT is also present among chemicals used for pesticides to protect Cocoa crops in farms that run along the river.","Using Google Earth’s satellite imagery, I was able to trace the source of the pollution along the 267KM river which runs along several affected communities in Osun state esspecially around Ijesaland. Having a clear overview of the river paths and chanels helped in the decision taken on the river paths understudied ie mining sites at the Oora river which leads to the Osogbo grove and then the Asejire endpoint where water samples were collected to establish the impact of gold mining activities and metals produced. The adoption of the imagery helped to be more strategic in this investigation. 

I also adopted data drawn from a period of 5 years by researchers who had run several tests such as physicochemical water quality analytical tests in labs, by researchers whose works have been published in global journals, and I also carried out my own water sample test across three different points of the 247KM Osun river to ascertain any differences had over seasons, so as to ascertain the impact of metals found in the river.","The illicit activities of illegal Chinese miners engaged in alluvial mining and the illegal artisanal gold miners; spread all over Ijeshaland, Osun State, Nigeria has resulted in massive environmental degradation, polluted drinking water & health challenges, as well as, unprecedented economic loss to local, State, Federal Government & the grassroots economy. It has also resulted in the abuse of the rule of law especially as it impacts the communities negatively. Allegations have often abounded about the complicity of the governement of the day in issueing licences and turning a blind eye on these illicit activities, as well as well as issuing licences indiscriminately to its cronies. 

The reckless environmental, pollution of soil, and water sources, destruction of farmlands and unregulated mining in Ijeshaland has been predicted to get worse, If nothing is done to check & remediate the aforementioned environmental, water & health challenges believed to be caused solely by unregulated mining activities. However, while the pollution of the river has been established, the only ties made have been to mining activities, up until this project have been underreported, which opens up other sources of pollution. 

This particular project involved not just funds that I had to expend personally, as a result of tests carried out across different points of the river, but coallating the data had to be done from scratch. Tests carried out had to be done out of the state, as a result of a lack of laboratories offering such services within. 

The use of natural ambience to get the listeners to understand the points being made was alos technical, hence the use of strong storytelling to avoid sounding too scientific.","I believe that journalists can learn the importance and adoption of storytelling in getting audience to relate more with scientific researches such as this. While the need for strong evidence and data in building a solid case was necessary, a lot of that could have been lost in transition for the intended audience if not properly relayed. The storytelling implemented, helped to break information down in such a way that audiences could understand and take ownership of the story produced. 

The need for journalists to conduct THEIR own research can aslo be learnt from this project. Up until this body of work was put together, the assumption was that the mining activities were soley responsible for the water pollution and all other sources hadnt been explored. I was convinced to take a wholesome approach instead of going with the more popular views on the gold mining situation being a SOLE cause of the pollution. This instinct helped in the discovery of even more worrisome and dangerous sources of some of the metals similar to that produced by the gold mining along the river chanels, hereby opening up a new conversation. Conducting my own research also helped in not getting caught in certain agendas by some on state actors which the popular narrative; ie ""gold mining narrative being the sole source of concern"" favored. 

Journalists should conduct their own researches as much as they can.",English,https://soundcloud.com/babatundeokunlola/saving-the-osun-river,https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/12/adeleke-suspends-operators-of-osun-mining-licences/,https://twitter.com/InternewsHJN/status/1587759975190990848,,,,,Babatunde Okunlola,"Babatunde Okunlola is a multiple award-winning development journalist, documentary maker and media consultant using media for development, and covers an intersection of issues on Environment, health, security and policies as they affect underreported and underrepresented communities in Nigeria, using data and storytelling.

Na região onde elas vivem, as chuvas se concentram em apenas quatro meses do ano. Nos demais, ocorre a estiagem. Descobrimos que, por essa razão, a vida delas, principais responsáveis pelo abastecimento de suas casas, gira em torno da busca pela água. Os dados nos ajudaram a analisar como a desaceleração na principal política de acesso à água no Brasil, nos últimos quatro anos, afetou essas mulheres.","Desde a nossa equipe de reportagem até o público leitor, jamais imaginava que, no Brasil do século XXI, haviam mulheres impedidas de serem cidadãs por não ter acesso à água de consumo humano. Não sabíamos que em uma região longínqua do país, havia mulheres que passavam três meses do ano caminhando em busca de água, um recurso básico, um direito humano. Sistematizar e traduzir esta realidade em dados foi inovador, permitiu denunciar para o próprio Brasil o peso da escassez hídrica para as mulheres. Isso ocorre porque na região onde essas mulheres vivem, historicamente, cabe a elas abastecer a casa com água. Desta forma, elas sentem na pele o fardo maior de não terem acesso a esse recurso de consumo humano. Até então, esse aspecto não era tão abordado nos textos e muito menos evidenciado por meio de dados. A nossa reportagem trouxe um dado novo: mulheres caminham, em média, 90 dias por água. Além disso, usamos os dados para analisar e contar a história da principal política pública de acesso à água do país, o Programa Cisterna, que à época, estava praticamente paralisado por falta de investimento. Ao longo desses 20 anos de existência, esse foi um dos poucos e primeiros registros sobre esta política, que foi proposta pela sociedade civil organizada, e que mostrou êxito, como mostram os nossos dados, não apenas em levar água de consumo humano para populações remotas, mas também, atender as mulheres, principais afetadas peja escassez hídrica. Este aspecto tornou o nosso conteúdo inovador e mostra o compromissodo verem abordar, para o público, pautas com recorte geográfico e de raça.","Acessamos bases de dados do Ministério da Cidadania e do Ministério da Economia, fazendo cruzamento desses dados. Com isso, conseguimos mostrar a relação histórica entre o aumento no investimento do programa e o aumento no número de tecnologias. Analisamos a relação entre a execução da política pública com base na proporção entre os recursos empenhados e os recursos executados a cada ano. Para facilitar a leitura, foram feitos infográficos e ilustrações. Com o recurso do infográfico, destacamos momentos importantes da política pública, tanto no aspecto positivo, quanto negativo, permitindo uma leitura em linha do tempo.","Inicialmente, esta matéria trata de uma das regiões que concentra os mais altos índices de pobreza, fome, analfabetismo e falta de infraestrutura. Ainda assim, é pouco coberta peja imprensa. Além disso, é muito difícil que as poucas coberturas realizadas tragam o recorte de gênero. Segundo, a nossa apuração se deu em um momento delicado da política brasileira no qual o acesso as fontes oficiais de dados tornou-se mais difícil e muitas outras fontes ficaram desatualizadas ou saíram do ar. A busca por esses dados foi um processo ainda mais complexo do que o comum. Por fim, as personagens retratadas nesta matéria vivem em regiões remotas do Semiárido, de difícil acesso e difícil comunicação, não costumam ter oportunidades de falar para a imprensa. Localizá-las e estabelecer um contato, entrevisá-las, exigiu um processo de produção especial, mas valeu à pena porque pudemos trazer a tona uma história real, que se passa em um Brasil, que ainda épouco conhecido por diversas pessoas.","Acreditamos que esse projeto ensina a importância de , inicialmente, denunciar realidades de violação dos direitos humanos em regiões remotas, mesmo que a produção da matéria apresente desafios hercúleos. Isso porque acreditamos que é papel do jornalismo retratar realidades pouco alcançadas. Segundo, mesmo diante da pouca transparência de dados, das adversidades impostas por um governo que não respeita a liberdade de imprensa, é possível e vale a pena reunir esforços para acessar os dados e continuar fiscalizando o poder público. Por fim, esta reportagem mostrou como os dados nos oferecem um mundo de possibilidades de trabalho no jornalismo. Aqui, analisamos e contamos a história de uma política pública de acesso à água, fundamental para a cidadania das mulheres e cujo processo de desaceleração estava ligado ao agravamento da escassez hídrica entre elas.

His work was referenced in an OSCE report on Russian war crimes, which confirmed more than one million Ukrainians had been taken over the Russian border.","The investigation made headlines in countries across Europe including Spain, Finland, Poland and Croatia and was followed up by media organisations in Canada, the US and Japan, including the Washington Post. Carl Bild, Sweden’s former Prime Minister, was among those who shared the investigation on Twitter and it was mentioned in the Human Rights Watch Daily Briefing. Two days after the 66 camps story, the Pentagon’s spokesman John Kirby confirmed that Washington had seen “indications that Ukrainians were being taken against their will to Russia”. The OSCE later directly referenced the investigation in a report on Russian war crimes. The report described the camps as a ""new alarming phenomena"" and said OSCE was ""gravely concerned about the mistreatment of Ukrainians in them. In July, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken confirmed that it was the US view that Russia had forcibly deported Ukrainians, often to isolated regions in the Far East. He said: ""The unlawful transfer and deportation of protected persons is a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians and is a war crime. Russian authorities must release those detained and allow Ukrainian citizens forcibly removed or coerced into leaving their country the ability to promptly and safely return home."" In September, a major report by Human Rights Watch said Russia had committed a serious violation of the laws of war and a potential crime against humanity. It said the process involved ""a form of compulsory security screening, in which they typically collected civilians’ biometric data, including fingerprints and front and side facial images; conducted body searches, and searched personal belongings and phones; and questioned them about their political views"". This was confirmation of my previous reporting. In total, the coverage reached an audience of 3.4 million people and prompted 130,000 engagements.","This investigation used open-source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to find an locate the camps. This involved searching social media for the camps in Russian, using a Cyrillic keyboard to translate road signs and identifying markers in videos including roads, trees and even a bus stop which were then matched up with online maps. The first camp was located using these markers as well as the unusually-shaped red roof of a farmers' market. As the camp did not show up on satellite images on Google Earth, which were not up to date, co-ordinates were passed to two satellite firms who provided up-to-date satellite imagery of the camp in the location where I expected it to be based on my anaysis. I then repeated this exercise using Russian TV news footage and other sources including Kremlin documents to establish that groups of Ukrainians were arriving in towns across Russia and, again using satellite imagery and tools including dash-cam footage, built a database of the locations of 66 camps, including a former chemical weapons site. Using this database, I calculated how many people were in these camps. This enabled me to work out an estimate for the number of camps across Russia. I also made gifs of some of the locations on Sentinel Hub, which showed the camps being built. I was also able to use the same techniques to find a number of detention centres in Ukraine. The investigation also used traditional reporting techniques including interviews with people who had been in the camps to reveal the full extent of the filtration system from within Ukraine to the far reaches of Russia and to show how it was centrally co-ordinated by Moscow.","This investigation involved finding temporary camps that were being built behind the frontlines of the war in Ukraine - out of the public eye and far beyond the access of foreign correspondents based in the country - and deep in the countryside in Russia, the largest country on Earth. It at first seemed an impossible task to locate the camps, particularly as a non-Russian speaker, but using novel OSINT techniques made it possible. At the time I first reported on this issue, world governments and human rights organisations including the ICRC were unable to confirm my reporting because they had no evidence of their own on which to substantiate the evidence. It was only months later that they were able to provide confirmation.",This investigation shows what can be achieved by journalists using OSINT techniques combined with traditional journalism skills.,English,https://inews.co.uk/news/ukraine-russia-war-putin-mauripol-deportations-filtration-camps-1539050-1539050,https://inews.co.uk/news/vladimir-putin-ukraine-russia-mariupol-siberia-kremlin-1569431,https://inews.co.uk/news/mariupol-ukraine-russia-war-leonidovka-putin-1579199,https://inews.co.uk/news/putin-mariupol-survivors-remote-corners-russia-investigation-network-camps-1615516,https://inews.co.uk/news/mariupol-siege-bombing-russia-putin-mayor-vadym-boychenko-1633560,https://inews.co.uk/news/mariupol-civilians-prison-detained-russia-putin-filtration-1637957,https://inews.co.uk/news/ukrainians-interrogated-russian-filtration-camps-threatened-death-gunpoint-1654195,"Dean Kirby, Investigations Correspondent",Dean Kirby is i's Investigations Correspondent.

The team at Dataphyte had scraped thousands of public contract data from an open government portal maintained by the Oyo state government & during the data cleaning process, found tons of anomalies. 

The investigation exposed contract inflation & exposed how these cronies used briefcase companies to win the government contracts.

It has also led to social media campaigns in demand for accountability.

The report has been aired on different radio stations, elicited calls for the house of assembly in the state to wade into the revelations and has been published locally and internationally (online and print). The state government has been issuing endless press releases to wade off pressure constantly mounting on it over demand for accountability.

The investigative series has also become a template for journalists in Nigeria to expose open contracting fraud, with many journalists and media houses now using the standard, a development that has strengthened accountability and contracting transparency in the country. 

This is key given that 60% of corruption in the country is tied to contract, an issue that is changing and receiving more attention after #NotebookGate series.

We analysed beneficial ownership data of 45mb with over 100,000 rows .

The beneficial ownership data were sourced from the Corporate Affairs Commission of the country while the team also scraped data from B2bHint through Python to complement what was gotten from the Corporate Affairs Commission portal.

The investigation deployed OSINT to run a social network analysis, tracing the social record and history of the company owners and the state governor, linking them after the analysis.","After publication of the first part report, the state government threatened legal action, claiming that the report was untrue.

However, in the face of such attempt to stiffle the investigation, two other series of investigations were released under the NotebookGate.

Russia,Важные истории (Istories Media),Small,Participant,,Зарубежные активы российских политически значимых лиц и членов их семей,2022-09-08,"Investigation, Cross-border, Database, Open data, OSINT, Map, Satellite images, Corruption, Money-laundering","Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap","Мы составили путеводитель по зарубежной недвижимости российских политически значимых лиц и их близких, которые ответственны за войну в Украине. Наша цель - собрать в одном месте как ранее известные объекты недвижимости, так и с помощью различных инструментов найти новые активы. 

Чтобы избежать заморозки и конфискации активов, многие российские политики переписывают недвижимость на дальних родственников, подставных лиц и оффшорные компании. Для властей западных стран это создает трудности в поиске активов и применении санкций. 

Наша цель - собрать в одном месте как ранее известные объекты недвижимости, так и с помощью различных инструментов найти новые активы. Путеводитель регулярно обновляется с появлением новых находок.","Для властей западных стран наш путеводитель стал хорошим источником информации для применения санкций и поиске активов, которые они раньше не могли найти. Для аудитории наш проект продемонстрировал лицемерие российских политиков, которые официально враждуют с Западом, но обустраивают там свою жизнь. Проект выявил потенциальные нарушения законы - сокрытие недвижимости от декларирования, незаконное обогащение. Проект вдохновил журналистов и общественных деятелей из России и других стран искать зарубежные активы российких политиков в своих странах, мы работали в сотрудничестве с журналистами из 7 стран. Аудитория была вовлечена в проект: читатели регулярно присылают нам информацию о зарубежных активах российских политиков.","Мы собрали и проанализировали массив деклараций российских политиков за разные годы (кто владел зарубежной недвижимостью и в каких странах)
Мы проанализировали архивные публикации в российских и зарубежных СМИ, форумы, телеграм-каналы, чтобы найти упоминания о зарубежной недвижимости, бизнесе, путешествиях, работе или учебе нужных лиц. Многие публикации и страницы в соцсетях были удалены и нам приходилось их восстанавливать с помощью различных инструментов.
Мы установили родственные связи российских политиков, нашли членов их семей и неформальные связи, чтобы понять, на кого могут быть записаны зарубежные активы. 
Мы анализировали социальные сети политиков и близких людей, чтобы понять, в каких странах и где конкретно у них может быть недвижимость.
Мы сопоставляли выгрузки из реестров разных стран со списками российских публичных должностных лиц, чтобы найти совпадения по фамилиям
Мы работали с зарубежными реестрами 16 стран - не только с кадастровыми реестрами, но и бизнес-реестрами, реестрами жителей, реестрами судов, телефонными справочниками. Делали запросы в органы власти, чтобы подтвердить информацию","В ходе работы над проектом мы столкнулись с большим массивом данных: в России очень большое количество политических значимых лиц - чиновников, депутатов, сенаторов...
Поскольку многие из них записывают недвижимость на родственников, нам предстояло установить родственные связи некоторых российских политиков. В России это закрытая информация, государственные реестры не предоставляют сведения о родственных связях и в каждом случае приходится придумывать индивидуальную схему расследования, состоящую из методов OSINT.
Главная сложность, с которой мы столкнулись - разное устройство кадастровых реестров в каждой стране ЕС. В одних странах можно быстро и легко найти недвижимость людей и получить выписки, другие страны вообще практически не предоставляют никакие сведения, в третьих странах поиск существенно ограничен (например, нельзя искать по фамилии и имени, необходимо знать точный адрес). Для каждой страны нам приходилось придумывать индивидуальную поисковую стратегию, для получения результата приходилось комбинировать различными реестрами и базами данных (бизнес-реестром, реестром жителей, судебным реестром, телефонными справочниками и так далее). В отдельных случаях мы иссоледовали геометки и фотографии из социальных сетей, по ним определяли примерное местоположение недвижимости и заказывали большой массив выписок. 
В некоторых странах удалось получить большие массивы выгрузок всех собственников недвижимости. С помощью програмных методов мы соотносили эти списки со списками публичных должностных лиц, чтобы выявить совпадения.
Мы еще не закончили наш проект, он регулярно обновляется по мере поступления новой информации - у нас есть большой список чиновников, чью недвижимость мы еще не нашли, но по косвенным признакам, у них есть зарубежные активы.","В ходе работы над проектом мы разработали новые приемы для поиска родственных связей и механизмы работы с реестрами ряда стран. Некоторые механизмы поиска недвижимости и получения выписок ранее никем не применялись; в некоторых странах никто из журналистов ранее не мог брать выписки на недвижимость. 
Также коллеги могут научиться механизму поиска совпадения в массивых данных","English, Russian",https://zarubezhnye-aktivy.istories.media/en/,https://zarubezhnye-aktivy.istories.media/,,,,,,Roman Romanovskii,"Роман Романовский, журналист-расследователь.

Readers are invited to explore the complex funding networks that underpin US politics through a Javascript-based web application that visualizes the sums exchanged by nearly 5000 candidates, corporations, and PACs during the 2022 election cycle.","I’ll start with honesty: this project’s metrics would not be impressive. I created it out of passion and because I believed in the importance of the material, but I’m only 18. As a first year computer science student at Reed College, I simply don’t have the platform to take it much farther than the limited reach of a teenager’s social media accounts. But I’ll tell you what I hope the impact of this project could be. Growing up in the United States during the years when Donald Trump sat in the Oval Office shook me in ways I still don’t fully understand. Even years later, I still viscerally remember sitting with my mother to watch one of the former President's few press briefings in the White House, and hearing her say, quite softly, “I can’t believe I’m watching this,” with a kind of despair I wasn’t used to hearing from my parents. Looking back with the benefit of hindsight, I think that she, like many Jewish people in the US during that time, felt powerless. When I began researching the 2022 midterms as a student journalist, it was that sense of powerlessness that stuck with me: the fear that a system, a nation, meant to serve its people could still be incomprehensible at times. My desire to change that was what led me to this story, an effort to process thousands of campaign finance records — public but so scattered and time consuming to research as to be out of reach of most voters — and make them accessible to all. Knowledge is power. That is the idea that has always guided me in my journalism work, and I hope that this story, and others like it, can serve to give that knowledge, that power, back to the people.","The most important tool I used in the creation of this project was undoubtedly [opensecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org/), a nonprofit journalism site that collects and publishes data on US elections. I scraped the source data for the story from the Open Secrets website and public API using the R programming language, and processed the resulting data in RStudio. A GitHub repository containing a copy of those R scripts, and the complete dataset I ultimately used, can be found under project link 3. I imported the resulting data on transactions during the 2022 midterms into a piece of software called Gephi, which specializes in processing large network graphs. I then used Gephi to arrange the data points for representatives and donors based on the force-directed Fruchterman Reingold algorithm. It is interesting to note that I provided Gephi with no information about the political alignment of any datapoint, so any appearance of partisan arrangement in the final graph is purely a result of the efficiency calculations the algorithm made based on financial connections. For more information on this process, see the GitHub repository for the standalone interactive. Gephi generated a network graph in the GEXF file format, which I then transformed into an interactive web application using the React and sigma.js Javascript libraries and the Materialize CSS library. This standalone application is available under project link 2. Finally, I wrote a cover story based on the data using simple HTML and CSS and published it to GitHub Pages, which serves as the primary link above.","In an article for Vox published in December 2018, which I read at the time and look back on as a major influence on my high school journalism, David Roberts wrote that “journalism in the late 20th and early 21st century was constrained on the supply side, and that shaped many of the professional practices and social norms around it. … The internet changed all that. There are no longer supply constraints — it is trivially cheap and easy to publish something on the web — and there are virtually no constraints left on the supply of information. Libraries are online. Government records are online. Every public figure’s every move is blogged or tweeted. … [As a result,] there’s more need for explanation. Because they were supply constrained, newspapers and newspaper journalists focused on what was new, what just happened, the incremental development. But lots of times, readers had no way of making sense of those developments or contextualizing them. They were getting the leaves, but they’d never gotten the trunk.” Even though it’s been years since I first read Roberts’ argument, I can’t imagine placing this story in any other context than that. The data I used was free and open — completely so. In fact, it was published by an organization whose sole mission is to obtain such data and make it as widely available as possible. There were no highly placed sources, no clandestine meetings with Deep Throat in a parking garage (much to the disappointment of my middle-school self). In a way I got lucky: I was born in an era in which I don’t need the connections, access, or experience of a professional journalist to start writing the stories I’m passionate about. But even with a world of data at my fingertips, when I started researching campaign finance early last year I was stumped. The numbers were opaque, the language even more so, and the data tables for individual representatives were complex and hard to place in any larger context. I was only seeing the leaves. But I believed this story was important, so I fought to understand it, and when I started to see a pattern emerging — a way of visualizing the flow of money behind power as a network of lines and connections — I taught myself the skills I needed to tell the story in a way that would let other people see it too.","In his excellent book _Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters Now_, former _Guardian_ Editor in Chief Alan Rusbridger lays out ten guiding principles of what he calls “post-print open journalism.” His first, and the one I find most interesting, is that open journalism “encourages participation. It invites and/or allows a response.” While I hesitate to say that my own work as a student has much to offer professional journalists, this project has been guided since its beginning by that passage in Rusbridger’s book. The final story presented above was written as explainer journalism on campaign finance, geared toward a college audience, but my own personal sense of the project’s core value lies almost entirely in the interactive web application itself. When I first presented an early version of that application to other student journalists at the Associated Collegiate Press Digital D.C. workshop in July, I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the presentation format broke down as the audience called out names of local representatives for me to look up and eager requests to focus in on particularly interesting subnetworks and connections. That’s the vision I have for this project: that individual voters could use it, and other visualizations like it, to research representatives and corporations of interest to them and engage in their own investigative journalism. So if there were an idea I wanted other journalists to take away from this project, it would be Rusbridger’s principle that the journalist doesn’t always shape the story. In some cases, readers’ personal use of the tools that we build can be as valuable as the story itself.",English,https://declanrjb.github.io/2022-midterms/,https://declanrjb.github.io/congress-finance/,https://github.com/declanrjb/congress-finance-data,https://github.com/declanrjb/congress-finance,,,,Declan Bradley,"Inspired to pursue journalism by his mother and grandmother, Declan Bradley began writing for his high school paper at age 13 and never looked back.

Norway,NRK,Big,Participant,,TikTok's Muscle Power: How Children are Drawn Into a World of Extreme Exercise,2022-12-03,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, OSINT","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Python","TikTok is the platform that is growing the most among children and young people in Norway. Half a million children between the ages of 9 and 18 have a user account. At the same time, the Chinese-owned company is reluctant to share how the algorithms affect our children. With the article ""TikTok's muscle power"", NRK was able to show for the first time how and how quickly a Norwegian boy is drawn into the world of extreme training on TikTok. NRK was also able to document that TikTok had failed to prevent the algorithms from serving one-sided content.","• ""This can destroy lives"", said Anette Trettebergstuen, the Norwegian Minister of Culture, after reading NRK's article. The minister brought it up in a meeting with TikTok on 9 December and asked for greater transparency around the algorithms and better moderation. TikTok replied that for the first time they will establish a contact point in Norway to have a better dialogue with the Norwegian authorities. The minister also announced a joint Nordic set of regulations to regulate TikTok and other large technology companies. For the time being, a committee has been set up to come up with proposals for measures in April.
• Three weeks after NRK put the spotlight on TikTok's algorithms and how little transparency there is around them, TikTok sent out a press release stating that they are introducing a function where you can find out the reason why a video appears in your feed.
• The article has 330.000 page views. We have received a lot of feedback from other journalists, both domestic and abroad, who wants to know more about our methods and work. We have also heard from parents all over Norway. Several have also used the opportunity to have a chat with their teenagers about what they see on social media.","Our TikTok-robot is built up by a program controlled by a computer, and a mobile phone equipped with the TikTok-app and a new user account. The user is set to be 13 years old. The robot is then tasked with using TikTok like a human boy would; by opening the TikTok-app and start watching videos appearing on the For You-page. We want to give TikTok's algorithms a hint about what our 13-year-old user is interested in. Therefore, we give the robot a list of hashtags and user accounts related to building muscle. When he encounters videos related to the keywords on our list, he will take his time watching them. Sometimes he will also hit «Like». 

For the next eight days, the robot swipes TikTok without interference.Swipe by swipe, the amount of muscle-related content rises. Three effective hours in, half of the videos watched evolves around getting bigger, stronger, and slimmer. After less than five hours, the count is 90 per cent; his feed is nearly packed with muscle-related content. During the last four days of our experiment, the count fluctuates between 75 and 90 per cent. To make sure the result isn't just a one-off, we wipe the phone and create a new TikTok-account. We then retrace our steps twice and get the same results. 

Most of our methods in this article used the Python programming language. To control an Android phone, we have used the automation tool Appium. In addition, we have used Microsoft's Azure Computer Vision API for OCR recognition. To store the data, we have mainly used the database ElasticSearch and the visualization tool Kibana. In addition, we have used SQL for queries in a database, Excel to keep information in order and Jupyter Notebook for documentation.","The algorithms of the large technology companies have long been an under-covered area among journalists in Norway, presumably because it places completely new demands on the journalists' knowledge of technology, coding and presentation. At the same time, half a million Norwegian children are at the mercy of an unknown algorithm for several hours every single day - and that's just on TikTok. In addition, other social media are working hard to imitate the addictive pattern of the TikTok algorithm. ""TikTok's muscle power"" is our contribution to putting the topic on the agenda and urging other journalists to join in and hold international technology companies accountable.","We want to be transparent and share our methods with other journalists. Therefore, we have just written down a method report (in Norwegian) in which we go into detail about how we have worked and which methods we have used. It is about, among other things, how to pretend to be a TikTok user in cities in other countries, how to systematically investigate TikTok's algorithms via the mobile app (a method that can be reused in new fields with other keywords, subject tags and user accounts) and how one finds and collects TikTok usernames in a given age group.

Nos mostraram quais aldeias precisávamos visitar e organizamos a retirada de avião de mulheres para escutá-las em um local seguro.","A reportagem provocou manifestações de diversas organizações da sociedade civil e de candidatos à Presidência da República, entre eles de Lula, que ganhou as eleições posteriormente e levou a principal liderança Yanomami, Davi Kopenawa, para a equipe de transição que discutiu as medidas urgentes para garantir a segurança dos indígenas brasileiros.",Pedidos feitos por meio da Lei de Acesso à Informação e compilação no Excel e análise de dados.,"O Território Yanomami, apesar de, em teoria, ser protegido pelo Estado brasileiro foi abandonado e invadido pelo crime organizado. Homens guardam as áreas de exploração de ouro com armas pesadas como fuzis e atacam opositores a tiros - em uma única comunidade, foram 10 ataques em um ano. Também expulsaram por meio de ameaças as equipes de saúde, único sinal do estado restante no local. Entrar nestas áreas tomadas pelo garimpo em segurança é impossível, nem as próprias forças de segurança aconselham. Os próprios indígenas que vivem nestas áreas têm medo de falar. Mas não há outra forma de ouvir as histórias das mulheres destes territórios, o que era nosso objetivo, sem ir até lá, já que elas não falam português e não saem das aldeias, distantes mais de uma hora da cidade por meio de avião. O levantamento de dados prévio nos ajudou a ser mais precisos e focar exatamente nas comunidades que precisávamos, o que reduziu nosso tempo de trabalho em campo e aumentou nossa segurança. Tentamos organizar a nossa ida para duas comunidades, mas fomos desaconselhados pelas próprias lideranças, que disseram que não teriam como garantir nossa ida em segurança. Então, tivemos que colocar em prática uma operação quase de guerra: retirar de avião mulheres de aldeias em áreas afetadas e levá-las para uma aldeia onde o garimpo ainda não chegou. Assim, promovemos um encontro de mulheres de três regiões diferentes (que os próprios dados obtidos pela Lei de Acesso nos apontaram como mais afetadas) e, com ajuda de duas tradutoras do Yanomam, ouvimos as terríveis histórias que elas vivenciam no dia a dia. Para garantir a segurança delas, não demos os nomes e nem fotos que pudessem reconhecê-las na reportagem.","Como o uso dos dados não pode, nem deve se bastar nos números. Acredito na necessidade de escutar as pessoas e as histórias por trás dos dados, porque elas ampliam e explicam os problemas que os dados apontam. Sabíamos pelos dados, por exemplo, como a morte de crianças aumentou, como a malária aumentou. Mas só depois de identificar estas áreas mais críticas com os dados é que fomos aos locais e escutamos as piores histórias, aquilo que nem os dados conseguem captar: os estupros de indigenas, as meninas Yanomami sendo aliciadas para a prostituição no garimpo, o trabalho escravo de jovens indígenas nos locais dominados pelo crime organizado. E, com isso, explicar a total complexidade do tema. Os dados precisam ser o ponto de partida para auxiliar a realização da melhor reportagem, daquela que conte as histórias humanas que os dados mostram.","Portuguese, English, Spanish",https://sumauma.com/por-que-os-garimpeiros-comem-as-vaginas-das-mulheres-yanomami/,https://sumauma.com/nove-criancas-indigenas-morrem-sem-atendimento-por-doencas-facilmente-trataveis-afirma-hutukara-associacao-yanomami/,https://sumauma.com/en/por-que-os-garimpeiros-comem-as-vaginas-das-mulheres-yanomami/,https://sumauma.com/es/por-que-os-garimpeiros-comem-as-vaginas-das-mulheres-yanomami/,,,,"Talita Bedinelli

United States,The Texas Tribune,Big,Participant,,Texas Tribune Reimagined Election Data,2022-11-07,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Breaking news, Database, Open data, News application, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics","Personalisation, Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Python, Node.js, Django","The Tribune seeks to empower informed participation in democracy, and we build tools to make voting easier. In 2022, our journalists set out to reimagine how we report election results. We know standard practices in newsrooms, such as prioritizing the horserace of vote counting over context, can sow confusion and mistrust.

We wanted to do better, with maps that emphasize political geography and accurately show Texas’ density; analysis of the impact of redistricting on outcomes; context about population growth that squares expectations with political reality and customizable results so every Texan can see who will represent them.","There are nearly 30 million people in Texas, but only 17.7 million are registered to vote — and just 8 million of them cast a ballot in the midterms. We know that by election day, it’s too late to help most Texans participate, and so we plan story and resource deadlines well before each election so Texans have the news they need, when they need it.

Our pre-election voter guide includes address search, a list of who is on your ballot, contact information for local elections administrators and maps of Texas’ new political districts. Our election explainers, which were supported by a Democracy SOS fellowship, answered reader questions about what the Railroad Commission actually regulates — it’s not trains — and how administrators keep ballots secure.

Data journalists know that land doesn’t vote — people do. Texas counties range from Harris, where more than a million people voted this year, to Loving, where 73 people voted. But on a standard election map, those counties are about the same size. Our developers redesigned our standard election map to show counties by size and political breakdown. We also riffed on a breakdown of counties by political affiliation that we first produced in 2020 — this time, with context on how many votes are left to be counted. These charts were on our results page and updated throughout the night. And, like all of our election products, the data is customizable so Texans can see the outcomes where they lived. 

In all, these stories got nearly a million page views and helped readers across the state participate in the election.","The Texas Tribune’s election results are powered by a custom API that we use to track data for each election cycle, from the primary ballot page to our elected officials directory. This API is built in Django and maintained by Carla Astudillo, an accountability-minded designer/developer who is great at finding and proceeding data stories. On election nights, we partner with Decision Desk HQ for a feed of up to the minute results data. Our data story embeds and results pages are built in a Node.js environment with graphics made in D3 and Canvas.

Behind the scenes in all of our election products is an in-house political boundary tool that returns the districts for each address in Texas — an important feature in a year when voters were casting ballots in brand-new political districts.

For the engagement and reader service portions of our work, our audience team surveyed Texans across the state so we knew we were answering real questions from readers. In 2022, we hired translators and worked with local media to publish versions of our general election voter guide in Spanish, Tagalog and Vietnamese in order to reach a broader audience.","There are nearly 30 million people in Texas, but only 17.7 million are registered to vote — and just 8 million of them cast a ballot in the midterms. We know that by election day, it’s too late to help most Texans participate, and so we plan story and resource deadlines well before each election so Texans have the news they need, when they need it. This work is essential in the fastest growing state in the country, where a decentralized political system and districts drawn to favor incumbents make participation difficult.","More than anything, the Tribune’s election results are the product of collaborations. Internally, our data visuals, audience, design, engineering and editorial teams work closely together to make this work possible.

The Coalition KBA provided us with spatial data for the Key biodiversity areas to us. 

In the case of the Canadian Protected and Conserved Areas Database, the main challenge was the size of the files (over 125 MB). With over 12,000 areas to be mapped - some very large areas, and some extremely small - we had to be able to offer maps that were easily read on mobile devices. 

Maps were produced with QGIS and embedded into SVG canvas. Those were then imported into the React.js framework and animated with the help of GSAP.","Using this database helped us find interesting elements and areas to highlight in our story and helped us calculate statistics that were not necessarily readily available on the government’s website.

Для этого была изучена статистика имен за два десятилетия. Особенно ярким примером влияния на имятворчество стала фигура экс-президента Казахстана Нурсултана Назарбаева. Еще в середине 80-ых имя Нурсултан даже не входило в 20 самых популярных имен для младенцев в РК. Зато в начале 90-ых, когда республика получила независимость, а Назарбаев стал ее первым лицом, имя Нурсултан стало стремительно набирать популярность. Колебания этой популярности во многом коррелируют с событиями на политической арене. Мы также изучили и ситуацию с другими именами.","К сожалению, у нас нет данных, что публикация вдохновила других журналистов.","Exel и фактически ручной веб-скрейпинг.
Поясним: на сайте БНС АСПР РК доступны два вида данных. 
Первый – месячный топ-20 имен с 1942 года. Для написания материала был проанализирован корпус имен с 1985 по 2004 год, а также ряды имени Нурсултан с 1985 года по июнь 2022 года. 
Второй – агрегатор имен, с помощью которого можно узнать, сколько людей носят определенное имя в разрезе возраста, пола и национальности на момент запроса. Другими словами, если задать имя Нурсултан, указав, например, возраст 35 лет, то мы узнаем количество носителей именно этого возраста. В этой группе могут оказаться люди как 1987 года рождения, так и 1986-го, которым на дату поиска еще не исполнилось 36 лет. 
Статистические ряды проанализированы с 1985 года по двум причинам. Во-первых, в середине 1980-х имя Нурсултан не являлось распространенным, что позволяет обнаружить последующие аномальные всплески. Во-вторых, лишь спустя несколько лет начнут происходить политические события, в центре которых окажется Нурсултан Назарбаев.","В рамках проекта исследователем ставилась задача отразить связь между популярностью политического или исторического персонажа, прослеживаемой в СМИ, и популярностью, выражающейся в частоте использования имени данного персонажа у населения РК.

We counted how often journalists write about women and men in politics, economy, accidents and social issues categories; how often female speakers are quoted and how media describe women. This research shows that women are less visible in the media space of Kyrgyzstan. They are underrepresented, interviewed less often, and their marital status and age are mentioned more often.","The article has been published just recently, so it's hard to track the impact yet. Though, the story was actively shared in KG twitter community, among media community in particular (https://twitter.com/KyrgyzstanMedia/status/1606150879618519041) But I hope this research will encourage journalists to write more stories about women and will motivate media to review their editorial policies. Moreover, I hope to make similar resarch in other Central Asian countries.","Both data collection and analysis processes were done using Python. The data was scraped/extracted with Python scripts using Requests, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium Libraries. Cleaning, sorting, and analyzing processes were done with Python Pandas Data Analysis Library. Morphology Tagging was implemented using Natasha Library for Solving Natural Language Processing tasks in the Russian Language.","Kyrgyzstan is the country where government never pay much attention to women's rights. Violence against women means less than cattle rustling here. This year two men accused of raping a 16-year-old girl were released from custody in Bishkek. But an akyn is in custody, who is suspected of stealing a horse.

The police do not investigate cases of violence against women or rapes properly. Women are less protected, less represented in politics, economy, art or any technical sphere. Eight of ten homicides of women in Kyrgyzstan are committed by men. A woman earns 72 cent per every 1 dollar earned by a man. 96 per cent of those guilty of domestic violence are men. Those are mainly husbands who beat their wives. Working women in Kyrgyzstan spend three times more time than man on household duties.

Moreover, in Kyrgyzstan a woman is deprived of a basic right to walk safely on the streets, especially at night. If anything happens to her during such a walk – she could be attacked, harassed, raped or killed – the society wonders what she was doing outside at night. However, there are often no questions to the male criminal. Such situations clearly show that media should speak about women’s discrimination and restriction of their rights.

More about femicide in Kyrgystan please find here: https://bit.ly/3XeN22x (in Russian). This story is the winner of Sigma award 2021.","I hope this research will make journalists and editors to think on how they cover stories about women. In Kyrgyzstan some media use victim blaming when they write about domestic violence or harassment. For example, we can find publications like ""Why a wife 'can be beaten' - the opinion of the residents of Kyrgyzstan themselves"".

Media should tell such stories to show that violence against women is systemic problem in Kyrgyzstan. To show why legal instruments don't work but not to blame victims or justify abusers. 

Female experts are less represented. Around 90% of political analysts, economists or security experts who we see in news are male. As part of this problem, the number of female members of Parliament is decreasing since 2016. Now it's just 19 women (out of 90 places) or 21%. There are no successful and independent role models for girls. Even when media shows businesswomen they also tell that she is a good wife, mother. 

There are comments of Anna Kapushenko, editor-in-chief of Kloop.kg in this research. Kloop is the only one media in Kyrgyzstan that cover female issues consistently and this topic is included in their editorial policy. I hope this example will inspire other media to do something similar.","Russian, English",https://cabar.asia/en/women-are-mentioned-three-times-less-often-than-men-by-kyrgyzstan-media,,,,,,,"Natalia Lee (author, Kyrgyzstan), Atobek Rakhimshoev (data analysis specialist, Tajikistan)","Natalia Lee, CABAR.asia regional editor, new media and analytical journalism specialist, podcaster and feminist.

Switzerland,Neue Zürcher Zeitung,Big,Participant,,Will each roof have to be a solar roof?,2022-09-08,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Infographics, Politics, Environment","Animation, 3D modeling, D3.js, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Python","The energy strategy of the Swiss government foresees a major shift away from nuclear power plants to rooftop solar. The plan has been criticized as unrealistic by some. But we, and probably most of our readers, were missing any intuition to judge whether the plan is realistic. We wanted to _see_ how Swiss cities will have to change to become giant solar power plants. What would Swiss cities look like in 2050? How many of our neighbors would have to install rooftop solar next year? Have a look at our model city ""Sonnstetten"" and see for yourself.","The article has been in the top 5 percent of our most-read articles of the year. It has received the predicate ""wonderful"" from a Swiss Federal Energy Agency representative. A seasoned journalist said he had not read such a clear exposition of the topic before.","**Modelling a Swiss city:** Because we wanted the illustration to be close to reality, we decided to use part of a real city (Zürich Altstetten) as the basis for our model. A 3D model of the rooftops exists, which we have edited in blender.

**From terawatt-hours to rooftops:** the data we had were ""terawatt-hours per year"". The question we had to answer was how many roofs should receive solar cells in a given year. For this, we based ourselves on a study that estimated the percentage of roofs needed in 2050 and projected backward from there.

**Which roofs should be considered?** We knew from studies that about 60 percent of all roof areas are not well-suited for installing photovoltaics. We used geodata indicating the solar potential of each roof to exclude poorly-suited roofs. This and some background knowledge on solar installation let us make informed decisions on which rooftops would be most likely to get solar panels, year by year.

**Panoramic images on mobile:** the image of the model city was in landscape format but most readers on mobile devices would hold it in portrait mode. So we developed an interactive that lets readers move their phones left and right to explore the whole panorama.

**Unfamiliar interactions:** this interaction is not common. Therefore we conducted user tests to find out where they would stumble and help us refine the design. Also, multiple feedback rounds were needed to make the panning feel natural. The movement is coupled to the phone's accelerometer – the update frequency needs to be high for fluent movements. At the same time, it needs to ignore small trembling movements.","Neue Zürcher Zeitung is a Swiss daily newspaper with a focus on quality journalism and a liberal-conservative readership. Many of our readers are especially skeptical about the transition from nuclear to solar energy.

Most electricity in Switzerland is produced by hydroelectric power plants. Most of the rest are by nuclear energy. In 2016 the ""energy strategy 2050"" was passed by parliament which bans the construction of new nuclear power plants. One year later the law was also accepted by 58 percent of the population in a direct vote.

The article is based on a revised version of the predictions from 2021 which addresses major critiques of the original scenario. Specifically, it includes predictions on the growth of e-mobility and population growth.

Switzerland is not an EU country and has 2021 failed to ratify a set of agreements that would have specified many aspects of its relation to the EU. One part of these agreements touched on energy markets and imports. In the absence of such regulation, it might become difficult for Swiss energy providers to import electricity after 2025. This development made energy independency a more urgent concern recently.

Switzerland is a country of renters. Only about 40 percent of the population live in an apartment/house they own. The other 60 percent are not free to install solar panels for their personal consumption.","In this project we have used an approach we call *re-specification*. It can be used for any generalization and is based on an observation similar to one Daniel Kahneman notes in his book ""Thinking fast and slow"": it is easy for people to generalize from a concrete example. But it doesn't work the other way around. This principle is especially interesting for data journalists who often need to communicate abstractions.
Even though we believe in the power of this approach, it is very time-consuming and requires a lot of data for context – which would not be needed when simply showing the statistic.

Even though most of our testers were delighted by the novelty of the interaction. They quickly noted that in many places it might be socially unacceptable: Lifting your smartphone and moving it around while sitting on a train immediately makes people think you are filming them.

O trabalho tem por base as diferentes universidades públicas do país, tendo o leitor de escolher a universidade e gerir um orçamento mensal que inclui: deslocações, habitação, alimentação, propinas e despesas adicionais. O objetivo é realçar as dificuldades que os jovens que têm de sair da sua cidade natal para estudarem passam","Este trabalho foi realizado durante um **estágio curricular inserido num Mestrado em Ciências da Comunicação.** O trabalho permitiu que todos os portugueses - mesmo aqueles que não passam por esta realidade - conseguissem **perceber os reais custos do ensino superior**, acabando por abranger outros problemas sentidos no país: como é o caso da **habitação e do custo de vida** que tem aumentado. 

Além de ser dos primeiros trabalhos jornalísticos em Portugal construído em forma de jogo, a reportagem foi **utilizada por professores do ensino secundário (de sociologia e economia) durante debates com os alunos** para explicar os custos de prosseguir estudos superiores. 

Este trabalho pretendeu realçar também um problema em Portugal: a **desistência de prosseguir estudos superiores por falta de meios**. O trabalho teve por base dados de investigações realizadas no país para realçar o impacto do mesmo. 

Para além do foco principal, o artigo tem alguns detalhes como a **diferença salarial entre homens e mulheres.**

Dentro da própria organização em que foi feito, o trabalho serviu para mostrar as potencialidades do jornalismo interativo, tendo-se tornado uma área a investir pelo Expresso.","O trabalho focou-se no storytelling: contar a história de milhares de estudantes portugueses que se têm de deslocar para entrar na universidade. Para tal, o uso da **linguagem web** foi fundamental.

I (Sadanand Paul) have discovered the New Formula 'Coronait Formula' to extract prime numbers from prime numbers. It is important to note that the entire mathematical world is also familiar with prime numbers, so it is also familiar because of the confusion. It is certainly true that prime numbers.","The formula that I have developed, it is about knowing and removing prime numbers from prime numbers itself, it can be called a lockdown achievement. An Interested in writing and mathematics. If writing can be called 'writer', then why can't I be called 'Mathematician' because of mathematical investigation ! Come, I have searched some theorems to know the prime number or the upcoming prime number, it is formulated :-

Rule of Method - 1

 Multiply all the Consecutive Prime Numbers from the first to the nearest, so far as the prime numbers want to know, but the digits do not include 5 in this multiplication. Remember, the first prime number is 2 digits. As-

 2 × 3
 2 × 3 × 7
 2 × 3 × 7 × 11
 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13
 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17
 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19

Rule of Method - 2

 If we add 1 to the product obtained by taking Rule of Method-1, then it is obtained as a prime number. As-

 2 × 3 = 6 +1 = 7 (prime number)

 In the same way as from Condica-1:

 42 + 1 = 43 (prime number),
 462 + 1 = 463 (prime number),
 6006 + 1 = 6007 (prime number),
 102102 + 1 = 102103 (prime number),
 1939938 + 1 = 1939939 (prime number)
 
 (with to be continued...)","Rule of Method - 3

 Adding 1 to the product by taking Rule of Method-2, if the unit digit of the resulting number is 0, 5 or even, then it will not be a series prime number. Therefore, leaving this type of series will come in the next series, but will not deprive multiplication of any consecutive prime numbers in multiplication of successive prime numbers. As-

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 = 44618574 + 1
 = 44618575 has unit digit 5, so it is a composite number.

 Now since the number obtained from the product and sum is due to the prime number '23', we will decide to use the prime number called '23' for the next step (series), even if the number is 'divisible', not discard it. As-

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 = 1293938646 + 1
 = 1293938647 The prime number is obtained.

Rule of Method - 4

 All the product of such series will be a composite number, but by finding the condition quoted in the above mentioned terms, find the 'prime number' by +1 in the product! As-

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31
 = 40112098026 + 1 = 40112098027 Prime No. (PN).

 2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 13 × 17 × 19 × 23 × 29 × 31 × 37
 = 1484147626962 + 1 = 1484147626963 (PN)
 
 (with to be continued...)","Rule of Method - 5

 To find out whether a number is a prime number or not, first find the square root of that number. If the square root number obtained is numbered after the decimal, it is not used, but the number that comes before the decimal, by +1 the number that is received, including all the numbers below them. Let's try to divide. Let it be known that even numbers and numbers with 0 and 5 'unit' digits are natural that they will be divisible. Except this, we will try to deduct from all other numbers or numbers, if not divided, then those numbers will be prime, as-

 Square root of 37 = 6.0827625303 Put 6 in it, then do 6 + 1, which is 7. Now they have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, including 7, trying to divide 37 by these digits, which are not cut off from anyone. It is known that 37 is not even even. So rules do not cut 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 to 37, this is also easy to do.

 Square root of 123 = 11.0905365064, put 11, then 11 + 1, which is 12. Now they have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, including 12, trying to divide 123 by these digits, which are cut by 3. It is known that 123 is not an even number. So rules do not cut 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 to 123, this is also easy to do.

Rule of Method - 6

 In exceptional circumstances, be bound with the condyle, the rules and conditions for New PN will be incorporated as soon as possible ! The above approach can also be called Coronait Formula.","Fermat's Last theorem (FLT) is easily collapsed with 'Figure number' discovered by Dr. Sadanand Paul

 The FLT theorem was first written in 1637 by French lawyer and mathematician Pierre de Fermat to estimate the margins of a page of a book of arithmetic in the margins, and he also claimed that he had proof, but to solve it in the margin there is not enough space for!

 This amazing theorem ie Fermat's or Ferma's final theorem (FLT) of the world of mathematics has been uncertain since his death in the year 1665, when the aforesaid book was removed by his son for some reason. Today's mathematicians do not think of carrying the equivalent of mathematical knowledge of the 17th century, for which reason mathematicians have not yet been able to find proof of Pier de Fermat's theorem. It was published in 1676 by the Royal Society, London. Format's solution was hidden around the 16th century, which I have discovered, by the way, many math experts, teachers and mathematicians have claimed to have solved it and cut it out! I (Sadanand Paul) have named it ""Non FLT"", that is, the processes by which FLT is cut.""

On the day of publication, speaking on French television, Clément Beaune – the transport minister – called for an official investigation into the allegations. Two days after the story was published, Total announced the sale of its stake in Terneftegaz – the joint venture company at the centre of the story – to Novatek, its partner. A few months later, in December, Total announced the full withdrawal of its directors from the Novatek board and a write-down of its investment's value in its annual accounts.","The primary tool for this story was Russian rail freight dispatch data provided by the [Anti-Corruption Data Collective](https://acdatacollective.org/), combined with commercially available pipeline flows data from Refinitiv. This data, providing a near real-time view of flows of crude oil, condensate and refined products within Russia, allowed us to pinpoint where condensate from a TotalEnergies joint venture field entered a processing plant, before a proportion of the finished product was sent for refining into jet fuel.

The rail shipments data in particular also allowed us to track shipments from the refinery to Russian military air bases around the border with Ukraine. From further open source research, we were able to determine that these bases had likely played host to fighter-bomber aircraft used in the all-out Russian assault on Ukraine, including serious incidents in which civilians appeared to have been deliberately targeted.

The project would not have achieved the impact it did without the skilled work of Ben Ayre, Global Witness's interactive developer, who brought this complex supply chain into focus with a series of maps and graphics that travelled widely on social media and elsewhere. At the same time, the political and commercial nous and contextual understanding brought by the reporters from _Le Monde_ helped to ensure that the the story's findings reached fellow journalists who could amplify its findings, company executives and policymakers.","This story was developed in the context of an ongoing war, with a very high sense of urgency. Due to the availability of the data described above, the actual process of investigating it and building out the supply chain was relatively straightforward, with Global Witness's data investigations team easily able to handle the analysis involved.","This story neatly demonstrates the power of commercially available commodities industry data to illuminate trade flows both internationally and at the national level, revealing stories that might otherwise have remained available only to well-resourced players in the industry itself.

By creating links between a subject-focussed investigative organisation with data expertise and access to high-quality industry data (Global Witness) and highly experienced and motivated journalists at a publication with a strong record of work on the company concerned (Le Monde), this project created the necessary conditions for those stories to reach a much broader audience.","English, French",https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/stop-russian-oil/total-russian-jet-fuel/,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/08/25/how-french-oil-giant-totalenergies-fuels-russian-fighter-jets-in-ukraine_5994692_4.html,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/08/26/totalenergies-to-sell-stake-of-russian-gas-field-after-mounting-pressure-over-links-to-war_5994854_4.html,https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/10/14/war-in-ukraine-totalenergies-faces-accusations-of-complicity-in-war-crimes_6000293_4.html,,,,"Louis Goddard, Louis Wilson, Sam Leon, Mai Rosner, Lela Stanley, Ben Ayre, Jon Gant, Julien Boissou, Emmanuel Grynszpan","The 'Stop Russian Oil' team at Global Witness was formed in the months after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, to tackle both the climate impact of Russian fossil fuel exports and their funding of the war.

Although the death toll caused by COVID-19 is not as striking as in the United States, there is still a life lost and a bereaved family behind each death, and this threshold also deserves to be underlined in Canada. This number is so large that its magnitude is difficult to grasp. This is why we present Internet users with a sober, but immersive, data visualization to allow them to see the scale of this tragedy over the waves, the thresholds crossed and the defining moments of the pandemic.","Most American media have highlighted the death tolls of the pandemic using original data visualizations over the past few years. Seeing the threshold of 40,000 dead in Canada coming, we prepared in advance to release our own original visualization when that threshold would be reached. It happened in May 2022. Our project not only demonstrated that it was possible to deal with a widely covered subject in an innovative and original way, but also with restraint and respect considering the sensitivity surrounding the whole question of mortality. The other impact of our project was to remind people that despite a return to normality (starting around time of publication), COVID-19 was still claiming many lives in Canada and that some provinces had even recorded more deaths in 2022 that at the start of the pandemic, when there were major restrictions and no vaccine. Our project was also published at a time when daily data on the health situation was still released in Canada. Shortly after, several provinces and territories opted for a weekly mode of communication or even stopped reporting their data publicly altogether. Doing the same project today would not even be possible without the data we had at the time.","Our project takes the form of an immersive visualization in which the Internet user immerses himself and which is built as the story unfolds, i.e. over the thresholds and key moments of the COVID-19 pandemic. The story, based on the number of deaths recorded each day in Canada, is punctuated by the data, but also sheds a different light on the evolution of the pandemic and the various measures taken by the health authorities in parallel with the death occurring at the same time. We used Three.js to display the 40,000 points corresponding to each of the people who died from COVID-19 independently. More specifically, we developed custom shaders to improve performance by rendering each point with WebGL. In this way, we were able to activate the points one by one, as the counter of deaths increases. The use of Three.js has also enabled the development of the horizontal navigation, which offers better space optimization on mobile phones and which is different from what is usually seen. It is still designed to be as easy to use on a computer as on all mobile devices. A visualization in the same style was thought out for social networks, and we finally opted for a graph separating the dead by province and territories and which unfolds in several images in an Instagram album.","In May 2022, the Canadian population was widely vaccinated and sanitary measures began to fall, suggesting an imminent return to normality. However, an important threshold would be crossed: 40,000 dead. This threshold was going to be the trigger for the publication of our project, on which we had started working at the beginning of spring (after a particularly deadly winter). The increase in the number of deaths in the spring even meant that we had to publish faster than we had planned. Our project was also published at a time when a change was taking place in the way data on the health situation in Canada was collected and communicated. From the start of the pandemic, Radio-Canada built its own database using information from the different provinces in order to feed our dashboard monitoring the progression of the pandemic. However, provinces do not count cases, recoveries and deaths in the same way. We therefore decided to use data from the Public Health Agency of Canada to build our visualization. But right after the publication, several provinces and territories opted for a weekly communication mode or even stopped reporting their data publicly altogether, at a time where the data about mortality remained one of the last indicators to measure the progress of the pandemic. The number of cases had been underestimated for several months across the country, due to the introduction of rapid tests and limited access to PCR tests. All these upheavals have also prevented us from updating our project, since we were now unable to access daily pan-Canadian data. Unfortunately, updating it was part of our initial objective, since all our infrastructure had been built to relaunch the project upon reaching the thresholds of 45,000 dead, and even 50,000 dead in 2023.","Several projects have highlighted mortality thresholds related to COVID-19, both in Canada and around the world. Even though it is the same topic, there are several ways to visualize it. Everyone's work can even serve as inspiration to achieve a result that is innovative, original and standing out. Our approach also allowed us to find a way to develop a graphic that would be immersive and interesting, and that would allow the Internet user to navigate through the story. It's not just a simple timeline. And even if it is a morbid subject, we have managed to approach it in a sober and respectful way for the families of the victims. The other thing to point out is that when working with evolving data, we are always at the mercy of the source. A change in the methodology or in the collection of data can compromise the project and impose changes. You always have to be able to plan and adapt.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2022/covid-19-bilan-deces-canada-coronavirus-morts-hommage,https://www.instagram.com/p/CdeAjw-Lp2Y/,,,,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier, Johanne Lapierre, Anis Belabbas, Charlie Debons, Isabelle Bouchard, André Guimaraes, Mathieu St-Laurent, Martine Roy","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,Participant,,Le gouvernement Legault a-t-il réalisé ses promesses?,2022-08-23,"Explainer, Long-form, Quiz/game, Database, Fact-checking, Chart, Elections, Politics","D3.js, Google Sheets","When aspiring to be re-elected, a government is often judged on its record: has it fulfilled all the promises it made to get elected the previous time? It is exactly this assessment that we presented to readers with our project on the performance of the CAQ government of François Legault, in Quebec, published one week before the election call. 

Each of the 251 promises, collected and monitored by an external organization, is presented there in the form of a quiz, multiple data visualizations and even exploratory cards classified by theme.","In 2018, François Legault, just elected prime minister for the first time, made a final promise : to fulfill all of the promises made by his party during its 4-year term. Since he was as attached to the fulfillment of this final promise as to the 251 others made during the campaign, we submitted his record to a fact check. Our project allowed readers to see how many promises had been achieved and how many had been broken, as a whole, but also by category, in health, environment or education, for example. 

A few weeks before the election was called, the government was sure to have one of the best records and to have fulfilled the majority of its promises, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Our project gave voters the facts, not only the political version, in addition to comparing Legault's record to the previous governments. It also helped set the tone for the upcoming election campaign, by offering a retrospective of the past four years in the political world. He further reiterated the importance for politicians to deliver on their promises, but also to make promises that could be fulfilled in a single term.","Our project begins with an engaging experience, where a quiz submits a selection of promises for readers to evaluate. Often voter bias dictates that governments do not deliver on their promises. They were therefore asked if, in their opinion, the ten selected promises had been fulfilled or broken. It was also a way to spotlight ten events from the past four years that may have gone unnoticed or forgotten because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Different forms of visualization also allow, whether by verdict, by theme or by government, to showcase different aspects of the Legault report throughout the article. It ends with an exploratory section, where Internet users can navigate between the different themes and directly consult those that interest them more specifically. 

A color code makes it possible to quickly differentiate the verdicts and the explanations associated with a selection of promises allow people to learn more about their fulfillment (or their failure). All the elements of the project were developed using a variety of technologies, including React.js, Material UI and D3. It is designed to be as easy to use on a computer as on all mobile devices.","We published our project one week before the start of the election campaign in Quebec. The time was perfect to present to our readers the results of a government that had promised to deliver on all its promises. Our project was an original way to put it to the test of facts, while differentiating us from other media who were also at the stage of evaluating the outgoing government on its record. It is a huge journalistic task to compile and follow the fulfillment of all the promises of a party elected to government. This is why we have chosen to collaborate with the Center for Public Policy Analysis at Université Laval. We were then able to take advantage of the expertise of their political scientists, offering them in return to present their data in a more user-friendly way and to broaden their audience, since our project would reach all of the readership acquired to Radio Canada. 

Politicians also scrutinized our work when the project was published, and some even challenged a handful of verdicts or their explanation, which were nevertheless validated by the analysis of our experts. We opted for a combination of participatory, static and interactive visualizations, in order to offer the most complete and enriching experience for readers. A wide range of stories and albums for social networks (particularly Instagram) made our project into a complete offer and reached a wider audience. Overall, it also had a value of civic education, which is more important than ever during an election period to help voters make an informed choice once at the ballot box.","A government's record can be both a dreadful and a daunting subject, although it remains a must-have as an election draws near. That's why we found a dynamic and informative way to present the information, rather than constraining it to continuous text. We offered a wide range of visualizations from the same database, in order to cover the many aspects of the same subject and draw different conclusions. It may also be wise to partner with an external organization, which is already doing rigorous work, in order to find the best tools to present their conclusions, and those that we ourselves have drawn from their work, and to expand the public reach. 

This is also why we have split up our project in order to present it on social networks. Each of the posts, from stories to albums for Instagram, featured specific elements, and they generated a large number of reactions, comments and shares.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2022/elections-quebec/bilan-promesses-caq-gouvernement-legault-polimetre/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEw1eGX6sOc,https://www.instagram.com/p/Chugah7LMi1/,https://www.instagram.com/p/ChsAQdrsMDk/,https://www.instagram.com/p/ChxFvL_rQf0,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier, Isabelle St-Pierre Roy, Anis Belabbas, Francis Lamontagne, Charlie Debons, André Guimaraes, Mathieu St-Laurent, Martine Roy","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,Participant,,Qui dirigeait le Québec à votre naissance?,2022-09-03,"Database, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Elections, Politics, Women","Personalisation, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets","Who ruled Quebec when you were born? Our project starts from a simple question to revisit the political history of the province. The Internet user is first invited to enter his date of birth to see which Prime Minister was in office that year and to obtain some facts and data on the legislative assembly at that time. He can then navigate through the timeline to see how the political landscape changed afterward, or uncover the history leading up to the government in place at his birth.","Our project stands out for its great educational and instructive value on the political history of Quebec. It brings together in a single page the governments that have succeeded, from 1867 to today. We present Internet users with an opportunity to revisit history through an exploratory project, which can be attractive to both young people and adults. Its catch, with the question Who ruled Quebec when you were born? allows you to get a specific answer, but then opens the door to exploring the whole project on your own. Moreover, this project has generated a lot of comments, but also commitments, from Internet users. Several people wrote to us to submit their answer to the main question, or shared it on social networks inviting people to get their answer too. Our project has also made it possible to put into context various elements of the modern political history of Quebec, from the breakthrough of the Coalition avenir Québec, in 2018, to the collapse of the Parti Québécois (and the one to come of the Liberal Party, in 2022), including also the strong comeback of the Conservative Party in the polls. Its publication came at the right time as Quebec voters prepared to return to the polls.","Entry into our project is through a very simple question, which gives Internet users a customizable and interactive experience. What takes place next is a timeline that allows them to explore political history at their own pace, by scrolling up or down, or by choosing other dates of their choice. We used React.js with custom MUI components (datepicker and cards). For the timeline, we used D3.js with synchronized transitions following the selection of the date or the scrolling of the page. To compare or notice the change over years, each card contains the same information: the current Prime Minister, his political party, archival footage, interesting facts about political moments and other data on the composition of the national assembly. It is designed to be as easy to use on a computer as on all mobile devices. We have also developed a data architecture facilitating collaboration between developers, designers and journalists. The project is directly connected to data sheets (Google) containing all the information for the construction of the cards, but the code displays the information specific to each card according to the data sheets.","We took advantage of the election coming up to develop an educational and instructive project on the political history of Quebec. This kind of retrospective, although always relevant, is difficult to fit into a daily news context, except perhaps precisely during an election period. We therefore used data from the Assemblée nationale du Québec and Élections Québec and we presented it in an original and playful way, inspired by hockey cards. Our political cards contain interesting statistics on the various governments that have ruled the province of Quebec. Since our project took more the form of a game or a customizable and interactive experience, we used the information it presents for various and complementary publications on social networks. A series of albums designed for Instagram has made it possible to explain several other aspects of the political history of Quebec, from the 32 premiers that the province has known, to the succession of the various political parties in power or even the place of women within the deputation. This original content not only made it possible to learn more about the history, but also brought Internet users back to the main project. We even showcased Radio-Canada's television archives through a series of historical capsules published on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.","Our project shows how it is possible to use historical data and electoral archives in the context of news. This is an instructive way to present data and we made its exploration fun and relevant for Internet users. Any project, no matter how simple, finds its relevance in the way its content is presented. It not only allows easy and quick access to specific information, while also offering the possibility of exploring and discovering more about the political history of Quebec and its evolution. Its content also recalls the idea of an exhibition for the general public on the electoral history of the province. Our use of social networks has also shown that it is possible to decline a project differently for each platform, by offering additional information while always redirecting to the main project.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2022/elections-quebec/histoire-partis-politique-premiers-ministres-elus-gouvernements/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CiFmGUEt3GI,https://www.instagram.com/p/CiXngvuL0Pb,https://www.instagram.com/p/CippEFKryql/,https://www.instagram.com/p/Ci7qwI-N1x4/,https://youtube.com/watch?v=mn-v1o6BwAg,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier, Isabelle St-Pierre Roy, Charlie Debons, Francis Lamontagne, Isabelle Bouchard, Martine Roy","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,Participant,,Et si la CAQ avait réformé le mode de scrutin?,2022-10-04,"Explainer, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Chart, Elections, Politics","Animation, Personalisation, Google Sheets","One of the most covered promises from CAQ’s leader François Legault in 2018 was about reforming the voting system. This promise, reinforced by an agreement with the other opposition parties at the time, was later broken by the government. We therefore wanted to show with our project what would have been the results of the 2022 election if the prime minister had kept his promise to introduce a proportional voting system in Quebec. This political fiction exercise has been enhanced with various visualizations and expert testimonies.","Our project was published the day after the October 4th election, which once again showed the distortion between the popular vote and the distribution of seats in the National Assembly. With only 41% of the votes, the Coalition avenir Québec got 90 of the 125 elected members (72% of them). Our project came at the right time: the subject of electoral representation, in the light of these results, was on everyone's lips. However, no one but us had done this work of transposing the electoral results according to a proportional voting system. We have therefore served as a reference for many other media, but also organizations, which wanted to demonstrate the impact that a more representative voting system would have had on our democracy. 

Saying it does not have the same weight or the same impact as demonstrating it, especially since the results would have been particularly different. The CAQ would have retained its majority, but with 15 fewer deputies. The Parti Québécois would have slowed its downfall. Québec solidaire would have been more represented and the Conservative Party would have even entered the deputation. This is why our project was seen all over the province and was the subject of discussions in the days and weeks following the re-election of the CAQ, which, despite everything, has no intention of reviewing the ballot in the future.","For our project, we used a simple scrolly showing the results of the October 4th election, followed by the results of our simulation based on a proportional voting system. The representation of the National Assembly, and the color code associated with each of the parties, makes it possible to present the information in a visual and simple way for Internet users, while accompanying them in the story with a series of explanatory texts. We used svg illustrations, animated by gsap with React.js. This same visual, but static, was used to show the results of previous elections, from 2008 to 2018, if a different voting system had been introduced earlier. It is the before-after principle that has been put forward here. Everything is designed to be as easy to use on a computer as on all mobile devices. All calculations were made in Google sheets, based on guidelines provided by the many experts we consulted. 

Our approach was briefly explained in the article, but all the calculations were not included in the story due to their complexity, which would have only made the story more difficult to understand. Complementary graphs also made it possible, in the rest of the article, to present the weaknesses of our actual voting system, to illustrate in a more efficient way what experts were saying in the article. 

Material designed specifically for social networks also allowed us to present the results, and a summary of the project, in another way. Another complementary album for Instagram has even made it possible to revisit the rich history of the voting system’s reform in Quebec, proposed several times but abandoned every time.","The promise of the Legault government to reform the voting system went as far as the redaction of a bill. It included a complex calculation method and a simulation based on the results of the 2018 election. This was the starting point of our project. However, many gray areas persisted between the bill and the simulation. All the experts we contacted could not understand Quebec's calculation method and did not obtain the same result when doing their own calculations. A series of exchanges with provincial officials also failed to demystify the formula used by Quebec. We were then suggested to make a freedom of information request to get more answers to our questions, but it would not arrive in time for the publication of our project. We prepared it in advance in order to be ready, on election night, to transpose the results and to publish the morning after the election day. 

We have therefore multiplied approaches with experts to develop the calculation formula closest to Bill 39. All our calculations are based on the results as compiled by Elections Quebec. We used their databases as a starting point, but then transposed them according to the calculation method obtained. Several experts did not want to indulge in this kind of exercise, which we finally did successfully. Our article was all the more relevant as it cast a critical eye on an abandoned promise made by the Legault government. Its abandonment benefited the government unlike the opposition parties. Our project also demonstrated how the rise of the Conservative Party in the polls did not translate into a seat at the assembly, but that a different voting system would have produced other results.","During an election period, you have to see ahead and anticipate the projects that will have the most impact at publication. We knew that an abandoned promise between two electoral campaigns was an ideal opportunity for a simulation project. We therefore set out to demonstrate what the results of the election would have been if the promise to reform the voting system had instead been kept. We had no idea, however, how much it would be the hot topic the day after the election. 

But since the majority of the project had been prepared in advance, we were able to put the final touches in the hours following the announcement of the elected government and therefore be ready to publish early in the morning, when everyone was talking about it, rather than two weeks later, when the dust would have settled. Our project also demonstrated that extensive research and complex calculations, which are difficult to understand, can be presented in a simple format, and embellished with information and expert testimonials that make it a complete file.",French,https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/2022/elections-quebec/distorsion-vote-reforme-mode-scrutin-uninominal-majoritaire-proportionnelle/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CjTjg65rnyg/,https://www.instagram.com/p/CjdJBbpMwh3/,,,,,"Daniel Blanchette Pelletier, Melanie Julien, Francis Lamontagne, André Guimaraes, Mathieu St-Laurent, Martine Roy","Our multidisciplinary team, with journalists, designers and developers, tackles complex issues using illustrations, analysis and other data visualizations to make digestible and captivating stories.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,Participant,,Voici comment l’inflation agit sur votre portefeuille,2022-12-05,"Explainer, Long-form, Breaking news, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Economy","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Node.js","Soaring inflation has hit every wallet in 2022. From groceries to gas and to rent, everything is more expensive than it was three years ago. The objective of our project was to visualize the fluctuations for ten of the most common consumer sectors, from January 2020, and to follow them (with a monthly update of data from Statistics Canada) to see where prices would stabilize first this year. All graphs are accompanied by explanations putting the data into context.","Our inflation project became a reference for viewing Statistics Canada data on the consumer price index on one page. It quickly puts forward the figures that matter (variation over 12 months for about ten consumption sectors) and allows people to see on graphs the fluctuations over a period of three years. It even offers additional visualizations by sub-categories or by province, since it is a national project. 

Each of the sections also gets detailed explanations, the result of an extensive research to allow Internet users to understand the price variations over time. Our project was not only a reference when it was published, but also remains relevant over time, since it is updated monthly, on the same day the federal agency releases its data. This is a good example of a public service project, at the service of people, which is continuously updated as new data becomes available. At the same time, we have developed a mini dashboard presenting the key data of our project, which can be integrated into every Radio-Canada’s articles on inflation or on the country's economic situation. It is therefore a tool that can support the work of other journalists in the newsroom.","We chose to open our project with a heat map, showing at a glance where prices rose the most or fell the most (or stayed the same). The project then continues with a dashboard that effectively summarizes the price variations of all consumer goods and services in Canada, then for ten categories that we have chosen to put forward for their interest. Each of the categories is then broken down into graphics and additional explanations. We used our custom API to scrape all the data needed from Statistics Canada and also to return it to the web page. 

All the elements of the project were developed using a variety of technologies, including Node.js, React.js, GraphQL, D3 and Material UI. It is designed to be as easy to use on a computer as on all mobile devices. An anchor navigation system has also been incorporated to browse into the article more quickly or more easily. A widget has also been developed so that the dashboard presenting the summary of our data could be added into any economic news article, with the aim of bringing Internet users back to our project if they wish to obtain more information. Finally, we created our own illustrations for each of the sections and made our own iconography from them. Everything has been imagined, designed and illustrated by our own team with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, to offer an inviting, colorful and instructive environment.","Our project was published after several consecutive months of rising prices. The initial objective was to visualize how prices had evolved during the pandemic, then when the economy recovered. Ultimately, we wanted people to understand where we were at now. It came at the right time, early december 2022, as all the experts were predicting that the economic situation should return to normal in the course of the year coming, or, at the latest, in 2024. This is why we opted for a project which would be updated monthly with new data. This makes it not only a reference article, lasting over time, but which is also a tool for monitoring the Canadian economic situation, both for the public and the experts who study the issue closely. 

We used data from Statistics Canada's Consumer Price Index. One of the challenges, however, was to select the most relevant data to offer readers, as well as the consumption categories that we were going to prioritize, based on their evolution over the past few months. We have presented the selected data in a more user-friendly and accessible way for the reader, in addition to allowing them to visualize the data using graphs. The objective was the same for social networks, and this is why our project also comes each month with the publication of an Instagram album presenting key data related to the Consumer Price Index.","Service journalism is important, and it finds a place of choice with the public, especially when it comes to prices and personal finances. Finding the right subject allowed us to deploy it into a project that would become a reference article. Monthly updates also made it possible to build loyalty, as well as to acquire a wider audience. It's also important with data journalism to not just be tossing numbers around, but to put them with the visualizations and context necessary to fully understand trends in the economy. It is a complex subject, but an important one in times of inflation. 

The development of our project has allowed us to rethink the delivery of data covered each month by many media, including Radio-Canada, with Statistics Canada releases. We came up with what we felt was the most effective way to present the data. In addition, we came up with a widget derived from our project that could be used for regular coverage. This way of thinking also helped us to imagine our project as a basis for recurrent publications on social networks, which people would recognize and expect from month to month. The album we designed features Statistics Canada data that we weren't used to see on Instagram.

Malaysia,Malaysiakini,Big,Participant,,Malaysian 15th general election special project,2022-02-21,"Explainer, Long-form, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Map, Elections, Politics","Personalisation, Scraping, QGIS, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Node.js, Highcharts, Mapbox, Figma, Kepshape, Svelte, Sveltekit, React, Next.js","The 15th national poll in Malaysia made history by achieving the highest voter turnout ever recorded, thanks to the implementation of measures such as lowering the voting age and automatic voter registration.

The project includes four reports that cover various topics related to the election. The first report illustrates the impact of young voters by simulating previous general election results. 

The second report discusses how expanding the voting base can exacerbate malapportionment.

The third report is a microsite that serves as a one-stop voting guide for first-time voters.

The final report is an election live result website.","The first report provides a detailed [electoral map](https://newslab.malaysiakini.com/undi-18/en/map) at the polling district level. Malaysiakini was the only Malaysian newsroom to publish such a map, which serves as a tool for academics and journalists to conduct geographical election analysis.

At least two media outlets, [Cityplus FM](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=407133804460758) and [The Fourth](https://www.facebook.com/reel/1178546966390512?fs=e&s=TIeQ9V&mibextid=0NULKw), cited the malapportionment report, helping to spread the information to a wider audience.

As a result of the report, there were [calls](https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/623441) for electoral reform from NGOs and academics. 

The voting guide received a lot of attention, particularly the election candidacy, result maps and the manifesto comparison. It continues to be a public resource months after the polls.

Malaysiakini was the only newsroom in the country to compare manifestos side by side.

A local university requested permission to display our content on its campus, and local publisher [Mentor Publishing](https://www.facebook.com/MentorPublishing/posts/pfbid027C8phW13ALsP967FiucFohwcju1EoAdN9tRXZUmDkLmUzbRg4jddBkTc63VFPjRUl?__cft__[0]=AZVkHTBPEZV9SXf4mhBg_Hpje2x9EFINg4WcYEgKyTxFfGYCpSdL2FjCHsKNYEvdHJs93859599Cyxl_l0vZokhl4_H-1Hf2T9VuGpRKuP9AnQXtzVY34Gk2_rQC549grx7kc8u-5O2GyQt40Tn5jpIj_4hUS6IIShRdq-hvmbKd3URZFfI176Pj_CVLKM3mNx20e8BcusI0AvmQmAZfk87R&__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R) cited our voting guide in a Facebook post.

Several researchers and content producers have praised the projects for being able to break down complex information to make it digestible. Political scientist Por Heong Hong said the manifesto comparison was a go-to resource for herself and her peers.

These three reports received high praise and accumulated close to a million page views.

The live result site consistently had 200,000 concurrent viewers throughout the tally process because it provided the fastest results and immediate analysis.","To clean and analyse the electoral data obtained from the Malaysian Election Commission, we used Google spreadsheet and Python scripts and brought on a researcher to help us better understand and interpret the data, and present the numbers and narrative in the correct context.

ArchieML allowed journalists and editors to write and edit structured text that could be rendered in interactive web pages.

To quickly publish and make calls for election results, we wrote some Python scripts to automatically scrape the official channel.

All reports were built with modern front-end web frameworks such as React with Next.js and Svelte with SvelteKit, and we prioritised a good mobile user experience as most of our readers access the sites from their smartphones.

The electoral maps data was processed with QGIS and presented with Mapbox, and Scollama.js was used for the storytelling effect on the charts.

The charts were built with the Highcharts API.","Malaysia's poor open data policy makes data less accessible, and the detailed election data and constituency map are not made public by default.

As a result, we had to purchase the data and map from the election commission at a cost of approximately US$2,800, which was a significant expense for a independently-funded newsroom like Malaysiakini.

We were only able to publish most of the reports with additional financial support from the European Union in the form of a grant from Internews Malaysia.

Although the malapportionment report shed light on the issue of unevenly distributed electoral boundaries, it did not lead to any substantial policy changes or reforms, as the next redelineation exercise is not scheduled to take place for several years.

Due to human resource constraints, Malaysiakini was only able to allocate one or two journalists-cum-developers and a designer to work on most of the reports, which resulted in a slower production pace and the need to take at least two months to complete each story.

Despite these challenges, we were the first and only newsroom in Malaysia to produce in-depth stories with the most detailed election map and data.

Группа журналистов проявила несогласие с собственником «ВД» и решила создать свою, более свободную на их взгляд, газету.

Сегодня работа редакции переросла в деятельность медиакомпании. И с 1 июля 2020 года полностью перешла в онлайн. Печатная версия Вечёрки прекратила свое издание. Компания ушла в диджитал осознанно, в реалиях современных трендов.

Using historical data, we contrast today's weather with the realities of our parents and grandparents - showing how unnormal weather and climate have become even in Central Europe. The data is embedded in daily automated analyses for more than 500 communities. We also use the data for weekly data analyses, a live widget on our website, print infographics etc. The project is not temporarily limited, therefore impacting future reporting and implementing data and climate journalism in the print & online channels of our regional newspaper.","Data and climate journalism have become regularly visible, applying a local take on a topic that is usually reported in global frames. We therefore hope to raise more awareness among our readers for the impact of climate chante on a local level.
As a direct consequence of our reporting on summer heat waves and what to do against it, a ""Hitzebus"" was implemented by the city council. On hot days, it drives through Stuttgart and provides homeless and poor people with drinking water, cooling devices and advice how to avoid the city heat.
The project also sparked a discussion inside our editorial board which led to a different policy for the images we use within articles about summer heat. It is no longer only happy children in the water but also people suffering from the heat.
We presented Klimazentrale at several conferences as a best practice for local newsrooms and data journalists.","Data come mainly, but not exclusively, from Germany's meteorogical service DWD. We added more data sources from the city council and the regional enviromental agency, making our data base a lot broader which enabled us to report in much more detail.
The data are being processed automatically via a Docker Container and published as Datawrapper diagrams. The automated analyses for more than 500 communities are rule-based and exported as XML directly into our online CMS.","2022 was the warmest year since weather recording has started. The impact of climate change becomes visible on a local level. Yet, climate change reporting often focuses on global frames - rightly so, because it is a global issue, but for local audiences it can be hard to connect a global phenomenon with the local weather. Add to this that over the years, people get used to hotter summers and winters without snow. 
Our project aims to compare today's weather with the realities of today's parents and grandparents - different realities obviously. By demonstrating how much different the local weather was one or two generations ago, we hope to raise awareness for the impact of climate change.
We believe that climate change has to be reported on a local or even hyperlocal level and ideally on the basis of evidence and data. Yet for small teams, that can be hard - it was hard for us as well, particularly because we had to add extra data sources to get a rich and detailed data base which enables us to really report on a hyperlocal level. 
We are only two journalists and one web developer. We believe that the combination of an enriched data base, automated processing and textual / infographic analysis of the data as well as the presentation in print and online channels combined with the (hyper)local approach makes Klimazentrale an outstanding data project coming from a very small team at a local newspaper.","There is (hyper)local data on climate change out there, and it is worth the effort to open and access them. The data provide a rich source for automated reporting as well as data analyses. Local reporting on climate change can have an impact, in our case the implementation of a ""Hitzebus"" (""heat bus"") that supports homeless people in the city during heat waves - which unfortunately become more and more frequent.",German,https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/klimazentrale,,,,,,,"Jan Georg Plavec, Simon Koenigsdorff, Christian Frommeld","Jan Georg Plavec is lead editor for data journalism, specializing in local data journalism since 2012.

A reportagem aborda a necessidade de se recuperar o conteúdo não incorporado e a preocupação em se curar sequelas psicossociais que atingiram alunos e, não raras vezes, os professores. A reportagem traz ainda dados significativos sobre orçamentos direcionados à educação no Brasil, assim como números da movimentação nos bancos escolares, com remanejamento de alunos das escolas particulares para as escolas públicas e desistência por parte dos estudantes, em especial aqueles que precisaram trabalhar para ajudar em casa.","A matéria foi publicada no site de notícias do Senado Federal do Brasil. Os conteúdos publicados na Agência Senado alcaçaram 13,9 milhões de visualizações e 9,3 milhões de usuários em outubro de 2022.

Foram apresentados infográficos para a educação infantil (até 3 anos), educação infantil (pré-escola - 4 a 5 anos), ensino fundamental (6 a 14 anos), ensino médio (15 a 17 anos) e educação de jovens e adultos.

Os dados foram divulgados pelo Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais Anísio Teixeira (INEP), do Ministério da Educação.","O Brasil viveu um período bastante difícil durante a pandemia, em especial, com a queda severa de recursos orçamantérios dedicados à educação. Para exemplificar, em 2021, o Congresso Nacional aprovou a Lei da Conectividade, que assegura acesso à internet, com fins educacionais, a alunos e professores da educação básica pública, por meio do repasse de R$ 3,5 bilhões da União aos estados. O então presidente da República, Jair Bolsonaro, vetou o projeto, que acabou sendo promulgado após derrubada do veto pelos parlamentares. A questão foi parar no Supremo Tribunal Federal, e após decisão favorável à execução da Lei 14.172, de 2021, foi editada medida provisória para confirmar o repasse, executado somente em 2022. Excluindo-se o montante destinado à conectividade, inicialmente projetados para serem pagos em 2021, mais R$ 6,8 bilhões foram autorizados para a educação básica em 2022. Mas no primeiro trimestre de 2022, apenas R$ 256 milhões foram executados, percentual inferior a 4%.

This data analysis exposed the scale of the gap between rising rents and frozen benefit levels, and the significant impact of the UK government policy of freezing Local Housing Allowance since 2020. We created an open database for local reporters and an interactive tool for readers to see data on available properties in their area.","This project was done in collaboration with a homeless charity who have used the findings to lobby and campaign for a rise in Local Housing Allowance. We worked with a documentary production team who used it in a powerful film about a homeless family and the story was picked up by several UK daily newspapers. We made our database available to local reporters and activists who could examine and expose the situation in their region. The story highlighted the importance of the cost and affordability of rent at a time of huge rises in the cost of living, and moved the policy debate from a focus on energy affordability to housing affordability. The story was cited in the UK parliament and the collaboration with local journalists sparked several articles about the plight of renters at a time of a crisis in the cost of living, as well as a wider examination of the structural reasons why more people on benefits are reliant on the private rented sector and have limited access to social housing.","We captured the details of 40,000 two-bed properties advertised in July 2022, scraping data from the largest rental listing website in the UK.

We used the properties addresses along with OpenStreetMap’s Nominatim API to find the coordinates of each property we had collected data for, which allowed us to localise them within the right Broad Rental Market Area (BRMA) using shapefiles obtained from the Valuation Office Agency. We then analysed the data to ascertain the total number of affordable properties in each BRMA, as well as the increase in LHA that would be necessary to make the 30th percentile affordable.

To ensure wide accessibility to our findings, we built an interactive online tool which allowed anyone to find out the situation in their local area by searching their postcode.","In order to get information from the biggest rental website in the UK, we had to create a scraper rather than using an API, and since we didn't get coordinates from the website we had to use OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API to find the coordinates. This created greater technical challenges than our previous attempt to gather similar information back in 2019, and was an innovative way to compare the two sources of data.

As well as the technical context being very different, the political context is also strikingly different, and this story showed the urgency of housing as a key part of the cost of living crisis. It firmly moved the focus of political debate from the ""heating or eating"" discussion, to one of viewing housing costs as a major driver of poverty among those relying on benefits as their main income. Although the government has not yet responded to calls to raise LHA, they have promised a Renters Reform Bill which they will address some of the instability renters face in the current economic climate, and it formed part of the discussion over the decision to raise Universal Credit levels in line with inflation, which campaign groups said was the initial priority to support those most in need.","This project displayed the power of close collaboration with a campaign group whose expertise and detailed knowledge of the specific problems faced by their clients can help to shape an investigation that has real meaning and impact. The combination of skills with the shared objective of exposing inequality and injustice is very powerful, and can drive change in a way that public interest journalism strives to do. The collaboration with local journalists and their expertise in their own communities can also be emulated by other national and local journalists, as it increases the depth of the story as well as having specific impact in local areas.",English,https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-10-07/lack-of-affordable-lets-leaves-families-with-little-left-to-live-on,https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Oit9_Om5qHSzUmfKQ5x3hM9lkOFLX7-zHDFe55TQ81s/edit#gid=1762142561,https://blog.shelter.org.uk/2022/10/shocking-new-statistics-show-affordable-private-rents-are-vanishing/,https://www.channel4.com/programmes/britains-evicted-kids-dispatches/on-demand/73769-001,https://thebristolcable.org/2022/10/bristols-broken-rental-market-among-uk-worst-for-families-local-housing-allowance/,https://www.birminghamworld.uk/news/birmingham-housing-bureau-of-investigative-journalism-west-midlands-cost-of-living-3868620,https://www.manchesterworld.uk/news/the-areas-of-greater-manchester-with-no-affordable-properties-to-rent-for-people-on-benefits-revealed-3871145,"Maeve McClenaghan

I took a slightly different approach to understanding how flooding has been affecting each States, Nigerians and how many people have been affected and died since 2012. I researched and used open-source reporting tools to examine past events in a project that active citizens and journalists can use for future research and potentially help the Nigerian Government prevent further mass deaths.","I searched Google using search terms to look for reports from national and international media outlets, victim posts, and hashtags for social media platforms, restricting my search to the years 2012 to 2022. In addition, I examined the flood extent on a NASA map in 2012 and 2022, two of Nigeria's most difficult years.

In order to understand how communities are being affected and how many people may be displaced by flooding, I started using Google Maps, Google Earth, NASA-generated satellite images, and local knowledge as soon as I had the data.

I visualised and produced maps for the project using tools like Microsoft Excel, Datawrapper, Power Bi, and Infogram.","Obtaining data and figuring out how to describe what was happening in communities during the flooding in Nigeria was one of the project's most difficult challenges.

For workers who are single or not married, the standard salary is still enough to meet their living needs for a month. However, in contrast to workers who have families and married, they tend to have difficulty bearing monthly living expenses, other than for themselves.","Each region has a different minimum wage value. Even though the minimum wage has increased, inflation continues to cause the cost of living to become more expensive as the prices of goods and services increase. 
Government policies are urgently needed so that the setting of the minimum wage is above the minimum living needs of the workforce, especially workers who are married and also have children. Attention to the minimum wage is also directed at increasing the welfare of workers.","The data used in this article comes from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS).

The investigation, which took roughly a year and a half to complete, reveals that some families exploit these children in order to gain UNHCR assistance

The investigation delves into the challenges confronting this population, which is projected to number more than 50 million children worldwide, according to UNICEF estimates.","Following the publication of the investigation, some organizations interested in refugee minors have introduced initiatives to educate and socialize children and have attempted to link them with official organizations to be resettled in some European States.

** Some civil society organizations presented copies of the investigation to the authorities responsible for unaccompanied children in Egypt in order to document the failure of the High Commissioner for Refugees in Cairo to verify the cases that are due to its programs for unaccompanied children. The investigation revealed the existence of exploitation of this group and the fact that some families had contacted persons accredited by the Commission to obtain undeserved support on the grounds that their children are unaccompanied children, which led to the assistance provided for real cases of unaccompanied minor children

** We received threats from unknown persons to us, asking them for data and information on some cases and information that we have documented in the investigation. We believe that they are relatives of Sudanese nationality, because Sudanese law makes some relatives have the right to have children instead of women

** We faced difficulties documenting this investigation by voice and photo because there were threats to those filming without security clearance, and any journalist who requested such statements refused to do so.

** Some of the cases we documented in the investigation were subjected to attempts to exploit and obtain UNHCR assistance in return for care and the families' refusal to leave these cases for any other place","* The investigation includes a comprehensive presentation of the dimensions of that issue, equipped with statistics and data that reveal the details of that thorny file that has turned into a paper on the negotiating table between the leaders of countries.

**It is difficult to determine the true cases of unaccompanied children, in light of the discovery that some families have tampered with the registration of their children in violation of the fact that they are unaccompanied in order to obtain support from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

We have been threatened by human brokers who are trying to control these children and use them for illegal acts, whether through smuggling, obtaining organs from their bodies or using them as a card in conflicts and wars, since they are the most vulnerable group that has no voice, despite the fact that there are more than 50 million children in the world

Philippines,Rappler,Small,Participant,,The rise and dangers of Philippine reclamations,2022-09-02,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Environment, Business, Economy, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Datawrapper, Flourish","This two-part series, which maps and analyzes over 187 reclamation projects, investigates the controversial rise of reclamations in the Philippines throughout the decades. It examines how projects that build new land and infrastructure in bodies of water enjoy much support, even without studies and data on its real economic and social impacts. These in-depth reports also break down the growing role of national and local governments, as well as private businesses and corporations, in the reclamation industry, and how the lack of transparency and misregulations within the system threaten many coastal communities especially vulnerable to the climate crisis.","Despite their long-term environmental and social costs, reclamation issues are still difficult to visualize and engage audiences and stakeholders in given the lack of data available and tangible narratives on its real-world impacts. Because of this gap in critical examination, the practice has spread nationwide without public accountability, and has gone largely unchallenged. 

In response, this original data journalism report intended to offer solid baseline figures, easy-to-digest visualizations, and an in-depth analysis of the arguments constantly floated in the highly divisive reclamation space.

Following the publication of the series, environmental and fisherfolk groups in the Philippines such as PAMALAKAYA have heavily cited its findings to lobby for the protection of the marine areas and the abolition of the Philippine Reclamation Authority. The issue of reclamations as well as the number that Rappler used in the report (187 projects) have figured in the Philippine Senate’s legislative discussions.
 
Noticeably, some mainstream and alternative media organizations have picked up on reclamation reporting, citing similar figures from our data story. An established local documentary show with a wide network and online reach also produced an episode tackling Philippine reclamations, using similar visuals from our reports. 

Civil society (i.e. Sagip Coron) and policy groups (i.e. Legal Rights and Natural Resources Center) fighting illegal reclamations, as well as independent consultants and scientists, have approached our team, asking permission to use the data stories as reference for policy writing and recommendations, and further studies on the subject. 

In terms of online engagement, the two-part series has a total of 17, 723 page views and 966 interactions on Facebook as of January 17, 2023. Other distribution tactics such as e-mail messaging, Twitter posting, and Instagram sharing via the team’s and network contacts’ personal and professional accounts have not been accounted for.","To harvest the data for this story, our team initially determined specific variables needed – namely locations, proponents, sizes, and statuses of dump and fill ventures – to map and analyze past, ongoing, and proposed Philippine reclamation projects. The process of data gathering and verification entailed requesting and cross-checking various available government data on reclamations, accessing a niche book and research on the topic, going over multiple online documents, and verifying details with grassroots sources such as fisherfolk, community organizers, environmental advocates and non-government organizations. 

These data sets were then organized in a Microsoft Excel for initial data crunching and analysis. The partial insights were discussed by the team to further improve the data curation, and plan the visual and text analysis of the reclamation reports. Among the variables added were the type of reclamation, notable issues, and public-private partnership (PPP) status. Our team also particularly used OCR to convert some PDF files into text and Google Spreadsheets to clean the data.

During the final stages of data gathering, latitude-longitude data of the approximate locations of the reclamation projects were manually collected since these were unavailable from other sources. Once the data sets were complete, the tables were plugged into Flourish and Datawrapper to create the final visualizations – resulting in three maps, three charts, and a process infographic. 

Important note: On the map, known projects are displayed using markers with varying diameters depending on the size of the project in hectares, while projects with little to no information are displayed using square markers of the same size.","In the Philippines, reclamation issues remain underreported despite their growing threats to the environment and local communities already affected by the pandemic. This is due to the lack of transparency and inaccessibility of supposedly public government data on reclamations; the gaps in journalists’ and communities’ technical and scientific expertise; the security risks that come with visiting reclamation sites that have police and military presence; and the resource constraints (time, finances, specialization) that limit many journalists and newsrooms from pursuing niche reporting. 

This data story was a result of two years of covering the reclamation space, having built theoretical and practical knowledge and an intimate, diverse network of trusted sources who were either affected by or immersed in reclamation disputes. This report intentionally sought to address lingering thoughts after every reclamation coverage: With the rise of dump and fill projects nationwide, how much of the Philippine waters are being or could potentially be destroyed in the name of undefined economic progress? What are the long-term consequences of such trade-offs without genuine studies and data on the collective impacts of reclamations?

The attempt to answer these queries through this two-part series took seven months, from the research to writing and editing, as our team had to navigate the complexities of reclamations, the incompleteness of data, and the tense political climate at the time of its production.

Specifically, we had to manually determine other information such as the latitude-longitude data, types of reclamations, and PPP status to have a more accurate picture of the state of reclamations in the country. There was also a chunk of missing data on the sizes of dump and fill ventures that were yet to be declared by proponents, according to the government, which made it difficult to complete the maps and other visualizations. 

The story production coincided with the Philippine national elections and its campaign season, too, which limited and delayed data and source access and led our team to work on the story amid a change in governments.

Despite all of these, the series – since its publication – has become of timeless use and value, being a pioneer and a niche report discussing Philippine reclamations on a large scale and with a historical perspective. Publishing the story under a new administration prompted various stakeholders – scientists, policymakers, environmental groups and advocates, and coastal communities – to continue raising awareness on reclamation issues, reevaluate the practice, and explore efforts to study its impacts moving forward.","Reclamation projects are environmental threats that merit more nuanced and in-depth coverage since it gravely impacts many facets of public interest, such as disaster risks, shelter, livelihood, governance, and social welfare. Excellent reporting on such complex topics, however, requires journalists, editors, and media organizations to study and follow the issues closely, immerse themselves on the ground, and provide the financial and logistical support needed.

It is also crucial for media to collaborate with experts from other disciplines – fisherfolk, scientists, lawyers, and visual designers, to name a few – and build on and reference important existing work so that journalists can elevate the quality of storytelling and contribute new knowledge on a topic or an issue. 

Our data story project is a result of that hard work, intentionality, and process. The team envisioned to do journalism that not only challenges long-held yet not evidence-based notions on reclamations but also provides open data that can be genuinely useful for stakeholders, especially communities that bear the brunt of ill-planned and illegal reclamations in the Philippines. 

Although it takes deep grit, patience, and time, niche and big picture reporting – especially with the use of solid data – can lead to more impactful and timeless reports. In our case, the use of reclamation mapping and data analysis in our reporting shows that works of journalism can inform the public of the grave impacts of reclamation projects while also giving them the tools needed to act on one of the country's pressing environmental issues.","English, Filipino",https://www.rappler.com/environment/reclamations-philippines-spreading-posing-dangers/,https://www.rappler.com/environment/how-business-nature-collide-reclamations-philippines/,https://www.rappler.com/environment/airport-city-displaces-bulacan-fisherfolk/,https://www.rappler.com/environment/aerotropolis-airport-heightens-disaster-risks-communities-bulacan/,https://www.rappler.com/environment/city-gentle-people-fights-save-coastal-life-dumaguete-reclamation/,https://www.rappler.com/environment/dumaguete-residents-own-words-why-they-oppose-smart-city-reclamation/,,"Raizza Bello, Michael Bueza, Jee Geronimo","Raizza Bello is an independent journalist doing in-depths and investigations on the environmental, post-conflict, and human rights issues.

The focus initially was the number of losses and amount of money the Kenyan government had been asked to compensate other parties. The project brought out other issues such as illegal evictions, fraudulent transfer and sale of government land and outright implementation of unconstitutional policies and process by the executive and the Presidency during that period.","The impact was a informing and sensitizing Kenyan citizens on the misuse and loss of tax payer money in the legal fees and compensation to the awarded paties. The project also highlighted issues of human rights abuse especially in the illegal and inhumane eviction of squatters in state parastatal lands and gazzetted forest zones without providing alternative settlement for the victims. The project highlighted the land issue which has been a major issue since Kenya gained independence. It highlighted the high level of corruption with government officials and other prominent influential people colluded with the Lands ministry officials to steal land allocated to various state agencies and departments.
The article led to Twitter space which I moderated and had experienced guests such as lawyers, and activists including one Phyllis Omido an environmental activists who led and won a court case against the Kenyan government for allowing a lead smelting plant to operate in Uhuru Owino slum in Mombasa, causing lead poisoning and many deaths to residents.","The main tool used during research and data collection was python and a Google Chrome web extension, Instant Data Scrapper. The two tools were used to scrape data from [The National Council for law reporting ](https://http://kenyalaw.org/kl/) website searching for all court cases within the period of interest where the Attorney General is a party in the suit. I then used Google Sheets to clean the data taking out the cases that were irrelevant or civil cases whereby the Attorney General was mentioned but the suit was not for or against the government. I alo used it to find cases that had a compensation aspect to them and totalled up the compensation amounts.
I also used Flourish to create charts and graphs.","The project focuses mostly on a political aspect showing the loss of tax payer money in the litigations. Their is also a focus on corruption especially on land matters. Another area is the blatant diregard for human rights by the government especially in the violent and illegal eviction of squatters. It also highlights the constant attacks to the judiciary by the Presidency and the executive arm of government during President Uhuru kenyatta's tenure and his willingness to implement unconstitutional policies.
Access to data was the main challenge as the Judiciary's website has not been working for over four months now. Fortunately, the The National Council for law reporting has created a repository of court cases saving us the time and money needed to go to different court registrars to request for case files.
Anotheer highlight is the Attorney General's office refusal to admit to the number of case losses and veiled threats in their right of response calling citing this project as sensational reporting that is not Scientifically objective or factual, that our analysis was premised on a seriously flawed understanding of the court process and ignoring the questions we posed about the illegal eviction of squatters.",The main lesson would be to find alternative sources for government data and to use it to hold governments accountable in the dispensation of their mandates to citizens.,English,https://africauncensored.online/bleeding-money/,,,,,,,Moffin Njoroge,"My name is Moffin Njoroge, a data journalist and fact checker at Africa Uncensored, based in Nairobi.

What happened then? An analysis of his most important speeches provides answers.

Once a year, the Russian president delivers a comprehensive address to parliament. The frequency of individual terms in these speeches provides clues as how much Putin has isolated Russia over the years, radicalizing himself and making the country less free. The analysis of his speeches makes clear how his political priorities have shifted. It shows how Putin's distrust of the West ultimately took full hold.","The project is intended to show how Putin's attitudes towards Europe and the West have evolved over time, from a conciliatory stance in 2001 to a confrontational one in the present day. It uses an analysis of Putin's speeches over the years to demonstrate how his political priorities have shifted and how his mistrust of the West has grown, which led to the radicalization of his views and ultimately the invasion of Ukraine. It provides historical context for understanding Putin's actions and the current state of Russia's foreign policy and relationship with the West.","We used a data-driven approach to research and report the story. The use of a Python script to collect the word count per speech, and the use of Excel to analyze the data, allowed us to examine the speeches in a quantitative manner.

Ireland,"Noteworthy launched in April 2019 as an online crowdfunded investigative platform that invites submissions from the Irish public for investigations and issues that have not received media attention. The public can submit story ideas via our website, social media or email, which are then assessed by the team. If suitable, a public proposal is launched to crowdfund the investigation.

We wanted to create a new platform for supporting important journalism, one where reporters and members of the public can team up to deliver the stories that matter. We were inspired in part by the emergence of similar community-engaged and/or funded platforms such as The Bureau Local in the UK, De Correspondent in the Netherlands and Revista 5W in Spain",Small,Participant,,FACTORY FARM: Are we prioritising profits over animal welfare and human health?,2022-07-06,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Open data, OSINT, Podcast/radio, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map","Scraping, QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Flourish; Canva; Datawrapper; Tabula; Lightroom","This investigation exposed - for the first time - suspected fraudulent activity and serious environmental impacts of the multi-million euro poultry industry on the island of island.

Niall conducted painstaking and detailed work into the little known cross-border manure trade. He showed how the border is exploited to subvert EU law and shield the negative by-products of intensive farming.

The series revealed fraudulent documents from a State agency were included in consent applications for poultry farms and that authorities are investigating falsification of documents submitted for poultry farm licences, with names of farmers used without permission on litter export contracts.","The hours put in paid off as the impact of the investigation was immediate with reports featuring on BBC and RTÉ a few hours after publication. Politicians and environmental advocates on both sides of the border have called for further investigations by authorities following our reports.

The investigation won the awrd for Specialist Business Reporting of the Year at the prestigious Business Journalism Awards in Ireland, with Sargent beating out seasoned buiness reporters to win the award for this series.","The long-form investigation blended a mix of data analysis, charts and mapping that took considerable time to produce, using a range of tools and software to present our findings in an easy and digestible format. 

We conducted analysis of hundreds of planning files from various different jurisdictions in Ireland, using scraping software to formulate template criteria/data to download for each planning application. We then used OpenRefine to further formulate the datasets, eliminate duplicates and format for spellings of names and townlands. We then analysed the information in Google Sheets to determine trends, key cases studies and identify cases to examine in more detail and determine farmers to contact. 

We also used a Google Sheets plug-in to generate the geo-coordinates of the address of the farms, matching this with the date that the farms received consent permissions to create mapping visualisations to show the concentration of farms per jurisdiction and the increase in the rate of farms built over a period of time. We used Flourish to create our maps. 

We also pieced together data from hundreds of poultry farm planning applications - including ammonia assessments and air quality reports - in biodiversity-rich areas to chart the growth in poultry farms in Ireland and assess their cumulative impact on protected nature without proper environmental assessments. Again we used scraping software and google sheets to extract and analyse the information.

To delve deeper into individual cases and track progress with investigations being carried out by local and national authorities, we also sent over 75 Freedom of Information and Access to Information on the Environment requests, leading to the release of hundreds of records examined in painstaking detail. Where data was provided, it was often within reports, emails and pdf documents so we used Tabula to convert records into spreadsheet format.","Access to Files and Data - Months of work went into compiling data and documentation to get to the heart of the issue as no details on any of the various investigations ongoing into fraud in the poultry industry were public at the time of our investigation, and the authorities involved would not publicly disclose any information, even to confirm that the investigations were ongoing. We had to use scraping tools to pool together farm applications, and narrow down the cases we wanted to examine in detail. Once we started to see trends emerging in the data, we knew where to look and the questions to ask, and then sent over 75 Freedom of Information and Access to Information on the Environment requests, leading to the release of hundreds of records examined in painstaking detail. This was painstaking work and required months of planning and execution. 

Format of Data - While the final visuals used in the articles are crisp and clean, the raw data behind it was not so. Firstly, the data from each local authority on consent and planning files were stored in different database systems with different public interfaces, meaning that we needed to come up with different scraping rules for each. Another problem was that data was in various formats (excel, pdf, word) with numerous spelling errors. We used Tabula and OpenRefine to collate, correct, confirm and analyse the large datasets.

In addition, much of the key data and information that we were searching for was not scrapable and held within non-OCR pdf documents. This then required days of research time to read files - some of which were hundreds of pages long - and pick out key details.

Access to Sources - It is notoriously difficult in Ireland to get Irish farmers to speak to non-farming specialist media about controversial issues within their industry, making it a difficult task for us to find the right farmers to speak with for this investigation. On top of that, all farmer names in investigative files released to us were redacted. Then in order to find sources to confirm issues within the sector, we first had to go through all the planning records, combined with other files, to whittle down the number of farmers to contact. Sargent then went about contacting over 50 farmers, with a handful willing to speak to us.

Political Landscape - Both Governments on the island of Irish are very supportive of expansion of the poultry industry, while the industry itself is controlled by some of the world’s largest poultry producers.","Other reporters can learn that perseverance is key when you are carrying out an investigation where there is virtually no information in the public domain and both industry and the authorities are unwilling to share information or may actively be trying to block your work. 

Other journalists can also learn that both planning and patience are key when working with planning and consent documentation that is going to prove to be a critical component of your working investigation. Taking the time to brainstorm, plan and organise the types of data you want and why you need it in advance of searching for the information is key in order to help refine your investigative parameters, as well as cutting down on the amount of time you will need to set aside to design your scraping parameters, and analysis time when you have compiled the data.",English,https://www.noteworthy.ie/factory-farm/news,https://www.noteworthy.ie/factory-farm-pt2-teagasc-long-read-5801687-Jul2022/,https://www.noteworthy.ie/factory-farm-pt3-ammonia-poultry-5801091-Jul2022/,https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=%2Bproject%3Afactory-farm-208524%20,,,,"Lead Reporter: Niall Sargent

Temperature anomalies in Shimla, Uttarkashi point to grim future",2022-05-12,"Explainer, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","Himalayan glaciers are melting rapidly and posing the threat of flash floods and landslides that are not being monitored actively. New data reveals that temperature anomalies are likely concentrated in certain parts of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau. 

I have collected and analysed the last 40 years' temperature data of India's two Himalayan cities-Shimla and Uttarkashi, to trace the unusual heat pattern in the last two months. They were warmer than the 30-year climate mean (1980 to 2010) in March and April. This temperature change triggers various natural catastrophes in the fragile mountain range.","The story raises awareness among local government bodies, civil society organisations, journalists and experts about temperature anomalies and their impact.in Himalayan cities and states. 

Even small temperature changes can significantly impact the mountains' unique geography. For example, rising temperatures in the region can lead to the melting of glaciers, and this melting can cause flash floods, landslides, and other forms of disasters. Glacier-related dangers are lurking, and human settlements and infrastructure downstream are under threat.

The report is also covered by the media of Pakistan [Pakistan's news sites](https://twitter.com/daily_khabrain/status/1524632763479040000); the country witnessed the most acute impact of extreme weather events affecting more than 30 million and killing around 1,200 people last year.","I have closely followed the extreme weather events and natural disasters that occurred in the Himalayan region. To understand the problem, I teased out the climate change aspect and decided to trace the micro-level temperature change. 

I collected data from web pages of major centres and institutions of the world, including the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). I scraped the local temperature data from various formats, including PDFs, Excel files and CSVs. I used Python to parse the data of many cities in this area. I narrowed my sample down to two Himalayan cities, Shimla and Uttarkashi, to trace the unusual heat pattern in the two months-March and April, which are usually colder in these areas. 

To map the deviation from the climatological mean for the selected two months, I analysed the last 40 years' temperature anomalies data for these two Indian cities. Both cities have seen an upward trend in temperature anomalies, which means they were warmer than the 30-year climate mean (1980 to 2010) in March and April.","I reviewed journal articles and reports released by relevant national and international agencies. To understand the Himalayan region’s unique geography and climate conditions, I examined satellite images of past natural disasters that claimed thousands of lives.

A review of various journal articles and satellite images shows that Himalayan glaciers will recede by a third by 2100. Himalayan states Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are becoming warmer — more than twice the global average. Permafrost is already at risk in the Himalayas region, and its drastic consequence, in the form of melting glaciers, is likely only to exacerbate over time.","The consequences of climate change on this precarious ecosystem are still being understood. A micro-level analysis of extreme weather events may help to understand other cataclysms that may not appear directly related to temperature anomalies or climate change. Journalists can track climate changes on a local level and the frequent disasters in the areas. 

For instance, Joshimath, a Himalayan town in the state of Uttarakhand, is facing a severe crisis of sinking, as cracks have appeared on roads and houses across the town.

At Newtral.es we have extracted daily data from all weather stations in Spain between 1991 and 2020 to analyze the daily thermal anomalies in 2021 and the increase in minimum temperature in that reference period throughout Spain, leading to increasingly frequent tropical nights.","Showing how climate change is generating a 'new normal' is a challenge. Through powerful visualizations we try to show how we are living more and more tropical nights and the impact this has on daily lives. For achieving that, we did not simply rely on static visualizations but also included interactive visualizations in which readers can choose the data displayed and, in this way, the text information accompanying the graph also changes.","In order to perform this work it was necessary to download daily data from hundreds of weather stations over several decades for further analysis. This includes all the stations available for the reference period 1991-2020 and they have been analyzed with R, Javascript, and D3, and the average peninsular temperature has been calculated using the data from the reference weather stations.","2021 was the fifth warmest year worldwide since records have been kept, including the warmest summer ever in Europe, according to the findings of the Climate Change Service of Copernicus, the European Union's earth observation program.

But in Europe, the warmest year has also been the one that has recorded lower temperatures than the reference period in the first months of the year, until the arrival of summer, with examples such as Filomena, which marked the beginning of 2021 with a snowfall with historic temperatures in several parts of the country and placed January 12 as the coldest day of the year.","We try to approach a complex subject with a great saturation of information in a simple way, providing visualizations that allow a quick understanding of the subject and to have the big picture, beyond the daily news.

The firestorm of negative online publicity in the wake of the article's publication also forced a number of banks to make hurried (temporary) efforts to walk back some of their aggressive/unethical customer acquisition practices such as unsanctioned account openings.","The Nigerian Inter Bank Settlement System (NIBSS) database came in handy as a tool for verifying some of the account information obtained from whistleblowers as well as court records. Using the same process outlined in my other entry, I was able to verify the ownership details of accounts held by illegal loan sharks and a corporate entity linked to a ponzi scheme.

In piecing together the terror-financing segment of the story, I made extensive use of Microsoft Excel and an online solution for very large CSV datasets called Quickbase. Using Quickbase, I was able to very quickly parse the huge data file passed across to me by the MEForum, and establish that just under $12 million in dodgy transfers came into Nigeria via a shadowy charity with no corporate or financial registration - which is supposed to be impossible.

Quickbase also provided an easy-to-understand data presentation interface, and some of the screen grabs included in the story are from the Quickbase interface. Excel on the other hand, allowed me to drill into the data at a deeper granular level to establish for example, the exact number of times that a suspicious transaction description was used across the entire dataset.","Ever since publishing a series of stories about terror financiers and apologists in high places in Nigeria, I have been a marked man. This is part of the reason why I live in exile. This story was an extension of the body of work I have accumulated that shows proof of high level collaboration with terrorists within Nigeria's government.

United Kingdom,"The Courier, the Press and Journal",Big,Participant,,Tracking the NHS in Scotland,2022-07-25,"Explainer, Open data, Chart, Map, Health","CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Flourish, Github Actions","Our National Health Service is under pressure - the aftermath of covid, staffing pressures, strikes, and an increase in other illnesses such as flu and Strep A.

So what does the data show in our readers areas?

This project contains nine articles each tracking a specific aspect of teh NHS in Scotland - from Accident and Emergency waiting times, to addiction services, diagnostic tests and cancelled operations.

The tracker articles are run using a combination of R and python with Github Actions deployed to automate pulling and wrangling the data.","This is the first time this data has all been pulled together into one place and visualised in a concise and easy to understand way - and also combining relevant targets for each metric to put the data into perspective. Every article also comes with explainer text on the subject and what expected timescales and targets are for that waiting list, which we hope is a helpful resource alongside the data.

One reader had this to say:
> ""Quite remarkable work by the Courier. No other daily paper in Scotland is doing work of this quality. This will become the reference standard for politicians across Scotland.""

Dozens of readers also contacted us to share their stories of the impact of long waiting times which enabled our team of Health and Wellbeing journalists to have a stream of case studies.

With this kind of project we also see an impact internally - with the rest of the newsroom better able to understand the data that they will receive in press releases and allowing them an outlet to cross check against. It also allows them to be able to link to a reliable source when writing stories about the political or health side of this data.","The data was wrangled in a combination of R and python and automated using Github Actions.

The CSVs of clean and analysed data were then automatically pulled through to Flourish to create the charts. This workflow allows it to be largely hands free (as long as no changes are made to the source data...). This is important as we are a small team with competing demands so the ability to automate tasks like this has been nothing short of game-changing and above what is normally expected technically of a small data team at a regional publisher.

R and python were both used purely because of differing preferences in languages across the team.

All of the R, python, and Github Action yaml code have been open sourced on our github account along with the cleaned data as we believe strongly in transparency in our methods and leaving ourselves open to challenges. We also believe strongly in giving back to the data community as other data journalists and data scientists making their code available on Github has taught us so much over the years. This Github page has been linked to at the end of every tracker article.

For the charts we have used our training in Dataviz principles to make charts that we believe are as user friendly as possible for our target audience and allows them to drill down to their local area and compare and contrast with other local areas.","The main constraint for us is always resources - we are a small team at a regional publisher with ambitions to create data journalism that could compete with the 'big boys'. As such we are always paying attention to the latest technology and how we can adapt and use it. This project was the first time any of us had used Github Actions, which as a free resource for automation is a complete game changer to a stretched small team.","I hope we can be an example to other smaller data teams that you can do more with less.

In Northern Ireland, the UK and many other countries, emergency fire assistance comes at no cost to the public, but in Ireland our councils use such fees as a revenue-raising measure – even though the money they raise is a small fraction of the overall cost of the fire service. I sourced data from Ireland's local authorities and created online data maps that show the reader the overall picture: https://bit.ly/3cHSJ73 and https://bit.ly/3cNsgVL.","The project exposed the hige variance in how much an emergency fire service can cost a person in Ireland, just because of where they live in the country. The in-depth investigation showed the realities of the costs for the public clearly for the first time, and the use of data maps clearly shows the scale of the variance across the country.","The data sourcing work involved scraping initial data from websites as well as sourcing information through emails with the local authorities where the data was not available online. 

To ensure like-for-like comparisons, calculations for specific fire scenarios were carried out using Microsoft Excel calculations and formulae. 

Through downloading and adjusting a json map of Ireland provided by Ordnance Survey Ireland and uploading this to datawrapper, I was able to create original maps charting the variance in fire charges across the country.","Data came from several sources - both found online, through email and by picking up the phone and several Freedom of Information requests. The work required perseverance and showed that different authorities can have very different approaches to providing open data to the public.","The importance of perserance in sourcing data and using all the practical and legislative tools available to do this.

Dessa forma, o projeto visa contribuir para a conscientização dos eleitores no exercício de seus direitos políticos pelo voto, apresentando informações de forma simplificada e didática sobre política institucional, além de realizar a checagem de notícias e verificação de informações de modo a auxiliar na escolha da população com seus representantes.","A plataforma Rumbora Marocar de educação política popular e de checagem, tem obtido reconhecimento local e até nacional. A iniciativa inédita iniciada na região amazônica em 2020, idealizada pelo Coletivo Re_o_cupa - Resistência Cultural Upaon-Açu, tem ofertado mecanismos para que a população detenha conhecimentos e exerça a cidadania através do voto com maior consciência nas eleições, utilizando uma linguagem clara e de fácil entendimento, comprometida com a realidade dos fatos em detrimento de interesses partidários, visando propiciar, por consequência, melhor entendimento tanto da política institucional quanto da política local. 
A equipe do projeto tem recebido convite para ministrar oficinas de como realizar a checagem de conteúdos a um público de mais ou menos 1500 pessoas, além de participar de programas locais. O Rumbora Marocar também é finalista do Prêmio de Jornalismo-Mosca-Troféu Rastilho de 2022. Nos dois primeiros meses do projeto (em 2020), as redes sociais do projeto alcançaram mais 3883 seguidores. 
Evidenciar estes dados sedimenta a importância de se implementar iniciativas que fomentem a participação popular como uma estratégia combativa à manutenção da estrutura posta, desafiando e subvertendo o sistema de veiculação de informações falaciosas em torno das campanhas eleitorais, ao fornecer conteúdos informativos de fácil compreensão pela população.","O Rumbora Marocar atua sobre dois eixos, o de checagem de informações (facting checking) e o de educação política política popular. O primeiro eixo de checagem surgiu com a proposta de aplicar as técnicas das agências de checagem às declarações feitas pelos candidatos aos cargos públicos, em eleições. 
Portanto, afirmações em planos de governo, em entrevistas divulgadas em grandes veículos de comunicação ou mesmo durante os debates serão devidamente checadas pelos jornalistas que integram o projeto.
A metodologia começa na coleta do material que será checado, vídeos, áudios ou textos. Nem tudo que é declarado é checado. Seleciona-se a partir de três critérios: assuntos de interesse público, assuntos que envolvam personalidades de destaque e assuntos que tenham repercutido significativamente na mídia. Vale ressaltar que opiniões não são checadas. O foco são afirmações que contenham dados históricos, estatísticos, comparações e dados relativos à legalidade ou constitucionalidade de um fato.
Além disso, garimpam a informação em base de dados confiáveis, podendo recorrer, se preciso, às Leis de Acesso à Informação (LAI) e às assessorias de imprensa de órgão públicos ou de empresas privadas. Caso o assunto suscite dúvidas durante a checagem, os profissionais ainda recorrem às entrevistas. Só após essas etapas, as afirmações são devidamente categorizadas. 
O eixo educacional fica incumbido de disseminar conteúdo de forma acessível e com linguagem popular sobre os cargos em disputa nas eleições fornecendo conteúdo relativo às funções a serem exercidas dos cargos em disputa, sobre o funcionamento dos poderes legislativos e executivo, sobre as competências atinentes aos respectivos cargos, com produção de matérias jornalísticas a respeito da conjuntura política, além da apresentação de materiais gráficos como cartilhas e de materiais em audiovisuais.
O material produzido é divulgado virtualmente nas redes sociais e no site oficial do projeto, em formato de artigo, card e cartilha.","O contexto histório da região onde o projeto se desenvolve é marcada pela presença de uma oligarquia que se mantém com a utilização patrimonialista da máquina pública que opera utilizando o aparato midiático e que transforma o jornalismo em um molde opinativo-partidário. O Projeto Rumbora Marocar, dado o caráter apartidário e por ser uma iniciativa precursora na cultura de verificação de informações na região, tem se mostrado como uma ferramenta para fortalecimento do campo Democrático e tem impactado positivamente na formação da opinião pública a partir de informações passíveis de serem checadas.","A função da checagem de notícias e da facilitação de conteúdos. É fundamental citar que a checagem faz parte da prática jornalística diária ou deveria fazer. Na realidade, seja pela pressa do fim do prazo ou pelo trabalho sobrecarregado nas redações, a checagem nem sempre é feita da melhor forma, abrindo espaço para um jornalismo declaratório, que se ampara, sobretudo, na fala dos entrevistados. Isso acaba por conferir valor de verdade a declarações equivocadas, em alguns casos. Fato é que uma que uma agência de fact checking pode ser um solução possível no combate à desinformação podendo tornar as eleições mais justas. O fortalecimento desse campo no Brasil é uma demanda urgente e necessária, tendo em vista que os efeitos negativos produzidos pela desinformação podem ser potencializados pelo uso distorcido dos recursos proporcionados pelas tecnologias da informação e das comunicações (TICs), sobretudo a Internet.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Participant,,The destruction of Mariupol,2022-04-23,"Investigation, Open data, OSINT, Map, Satellite images","QGIS, CSV, RStudio, OpenStreetMap, SAR and visual satelite images","After nearly two months under siege by Russian forces, what was left of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol?
Using freely-available satellite data from the European Space Agency, we detected damage to building across the city. The location of damage was matched up to individual buildings using Open Street Map. We verified the technique by comparing a list of damaged buildings from earlier in the war, compiled by the UN, to the results from our pipeline using satellite data from the same time. 
We found that nearly 45% of the built up area had suffered damage, including 33% of residential buildings.","The article generated 51.5K views. It was in the top 10 most read of all of our Graphic Detail stories for the year. The story was widely shared on social media. 

The story also generated discussion with other researchers in the fields of remote sensing and satellite intelligence. One researcher from UCL (Ollie Ballinger) is writing a paper about responsive remote sending in war zones and is using the piece as a case study. He has replicated and extended the pipeline for other dates (see link 2). Another company who are working on using SAR imaging in African war zones, Masae Analytics, got in touch to discuss the technique also, and offered to share data and insights for future stories.","We relied on freely available data and tools throughout this project. 

Our main data source was the synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) scanner aboard Sentinel-1, a European satellite. SAR emits microwaves which bounce off the surface of the Earth and return as an energy “echo”, which is then recorded.

Damage to buildings influences the returning echo signal. Rubble creates stronger signals than flat roads or roofs as more microwaves bounce back towards the satellite. This changes the amplitude of the returning signal. A collapsed building can also affect where the echo wave is in its cycle when it reaches the satellite — a change in the signal’s phase. 

We analysed pairs of SAR images, two images from before the start of the war were used as a reference. We measured the coherence of these pairs of images, similar to measuring the spatial correlation, but accounting for both the amplitude and phase. Undamaged, built-up areas, tend to have high coherence between images, whereas greenery has low coherence. 

We then subtracted this reference coherence map to another coherence map created using one image from before the war and one during (17th April). Large drops in coherence indicate damage to built-up areas. This analysis was performed using SNAP, a freely accessible remote-sensing analysis platform created by the European Space Agency. 

To determine a threshold value for 'damage' we compared a coherence-difference map, calculated using images from earlier in the war, to a list of damaged buildings compiled by the UN from the same time (March 14th). The 'damage' map, and the geocoded UN data, were matched to building footprints on Open Street Map. The threshold for deciding which buildings were damaged was optimised for accuracy (92%) and precision (85%) of match to the UN data. This was done in QGIS and R.","At the time of publishing this article very little was known about the fighting in Mariupol. Journalists and aid workers could not enter the city safely and so simple facts like the death toll or conditions in the city were unknown. 

One of the only reliable sources of information was satellite images, but simply viewing visual images of small patches of city does not tell us much about its overall state. Our article was the first to quantify, remotely, the number of destroyed buildings and their composition.

While we are not the first people to analyse SAR images for the purpose of detecting building damage, I believe we are the first newsroom to do so. This is also the first time I have seen any method to threshold the damage maps to determine how much signal change constitutes damage. This is also the first time I have seen such damage maps merged with records of individual buildings and building types.","I hope that this project demonstrated how journalists can do their own quick-turnaround, responsive satellite investigations using freely available data and tools. 

The European Space Agency provides many online tutorials on how to perform this type of analysis. We also published a two-part series in our _Off The charts_ newsletter, talking though the process we used step-by-step (see links 3 and 4).

Os dados foram obtidos via Lei de Acesso à Informação (LAI) e além de revelarem a omissão do governo durante 9 anos e 11 meses, também traça um perfil social e econômico da vítimas, e identifica os horários e dias da semana de maior recorrência da violência.","Esta reportagem guiada por dados teve o maior tempo de leitura e audiência da plataforma fechada do jornal O POVO, o que demonstra que conteúdo baseado em evidência, contextualizados, humanizados e com recursos práticos de visualização de dados podem prender a atenção do leitor. O material também foi manchete da versão impressa do jornal. 
Outro ponto importante, é que se a série histórica dos casos de violência doméstica obtidos pela reportagem, servem como base para um dataset maior dos casos da mesma natureza. Ou seja, agora o jornal possui uma série histórica deste tipo de violência, e apenas atualiza os casos via dados disponibilizados na transparência ativa dos órgãos de segurança pública. Isso é muito importante porque economiza tempo dos jornalistas e proporciona a criacão de diversos outros conteúdos. Este material também foi finalista do mais relevante prêmio de jornalismo de dados do Brasil, o Cláudio Weber Abramo , organizado pela Escola de Dados.","Utilizamos a Lei de Acesso à Informação como principal ferramental para obtenção de dados.

Mas ainda é um desafio a sua implementação nos registros de segurança pública, como por exemplo o Boletim de Ocorrência. 
A inclusão desse tipo de dado visa orientar os órgãos públicos na adoção de ações de promoção da igualdade racial previstas na Lei 12.288, que institui o Estatuto da Igualdade Racial e atende a uma das mais antigas reivindicações do movimento negro brasileiro. Portanto a relevância de se discutir esse assunto , e que vai além da abordagem dos casos de violência (não menos importantes), mas que mostra uma violência aqui do estado, que deveria garantir e ampliar os direitos dos cidadãos, e não negligenciar. 
Outro ponto importante de destacar é que esta reportagem foi realizada em um contexto de lockdown no Brasil, ou seja, devido as medidas restritivas para Covid-19 foi um imenso desafior encontrar as vítimas de violência doméstica e conquistar sua confiança para que pudessem falar com a reportagem e contar suas histórias de vida.","A ausência de dados também é uma informação relevante e que deve ser denunciada e discutida pelo jornalismo. Como foi o caso deste especial, quando percebemos que o campo raça/cor não era registrado, logo despertamos que aquele seria o gancho do especial. 
O quesito “raça/cor” passou a ser campo obrigatório dos registros administrativos, cadastros, formulários e bases de dados do Governo Federal desde dezembro de 2012. Mas ainda é um desafio a sua implementação nos registros de segurança pública, como por exemplo o Boletim de Ocorrência.

Argentina,Chequeado (www.chequeado.com),Small,Participant,,Data journalism from a fact-checking organization for TikTok,2022-02-07,"Explainer, Database, Fact-checking, Video, Map, Politics, Economy","Animation, Adobe Creative Suite, R, RStudio, - Flourish, for graphics design and edition.
- OBS studio, for recording and acreenshoting.","This project is about the importance of using and promoting stories based on data journalism through new platforms, with the aim of countering online misinformations.

Through this work, we created journalistic content (based on data journalism) for Chequeado's social media pages and more specifically for TikTok, where we have published data visualizations that function as the main input for videos destined for that platform.

The topics covered, limited only by the availability of official data, ranged from the analysis of public services to university education in Argentina.","We found a successful format that allows us to spread data visualizations within TikTok: so far, our videos have reached to more than 100,000 users. This allowed us, along with other formats, to double our number of followers on the platform (@chequeado).

The visualization of data in new formats such as TikTok allows the information to be presented in a clear, interactive and understandable way for the user. Plus, it doesn't require advanced technical video editing skills for a post to have a lot of reach. Our mission is to communicate complex ideas and concepts in an effective and attractive way.

The experimentation with this format also led to the presentation of a highly attended workshop at the 2022 Media Party celebrated in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in which we shared our work processes and our learning with hundreds of colleagues and media professionals.","To collect data we wanted to share it with our community, we scraped official data in closed format from an R script executed once every 24 hours. We also did cleaning and data processing with R.

When it came to finally finding the way of presenting this information, we used Flourish to create our visualizations, OBS for screenshots and Adobe for all video editing in different formats.","Access to data in Argentina can be problematic. Generally, not due to political issues, but because of the lack of the technology and infrastructure needed for this type of projects.

For this reason, we consider it is important to highlight the big role that open records requests have (similar to FOIA), which allowed us to create and share our content.

At the same time, whenever an open records request was not enough for us to be able to get the information we needed, we highlighted the role of techniques such as data scraping on government sites. As will be seen later, one of the published stories was only possible thanks to this technique.","Our greatest learning was to understand that, if we make the effort to adapt the stories we want to tell to the narratives that a platform like TikTok proposes, the audience will respond with interest. We have achieved this without sacrificing the methodology of data journalism or the intention to show all facets of each database with which we have worked. Therefore, what other journalists can learn is that you should not transform your own prejudices into limitations.

In Chequeado, we identified as well that although there are several sites and media that use data visualizations, they were not focused on short video formats such as TikTok and Reels. Social media platforms such as TikTok not only allow the information to be presented in a clear and innovative way, but they also give us journalists and communicators amazing tools to create it with. 

It is a format that allows us to show quantitative evidence on current affairs, which is something that Chequeado does as DNA of its identity.",Spanish,https://www.tiktok.com/@chequeado/video/7135582625032457477,https://chequeado.com/el-explicador/cuales-son-las-lineas-de-colectivos-mas-denunciadas-por-los-pasajeros-y-que-es-lo-que-mas-les-reclaman/,https://www.tiktok.com/@chequeado/video/7062076164151446790,https://www.tiktok.com/@chequeado/video/7153265874504289541,https://www.tiktok.com/@chequeado/video/7106960705777061126,,,Ignacio Ferreiro,"Ignacio Ferreiro has dedicated his professional career to data journalism for more than 5 years, the last of which have been as part of Chequeado.

Serbia,Center for Investigative Journalism of Serbia,Small,Participant,,Party funds,2022-03-17,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Fact-checking, OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Elections, Politics, Corruption","Animation, Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Flourish and Canva","Public funds are main source for financing of political parties in Serbia and this is why it could be main threat for corruption and misusess. Center for Investigative Journalism of Serbia created database that included the income and expenses of 25 of the most influential parties and groups of citizens in Serbia. Database allows users to filter for data, including by party
name, year, location, company name, and payment purpose. It is unique in that it
enables users to make their own combinations and follow the trail of money not
only for one year and one party, but multiple ones.","Our Party fund project was first of that kind in field of finincing political parties in Serbia and it was one of the most visited content on CINS website last year. It gave people chance to see where their money, almost 70 milion of euros, went after it was given to parties from state budget. Since our database was published, there were many republications in online and print media, and our researchers talked about this database on TV. We also gave the access to the data to everyone interested, and that allowed journalists in Serbia to work on their own stories with this data and look for different angles.

Almost all pages of our database have infographics and maps, so data could be easily understood.

Using data from database, we wrote three stories that showed wrongdoings in parties financing, deficiencies in it's monotiring and advantage that ruling Serbian progressive party (SNS) has in relation to others. We discovered that:

1. In six years period, ruling party SNS has spent on election campaigns more than 22 political parties combined. One of the reason for this dominance is that in 2014. SNS urgently changed the law which allowed them to spend the money from the budget that they receive for regular work on elections.

2. Party of former President of National Aseembly Ivica Dacic (SPS), now Minister of foreign affairs, has for years been financing its work by renting out real estate inherited from the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Their “tenants” include many municipalities, public companies and institutions, which is assessed as unacceptable by experts.

3. Party of, in that time, Minister of Interior Aleksandar Vulin (PSS) (now director of national inteligence agency) has been paying rent for offices in several places across Serbia, but those expenses have remained hidden.","First, we scraped the data from the Agency database. Although all the data was already available, users couldn't cross-reference it and look for patterns and companies that kept showing up for years. 

Our second part was to combine the data, and we did that through MS Office Excel and Google Spreadsheets. These tools allowed us to store all of the information in one file. After doing that, we could analyze the data in more ways than one. You can see if some political parties have donors in common, or if some of them got the money from a company they hired afterward, etc. This way of showing data allows users to follow the money in a couple of clicks. 

After that, we spent a lot of time cleaning the data. Since parties insert the data manually, this step was crucial for our analysis. For example, someone could input Pink television as “Pink” and someone as “Pink TV” and when that happened, the software recognized it as a different media outlet. That is why we cleaned and tested all of the inputs. We used Spreadsheet and Open Refine in this step. 

At the end, we create dozens of pivot tables to look for conclusions. We had a programmer and a graphic designer who created the database on our website and its visual identity. We tested it manually – all team members have searched, filtered, and browsed the test version of the database and made sure everything works smoothly. We used various software for our data visualizations, mostly Flourish and Canva. We created the map of Serbia from a custom geojson file.

An independent fact-checker was hired to check the database. All of the stories were, as always in CINS, thoroughly fact-checked.","In its Country report Freedom house has ranked Serbia as partly free where ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) has ""steadily eroded political rights and civil liberties, putting pressure on independent media, the political opposition, and civil society organizations"". 

For years, SNS dominates political arena with control of the media and public institutions and with great financial power. In 2014, two years after they came into power, SNS urgently changed the Law on financing political activities which gave them financial advantage over the other parties. Public funds are main source for financing of political parties in Serbia and this is why it could be main threat for corruption and misusess. Even though in previous years there were cases of illegal financing of ruling Party (one of them for using proxy donors to disguise the true source of funds), not one person has been indicted. CINS's Party fund database shed a light on political financing and gave the oportunity for citizens to be informed and make informed choices.

Political parties are legally obliged to submit their financial reports to Serbian Anticorruption agency, after which Agency publish it on their website. But Agency's register is not user friendly, people cannot download data and cannot cross-reference it for different years, parties and/or reports. It demanded some basic knowledge about financing politicial activities so people can find what they are looking for. Also, register of party donors was removed from Agency's website after one of the SNS official and donor became their director. That is not the only example. Shortly after we published the database with almost 3.000 proceedings launched against public officials across Serbia in 2018, the data vanished from the Agency website. We tried updating using FOIA requests, but all of them were declined. For all of this reasons, our database is even more crucial. Not only we are saving data from possible erasing, but we are also make it more understandable for people.

Media are under government control and all tv stations with national frequency are main promoters of Aleksandar Vucic, president of Serbia and SNS. Pro-government newspapers, portals and tv stations are public voice of the ruling party and they were used to silence critics and independent media who are branded as ‘enemies of the state’. As CINS investigation and database showed, these media are main beneficiaries of election money coming from ruling party.","First of all, journalist can find a large dataset in a couple of clicks and dive into the world of political party financing. They can learn how the system works, who earns the most and which media otulets are favorized. Prior to working on this project, we frequently reported on the topic of political party financing and showed many flaws in the system. After reading these stories, journalists can look for their stories in the database. For example, a couple of years ago we discovered that the Serbian rulling party received office space in Belgrade as a gift worth about 1.3 million EUR, the value which exceeds the limit allowed by law. Our database contains information on more than 200 donations, and journalists can look for more unallowed ones. 

Our database was created by a small team of journalists and supervised by one editor. Our colleagues can learn they can work on ambitious projects as well, only if they plan ahead and give themselves enough time. This database can give them an idea for a project they could work on.

Official estimates in Rwanda show that the grey-crowned crane is hunted for meat and alleged medicinal value but also, some people use the birds as pets in their households and hotels. They are also sold to global illegal wildlife dealers.","Some activities by local villagers were conducted before an initiative to address this threat to cranes was developed. Some crane poachers have now refrained from the illegal acts and found other means of earning a living.

United States,MarketWatch,Big,Participant,,An inventory crunch is making life impossible for home buyers. Our interactive map can help you track the availability of houses for sale near you.,2022-05-12,"Long-form, Open data, News application, Map, Business, Economy","D3.js, Canvas, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Svelte, Jupyter Notebooks with iPython, Google Sheets","MarketWatch analyzed more than five years of monthly data from Realtor.com to drive reporting on the housing inventory crisis and to create a tool for users to search by county how many homes are available for sale in a given month, the median home price and the five-year change in these indicators.","The nation’s housing inventory shortage was one of the biggest economic and personal finance stories of 2022. The plunging number of homes available for sale caused housing prices to soar and complicated efforts of policymakers fighting inflation. To help readers understand the implications on a personal level, MarketWatch reporters turned to the data.

MarketWatch analyzed five years of raw monthly housing inventory statistics provided by Reator.com for more than 3,000 U.S. counties. The analysis drove MarketWatch’s reporting on the issue by identifying areas where the shortages were most acute, making sure to account for variations and noise in the data based on county size. MarketWatch created a unique interactive so that readers could easily search 2,296 counties by looking them up via a search bar or clicking on a map to see the five-year inventory change along with median list-pricing data. The tool updates monthly. 

By breaking down inventory figures by county, this project contextualizes the crisis for readers in their own markets. While the crisis is national, each county has its own challenges based on different variables and factors. For potential homebuyers seeking a move to another county, understanding how that area's landscape has changed over five years is key to understanding that housing market.

Other publications followed with their own stories on the issue using similar timeframes and data sources. Months after MarketWatch launched its housing inventory project, Fortune (https://fortune.com/2022/07/06/housing-market-correction-is-hitting-your-local-housing-market-as-told-by-one-interactive-map-home-prices/) published a U.S. housing inventory map that looked very similar to ours. But it had much more limited data and utility, covering only large metros as opposed to thousands of counties. It was also not easily searchable. The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/14/upshot/housing-shortage-us.html) reported that the housing inventory crisis was no longer a ""coastal issue,"" an issue that our reporting and analysis had revealed a month earlier.","Data that drives the reporting and interactive is gathered and organized into a repository of JSON files with a reusable Jupyter iPython Notebook. After each new month of data from Realtor.com is published, the Notebook is run to update JSON files in a Github repository, which are then deployed to public data storage using Jenkins and can be accessed by the interactive.

A CSV file is created and uploaded to a Google Spreadsheet with this Notebook as well. It is formatted in a consistent way that allows for comparable month-by-month analysis, which drives reporting by identifying which counties and metrics to focus on for our next stories. Those involved with the project can sift through the data to identify in which counties the housing inventory crisis is most acute and various other metrics that are useful in reporting like pending and active sales, median price per square foot, and average home price.

The front-end was developed using Svelte to create modularized components that are easy to rearrange and extract. The visualization library, D3.js, is used for rendering the choropleth maps using TopoJSON files stored server side. These TopoJSON files are created with a repeatable bash script with the topojson-client library, which merges topographical data with values (housing inventory change) that map onto a color scale.","As with any data-centered story, there are always compromises that have to be made and an explanation that data alone cannot 100% represent a situation. Deciding which metrics, type of data transformations, the time period, the granularity, and what these elements can say and not say together is important to explain for audiences. Realtor.com supplies many columns of data. In particular there are three separate data points for listings — total, active and pending — each of which give separate insight into a housing market. The decision to present total lists was a deliberate one. We wanted to capture the whole picture — the change in active listings shows surplus while pending shows actual buying activity. Because these two are more volatile, and we were seeking to understand both of these together over a longer period of time, the decision was made to use total as our core metric, using the other two as supplemental for our reporting.

Without a team of developers, compromises had to be made on how the interactive performs and is presented. Despite that, three separate views were created that each serve a vital part of telling the story of the housing inventory crisis. Each piece — the searchable map with detailed metrics by-county, the time-lapse map over five years and top-10 lists — was thoughtfully constructed with performance, relevance and necessity in mind. As the only developer for the interactives is a primarily front-end developer with limited time and resources to safely and reliably implement a database connection or build an API, a creative solution had to be found in order to handle the large amount of data this project requires.

The technological compromise made was creating a folder structure of multiple static JSON files stored publicly in place of a database to be queried with an API. JSON files with detailed data by county are divided into one file per state. This prevents the browser from requesting data for more than 2,000 counties at once, requesting the state file only when a county within that file is searched for or a state is clicked on. To speed up county searches within that state, the data is stored client-side so another cross-site request does not have to be made twice for one state.","While technological compromises had to be made with this project, these compromises can teach data and technological journalists that meaningful and robust work can still be accomplished quickly and securely. Building the interactives for this project centered on the product development practice of ""minimum viable product"" (MVP) — identifying a balance between usability, readability and performance to publish on quickly and often. This serves as a great way to think about deadline-oriented projects.

Thinking about coding journalistic products on deadline forces a simple approach, leading to longer-term viability. Storing static files on Github or other third-party sources reduces the reliance on internal databases and products that can quickly become outdated and neglected due to a product team's constraints. Less maintenance and less reliance on systems that could be decommissioned in future years means that it is more likely to survive multiple updates to websites and systems and be preserved on the internet for longer.",English,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/interactive-see-how-housing-inventory-has-changed-in-your-county-11672237111,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/inside-americas-housing-inventory-crunch-homes-available-for-sale-plunged-more-than-70-in-el-paso-raleigh-and-las-vegas-in-five-years-11652360287,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/believe-escaping-to-a-small-town-will-revive-your-dream-of-homeownership-those-housing-markets-are-not-as-idyllic-as-youd-think-11655210891,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/even-with-the-mortgage-rate-surge-houses-for-sale-remain-in-short-supply-in-cities-and-towns-11671544773,,,,"Reporters: Eleanor Laise, Jacob Passy

United States,"The Hechinger Report, Arizona Center For Investigative Reporting",Small,Participant,,Education Suspended: When students are blocked from class for missing class,2022-12-06,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Illustration, Chart","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python",This first-of-its-kind analysis uncovered widespread use of suspensions for attendance violations in Arizona and a potential civil rights violation.,"Our three-part series offers the most comprehensive look to date at this controversial discipline practice, even beyond journalism and into academia. As a result of our reporting, the Arizona Department of Education acknowledged that it may be time to revisit its discipline policies. The U.S. Department of Education’s assistant secretary for civil rights made one of the clearest public statements yet about her office’s commitment to investigating racial disparities in school discipline under the Biden administration. A researcher said he would like to use our database for an academic paper about school discipline. And a statewide nonprofit, Read On Arizona, discussed our findings in a special convening to combat chronic absenteeism. And a reader successfully challenged her fourth-grader's suspension, armed with information from our story.","We used student enrollment data available through the Arizona Department of Education’s website.

The only way to find out how often students were being suspended for attendance reasons was to request discipline data directly from school districts. We submitted more than 400 public records requests to Arizona's public school districts and charter networks. From there, we were able to request chronic absenteeism data by district from the state department of education, which helped us better compare district responses to absenteeism and direct our focus on individual districts.

Using the data we obtained from 89 school districts that suspended students for attendance violations from 2017-18 to 2021-22, we constructed our own database of all suspensions over that time period. Districts provided data in a variety of different ways, all of which had to be standardized and cleaned. Our final database included the violation, the number of suspensions and/or the number of days students were suspended (based on what was available) and the demographic information of the student suspended, namely race, ethnicity and special education status. We also hand-coded whether or not the violation was attendance related, sometimes reading through long narratives of the disciplinary incident to determine that. Our database ultimately included 13,582 rows, logging about half a million total suspensions. The cost to collect the data itself was negligible as very few districts asked for payment to produce the records.","School districts were deeply reluctant to provide the information we sought. Hundreds flouted Arizona Public Records law and ignored our repeated requests or refused to share the documents, in some cases on the advice of their attorneys. One attorney published an open letter giving school administrators a list of ideas to delay and evade our request, several of which contradicted state open records laws. Among the districts that provided their data, some presented it in messy and unstandardized ways, sometimes with heavy redactions. Many pushed back against providing the documents in an Excel-compatible format. 

We circulated a legal memo of our own, pushing back on the lawyer's public advice and highlighting relevant elements of Arizona's public records law. We went back to hundreds of districts multiple times seeking the original records and haggled with the vast majority of the approximately 150 school districts that did provide data to get everything we requested, in an Excel-compatible format, which sometimes required citing case law. Ultimately we couldn't get better than PDF scans for a handful of districts and more than 250 districts never provided complete data.","The data was very different across districts. Almost every district had its own taxonomy for behavior violations, with a long list of categories specific to that given district. Some had fewer than a dozen general categories (i.e., attendance violation) and some had more than 50 more narrow ones for a given year. To address this, we added a manually coded column to the database that identified whether or not that violation was attendance-related. 

Beyond that, districts gave us their data in one of four general formats: 1., (most common) as Excel-compatible spreadsheets where each row described a single disciplinary incident, 2., as Excel-compatible spreadsheets where each row aggregated a given violation type, 3., as PDF copies of spreadsheets organized in one of those two ways and 4., as PDF copies of scanned incident reports. For the first bucket, we could create simple pivot tables to aggregate violation types and put them into our database. For the second bucket, we could put the totals directly into our database. For the third, we had to convert, sometimes manually, the data into Excel for analysis and standardization. And for the fourth, we had to read through the incident reports to create spreadsheets for each district.",English,https://hechingerreport.org/when-the-punishment-is-the-same-as-the-crime-suspended-for-missing-class/,https://azcir.org/news/2022/12/08/black-hispanic-students-suspended-civil-rights-violation/,,https://hechingerreport.org/many-schools-find-ways-to-solve-absenteeism-without-suspensions/,https://azcir.org/news/2022/12/06/inside-data-analysis-arizona-attendance-related-suspensions/,,,"Tara García Mathewson, Fazil Khan, Maria Polleta","Tara García Mathewson is a reporter covering inequality and innovation in K-12 education, nationally, and she oversees coverage for Hechinger en Español as the languages editor.

We also added on-site reportage to the data and conducted a survey of truckers. We suggested alternatives such as a safe fare system and a total driving time system, and pointed out the attitudes of the government, politicians, and public that should be preceded for this.","Journalism reports dealing with workers' rights, industrial accidents and strikes in Korea are almost very superficial and fragmentary.

Readers deeply sympathized with the fact that ‘the structure and contradiction of the freight transport market is a matter of the community related to the safety of all citizens, beyond the interests of some workers and users’. In Korean society, ‘safety’ is a common value that can be a clue to resolving conflicts. In the midst of extreme conflict in Korean society over truckers, we have succeeded in highlighting 'safety' as the core of the issue.","We started working on 3TB of data that contains the monthly trajectories of 59,296 commercial cargo trucks in 1-second intervals. This data was then processed in two forms. First, we separated the status of the cargo truck into operation and stop and compressed it to 500MB. Second, we re-processed the movement on a national map with a 500m grid unit and compressed it to 16GB. The data on the first temporal dimension was represented on a tire-shaped graph, and the data on the second spatial dimension was represented on a map. These operations were performed in R.

The visualization results of 59,000 freight vehicles and other processed data in various formats were used as a basis for exploration and analysis, and the direction of the investigation was set and focused on specific areas and parts of the data that required further investigation and reporting.

The final results that were published in a web page format were re-created using JavaScript. The time chart represented like cargo truck tires was created using d3.js. The movement on the map was represented using deck.gl. We used scatterPlot layer, but we pre-processed the data so that the grids displayed according to the scroll are filtered, and thus, it was represented as if the cargo truck is moving.

The most important thing was the process of translating a month of unstable life into a tire-shaped pie chart. The pie chart of people with irregular lives looks like a worn-out tire, which seems dangerous. On the other hand, the pie chart of people who rest periodically looks like it can roll smoothly on the road.","The jury needs to evaluate this project in consideration of the special working environment, political situation, and media landscape of Korean society. As is widely known around the world, Korean society is a society of tremendous hard work, overwork, and long-term work. Late-night work, non-stop work, overtime work are very common. The resulting deaths and injuries of workers and citizens are very common, too. 

However, the efforts of the government and companies to solve these problems are not only very insufficient, but also have little will. The government and companies are very stingy in raising the minimum wage for workers, and when workers take collective action to claim their rights, they mobilize the police and courts to punish and threaten them. Moreover, most of the Korean media are on the side of these political powers and corporations. 
 
Our project aimed to bring about meaningful change in this social context. On November 24, 2022, around the time the ‘Let the trucks rest’ project was issued, truck drivers belonging to the ‘Hwamul-yeondae(trucker's labor union)’ went on strike. The current South Korean conservative government and President Yoon Seok-yeol strongly condemned the strike, comparing it to an “illegal strike,” “collective selfishness,” or “a disaster like the North Korean nuclear threat.” They imposed criminal punishment on the workers and demanded compensation for damages. The anti-labor press also poured out superficial and biased articles claiming that truck drivers went on strike “out of greed for money.” We gathered as many facts as possible to contain these unwarranted attacks. And it was effectively organized, arranged, and delivered to the readers.

The DTG data we analyzed contains information about vehicles in operation. This is essentially the driver's personal information. State agencies are collecting this data and, in some cases, it can be misused as a means of monitoring and controlling workers. Considering this, we tried to ensure that the data recorded by individual workers could realistically represent their poor working environment while protecting personal information and privacy as much as possible.

The ‘Let the trucks rest’ project was prepared over a long period of time from April 2022. We received DTG data from the Korea Transportation Safety Authority and Han sangjin, the professor of Seoul National University, analyzed and processed it in an easy-to-understand way for readers, and spent 24 hours taking on a 25-ton truck to observe the actual freight transportation market. We circulated survey questions to numerous truckers and interviewed professors, labor union’s leaders, and government officials. 

SISAIN, to which we belong, is a weekly magazine and a paper medium. However, in order to overcome the limitations of text journalism, a special web page was created(https://truck.sisain.co.kr). Our goal was to combine the strengths of data journalism and on-the-ground reporting to tell the story in the most effective and impactful way. Seungbum Kim, direcor of VWL(https://www.vw-lab.com), a great data visualization expert who has been collaborating with SISAIN since the 2021 'Beyond the School Zone' project(https://beyondschoolzone.sisain.co.kr), provided great help in this process.","The inspiration our project gave to other journalists in Korea can be confirmed through the comments in media magazines.

1. ...""It is even more difficult to find articles written by directly covering truck drivers. There are only a handful of articles that have looked into why the safe fare system is important and why the borrowers went on strike, and most of them are lumped together in the demands and slogans of a “group” called the “cargo union.” It is against this background that SISAIN’s report, 'Let the trucks rest'. In October, SISAIN accompanied the driver of the truck for 24 hours, revealing the reality of truck drivers' ""irregular labor"" that statistics and reports cannot show. This project, which started regardless of the cargo union strike this spring, drew sympathy by revealing the structural contradictions of the cargo market in detail with data and on-site coverage, discussing solutions such as the safe fare system, and presenting responsibility issues such as costs to be shared by members of society. https://url.kr/o4mncf
 
 2. ...“I know that there were many journalists who tried to properly inform the reality of cargo workers even in the midst of malicious reports about the cargo workers. In particular, SISAIN's special article ""Let the trucks rest"" (November 24) is a masterpiece that systematically and effectively delivers data on cargo labor through infographics and investigative reports and reports the reality of these workers in a living language.” https://url.kr/muql9p 

We know that other countries have similar problems in the truck labor market and have data similar to Korea's DTG. We believe that the 'Let the trucks rest' project is a meaningful first attempt at data journalism that can inspire journalists in other countries interested in labor, safety and human values, which are being pushed aside under the goal of efficiency.",Korean,https://truck.sisain.co.kr/,https://www.sisain.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=48964,https://www.sisain.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=48966,https://www.sisain.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=49010,https://www.sisain.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=49011,https://www.sisain.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=49069,https://www.facebook.com/byun.jinkyung/posts/pfbid02EobEiCrj3NCJy4yuo7YCBi8Tr3Dbvy4HMgQsgruoKpX3cFGtqAkDstKGWYnS9NLBl,"Byun Jinkyung ,

Egypt,Arab Reporters For Investigative Journalism (Arij),Big,Participant,,Forced Eviction Laws In Egypt Are Unfair,2022-11-22,Investigation,"Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","The investigation reveals an increase in cases of forced evictions of citizens from their homes and lands due to road expansion and bridge-building projects implemented by the Egyptian government in recent years, which led to an increase in the number of forced evictions of real estate and landowners by the government in exchange for insufficient compensation; this step violates the law on confiscation of property for public benefit and articles of the Constitution.","In response to the investigation, engineer Ehab Mansour, undersecretary of the housing committee of the Egyptian House of Representatives, submitted a briefing request to adjust the mechanisms for compensating citizens in case of expropriation for public benefit, in accordance with Law No. 10 of 1990, as amended by Law No. 187 of 2020, on expropriation of real estate for public benefit.

Following the publication of the investigation, the Egyptian government issued a decision to assess the compensation for expropriated citizens according to the prices prevailing at the time of the issuance of the public benefit decision plus (20%) of the assessment value, and the entity requesting expropriation deposits the full amount of compensation within a period not exceeding three months.

This has positively affected the life of society and citizens, as those who are expropriated from the property or land they own are compensated fairly, and compensation is not delayed after requesting a briefing and amending the law, which was a reaction to the publication of the investigation and their discussion in the House of Representatives.","Initially, the official gazette of the Egyptian state and the sorting of 200 issues of them were used in order to revise the decisions of the Egyptian President, the Council of ministers, ministers and local bodies on expropriation of citizens (real estate/ land) in order to build bridges, axes and road bridges, to build a database on the number of decisions and which entity issued more expropriation decisions during the period from 2014 to 2021.

It also relied on the archives of the Egyptian court of Cassation to revise the cases of expropriation filed by citizens against the dispossession decision-makers to create a database related to the judgments issued, compensation, their size and the amount of damage inflicted on them.

i then relied on data analysis tools in order to extract the information contained in the investigation from the aforementioned databases, as well as using Flourish and Datawrapper tools to list and present data and information via infographic to be clearer and easier for the reader.

Through these tools and means used, I came up with the numbers of expropriation decisions, the most issuing bodies for those decisions, the number of those affected, which regions are more, the amount of compensation received by citizens, and the number of cases filed against official bodies in protest against the expropriation decisions.","What context about the project does the jury want to know - the political landscape, resource constraints , legal threats , access to data , innovative technologies and so on
There is a security clampdown in Egypt, especially in the field of journalistic work and investigations that reveal the secrets and issues of corruption such as my investigation, the political scene in Egypt suffers from severe restriction and blocking of information, and there are huge numbers of journalists who have been thrown into prisons for exposing major issues and corruption is happening.

The danger inherent in the investigation is that I have worked on decisions issued by the president of the Republic and there are red lines approaching blackness in Egypt from compromising the decisions of the president, and from him to the decisions of the prime minister, it revealed huge suffering and flagrant violation of the law that occurs based on decisions issued by the head of state and his cabinet, which is a breach of those red lines, representing a security risk to my person.

Access to the data was also not easy, as the Official Gazette does not allow full access to its decisions, but I used some innovative tools and techniques in order to access it, as well as the archive of the Egyptian court of Cassation.

I also faced security threats due to the refusal of some areas and neighborhood heads to photograph the demolitions of houses owned by citizens, which threatens private property and violates the law.I filmed some police cars carrying out demolitions, which put me at risk at that time.","They learn data journalism and they don't just mean numbers and can build a story or a whole investigation that exposes corruption through that data
There are reliable sources of such data that are close to the journalist, but he is not aware of them, such as the decisions of officials in official newspapers, the archives of major courts in countries, and official statements of government bodies.
A good and thoughtful analysis of databases yields important information that can only be disclosed through data.I produced the investigation after a 6-month training with Arij on data journalism and learned the methods of Investigation, searching databases and moving on them to come up with confirmed information that benefits the investigation and supports the story.

Germany,"FUNKE Mediengruppe (Berliner Morgenpost, Hamburger Abendblatt, WAZ, Thüringer Allgemeine, Braunschweiger Zeitung and many more)",Big,Participant,,Climate Crisis: Mapping where the earth will become uninhabitable,2022-04-04,"Investigation, Explainer, Infographics, Map, Environment","R, Node.js","Scientists concluded in the IPCC’s latest report that we are currently facing global warming levels of more than 3°C, and warned of the detrimental consequences they will have for life on Earth. To illustrate the impact of global warming, we created an interactive visualization that allows users to explore some consequences of climate change. A three-dimensional globe shows which parts of the world are projected to become uninhabitable as a result of future sea level rise, tropical cyclones, heat and water stress, and how many people live in those areas.","The project received a lot of attention on Twitter and Reddit, and was featured in blogs and websites at the time. Climate scientists, politicians, climate justice activists, and many more shared it on their websites, social media and LinkedIn. The project has also been featured in talks held by leading scientists to highlight the need for openly accessible and interoperable data. Since then, the project was named one of the best of 2022’s data journalism both by the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) and DataJournalism.com. It was nominated for two Online Journalism Awards of which it won the Excellence and Innovation in Visual Digital Storytelling.","All data used for the interactive visualization is based on scientific studies and models. They were either openly accessible or were made available to us upon request to different researchers. We processed data from over a dozen different sources into a comprehensive dataset. We developed methodologies which we asked the scientists whose data we used to check.

For example, modeled projections for the future needed to be corrected for bias with data from historical observations in order to generate absolute values for future projections (e.g. future temperature values). Other data processing that was necessary included averaging huge amounts of data from several models using programmed scripts that took more than 10 hours of computing time in order to compensate for individual models’ various tendencies to over- and underestimate.

The interactive visualization was developed using a custom programmed react app and based on the three.js library.

Since the project is relevant to a global audience, we also collaborated with an English-speaking climate journalist for translation.","For this project, we requested and collected scientific data from different scientists and institutions working on various aspects of climate change effects. We processed the data from different sources - partly with code that took over 10 hours to run - into a uniform resolution we could display on the interactive globe. 

Our specific angle - wanting to show the probable consequences of current climate policy rather than a purely fictional scenario - posed an additional challenge when searching for raw data, as climate science often calculates effects for a best and worst case scenario (RC2.6 and RCP8.5) as opposed to a scenario that is closest to the current predictions. In some cases, that meant having to discard otherwise interesting and suitable data, in other cases we were able to extract data for specific warming levels from another warming scenario in consultation with the respective scientists.

Ongoing improvement processes of widespread climate models pose an additional challenge as it means that data from studies and research that are not fairly recent are quickly outdated and not suitable to use. Much of the data was only possible to obtain by direct contact to researchers and we were in close contact with the scientists to make sure our methods of further processing their data were legitimate.","1. Making domain knowledge from Earth and climate science available to the broader public:
Climate researchers are and have been calculating effects of climate change with sophisticated models that are able to make solid projections. The (full scope of) information generated by scientists is hard to access for laypersons, though. Even in scientific papers the data generated is often published as static graphics, not making the granularity of the data accessible to readers. 
We collected scientific findings across different specialized areas of study into a comprehensive overview and by using an easy to understand interactive visualization, we made information and data from in-depth research accessible to a broader audience in a way that also people who don’t have much pre-existing knowledge on the topic can follow. 
An extensive FAQ was added to explain jargon and basic concepts of climate research and policy, such as “RCP”s, “climate model” and more. We consider this project an example of how journalism can function as a translator / bridge between science and the public.

2. Dealing with complex information through different levels of engagement: 
Next to a more guided scrollytelling containing the most important context and information, the website also features an “explore” option that readers can use to interact with the data and visualization themselves. There, for example regions and states that are expected to be hit hardest are listed in an additional quick overview and any region or hazard can be explored in detail.

In conclusion, different aspects of climate change and its effects are communicated in a simple and engaging manner: interactive elements allow users to dig into details, and the narrative elements offer an overview that is to the point.","German, English",https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/klimawandel-hitze-meeresspiegel-wassermangel-stuerme-unbewohnbar/,,,,,,,"Ida Flik, André Pätzold, Benja Zehr (Interactive team)","Funke Mediengruppe's Interactive team implements interactive applications and data-driven stories for the Group's various news brands.

Using building blocks that represent emissions of typical products and services, users can visually and playfully build their climate budget: How often can you eat steak instead of going on vacation? How do the carbon footprints of smartphones and smoking compare?","This interactive story was part of the “sustainability weeks” at FUNKE Mediengruppe in October 2022.

The project received a lot of attention, especially on social media like Twitter. Both industry leaders and our readership praised the project for its innovative approach. The Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) mentioned this project as an example of successful game applications in their list of 2022’s best data journalism.","The application is a custom React app. The game itself takes advantage of the browser’s drag & drop functionality to implement an interface empowering users to build their own visualization. Browsing, selecting, turning, placing, and removing blocks are additional actions giving users full control of the game, which were all custom built to increase interactivity.","Data on CO2 footprints of specific products and services mostly don’t exist. One of the main endeavours of this project was therefore to collect from various sources the greenhouse gas emissions of as many actions and products as possible, and to gather them in a single database. Manual research and calculations were required. The average electricity consumption of an indoor swimming pool — and the corresponding emissions per visitor — is an example of such custom made calculations.","One of the main contributions this game offers is the manually compiled database of specific products’ and services’ emissions. Even though carbon footprints are regularly discussed, there are few quantified examples of the impact that specific actions have. Next to being an engaging playful interface, the project is also a call for data journalists to go beyond the data that is ready to be found or scraped. It demonstrates the value of following through with a project idea, and of finding the data that is needed for the project rather than vice versa. 

It is also an illustration of how interactive games beyond quizzes and other standard formats can be used as a key part of a data project for more effective communication, and shows how developing unique technical solutions opens up new horizons for journalism that cannot be achieved with standard graphs and visualizations.",German,https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/co2-budget-pro-kopf-testen-klimawandel/,,,,,,,"Ida Flik, Luc Guillemot, André Pätzold, Benja Zehr (Interactive team)","Funke Mediengruppe's Interactive team implements interactive applications and data-driven stories for the Group's various news brands.

Optical Character Recognition (For searching and translating Khmer language government records database)","‘Cambodia’s Cyber Slaves’ exposes large-scale trafficking, torture and enslavement inside the country’s multibillion dollar scam industry, the Chinese criminals behind it and their links to the ruling elite.

This compelling investigation reveals how thousands of young men and women are locked up in vast compounds and forced to scam targets across the globe.

Using victim testimony, video footage, concealed court records, compound coordinates, citizenship records, photographs and company registrations, it forensically maps an epidemic of fraud and slavery.

The resulting long-form documentary and interactive feature are a vital expose of grave human rights abuses.","Soon after the story broke, Cambodia was blacklisted on the US Trafficking in Persons report - triggering sanctions. FBI officials reportedly met Cambodian counterparts to discuss the issue, as did Foreign Ministers from across the region. A fugitive implicated in the interactive was arrested in Thailand. 

The program received widespread media coverage in the Asia Pacific, particularly online and including a front-page story in Australia’s national newspaper, ‘The Australian’. 

Online viewers around the globe praised Al Jazeera for exposing a previously unreported issue. Some revealed that they had been forced to work in cyber scam operations in Cambodia while others contacted us and said they had been about to take up jobs in Cambodia but decided against it after watching the documentary. 

Directly citing the 101 East investigation, a former Foreign Minister of Thailand lambasted the Cambodian Prime Minister in ‘The Diplomat’.

Cambodian government denials fell apart under an avalanche of social media pressure and regional coverage until the most powerful politicians in the country, including the Prime Minister, were finally forced to acknowledge there was a serious problem. 

A crackdown followed that saw thousands of enslaved victims freed from cyber fraud compounds, though key perpetrators remained untouched. Four suspects were arrested in Australia in December. Thai police launched major investigations. One implicated individual has since been unable to renew a permanent residency visa in a western country where he frequently resides. The fallout continues.","Before Al Jazeera traveled to Cambodia we began mapping companies tied to suspected perpetrators using C-Maps and later OCCRP Aleph’s network diagram tool while building detailed profiles on suspected perpetrators.

On the ground, extensive victim testimonies were recorded and cross-checked to further identify perpetrators. Video evidence and text message chains were extracted from phones. Coordinates were recorded for every suspected cyber slave compound, which were also discreetly filmed with drones and hidden cameras. Social media was scanned for photos linking implicated individuals to powerful politicians. Names and spellings were verified through a private citizenship database (that used Optical Character Recognition to scan and translate Khmer records) and recorded in relevant languages (Chinese, Khmer, Thai), then paired in web searches. Criminal convictions and Interpol red notices were systematically recorded.

All of this data was collated and analyzed in a spreadsheet/dropbox media archive that served multiple functions - as an evidence base for the investigation, an archive for our video editor and a database both for the composition of graphics and interactive elements.

Compound coordinates were joined with links to relevant drone shots, suspects’ company ownerships/directorship data, their criminal records, citizenship documents, photos of them with powerful elites and headshots. QGIS and Google Earth Studio were used to make base geospatial materials for After Effects, where they were combined with drone footage and photos, then animated. 

The same QGIS file was used to export geospatial data to the visualization tool Flourish and merge it with detailed profiles of the individuals behind them. This element was then embedded into our interactive feature ‘Meet Cambodia’s Cyber Slaves’. Finally, victim testimonies were collated into an interactive carousel, again built with Flourish, and embedded in the same feature project.","‘Forced to Scam: Cambodia’s Cyber Slaves’ was the first long-form documentary to expose the kingpins behind the country’s vast cyber slavery industry.

101 East first became aware of cyber scam operations in Cambodia in late 2019 while investigating illegal online gambling. But as Covid-19 lockdowns were enforced, travel became impossible, so our team focused on developing confidential sources remotely.

As the world began to reopen, we started finding images, videos and postings on social media sites detailing horrific cruelty inside cyber scam operations in Cambodia. Videos show victims begging for help as they were kicked, punched, beaten with large sticks and shocked with electric batons - their faces contorted with agony, their bodies covered in bleeding wounds.

Then came a challenging six months seeking out victims willing to talk and forensically sifting through their testimonies to identify those responsible. 

Working in one of the most corrupt countries in Asia where brutal government repression helps criminal syndicates act with impunity, our investigation required extreme stealth and careful strategizing to unearth the perpetrators and guarantee the safety of our sources and interviewees.

Reporter Mary Ann Jolley, who was previously forced to flee Cambodia while conducting another corruption investigation, returned to obtain first-hand accounts of the atrocities being committed inside these scam operations. Almost immediately, police started harassing her and our team, requiring caution and careful diplomacy.

Notwithstanding, the team managed to interview more than a dozen victims, including a man who broke his back and leg after jumping from the third floor of a building in a desperate escape attempt. A multiplicity of languages added to the complexity. Victims came from China, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar Malaysia and the Philippines. 

Traveling across the country, the team exposed the sites where thousands are allegedly imprisoned and enslaved.

Confidential sources provided access to private databases of government records, enabling them to confirm ownership of properties and identities and citizenship of individuals behind them. The team also secured rare access to court records in China to verify criminal histories. 

Employing forensic investigative skills, the team exposed the Chinese criminals behind these cyber scam operations and their links to the highest levels of the Cambodian government, including a veteran senator and two of his relatives; a tycoon sanctioned by the US for human rights abuses and environmental destruction; and Prime Minister Hun Sen’s nephew, Hun To.

Others implicated are Chinese fugitives and criminals who all appear to have close associations with the Prime Minister.

Given the dangers, the team could afford very limited time in the country and at each location. Filming outside the Prime Minister’s summer residence guarded by his much-feared bodyguard unit was risky, but crucial to showing how scam companies operate with apparent impunity. Filming the isolated Heng He compound was also perilous. 
 
Rigorous fact-checking, extensive rights of replies and attempts to doorstop many of those implicated, ensured accuracy and balance, as did confronting government officials.
 
Extraordinary lengths were taken to ensure that sources were protected and in safe locations before the program was broadcast.","‘Cambodia’s Cyber Slaves’ serves as an example of how shadowy and labyrinthine criminal networks can be untangled and exposed.

The strength of the work lies in how different types of data was collected, collated and analysed, then deftly presented in clear and engaging journalism.

It is worth examining Jolley’s expert distribution of evidence through her scripts to clearly prosecute dense arguments while retaining impact and engagement. 

The revelations contained within should draw much needed attention to the extraordinary scale of fraud that can be committed online and the need for journalists, law-enforcement and governments, to take serious actions to curtail these crimes.

The project reveals how unregulated digital technologies can be exploited by organised crime to extract billions of dollars.

It also shows how this global technology allows syndicates to operate from the protection of corruption-ridden refuges while freely targeting victims in countries otherwise guarded by strong rule of law such as the US. 

And it exposes how slavery has become frighteningly prevalent in our modern world. 

Until recently, awareness of the scale of this crisis barely existed. Solutions will not be quick or easy so sustained pressure is critical.

In dictatorships like Cambodia, violence, intimidation and tight judicial control have been used to silence dissenting voices and wipe out political opposition. The international media has a unique role to shed light on the dark underbelly that thrives in this vacuum of accountability.

These syndicates have discovered a new way to reap huge profits and destroy lives by exploiting universal human emotions like loneliness and greed. It’s a calculated, sinister and sophisticated strategy refined by gangsters and enabled by elites.

Their new weapon is information and the technologies used to distribute it. As journalists, we are all uniquely trained to fight back.",English,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-EtdC4zQso,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2022/8/11/meet-cambodia-cyber-slaves,,,,,,"Authors/Producers:

France,L'Obs (one of the largest French magazines),Big,Participant,,Money Laundering in French Real Estate,2022-07-07,"Investigation, Cross-border, Open data, Map, Corruption, Money-laundering","Google Sheets, Python","By matching government datasets available online, our cross-border team of journalists uncovered nearly €750 million of properties purchased with shady money, from Paris to the French Riviera. 

That is 196 suspicious real estate operations, carried out by 62 foreign individuals, including close family members of dictators (Cameroon, Azerbaijan, Togo...), known money launderers and Russian oligarchs.

Some sales involved French notaries with high-ranking positions in their profession’s accountability institutions.

The team expects this story will likely lead to court cases and prosecutions over the next few years.","The story was published in the print summer 2022 edition of L'Obs magazine and mentioned on the front page. The magazine is printed to around 200,000 copies. The story was also picked up by French media such as France Inter radio.

The story was widely shared amongst law enforcement agencies. One agency specialised in money laundering prosecutions contacted us to ask us to explain our methodology (we had to turn down a private call for ethical reasons). 

Other law enforcement officers showed interest in our work, acknowledging that the methods we used were sound and, sometimes, that they do not have enough resources to replicate them. 

In addition, we are aware that several non-profits are planning court cases on the basis of our investigation.","Our investigation was built on two government datasets. The first one, published by the French Ministry of Economy and Finance, lists all real estate properties owned by companies in France. It encompasses 16.1 million records. The second one, maintained by the French Institute for Intellectual Property, lists the shareholders and beneficial owners of the 11 million French companies. By combining those two datasets, we were able to find the names of people owning properties in France via a company, which added up to 2.48 millions names. 

Nearly all these names were irrelevant because many French citizens own real estate via companies. So our next step was to find the needles in this haystack: the names of people who might be laundering money through French real estate. To do so, we used several datasets of “interesting” names, such as OpenSanctions, Wikidata and others. We then matched these names with our dataset of French property owners. 

Eventually, we ended up with a few lists of several hundred names that we looked through by hand, searching the names on Google and weeding our false matches. We still ended up with a list of nearly 200 fairly well-known people who might be laundering money in French real estate. Ultimately, we focused on about 60 of them for practical reasons. 

The last step of the research was to file administrative requests for each of the interesting properties that we had found. We made 81 requests to the “Service de la publicité foncière”, a rather obscure government office that keeps track of land ownership in every French department. For each property, the documents that we obtained included purchase price, whether a mortgage had been taken, the names of the sellers and buyers, and the names of the notaries involved in the sale.","We used a French official dataset of company owners. At the time we were doing our research, this dataset included both shareholders and beneficial owners of french companies. Since 2021, French companies were indeed legally required to declare their beneficial owners. In November 2022, however, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the general public should not be allowed to access registers of beneficial owners, in the name of privacy. As of 1st January 2023, the French government has removed the names of beneficial owners from the database that we had used. Although most of the people we uncovered through our research were direct shareholders of French companies rather than “hidden” beneficial owners, this change will severely limit future investigations like ours. For example, without beneficial ownership information, we would not have found the French properties of Zhanna Volkova, the ex-wife of Putin’s former son in law.

In terms of data analysis, our main challenge was that many people used longer names in official documents than the names registered in datasets of Politically Exposed People. For example “John Smith” and “John Edward Smith” would not lead to a good match if comparing each letter. We tried out several fuzzy matching algorithms before finding one that worked.

Another problem was that we initially thought that we’d get a couple dozen interesting names, at the most. So when we found nearly 200 of them, we were a bit overwhelmed. We realised that we would not be able to work on all of them within our budget so we had to focus on about 60 names. We also collaborated with journalists from the countries where the Politically Exposed Persons came from - although most of our colleagues preferred not to be named in the article, for security reasons. 

There was also a high legal risk linked with publishing names of very powerful people while alleging that their investments in French real estate might be money laundering. We are very grateful to L’Obs for having our backs. Fortunately our story was not subjected to any lawsuit.","This project demonstrated that it is possible to do investigative stories revealing corruption and money laundering by solely using government datasets and documents. This had never been done in France.

Our methodology is highly replicable in other countries where similar datasets exist, which would include much of Europe and dozens of countries around the world. Furthermore, the French datasets that we used are now updated every year, so it is possible to look for new owners every year.",French,https://www.nouvelobs.com/justice/20220707.OBS60621/immobilier-de-luxe-comment-la-france-attire-l-argent-douteux-du-monde-entier.html,https://www.emmanuel-freudenthal.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Immobilier-de-luxe-comment-la-France-attire-largent-douteux-du-monde-entier.pdf,https://twitter.com/WillFitzgibbon/status/1545172335921176585,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6950818464148144128/,https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6950802217280921600/,https://twitter.com/yannguegan/status/1544979369172533254,,"Emmanuel Freudenthal, Yann Guégan, Coline Emmel, Youri Van der Weide with contributions by Karine Pfenniger","Emmanuel Freudenthal is a freelance investigative journalist based in Kenya.

Even on a city level, money and power obscure the picture of what needs to be done to ensure safety and justice for all. 

With homes swallowed by floodwaters and river erosion, migrants from different parts of Bangladesh have opted to move to the cities of Dhaka and Chittagong for 'safer ground. ' But these options for 'safer' ground are also sinking.","The Sinking Cities Project is a global cross-border investigation that examines how sea-level rise is impacting major cities and how their governments are responding to the consequences of climate crisis. My part focus on Bangladesh. After publishing the story- it was republished by different Bangladeshi and international media including BBC ALBA. Bangladesh policymakers are also concerned about the issues. 

The Government plans to bring water from a river that is 132 kilometer away to Bangladesh's largest industrial zone, which is currently under construction due to the worrisome effects of groundwater extraction. Chittagong Water Supply and Sewerage Authority decided to impose taxes on individual deep tube wells as a means of discouraging groundwater extraction after publishing the story.","We have used at the story data, video, info graph (A Flourish chart) and illustration.

Always the authorities are in a denial mode not to give information. At the same time in Bangladesh, there is a law called criminal defamation law known also as the Digital Security Act—which included sections of non-bailable and 10 years imprisonment for publishing anything using digital platform that hurt anyone. So, there were legal threats to publish anything. I was more cautious about the part of the water crisis of Bangladesh's largest industrial zone—where the country is expecting huge foreign investment. Anything negative about the industrial zone- government considers it as anti-government propaganda. Getting data also was a tough job for me. I spent around six months on this data. On my first visit, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority did not allow me to enter into their building. After waiting several hours I had to return with empty hands. Then I applied for data but they did not respond. Finally, I managed to talk Managing Director via my colleague.","This is a project that depicts almost every aspect of Bangladesh's climate crisis.

There is also the issue of how the safer ground (cities) is suffering as a result of the climate crisis. What are the cities' policies for these climate migrants?

What are the financial constraints to building climate resilience? How international organizations are assisting. How much money does Bangladesh spend to the climate crisis?

Netherlands,"Follow the Money, Platform Investico, De Groene Amsterdammer, Le Monde, De Tijd, Handelsblatt, El País, Børsen, IRPImedia, Der Standard, Luxemburger Wort, Luxembourg Times",Big,Participant,,The Great Green Investment Investigation,2022-11-29,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Fact-checking, Infographics, Politics, Environment, Business, Economy","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Bloomberg Terminal","Initiated and coordinated by the Dutch platforms Follow the Money and Investico, eleven leading European media collected and examined the portfolios of hundreds of investment funds that label themselves as dark green (‘Article 9’). We compared our database containing over 30 thousand investments with existing resources on the fossil fuel industry. Almost half of these allegedly most sustainable funds contained investments in fossil fuel and aviation companies, for a total of more than 8 billion euros. This goes directly against the European regulations governing sustainable investing.","The resulting articles were published on the front pages of some of the leading financial newspapers across the EU, tailored to their national audience. The publications made waves in the financial sector, as well as with politicians and in the ngo sector.

In the European Parliament (oral) questions were asked by MEPs Tang (NL) and Fernandez (ES) to the European Commission about the outcome of the investigation. The research has been discussed with euro commissioner McGuiness during a plenary meeting in January. 

Critical followers of the financial sector - such as NGOs, and politicians - have given attention to our investigation in various ways, including comments on social media, columns and opinion pieces. 

Banks and investment funds felt compelled to actively communicate the extent to which they are rightly seen as sustainable. (e.g. one of the team members got a push message in its bank app with a statement on the extent to which they emerge negatively in this investigation). While the actual cause-and-effect cannot necessarily be hard-wired, we see a lot of movement among the investment funds we reported on. In the week since the launch, fund managers such as Blackrock, BNP Paribas and ACTIAM have indicated that they are scaling down their Article 9 to Article 8 (less sustainable). In some cases (such as ACTIAM), specific references were made to this cross-border investigation. 

Various national authorities have asked about the data and methodology of our study. For instance, the Dutch research team was invited to give a presentation at the Ministry of Finance and the German team was asked by the national regulator to share insights.","This project was data driven, and started with obtaining a list containing all Article 9 funds available to European investors. We coded an autoclicker which automatically looked up each fund from this list and extracted portfolio data from a Bloomberg terminal. The terminal only allows users to look up funds one by one, and requires multiple input on multiple stages to verify the correct data is being pulled. We then used a custom written Python script to compile all these portfolios in one large database. We used Jupyter Notebooks, and the Google Colaboratory platform to execute these scripts.

To judge the sustainability of all these investments, we made use of several well respected resources in the financial sector. The Global Coal Exit List and Global Oil and Gas Exit List, both compiled by the German ngo Urgewald, helped us identify fossil fuel investments. And the British ngo Climate Bonds Initiative let us compare our data with theirs, to exclude veritable green bonds issued by fossil fuel companies. The fact that all investments are characterized by unique identifiers (so-called ‘ISIN codes’) allowed us to match all these resources with each other.

We then automatically created a specific data set for each country, listing all investments by all funds available to investors there, together with specific information on the fossil fuel companies occurring most. This allowed every partner to put its own spin on the underlying data.

In the final phase of the project, we asked a lot of financial institutions for comment, as well as national and European regulators, and experts on financial regulation.","A major constraint we had to overcome is the lack of publicly available information about the actual investments that a fund makes. While the top 10 largest investments are often published on their website, the total investments are only to be found buried deep in an annual report, if at all. This lack of transparency is striking for an industry that often prides itself on taking rational decisions, based on solid data. The fact that Follow the Money owns a Bloomberg terminal allowed us to circumvent this obstacle, but only after putting significant time towards extracting all the portfolios. The cost of such software is furthermore prohibitive for many smaller media.

Another challenging aspect of this project was the nature of sustainability itself. The concept is so vaguely defined that it even becomes challenging to designate major oil companies and coal mines as unsustainable. The European regulation stipulates that investments in these dark green funds should not ‘significantly harm’ the environment, yet what constitutes significant harm is not specified in much detail. This allows fund managers to find excuses for their investments in fossil fuel and aviation companies. Experts on financial regulation were however unified in their judgment: even this vaguely formulated law does not allow for investment in fossil fuel companies.","Cross-border collaboration becomes a lot easier when everyone starts with the same underlying data. We could approach the whole team with similar data files, which they could then find the stories in that were most relevant to their national audience. This created a solid base for the overarching story, while allowing all collaborating media to be flexible as to the contents and form of the final publication.",English,https://www.ftm.eu/green-investments,https://www.ftm.eu/articles/half-of-europes-dark-green-funds-invest-in-the-fossil-fuel-industry-or-in-aviation?share=G3xjZKcUMHBkMLmGOQ86hN3o%2FXP1z8n%2F0abLffKUNzOQgCu714f%2Bqy0S6GFperY%3D,https://www.groene.nl/artikel/wat-is-de-kleur-van-geld-groen,https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/anlagestrategie/trends/greenwashing-jeder-zweite-nachhaltige-fonds-investiert-in-oel-kohle-und-luftfahrt-/28835540.html,https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2022/11/29/la-grande-tromperie-des-fonds-d-investissement-verts_6152081_4355770.html,https://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie/algemeen/bijna-helft-groene-fondsen-investeert-in-vervuilende-bedrijven/10430870.html,https://elpais.com/economia/2022-11-29/los-agujeros-legales-de-las-finanzas-sostenibles-asi-acaba-el-dinero-de-los-fondos-de-inversion-mas-verdes-en-empresas-contaminantes.html,"Adrien Sénécat (Le Monde), Bettina Pfluger (Der Standard), Carlotta Indiano (IRPI), Daniele Grasso (El Pais), Edoardo Anziano (IRPI), Emiel Woutersen (Platform Investico), Fabio Papetti (IRPI), Giulio Rubino (IRPI), Ingo Narat (Handelsblatt), Joseph Gepp (Der Standard), Lars Bové (De Tijd), Lars-Marten Nagel (Handelsblatt), Linda van der Pol (Platform Investico), Martin Murphy (Handelsblatt), Mathias Hagemann-Nielsen (Børsen), Michael Verfürden (Handelsblatt), Peter Van Maldegem (De Tijd), Remy Koens (Follow the Money), René Bender (Handelsblatt), Sönke Iwersen (Handelsblatt), Thomas Klein (Luxemburger Wort), Ties Gijzel (Follow the Money), Ties Joosten (Follow the Money), Tom Bolsius (Follow the Money), Volker Votsmeier (Handelsblatt), Yannick Lambert (Luxembourg Times), Yara van Heugten (Follow the Money), Leon de Korte (Follow the Money)",Follow the Money and Investico gathered a team of European journalists with financial and/or data expertise.

We used fictional Noah (13) to tell the story in a timeline, and enriched the timeline with video and audio material of kids, influencers and experts.","As a result of our project the Dutch alcohol industry forced influencers to delete videos containing alcohol brands from their social media.

The Dutch State Secretary for Health also announced working on ways to get the videos out of kids' timelines.","To make this story, we created an account on TikTok for fake 13-year-old Noah van de Bosch. We created his picture with a Random face Generator, which generates photos of non-existing people from numerous pictures. After that, we started scrolling on TikTok. 

The first ten minutes on TikTok we were passive. We didn’t do searches and didn’t give “likes.” After ten minutes we did entered relevant search words like “drank challenge,” “drankjes mixen” (mixing drinks) and “drankspel” (drinking game). We also started following content creators and giving “likes” to videos. In total, we gave 68 “likes” (62 unique videos, 6 doubled).

After feeding the algorithm for half an hour by explicitly searching for drinking videos, we went back to the “For You” page which filled with alcohol-related content.

After the experiment, we retrieved the data from TikTok and then analyzed the data using Excel.

In total, we saw 1,228 videos. We saw some videos twice. We removed those from our list, so that we were left with 1,179 unique videos. Of those videos, 63 contained an alcohol brand. That’s 5.3 percent of all unique videos. Meanwhile, 18.9 percent of all unique videos contained alcohol in general, like people proposing a toast or just having a drink (brand or no brand visible).

The TikTok account (user6617701857793) was created on April 12th, 2022. We retrieved the data on April 19th, 2022. For this analysis, we watched the 1,228 videos that were shown on Noah’s account between 11:43:55 a.m. and 12:48:20 p.m. In total, we gave 68 “likes” (62 unique videos, 6 double).

We created a database of over 350 thousand scientific studies published between 2000 and February of 2022. We narrowed it down to studies where scientists from Western European universities collaborated with Chinese colleagues directly linked to an institute that is part of the Chinese army. We were left with 2,994 studies.","The investigation sparked the debate on knowledge security in several European countries. Experts, including the secret services in the Netherlands, called our findings 'worrying'.

Parliamentary questions have been raised in countries such as Germany, and in the Netherlands the parliament asked for an official debate on the issue. The Education Minister stated that the screening of non-European scientists should be stricter and made a promise to come up with a specific list to help universities in excluding certain students/organizations from their courses.

In Belgium, universities made the joint statement that they will better protect their knowledge from foreign interference by countries such as China. There have been consultations on this with the State Security Service.

In Denmark, regulations and guidelines for universities to curb foreign espionage and abuse of Danish research and technology had been being worked on for two years. The government announced a ""paradigm shift"" and presented new guidelines for universities. The Minister of Education and Science felt compelled to proclaim that China Science Investigation once again announced why the new legislation was necessary.

The German Federal Foreign Office had been tasked with drafting the federal government's new ""China strategy"". It would deal with the new way of dealing with China, especially in economic relations. Federal Minister Bettina Stark-Watzinger (FDP) referred to the responsibility of universities at the Federal Press Conference on 20 May: they should be sensitised to cooperations and ""supported in going their own way"". 

The CDU/CSU expects a ""concrete agenda"" from the Research Minister, who should ""initiate talks with the relevant bodies such as the German Rectors' Conference and the German Research Foundation. 

Although unclear if there is a causality, Swissuniversities, an umbrella organization for Swiss higher education institutions published a guideline for international research cooperation in the weeks after the investigation was made public.","For the quantitative research into scientific collaborations between Europe and the Chinese military, Follow the Money collected scientific studies with at least one author affiliated with a European institute, and another affiliated with a Chinese institute listed on Lens.org. All articles were published between January 1st 2000 and February 1st 2022. The resulting dataset contained over 350,000 studies.

We cleaned and parsed this data using Python, and analyzed it using Aleph, a tool built by the OCCRP. This software uses a graph based data structure, so we converted our clean data to this format using the OCCRP’s Python package. We used their command line tool to push the dataset to our Aleph cluster, and journalists from collaborating newsrooms were given access. Here, they can analyze papers, researchers, and institutions relating to their country.

Unfortunately, Aleph can’t do path queries. There was no way of knowing which papers were, for instance, a collaboration between two specific institutions. Using Aleph’s command line tool, we exported our FtM data structure to Neo4j. This graph database system uses the Cypher query language, created to do path queries. Our data journalist wrote path queries for all newsrooms and exported the results to csv for further analysis.

Another big challenge was the naming of institutions in English. These are often not directly translated from Chinese. It proved difficult to find, for instance, all institutions with military connections. Using The China Defence Universities Tracker (by ASPI) and The People’s Liberation Army’s 37 Academic Institutions publication (by CASI), we created a database of Chinese institutions, their English and Chinese names, and any known aliases. We did fuzzy matching between this and our dataset, to find institutions we suspected might be military. We manually confirmed these suspicions before analyzing any papers written in collaboration with these institutions.","The biggest struggle this investigation faced was the fact that researchers from other countries in the world - think of the US - were conducting research with European scientists, developing technologies that could be used for the wrong purposes. So it was a precarious odner topic to explain why China needed to be investigated by this collective. 

At the same time, there was the difficulty that the Chinese government is quite closed, making retrieval of comments very difficult.","Cross-border collaboration becomes a lot easier when everyone starts with the same underlying data.

India,The Hindu,Big,Participant,,Adjusting to climate How Kerala got it right in 2022,2022-08-29,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, Podcast/radio, Chart, Audio, Environment","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","In Kerala, India, it rarely rains in August. Rainfall usually peaks between June and July before tapering off by August—but patterns have changed due to climate change. Unpredictable rainfall is a headache for people who manage dams. In 2018, Kerala faced one such August, with copious amounts of rain coming down in a short span. Dams overflowed and close to 500 people died. But in 2022, despite facing a similar August, dams did not overflow, and there were hardly any deaths. What changed? Using data we explain how Kerala managed its dams better this time around and escaped another tragedy.","To understand better how Kerala did it, we interacted with the manager of one of the biggest dams in the State, in the city called Idukki. We converted the conversation into a podcast for our data based podcast channel: Data Point (https://open.spotify.com/episode/2R3OfndcFDa6oQPwEovHUT). The ""Data and dams: How Kerala cracked flood management"" remains one of the most listened to podcasts of last year.

Data about dam maintenance, with all the technical jargons broken down, is a rarity in Indian journalism. There are various factors involved: amount of rainfall, inflows into the dam, storage capacity of the reservoir, outflows and spills from the dam. If there are two years which recorded very high amounts of rainfall in a month when it was least expected, and only one of them led to a disaster, it is important to understand how it was managed. 

Given that climate change is a clear and present danger, the world is moving towards adaptation. One of the primary goals of the COP26 summit was adaptation. The goal describes adaptation as follows: ""building defenses, warning systems and resilient infrastructure and agriculture to avoid loss of homes, livelihoods and even lives."" Kerala's successful dam management falls under this category given that climate change has shifted the rainfall patterns in the State. 

This piece, using a data-based approach, has given a new way to analyze and understand dam management instead of relying on information supplied by those involved in the work. It gives a new tool for journalists and researchers to come up with bias-free conclusions about a subject which is hard to understand and impacts thousands of lives during excessive rainfall — a phenomenon which is only going to increase in the coming days.","Kerala's statistics about dam management were available in https://sldckerala.com/index.php?id=7
It gives the data in a daily format. So we used python to scrape the data out. The program was designed in such a way that it will load all the dates and scrape the data out and give the final numbers in a CSV file. 

Now more than scraping, the bigger challenge was to understand what the column headers stood for and the unit as like most Indian datasets, this one too did not have any meta data. 

For instance, the website's table has a column named ""spill"". Nowhere it is explained, what spill means. So most of the data was in dam related jargon, if we are not able to decipher it, it is at the end of the day a bunch of meaningless numbers. 

So we started calling dam managers in Kerala to understand what spill means, what is minimum drawdown level, how are inflows and outflows measured and was able to make sense of the numbers which led to the story.","The biggest problem with the project is the jargon that is used by those who are responsible for managing a dam. Hundreds of people die in India due to poorly managed dams that leads to floods in times of excessive rainfall. So, there is a need to fix accountability. 

However, the experts themselves will not explain the issues behind, given that they are involved in managing them in the first place. Because if mistakes emerge, they may have to face the consequences. 

So, mostly we need to learn the jargons involved and the dam management techniques used, by ourselves. And so, we did that over many years. Yes, this is not the first time we attempted to understand the workings of a dam. 

In 2015, when parts of Chennai city in Tamil Nadu sank, we experimented with dam related data for the first time. Using parameters such as inflows and outflows, we explained how the tragedy was a result of a ""wrong call"" made by persons incharge. Please refer to attachment ""Chennai 2015"" for details .

In 2018, when Kerala sank, we again dabbled with dam data and this time we added more details such as spills and outflows to enhance the understanding of how dams were mismanaged. Refer to ""Kerala 2018"" attachment for details. 

In 2022, it came a full circle when we were able to compare two years — 2018 and 2022 — and able to come to a conclusion regarding what worked and what did not. Refer to ""Kerala 2022"" attachment for details.","Following a topic with persistance, however tough it may be, will yield results. And if we crack it once, multiple stories will follow.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Participant,,Putin's energy weapon: how deadly will it be?,2022-11-26,"Open data, Politics, Health, Economy","CSV, R, RStudio, Statisitcal modelling, geo-spatial analysis","Before the war Russia supplied 40-50% of the EU’s natural-gas imports. But in August Mr Putin turned off the taps on one of the biggest pipelines. The price of gas and electricity surged. 
High energy prices are not only bad for people's wallets but also their health. As prices rise, the most vulnerable skimp on home heating, raising their risk for lung and heart problems. 
With winter approaching, we modelled how deadly Putin's 'energy weapon' might be. We predicted that high fuel prices could result in 150,000 excess deaths in Europe. More than have died in the fighting so far.","Since being published in December the page had 116,000 unique page views, with an average read time of 4 minutes 20 seconds. Even though it was published late in the year it had the most views of any 2022 Graphic Detail article, and was in the top 5 most read interactive articles of 2022. 

The story contributed to our cover package that week, and was referenced on the cover of the magazine. I also wrote a follow-up story about the effect of government interventions which could not fit in the original piece (see link 2). 

Our estimates were used by other news organisations in their articles (example in link 3 below), and were widely shared on Twitter. Most interesting to me was a follow up discussion with academic researchers on twitter (and via email) about our finding that warmer countries have more winter deaths and are more sensitive to falling temperatures (see link 4).

I discussed the piece on our 'The Intelligence' podcast (link 5), and the story was picked up by a number of data-journalism newsletters.","We created a model to identify the effect that fuel prices have on winter deaths in Europe, with the goal of then estimating how may deaths we may see this year when fuel prices are so high. 

The model was designed to predict the weekly death rate, within 226 NUTS2 regions, of 29 European countries, between 2000-2019. One of the most important predictors, which has a very strong relationship with death rate, was the temperature in the region. This was calculated using the Copernicus E-OBS data, which gives gridded daily meteorological data across Europe. We population-weighted to create average and low temperatures for each region each week. Other weekly predictors we used were precipitation, flu spread and whether the AH3 strain was most dominant. A variety of demographic measures were also included (age structure, income, government expenditure etc), and also information about housing energy efficiency. We trained the model only on the data from the 'winter' months, October- April to avoid any effect from heat-wave days.

We then developed scenarios for how this winter might look. We knew that fuel prices were likely to be high, so we took the October prices and assumed they would stay roughly constant throughout this winter. Using the data from previous winters we created some temperature scenarios for warm, average and cold winter. 

We then plugged these new numbers into the trained model to estimate the number of deaths that might occur this year. The estimates were grim. Assuming that historic relationships hold, in a year with moderate temperatures and normal flu levels, assuming energy prices stay near October levels (but accounting for confirmed price caps and discounts) around 147,000 (4.8%) additional people might die, compared with if prices were at 2015-19 levels. 

All analysis was performed in R.","In this project we hoped to quantify the impact that high fuel prices would have on ordinary Europeans. This was a very important political question at the time, as governments were finalising their winter fuel subsidies. Previous studies in the UK and US had highlighted the impact that fuel prices had on the winter death toll, but the same effect had not been investigated across Europe. 

This project involved an large amount of data processing and cleaning. Extracting the average, population-weighted temperatures for each region created many gigabytes of data. Most of the data was freely available from EUROSTAT or the European Commission, but data on monthly fuel prices and government interventions were provided by a private company.","Journalists can see that it is possible to do thorough but responsive analyses that have a big impact.

This investigation documents 1000 incidents of collapsed buildings between the years 2014 and 2020, which have left 500 deaths, a third of which are children, and another third are women, according to the numbers published by Egyptian newspapers.","Shedding light on the issue of looming buildings in Egypt, and linking that to the problem of old rental contracts helped increase the public awareness towards the problem, and that is considered to be a big impact of the investigation.

Also, the Defence Headquarters of the Nigerian armed forces declared terror kingpins exposed in the story wanted and placed N5 million bounty on each of them. Some of the terrorists would later be killed by the army following the social media controversy that trailed the investigation.","Crisscrossing 17 local government areas of Nigeria’s Zamfara and Sokoto states, the journalist spent weeks gathering data probing armed and menacing terrorists diverting hundreds of millions of taxes that should go into pockets of states. 

The reporter showed how citizens paid millions of cash in exchange for peace in communities with little or no government presence. And in the space of one year alone, the terrorists amassed over N600 million in taxes that should go into the Zamfara state pocket.

This investigation showed heavy data on how terrorists – locally known as bandits – invested in multi-billion illicit farming to finance their terror activities in the region. The story exposes the survival and resilience of the terrorists who raise and spend money to oil their violent crimes. 

In addition to kidnapping for ransom and forcibly extracting levies from communities left unprotected by states, my report showed how terrorists engaged in farming, which involves forced land capture and massive slave labour.","Four three years, this story remained unattempted because of its cost and characterisation and acess denial. But after painstaiking research for months, I found a way out.

Disguised as a helpless local uprooted by war, embedded myself in the ungoverned spaces for weeks and documented how the terrorists took over the governance and economy of communities unprotected by the government. My report showed how the terror group milked vulnerable citizens to enrich their pockets in communities that should be under the sovereign authorities of states.",One essential thing about this project is the use of raw data collected by the journalist across the state.

O último sobrevivente do povo Tanaru resistiu solitariamente durante quase três décadas, após ver seu povo ser dizimado. Com a morte do indígena, latifundiários alegam ser donos do território e entraram na justiça para obter o direito à terra. Durante quase dois meses busquei saber quem eram os ruralistas. Tarefa dificultada por instituições públicas detentoras desses dados. Recorri à Lei de Acesso à Informação, que demorou a dar respostas, mas, revelou a identidade dos ruralistas que querem expandir seus pastos e lavouras para dentro da TI Tanaru.","Além de dar notoriedade e transparência a um caso que em tempos de polaridade no Brasil, onde os povos originários não tinham a visibilidade necessária, a reportagem é citada em uma Ação Civil Pública ajuizada pelo Ministério Público Federal que requer da Fundação Nacional dos Povos ìndigenas que a área do ""ìndio do Buraco"" seja reconhecida como terra pública e tenha destino socioambiental. 
A matéria foi republicada por outros sites de notícia, compartilhada por jornalistas verificados no twitter, onde obteve milhares de visualiações e inúmeros retwetts.","A reportagem levou dois meses para ser produzida. Para construir o conteúdo, procurei ouvir todas as partes envolvidas, além de me embasar em referenciais teóricos, checagem de dados e pesquisa de processos. Foram entrevistadas três pessoas e consultadas várias fontes de dados, entre elas uma tese de doutorado, uma petição, uma ação civil pública e o site do MPF. A matéria procurou oferecer diversidade de vozes e perspectivas amplas: históricas, geográficas, ambientais e etno-sociais. O grande diferencial foi a resposta obtida através do pedido de informações à Funai, por meio da Lei de Acesso à Informação, que deu robustez à matéria a partir da divulgação, exclusiva, dos nomes dos latifundiários interessados na Terra Indígena Tanaru.","É fundamental que se diga que no governo anterior houve um desmonte das políticas públicas ambientais e não houve, como prometido pelo ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro, enquanto candidato, nenhum centímetro de terra indígena demarcada. 

Também foi difícil construir a reportagem sem ter acesso à Terra Indígena Tanaru. Na Amazônia as distâncias são enormes e muitas vezes é preciso percorrer longos trechos de estrada de terra. 

Outro ponto que deve ser destacado é que muitas fontes tiveram medo de se manifestar por medo de retaliações. O medo não é infundado. A Amazônia registra níveis elevados de assassinatos de ativistas, ambientalistas, protetores ambientais e defensores dos direitos humanos. 

Sobre o acesso aos dados, embora exista a Lei de Acesso à InFormação (LAI), outra lei, a Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), acaba sendo usada como escudo para privar o jornalista das informações que busca. 

Por fim, é preciso identificar bons e críveis referenciais teóricos na internet que podem ajudar satisfatoriamente a subsidiar a reportagem.","O mais importante é não desistir após a primeira negativa de informações. É preciso ter um número amplo de fontes confiáveis e em tempos de imediatismo da notícia, não ter pressa para apurar um fato. Vale mais construir uma reportagem bem aprofundada e com dados novos e robustos, que uma notícia superficial.

Sobretudo, mesmo sabendo de antemão que alguma ação será realizada, se a fonte pediu sigilo temporário, respeitar esse tempo. Construir essas pontes pode até render que uma notícia seja dada em primeira mão pela fonte.

Google Cloud Platform
Github

Typescript","The project levarages strong visual illustrations and gamification of interactive quizzes and AI simulations to encourage a wide audience to understand the innovative image-generative AI technology released in 2022. The image generative AI, ""Stable Diffusion,"" featured in this article, uses a technique called ""Latent Diffusion Model"" that ""generates images from noise"" in response to user input of any word.The birth of generative AI such as Stable Diffusion and chatGPT is a major step toward the technological singularity. In terms of science communication, this project is successful in communicating to readers how generative AI works .","In the world's news media, This project is so far the most successful piece of science communication on artificial intelligence . Generative AI, by its very nature of using human products for training, is controversial in terms of intellectual property rights and ethics, but there are also many examples of misunderstanding of AI technology that confuse the debate. In some cases, AI researchers and AI-enhanced designers have been slandered on social networking sites. A typical example of misunderstanding is the perception that generative AI directly generates images by collaging human products used for training so that AI violates on intellectual property rights.

Through careful discussions with AI researchers, this project has succeeded in correcting misunderstandings about collage, while creating an image-generating AI mechanism that ""generates images from noise"" with strong visual and interactive elements, and achieving both comprehensibility to a wide range of readers and scientific accuracy. This success is evidenced by the response to the project: many people on social networking sites responded that they could understand how AI works in a very easy-to-understand way, and the Github program used in the project to reproduce image generative AI received multiple stars from AI researchers.

The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/ai-image-generator/) and other media have also launched experiential content using image generative AI after this project. Our project was the first and highest quality experiential content published soon after the release of Stable Diffusion. This project will remain valuable for many years to come as a snapshot of the early days of generative AI, which will be a game changer in the 2020s.","AI/Machine Learning:
This project uses more than 1,000 images generated by the latest image-generative AI ""Stable Diffusion"" released in August and December 2022. Stable Diffusion generates elaborate images according to the words entered. In the human or AI quiz, we used a variety of creative words to create AI-generated images resembling famous painters such as Van Gogh and Renoir.

Python/Scraping:
We built an image-generative AI by using machine learning libraries (Pytorch, Transformers, etc.). For the latter half of the project, we built an automated pipeline using Python and had the AI generate a large number of images (about 1000) for an experience that allowed the AI to pseudo-generate images by arbitrarily selecting 10 keywords.
To illustrate what a large amount of data was used to train the image generative AI, tens of thousands of public domain images of artworks from the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the AI's training dataset ""LAION-5B"" were obtained using scraping methods.

Google Cloud Platform:
The image generation and data acquisition described above require large-scale computing resources such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) and time. By building a scalable large cloud computing environment, we were able to successfully apply AI to image generation.

Github:
Github provides a program that anyone can use to run the image generative AI discussed in this project. It is also possible to reproduce the generated images used in this project.

React, Typescript:
They are used as a front-end language to build the gamification of the human or AI quiz and the simulated experience of the image generative AI.","This is an innovative project that takes the latest AI for image generation as its theme and uses actual AI for content creation. The project is capable of outputting approximately 1,000 different images based on 10 keyword combinations. For example, among the 1,000 possible combinations, the keywords ""Kyoto"" and ""Paris"" can be entered simultaneously to produce a strange and unique image of the Eiffel-like Tower in a Kyoto-like cityscape. This is an unprecedented example of journalism that makes full use of AI, using a large amount of computing resources and algorithms in cloud environment. The generated images are created with the latest AI models, which will be released between August and December 2022.

This project also carefully considered the legal issues surrounding image generative AI under the supervision of an attorney specializing in intellectual property rights. There are two major issues in image-generating AI: whether it is legally acceptable to use existing copyrighted works for training, and the legal risk that the generated images may have similarities to existing copyrighted works. We have confirmed that this project has no intellectual property issues under Japanese domestic law, and we have also guaranteed reproducibility by releasing a program on Github that can reproduce the image generation.

In this project, scientific accuracy was ensured not only through the supervision of professional AI researchers, but also through technical verification by the journalist himself, who carefully read and understood the paper on generative AI (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752), and reproduced and implemented it in his own in-house computing environment. The scientific correctness is ensured through those technical verification.

The theme of the Human or AI quiz was carefully chosen to metaphorically represent the project's theme of ""how humans and AI should coexist"". Impressionist paintings such as Renoir's and Post-Impressionist paintings such as Van Gogh's were inspired by the birth of the pioneering technology of ""photograph"" in the 19th century, and the quiz metaphorically expresses the message that the birth of image-generating AI in the 21st century will spur new human creative activities, and that AI and humans should productively coexist in the future.","Science communication is the issue that the media and politicians around the world failed miserably to address during the COVID-19 pandemic. The gamification of the human or AI quiz played an important role in attracting a wide range of readers to the article. The explanation of how AI works is the result of heated discussions among journalists, editors, engineers, designers, and researchers on an equal footing, and manages to combine scientific accuracy with ease of understanding for the reader.

The AI simulation section illustrates the importance of cloud computing in journalism. Cloud computing allows computing resources to scale semi-infinitely as needed, making it possible for a single journalist to analyze very large amounts of data and use sophisticated AI on a large scale.

At the end of the project, a reproducible program is available on Github, allowing anyone to easily run the image generative AI and regenerate the AI-generated images used in the article. The project also ensures transparency and verifiability, which are important to the ethics of both data journalism and science.

This project demonstrates the value of news media investing in R&D departments, and the high value of having newsrooms that follow the latest news and R&D departments that follow the latest technology working together.

The generative AI discussed in this project is not only an important issue for journalists in the context of fake images and AI ethics, but should also be recognized for its importance as a tool for journalists to organize and retrieve vast amounts of information.","Japanese, English",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/ai-art/,https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mWVx2L09TXPvIarEstH1bY0bChSny1FV#scrollTo=cgQGpK3fw7Nj,https://github.com/Olivine-Ryo/ai-art,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/ai-art/,https://www.nikkei.com/telling/DGXZTS00002960R21C22A1000000/,,,"Ryo Namiki

It has used these plantations to justify fund transfer from the develped world in global climate negotiations through programs like REDD+. However, an in-dept investgation shows that most of these plantations are non-existence and in some cases, the data shows, that the Indian state has claimed to have planted trees in the Arabina Sea and the Brahmaputra River. 

The story raises bigger concerns over ""nature based solutions"" and afforestation activity as efforts to combat climate change.","The story was used by an opposition parliamentarian to raise a question in the Indian Parliament. The story was used by name in the Indian Parliament to discuss plantations. 

The story is being used as evidence in two separate court cases, one in National Green Tribunal of India (India's environment tribunal) and in state level court of the west Indian state of Rajasthan.

An environmental non-profit based out of Delhi is using the methodology employed by me in the investigation and shared with them after the publication of the story, to generate more evidence on India's ""ghost plantations.""

The Global Investigative Journalism Network selected the story in its 2022’s Best Investigative Stories in India list. ","For this story, I have relied on India's trnaparency law, the Right to Information Act, to get the data on the status of plantations. Then I used statistical sampling methods to identify a smaple of 2,000 kml files (uploded by Indian states to mark the GPS location of these plantations). For all of these 2,000 files, I used Google Earth to verify whether there was any vegetation on the ground. To improve the nature of this evidence I used Goolge Earth's Historical Imegery feature to map the changes on the ground, as visible through time, to the timelines of the plnatation -example when was the plnatation done- mentioned in offical docuemnts. 

Identifying these plnatations on the gorund was a challenge too, because most of them were in secluded areas without prominant land marks. More importantly, these plantations were on small areas, measuring in acres, it was important to make sure that what I was seeing on the gorund was actually the site of the plantations and not a nearby area. For this I used the lat-long data from the Google Earth, cooroborated it on Google Map, dropped pin on all of the locations, and used Maps to navigate to these areas.","The research for this story proved to be more difficult than anticipated as the Indian ministry of environment, which was a source for a lot of the documents, kept stonewalling my requests for information, despite these requests being made using the national transparency law.","In this story, I have not just relied on documents from the government to investigate an issue, but used GPS technology to generate evidence to support my investigation. If anything, the learning from this story is the use of appropriate digital technology to take one's investigation one step further than what your paper trail of documents is hinting at.

Billions of dollars are pledged to kickstart ambitious national programmes to build renewable-energy resources and move away from fossil fuels. #PowerTracker investigated where this investment ends up, and how it is being used. We provided training and ongoing support for journalists in Southern Africa–and beyond–over the course of several months, which culminated in the publication of a series of data-driven investigations, and a new and unique dataset that focuses on renewable energy projects in the region.","The biggest impact of #PowerTracker was empowering and upskilling local journalists and media outlets, which has resulted in enhancing the capacity of Southern African data journalism. 

Following publication of five in-depth investigations and the release of an exclusive dataset related to close to 200 green energy initiatives across the region, the project was published in more than a dozen local and international media outlets (in total, it was published 22 times); team members were invited to share their findings on numerous panels and conferences (notably, the [African Investigative Journalism Conference](https://aijc.africa/aijc2022-programme/) and the [Code for All Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ofIwMP9v5Q)); more than 300 journalists were trained in data-based environmental journalism, using [project material](https://oxpeckers.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Strengthening-Environmental-Journalism-PowerTracker-Learning-Narrative.pdf); we have seen increased awareness on green energy projects in the region; new information about some of the renewable energy projects investigated was revealed (and will contribute to the region’s shift towards cleaner energy resources); and the project’s journalists have been approached by sources (government and otherwise) to do follow-up stories. 
 
We also partnered with 20 different organisations to source and access data, developed and hosted four training modules, ran eight different social media campaigns and reached 124,621 unique users on our website and social media platforms. 

Towards the end of the project, we received support from the Climate Emergency Collaboration Group to continue our work, and centre our focus on tracking financial flows in power generation projects in the Mpumalanga province, South Africa’s energy heartland. In 2023, we will seek to answer questions such as, where the funding for a project is coming from, how much money has been invested and by whom, and how many new jobs will be created—all against the backdrop of an ongoing energy crisis and a Just Transition to renewable energy.","All of the data we collected was published on our [Oxpeckers’ Get the Data repository,](https://oxpeckers.org/get-the-data/) and used as part of our investigations. All of the information we collected is open-source, and available for anyone to access. 

The data we collected is the first of its kind in the region, and includes the capacities of various energy projects, countries where they are implemented, how much carbon emissions these projects are reducing, who is funding them, how much they cost, and many other details.

This information was aggregated, analysed and visualised using Google Sheets, Tableau Public, Terminal (iTerm2), Flourish, Adobe Photoshop and InDesign, as well as Canva. These were used to extract information about the finances behind renewable energy initiatives in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Our analysis and visualisations formed the backbone of each investigation. 

It will also be used as part of the second round of #PowerTracker, where we are creating a mapping tool that allows users to track and map renewable energy initiatives in Mpumalanga, South Africa, and eventually, across the region.","Our biggest challenge was obtaining official data. We overcame this by working with NGOs, law enforcement and government agencies to access the data we needed. This data, particularly when it came to the finances, highlighted a lack of transparency and how difficult it is to get this kind of information. When we collated the data and analysed it, we discovered instances of financing that lacked significant detail, potential ‘shady’ dealings by officials and the need to continue monitoring these projects closely. 

Another challenge was how quickly the context in which we were working changed and evolved. From the announcement of [South Africa's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan](https://www.thepresidency.gov.za/download/file/fid/2645) to the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27). Most recently, South Africa secured loan agreements from France and Germany, to aid its transition from coal to cleaner energy sources like solar and wind. This forms part of an initial $8.5 billion pledged by the US, UK, France, Germany and the EU. South Africa’s Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, unveiled shortly before COP7, sets out ambitious targets for spending this money over the next five years. This is just one example where a lot of money has been promised and the spending will need to be monitored closely.

Not only did we follow the news closely, we focused our [final public webinar](https:////youtu.be/uSlWLg9zghY) for the project on COP27's outcomes, and how this would impact our work going forward.","When we began #PowerTracker, in early 2022, we sought to upskill investigative environmental journalists to use data in their work, and in their role in the fight against the climate crisis. By honing in on the Southern African region and focusing our efforts on a select few grantees, we believe our efforts were successful. 

Not only have their investigations been widely shared—showcasing the importance of data-driven investigative environmental journalism within the context of a shift towards renewable energy—but we were also able to train other journalists, and expand these skills across the region and into local newsrooms. Additionally, we have created an in-depth resource pack (including training material, videos, investigations, data and the learning narrative) that can be used by others in their work. 

We have also shown how to turn data into a compelling and important environmental story. By training journalists how to work with data, we have published numerous investigations that use #PowerTracker data to tell their stories, lending our voice to issues around climate change, a Just Transition to renewable energy, financial flows and the impact these projects have on surrounding communities. We see these stories as demonstrating what newsworthy and good quality data journalism looks like.",English,https://oxpeckers.org/powertracker,https://oxpeckers.org/2022/09/lesothos-energy-pipedream,https://oxpeckers.org/2022/09/south-africa-mainstreams-wind-and-solar-power,https://oxpeckers.org/2022/09/zimbabwe-electric-vehicles,https://oxpeckers.org/2022/10/biogas-in-botswana,https://oxpeckers.org/2022/10/sugar-power,https://oxpeckers.org/2022/11/energy-transition-in-the-east,"Fiona Macleod, Nompumelelo Mtsweni, Roxanne Joseph, Erofilli Grapsa, Sechaba Mokhethi, Thabo Molelekwa, Debra Matabvu, Sharon Tshipa, Phathizwe Zulu and Yolandi Groenewald","Oxpeckers is Africa's first journalistic investigation unit focusing on environmental issues.

Ultra-patriotic social media personalities attack foreign governments and big companies - and sometimes call for even harsher actions than Beijing takes. 

We focused on the keyword “ruhua” - “insulting China” - to highlight a crucial shift in messaging on the popular Weibo digital platform. Where once state institutions led the way, now individuals - some of them officially-backed - play a much bigger role. That increases the risk that social media nationalism could spiral out of control.","The story has had a big impact since its publication just a few weeks ago. 

The project had more than 60,000 page views on the Nikkei Asia website with an average time on page of 4 minutes 33 seconds as of January 16, 18 days after publication. These figures are multiples larger than median benchmarks for feature articles. 

The Japanese translation of the story published by Nikkei had secured more than 220,000 page views, as of January 17. A version of it also appeared as the lead story in Nikkei’s flagship newspaper, which has 2.5 million readers. 

The story was highly praised by overseas Chinese watchers, including prominent scholars focusing on China studies. The story was widely shared in China too, where most people are prevented from accessing most overseas media sites. Some people said they were shocked how a Japanese media outlet could know China so well, with all these telling details on its social media. 

Bill Bishop, a noted China watcher based in the U.S., recommended this story highly to his many paid newsletter subscribers. He wrote: “Nikkei Asia has put together an excellent report on the rise of online nationalism since 2012, and especially the increasing use of the accusation of ruhua 辱华, or “insulting China”.”

Li Qi, a U.S. based journalist who has 82,000 Twitter followers, said the project was a “Top notch data visualization from @NikkeiAsia.”

Stewart McDonald, a member of the UK parliament, tweeted: “Fascinating research and data analysis on the CCP’s online army of fanatics from @NikkeiAsia … Throws up all sorts of concerning questions.”

Prof Kazuto Suzuki, a renowned international political scientist at the University of Tokyo, tweeted: ""Interesting article that captures the history of the closed Chinese speech space through analysis of social networking sites.”","We first of all chose “ruhua” as the key search term because this term has been frequently used by Chinese nationalists over the past few years. It has been deployed to attack foreign governments, western companies and Chinese businesses. Examining the occurrence of this particular phrase also showed how widespread, wide-ranging and aggressive online nationalism has become these days. 


We used open source tools (Weibo Search, Weibo Scraper, etc.) available on Github to gather information on social networking sites. For data analysis, we used Python, and for data visualization, we used free tools such as RawGraphs 2.0.

We used D3.js to produce the beeswarm chart and network diagram. The palette was designed to be as accessible as possible to readers with color vision deficiencies. We made good use of general HTML and CSS, and devised a stress-free way to tell the story through scrolly-telling.","It is very hard to examine public opinion in China because of the information controls imposed by the government. We used open-source tools (Weibo Search, Weibo Scraper, and so on) available on Github to gather information on social media and explore trends in public opinion. The idea of focusing on the keyword “ruhua”, or “insulting China”, which is often used by nationalists, was important in this analysis.

At the start of our research, we were able to obtain data on posts containing the term ruhua on Weibo. Around November 2022, just after the Chinese Communist Party Congress, it suddenly became impossible to retrieve this data. We therefore based our analysis on the data we had obtained and - fortunately - stored before Octorber 2022. It is not clear why the data became impossible to retrieve.

It is difficult for journalists in Mainland China to do this kind of research. Journalists based in Tokyo, New York and Hong Kong worked closely together to complete this article.

After publication, some online nationalists targeted the reporters on the project, who are all either Chinese nationals or of Chinese heritage. The nationalists did not allege any factual inaccuracies but instead accused the reporters of offering “intelligence” to the Japanese and being “traitors” to their motherland. Nikkei and Nikkei Asia are closely monitoring developments and making efforts to prevent further harassment. 

This is unfortunately a sign of the pressures journalists of Chinese heritage face when they do this kind of reporting. It also reinforces a main point of the piece: that the behaviour of some online nationalist elements in China is aggressive and disturbing.","This project is a great example of how to use data to measure an important but hard to quantify phenomenon: in this case, nationalism. 

By focusing on a specific high-profile term – “ruhua”, or “insulting China” – we found a good proxy for broader rising ultra-patriotism.

This allowed us to draw a striking concrete conclusion: that nationalism is increasingly being spread online by individuals rather than Chinese state institutions. In addition, by analysing the networks of reposting, we exposed otherwise invisible relationships between the Chinese government, media and individual nationalists.

It also shows the power of a multidisciplinary approach to publication and teamwork. We tapped into data expertise in Tokyo and Hong Kong, Chinese-language reporting skills in Hong Kong and New York, and English-language editing skills in Tokyo. We also complemented the graphics with a striking “hero image” illustration.

The result is a highly distinctive account of a growing trend in online nationalism that is hugely important to China’s internal politics and relations with other countries. It also affects some big companies, both foreign and Chinese.","English, Japanese",https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/china-social-media/,https://vdata.nikkei.com/newsgraphics/china-social-media/,https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGKKZO67266780Z21C22A2MM8000/,https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Inside-China-s-online-nationalist-army,,,,"Data Analysis; Kenji Asada and Aiko Munakata

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,,Who owns England's privatised water system?,2022-11-30,"Investigation, Explainer, Open data, Infographics, Map, Environment, Business","Animation, D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","England is one of few countries in the world to have fully privatised its water system. It's not just run by private companies, but they own all the assets too, from pipes to reservoirs.

As recent sewage leaks and water shortages have made painfully clear - these companies have been opting to pay their shareholders rather than investing in the system.

This investigation tracked the ownership of England's big nine water companies to find out who is really benefiting from England's water system and how much money they've taken out.

Published as two interactives, each paired with a news story.","When Margaret Thatcher privatised England’s water system in 1989, the campaign to advertise the stock said that every member of the British public could become an “H2Owner” - a shareholder in water. 

Thirty years later, water companies are still using a version of that argument and defend their large payouts to shareholders as helping UK pensioners - citing the fact some UK pension funds own water shares. 

But it’s not the average British person, or even British pension fund, who really owns the water companies. Our story: “Revealed: more than 70% of English water industry is in foreign ownership”, has put paid to that argument. 

Our story made the front page splash of the Guardian newspaper and was followed up by other UK papers. 

The four key stories of this project got 450K views between them, and adding in the opinion and analysis also commissioned, over half a million views. 

Both our interactives had very high attention time, reaching the highest rating on the Guardian’s internal system.

A priority for us was making it simple for people with less financial literacy to understand this complex system and particularly the financial engineering involved. People who have been researching this topic for years congratulated us on coming up with a unique presentation that made it understandable. 

Internal impact: highly praised by senior management, it was an unusual example of collaboration between desks and people with different skills, setting a new template for collaboration at the Guardian. 

The pieces were widely shared by many pressure groups, from environmental writer Rob MacFarlane to Surfers Against Sewage, as well as leading academics. 

This work highlighted structural problems with the sector - an important supplement to more traditional news stories highlighting particular sewage leaks. And led to calls for renationalisation of water or at least greater regulation.","We went through dozens of financial reports to extract the key information we needed such as shareholders, dividends and corporate structure, carefully logging this information into our database.

There were no patterns across all these documents, so the data collection was a manual process for which we used a tool previously created by The Guardian which applied optical character recognition to PDFs, as some documents were not editable as text.

The database was built in Google Sheets and it had two purposes: to keep track of the findings, the research and the sources in an organised way, and to build the final database for the story. 

After speaking to academics, we came up with a method to estimate the value of the sector per shareholder and country, which allowed us to later perform calculations to find the biggest owners of English water. 

This data process was combined with traditional reporting - asking for interviews with these foreign owners, and getting reactions from politicians.

To tell this story, we used the Guardian’s standard map library and some simple scroll-driven zoom and pan effects for the map interactive. This allowed us to start the story locally, then to zoom out to the global picture illustrating just how far away the owners are from their customers.

A simple D3.js chart keeps track of the total ownership.

For the interactive illustrating the “financial engineering” that has seen lots of money leave these companies as dividends, we used Greensock.js - a javascript animation library with an SVG graphic produced by our designer. 

The animation moves and builds as you scroll, with the step by step format creating a clear narrative.

We wanted the animation to be pleasurable and visually interesting, making it easier to engage readers with this complex story.","From its conception, this was planned as a visual project that would explain in simple terms a very complex system which is not intuitively visual. There are not many previous examples of taking this approach to this type of financial story and therefore a lot of original thinking was required. 

This gave an extra challenge to the project, combined with the fact that the designer working on this could only help occasionally and had to prioritise other work. With more time from a designer we could have done a more ambitious interactive on our ownership story and played more with different elements on the page. 

The data collection was a super time-consuming process as we had to learn to read financial accounts reports and check them one by one - complex documents for non-business journalists. Furthermore, these documents are published as PDFs - a format that makes the data process even slower.

From a legal perspective: since we were directly discussing nine companies and mentioning many of the world’s richest companies - from Blackrock, to Hong Kong based CK Hutchinson Holdings - we had a significant amount of high-stakes legal work to do. With over a dozen right of replies and requests for comment sent out and compiled centrally by the team. Overseen by our experienced editor and senior correspondent. 

Water companies have been aggressive in protecting their reputations too. We received obfuscatory responses from several, for example, some intentionally using their complicated corporate structures to make claims like “we never paid dividends to our external shareholders”, an argument that obscured the key fact that money - ultimately from customer bills - had left the company as dividends. (In cases where there are layers in a corporate structure, it is normal for dividends to be paid to the parent of the company, and from they can go to external shareholders or further into the corporate structure.)

This was one reason we were keen to include a simple graph showing the number of holding companies in the corporate structure of each water company - corporate complexity became a big part of the story.","Some of the greatest injustices are hidden in plain sight - they’re just boring and difficult to understand. Though most of the hard work of this story was analysing the public financial statements of these companies, the other vital bit to crack was making this complex financial story hit a nerve with readers. 

It is hard to tackle complex system topics like globalised finance - but extremely important. Whether these systems are technical or financial - complexity can be more effective than secrecy in concealing failures and injustice. 

Traditional news reporting is rightly focussed on people, but sometimes that means we miss reporting on the systems that increasingly shape our lives. Journalists should tackle stories that make these faceless systems more tangible and work to connect them with their impacts on everyday life. 

Visual and interactive journalism can pioneer creative ways to show these complex systems. By making use of the story-telling power of graphics and code, as well as words and numbers, we can make these difficult topics easier to understand. 

For example our attempt to visualise the financial technique of “leveraging” with the pipes graphic - was very conceptually challenging. It could be improved, but one success was: people who we explained leveraging to verbally didn’t understand it, but people who we showed the graphic to, did understand. 

Collaboration means more resources, time and effort is needed to find people with complementary skills and to organise them between teams. However, the result of that work when done properly has a bigger impact on the media and audience. Readers benefitted from an impactful, richer and high quality journalistic product, while this type of project has strong performance metrics and it helps to build up the brand.",English,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/nov/30/englands-water-the-worlds-piggy-bank,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/30/more-than-70-per-cent-english-water-industry-foreign-ownership,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2022/dec/01/down-the-drain-how-billions-of-pounds-are-sucked-out-of-englands-water-system,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/01/water-companies-debts-since-privatisation-ofwat-refuses-impose-limits,,,,"Anna Leach, Carmen Aguilar, Sandra Laville, Ellen Wishart, Bibi van der Zee, Pablo Gutierrez","Anna Leach - Visual projects editor

Ireland,"Noteworthy, The Journal",Small,Participant,,Revolving Door,2022-11-10,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Politics","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Noteworthy investigated thousands of entries on Ireland's Lobbying Register over the seven-year period in which the register has been in effect. The investigation discovered that former assistants to Government ministers, who have since become lobbyists, failed to declare that they worked for the Irish Government (as required under Irish law) on hundreds of occasions. The series also mapped the relationship between lobbyists and current Ministers and, for the first time, the extent of lobbying by individuals who used hold senior public sector roles in Ireland.","More than 250 returns filed on the Lobbying Register were changed to accurately reflect that almost 30 different lobbyists - including some working on behalf of Google, Huawei, Diageo, GSK and Merck - were individuals were former officials in the Irish Government and had connections to current Government ministers.

We also named a number of so-called 'former Designated Public Officials' (DPOs) - those who worked at a high level in Government as ministerial assistants or in other civil service roles - who were or are now working as lobbyists after leaving public roles, for the first time. 

We similarly named for the first time several individuals who received exemptions to the mandatory one-year 'cooling off' period for lobbyists, whereby those who work in a public role where they are designated as a DPO must wait one year before becoming a lobbyist unless they can receive an exemption. The identities of these individuals are kept secret by the Standards In Public Office commission (SIPO), which oversees the regulation of lobbying in Ireland, refuses to disclose who they are. We also found one individual who breached this mandatory one-year 'cooling off' period.","For this investigation, we mainly relied on Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel.

We downloaded .xls files from the Lobbying Register from a seven-year period and created a column of individuals who were listed in the spreadsheets as former Designated Public Officials.

To find which former special advisers are or were involved in lobbying, we collated a list of every adviser employed by government departments since 2015, the year legislation on lobbying was introduced.

We checked responses to 11 years’ worth of Parliamentary Questions and read Statutory Instruments that gave effect to the employment of every adviser since the formation of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition in 2011.

Every special adviser we sourced was then inputted into the Lobbying Register to see if the individual had lobbied and if they had done so within a year of leaving public office. 

We also sought out those who named themselves as former advisers on lobbying returns since 2015, and likewise checked if those individuals lobbied within a year of leaving office.

This allowed us to uncover the names of individual lobbyists who had not disclosed that they were former DPOs until that point, as well as to confirm that returns were inaccurate by not listing them as such.

When downloading the spreadsheets, we also found dozens of returns that did not feature on the front end of the Lobbying Register's search feature. Through this, we discovered that several people who were listed as former DPOs in some returns were not listed as such in several others.

We also checked how long after leaving public office certain former DPOs began lobbying, and asked them - if they began lobbying less than a year later - whether they had received an exemption to the one-year 'cooling off' period, asking for proof where they claimed that they did.","Concerns about a ‘revolving door’ between the public and private sector came to the fore two years ago, when former Irish minister of state in the Department of Finance, Fine Gael’s Michael D’Arcy, left his role as a senator to become chief executive of the Irish Association of Investment Managers (IAIM).

His appointment caused controversy when it emerged that neither he nor his new employer had contacted Sipo to seek permission to waive the cooling-off period.

Between 2016 and 2021, the most recent year for which data is available, 24 individuals – not all of them special advisers – applied to Sipo for an exemption to this mandatory one-year cooling-off period.

However, Sipo refuses to name those who successfully sought this exemption, citing reasons of confidentiality - including through Freedom of Information requests.

And although the regulator says how many people apply for the exemption each year in its annual reports, it no longer says the number of those who have applied successfully, as it did until 2020.

This means that transparency around the 'revolving door' nature of lobbying can be lacking. along with the connection of certain lobbyists to their former ministers or colleagues in the public service.","The Lobbying Register is seen as a very transparent and functioning tool that enables both journalists and the public to see exactly how lobbying functions in Ireland.

However, the flaws we have uncovered with individual entries and the functioning of the register itself shows that this is not always the case and that the data contained on the register isn't always accurate.",English,https://www.thejournal.ie/revolving-door-lobbying-register-5896553-Nov2022/,https://www.thejournal.ie/revolving-door-lobbyists-5898070-Nov2022/,,,,,,"Stephen McDermott, Cormac Fitzgerald","Stephen McDermott is a journalist and editor with The Journal, based in Dublin, Ireland.

Indonesia,[Project Multatuli](https://projectmultatuli.org/),Small,Participant,,Exposing Indonesia’s Coal Oligarchs,2022-02-04,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Quiz/game, Illustration, Infographics","Scraping, D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","I, along with several Project Multatuli team members, created an interactive data story to help the public peel back the many layers of the coal oligarchy—the small group of men who control the dirty energy source—in Indonesia.

The story was presented in the form of a game, in which players must answer questions about the businesses and networks of the nation’s 10 biggest coal oligarchs. At the end of the game, we provided a link to an in-depth 11,000-word story on the 10 oligarchs, who had been able to perpetuate their dirty energy enterprises for decades.","Not long after the game and in-depth report on Indonesia's 10 biggest coal oligarchs were published by Project Multatuli in early February 2022, they went viral on social media, particularly on Twitter. As a result, both products were able to reach a wide range of people from different backgrounds.

As of March 22, 2022, the Twitter threads on the game and story had gained more than 444,000 impressions, leading to over 15,100 people visiting the game pages (both the Indonesian and English versions) and 72,200 people reading the in-depth 11,000-word stories (both the Indonesian and English versions) on Project Multatuli's website.

Many people shared the screenshots of them while playing the game. People also shared the links to and praised the game and article, including noted Indonesian economist Faisal Basri, Murdoch University's senior lecturer Ian Wilson, and Straits Times correspondent Jeffrey Hutton. Louise White, a graduate student at Stanford University Graduate School of Business in the US, even interviewed me in November 2022 to better understand the process of creating the game and story as well as Indonesia's dirty fuel industry as part of her research. 

About three weeks after the game and article were published, Koalisi Bersihkan Indonesia (Clean Indonesia Coalition) created a new social media campaign on Indonesia's coal oligarchs using similar data from Project Multatuli's game and story. The coalition consists of various NGOs, including the environmental ones such as Walhi, Jatam, and Greenpeace Indonesia.

Project Multatuli's game and story have subsequently triggered discussions, further research, and more environmental campaigns against Indonesia's coal oligarchy and dirty fuel industry. Amid mounting pressure, Indonesia's state-owned lender Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) then announced in May 2022 that it would stop providing new funding for coal and oil and gas projects.","I spent two months, from December 2021 to January 2022, manually collecting and organizing publicly available data and information from Indonesia's Energy and Mining Ministry's website, annual reports of the nation's biggest coal mining companies, research and studies by different organizations, past articles published by dozens of Indonesian and international news outlets, and video documentaries to map out the biggest coal-mining companies and their respective owners, as well as the owners' other businesses, overall capital strengths, as well as political networks and influence.

After consulting with Project Multatuli's managing editor Mawa Kresna and data journalist Louis Lugas, I decided to create a news game, through which I could present the story in a fun and interesting way. Lugas then helped develop the game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js, Kresna prepared the game questions based on my research findings and infographics to be used in the in-depth story, and graphic designer Nauval Firdaus worked on the illustrations of the coal oligarchs. In the end, we were able to publish the Indonesian and English versions of the game and story in early February 2022.","Indonesia's energy and mining sector is full of broken promises and lip services. The country has set many ambitious goals in the past nine years during President Joko Widodo era to boost the use of renewable energy, yet there has been no significant progress on the ground.

Indonesia ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016. In July 2021, the country also submitted its updated climate commitments to the UN and set a deadline to eliminate completely its greenhouse gas emissions by 2060 or before. However, looking at Indonesia's track record and even the long-term plan to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, it's clear that Indonesia still puts a premium on coal and lacks the political will to boost the use of renewable energy. At the end of the day, Indonesia always goes back to coal.

There are several challenges in reporting on energy and mining in Indonesia. This subject is dry, full of technical terms, and relatively hard to comprehend, especially for common people. That's why, discussions on this matter often just occur among limited groups of people, including researchers, activists, and certain government and political figures, not among the grassroots.

In Indonesia, covering energy also means covering the mafias and conglomerates who try to ensure that the dirty fuel businesses can keep going. So, often times, journalists in remote regions must face threats after publishing stories related to these conglomerates. Even on social media, after I published the coal-oligarchs game, buzzers flocked into my and Project Multatuli's accounts and tried to question the credibility of my report. It must be noted that this country has a draconian law, namely the Electronic Information and Transactions Law, which has often been used to prosecute journalists for defamation.

Moreover, data and information on Indonesia's energy and mining sector are relatively hard to collect, including because of the coal miners' complicated business structure or lack of transparency. It's also hard to rely on the Indonesian government websites due to their disorderly nature. Many government sites, which are not user-friendly or not designed with non-experts in mind, offer few interactive features, preventing users from filtering and extracting data with ease.","This project shows that journalists can allure many people to delve into this complex energy and mining issue by using data journalism techniques and being creative in the presentation of the stories. Hence, it's important for news organizations to invest in data journalism, whether in terms of the required tools or human resources. By doing so, the press would be able to use data to tell impactful stories on various different platforms, help the people gain a better understanding of the complicated realities they are living in, and hold those in power accountable.","English, Indonesian",https://projectmultatuli.org/en/exposing-indonesias-coal-oligarchs/,https://projectmultatuli.org/en/unearthing-indonesias-10-biggest-coal-oligarchs/,https://projectmultatuli.org/menguliti-oligarki-batubara-indonesia/,https://projectmultatuli.org/profil-peta-koneksi-bisnis-dan-politik-10-oligark-batubara-terbesar-di-indonesia-di-bawah-pemerintahan-jokowi/,https://restofworld.org/2022/2022s-best-stories-global-tech/,,,"Writer and reporter: Viriya Singgih

Netherlands,Pointer (KRO-NCRV),Big,Participant,,Fake profiles on dating and sex websites,2022-01-17,"Investigation, OSINT","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, R Markdown, Jupyter Notebook, Lobe.AI","Since 2020 we're scraping Dutch sex advertisement websites to find scammers. We're analyzing this data phone numbers that occur at different advertisements, people who are traveling a lot, or copypaste advertisement text. We've built an automatic analysis process that finds interesting leads in these advertisements, so we can research these individual leads separately.

This resulted in a series of articles, tv episodes and interactives about online scammers in sex advertisements and on fake dating websites. During this investigation, we used data journalism, OSINT, AI and went undercover to find out who are behind these scams.","This project tells the stories of persons who are not represented as victims in our society. When you are scammed while paying for online sex or trying to find love, the first and foremost reaction people will get is: 'Well, it's you own fault.' The criminals behind these scams don't have to be afraid to get caught, because embaressment and low attention by the police are contributing to a small amount of police reports. While the victims can be charged with tens of thousand of euros in damages. And that's not even considering the loss of trust for these victims.

By uncovering these scams, we made people aware of fraudulous dating websites and safe dating practices. For sex workers, the scammers pose a danger to thei safety and wellfare: clients can be chastised for the fraud of a scammer.","We started our investigation by scraping 5 different websites with sex advertisements. These scrapers are made in Python and run on a cron job: we visit these websites every week to collect new advertisements.

After that, a cron job for an analysis in R runs to find the most suspicious advertisements. We're looking at several clues, like phone numbers that occur at multiple advertisements, people who seem to travel a lot, and advertisement text that's almost similar to other advertisements. After this analysis, we receive a list of the most promising leads.

A lot of times, analyzing the photographs is enough to find suspicious advertisements. With reversed image search, we can determine that most of these advertisements are fake. We also collect the fake advertisements in a Google Spreadsheet, which feeds into the next analysis loop. This way, we can find a lot more scammes in the next round.

After a while, we got a tip about fake dating websites. This person claimed to have worked at a dating website, where she was paid to to play the role of several dating profiles. Her only job was to keep genuine customers talking (because they'e paying per sent message). We decided to go undercover as a so-called chat agent. We could confirm that thousands of fake dating websites are active in the Netherlands. We also got the manuals for new employees for some websites. We made an interactive about the tactics these chat agents deploy to keep you talking.

After that, we got another tip about fake profiles on Tinder. People who are trying to find someone over there, are being lured to these fake dating websites. We hired the world record holder for Tinder matches to build a Tinder scraper. We trained an AI to find hundreds of fake profiles.","In 2018, our colleagues uncovered that a lot of fake dating websites are online in the Netherlands. You can't find real profiles on these websites: instead, you're connected to a so-called chat agent, a person who's being paid to keep you talking indefinitely. These websites don't communicate that they're fake.

But a lot of readers still think that the blame is on the customer. They should've taken more care when signing up for an account, is the general consensus. We wanted to get a peek behind the scenes in how these chat agents are trained for the job. We succesfully got a job as a chat agent to confirm our suspicions. From that experience, we made a tv episode and an interactive story on how people are being scammed. These website use a variety of smart tricks to keep customers engaged and chatting.

Our Tinder research was one of our first experiments with Lobe.AI: software that allows you to train an AI te categorize images. We trained our AI to recognize fake profiles on Tinder, so that we didn't have to manually look through hunderd of thousands of images.

For our investigation into sex advertisements, we build our own scraping and analysis process. If we had to look through thousands of advertisements, we probably wouldn't have found anything. But because we automated most of the work, we had a lot more time for verification and additional research.

For our investigation into webcam scamming, we had to use a bit of OSINT to verify the location of a hotel in Warsaw (Poland). We had a lot of images from this fraudulous web cam company, and we could verify the exact hotel room thanks to the wood nerves in a wooden beam.","This investigation shows that a lot of data journalism skills, OSINT and AI can be used to investigate a very difficult topic. When it's hard to find victims or suspects, these techniques can provide a lot of information to write. One of my main pet peeves is that stories make stories: when you write long enough about a topic, you will get more and better tips. So at a certain moment, these hard to find victims came to us by themselves. They wouldn't have done that if we hadn't published our first few stories, mostly made with data.

During this project, we also had the feeling that we could experiment a bit. Our Tinder research could've failed at any moment, because it was a learning process all along. But that was okay. Nobody knew that we were working on it, so we were the only ones knowing that we potentialy would've failed. It's cool that there are still opportunities for journalists to tinker away with new technologies and techniques. And it's extra rewarding if those risks pay out with some unique, exciting and important stories about scams and frauds that aren't talked about that much.","Dutch, English",https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/misleid-door-verleiding-hoe-chatoperators-je-aan-de-praat-houden-op-nepdatingsites,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/oplichters-actief-in-online-seksadvertenties-zelden-aangifte-door-schaamte,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/zo-misleidt-dubieus-webcambedrijf-zijn-klanten-emily-uit-elst-blijkt-niet-te-bestaan,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/hoe-we-een-computer-hebben-leren-tinderen-om-nepprofielen-te-herkennen,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/naaktfotos-en-medische-gegevens-van-klanten-nepdatingsites-door-medewerkers-in-te-zien,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/zo-hebben-we-ontdekt-hoe-datingsites-met-nepprofielen-te-werk-gaan,https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e42niArM-Kb0hoKXue5V39sw4M8zFJZr?usp=sharing,"Jerry Vermanen, Marije Rooze, Charlotte Claessen, Mark Jan van Tellingen, Thomas de Beus, Steven Schoppert, Roul Meijer, Niels van Nimwegen, Sietze van Loosdregt","Jerry Vermanen works at Pointer as an investigative data journalist, and has won the journalistic prizes De Tegel and Sigma Awards multiple times for his publications.

South Africa,Private,Small,Participant,,How fateful?,2022-08-31,"Map, Culture","Json, R, RStudio","When I met my boyfriend I sometimes felt a tinge of regret that we never got to make an adorable meet-cute story, despite living in the same city for five years and attending the same university. We met online at the height of the COVID pandemic, and our first interactions were all digital. 

Thanks to Google’s location history quietly ticking away collecting GPS data in the background I thought that I could potentially find an answer to how fatefully our paths criss-crossed before we met. Just how closely did we come to potentially having an eyes-meet-across-the-room moment IRL?","The project received much more attention than I ever expected. First it made it to the [top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33077473), then it was picked up by influential [Software Developer on Twiter Dare Obasanjo](https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1577590247143378944?s=46&t=TUAWPBQ-rQtU5cBTiAVA0Q). More recently it was noticed by [Genís Roca, Barcelonian tech writer](https://twitter.com/genisroca/status/1607345162589552641), which led to a feature on [Catalonian TV news station TV3](https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/telenoticies/una-parella-descobreix-que-van-coincidir-33-cops-abans-de-comencar-la-relacio-a-traves-duna-app/video/6196113/).

Aside from journalists, this project has received nearly 7,500 likes and upvotes in the places I know that it's been posted. More impactfully, however, are the at least 600 people around the world who have weighed in commenting with their feelings about data privacy. Many commenters said that they checked their privacy settings as a result, or wanted to do the analysis for themselves. Whether people were capivated or creeped out by the use of personal data collected by big coorporations like Google, the project, I hope, has given consumers a sense of agency over their own data and data collection that they are subjected to. While the data protection laws and regulations are just being developed, public awarness and discussion on this issue is critical.","I used the R programming language to extract and transform data that is downloadable on request from Google Map's Timeline. This data is recorded with a user's permission from sources like background GPS tracking. Using data files downloaded by both me and my partner, I used R to extract all the location records into a database of records over the span of more than 5 years. My boyfriend requested, downloaded, and shared with me all his data himself. 

I cleaned the data next so that records with low accuracy confidence were removed. I also condensed the volume of data by removing unnecessary detail from the dataset by grouping together records into 10 minute intervals. Similairly, GPS coordinates were also grouped together into a grid of coordinates 111m apart from each other. 

Once the two datasets were compiled and cleaned up, I did the analysis. I wanted to know how close together we got at any time so I matched up all of the timestamps to make pairs of records. Then I calculated the distance between the pairs of coordinates. This yielded the result that on 33 recorded occasions we had been on the same grid-point before we met within the same 10-minute interval.","* In the last ten years the number of countries that have data privacy laws has doubled. Now 71% of the countries in the world have adopted data privacy regulations to protect consumers, and another 7% have draft regulations waiting to come into effect. This speaks to the fact that in an international context countries and their governments are talking about who has what rights to personal data. [(Source: UN Conference on Trade and Development)](https://unctad.org/page/data-protection-and-privacy-legislation-worldwide) 

* Due to the budding data protection regulatory scene, it means it's never been more important for consumers themeselves to have a say in the development and enforcement of these new regulations. My project brings data privacy to the front of public consiousness, but I hope it also shows the benefits of personal data collection with informed consent, and how it can be used to come to deeper insights that would be otherwise unanswerable. 
 
* I completed the project as a portfolio project while job searching, so my piece is written as a code-focused demonstration of my data visualisation skills. I didn't ever expect it to grab the imaginations of so many people- technical and non-technical!

* Without any platform or promotion the research has momentum. Aside from me doing the project and posting it for little or no followers on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6970680653004615681/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@channonperry/i-used-my-google-maps-location-history-to-see-if-my-boyfriend-and-i-could-have-met-before-we-did-c6842c4a8b64), data experts and regular romantics alike have really been drawn to talking about and sharing my story. 

* This is a small personal project as opposed to a funded journalism excercise carried out by a team. Aside from the limitations that that presents I want to highlight it because even an honourable mention [(like the one I got from The Pudding)](https://pudding.cool/process/pudding-cup-2022/) would have a huge impact on a young and inexperienced data story teller like myself.","I think that my project caught public imagination not because of my small story, but because it tapped into the curiosity that readers have about their own lives. Applying technology to the big philosophical nature of the research question, ""Could my romantic partner and I have met sooner"", is solidifying the otherwise nebulous unknowns of the past into hard data.

Switzerland,CORRECTIV,Big,Participant,,Charcoal: Somalia's burning issue,2022-12-13,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Environment, Corruption, Crime, Economy, Terrorism","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, CrowdNewsroom developed by CORRECTIV","With the help of our own open source, internet based investigation platform, the CrowdNewsroom, CORRECTIV investigated the charcoal trade that has been known to finance islamist terrorists in Somalia. Collaborators of the terrorists as well as inhabitants of terrorist controlled areas confidentially shared vital data with us that we cross checked with satellite imagery. Local journalists on the ground were also involved. Our final data sets confirmed not only that islamists are still profiting from the charcoal business, but that parts of the government are profiteers as well. A possible reason why the trade has grown over the past years.","Somalia is a country where journalists rarely dare to tread. Large parts of the country are controlled by Al-Shabaab, an islamist militia that is part of Al-Qaida. Stories from Somalia thus are often based on anecdotical evidence and a few interviews if any. The use of the CrowdNewsroom enabled us to draw from a large sample of people who are part of the charcoal value chain, even if they live in places that are off-limits to journalists. Somali journalists reported back from colleagues that the interest to use that tool for future investigations is high (and easily possible since the tool is open source and in Somali language). The original story was published in German. We decided to translate it into English so that it can be read by Somalis in exile as well as by people in the region.","The main tool to gather our data is the CrowdNewsroom, an open source, internet based interview tool that enables participants to answer questions (in writing) from their cell phones, upload files (o.e. photos), send GPS data and additional information they want to share. The participation is anonymous (though people can leave contact details if they wish), and the data is stored safely and securely on servers run by CORRECTIV. Somali journalists helped us to spread the word about our investigation. Based on the data from the CrowdNewsroom, we were able to reconstruct the value chain from logging to shipping and identified the places throughout Somalia where the trade is happening. Those places, provided by collaborators of the charcoal trade themselves, were verified with the help of satellite imagery available through Google Earth Pro and the Sentinel Hub. The result provides a comprehensive overview of a trade that could not be investigated in such a systematic way before.","The CrowdNewsroom has been programmed to collect data from a large number of people with the aim of exposing systemic problems behind social grievances. In the past years, we have used the tool to i.e. identify ownership of real estate in large cities in order to find out about the engagement of offshore companies or rogue investors. The CrowdNewsroom was enhanced to widen the scope of these investigations. In a war-torn country like Somalia, reliable data is virtually non-existent. The CrowdNewsroom enables journalists to collect data on their own, together with proof that is uploaded to a secure server. Moreover, it's normal people on the ground who can share their info regardless of their affiliation or status, simply through a smart phone which almost everybody has access to. In contrast, most stories about Somalia or similar countries are usually based on interviews with interested parties, i.e. politicians, aid organizations or United Nations representatives.","The investigation of the Somali charcoal trade has been designed as a pilot project that will hopefully encourage journalists in other countries to set up similar investigations. The CrowdNewsroom not only is open source, it can also be adapted to almost any language. Since it's browser based, there are no technical prerequisites. Our hope is that it will make it easier to conduct investigations in conflict areas or even battle fields, always in collaboration with journalists on the ground (even if not on the frontline) who know their country well.","English, German",https://correctiv.org/en/latest-stories/2023/01/16/charcoal-somalias-burning-issue/,https://correctiv.org/aktuelles/2022/12/12/hauptsache-kohle/,https://crowdnewsroom.org/en/,,,,,"Marc Engelhardt, Abdalle Ahmed Mumin, Bettina Rühl, Assia Shidane, Niklas Jordan","Marc Engelhardt is director of the CORRECTIV CrowdNewsroom and a former Africa correspondent, now based in Geneva.

Se predijeron, primeramente, todos los resultados del Mundial de Atletismo de Oregon y, posteriormente, los resultados del Mundial de Fútbol de Qatar. Para ello se utilizó una estrategia basada en datos de resultados previos y técnicas diferentes de inteligencia artificial (Aprendizaje de Máquina y Simulación). Se pronósticó correctamente el Campeón y Subcampeón del mundo en Qatar y el 69% de los finalistas, 60% de los medallista y 49% de los campeones de Oregon. Fueron de los mejores pronóscitos publicados en el ecosistema mediático.","El proyecto ha tenido un gran impacto, sobre todo, durante el transcurso de los eventos deportivos que fueron objeto de los pronósticos. Los trabajos publicados, que no solo incluían los pronósticos, sino un análisis periodístico de los mismo así como el posterior análisis de los resultados, se convirtieron en publicaciones de referencia a las personas que seguían estos eventos deportivos quienes consultaban las publicaciones para estar al tanto de las posibilidades de equipos y competidores. El resultado también llamó la atención de autoridades deportivas quienes establecieron contactos con el equipo para trabajos futuros. La divulgación de los trabajos y la interacción se realizó utilizando Twitter publicando parte de los pronósticos así como los autores interactuando desde sus propias cuentas. Otro valor de impacto del proyecto es la continuidad de la colaboración con la Academia pues los trabajos fueron hechos en colaboración con el Grupo de Inteligencia Artificial de la Universidad de La Habana, esto permitió acercar a estudiantes de Ciencia de la Computación al Periodiismo de Datos para que, en el futuro, se puedan integrar, conociendo el quehacer del periodismo de datos, en espacios de análisis sociales. Fue interesante el caso de las predicciones de Fútbol, el pronóstico estaba funcionando como uno más pero una vez concluida la fase de grupos compartimos en Twitter, desde la cuenta de uno de los autores, una comparativa de nuestro pronóstico con los realizados por EASport, El País, FiveThirthyEight, Oxford, 90 Minutos y Turing Institute y eramos en ese momento el pronóstico que más equipos acertó que pasaron a 8vos y, sobre todo, el que acertó en equipos como Senegal, USA, Australia, Marruecos y Corea del Sur, fuimos aumentando de seguidores lo que aumento hasta el último momento cuando fuimos los únicos, de los pronósticos comentados, que predijimos correctamente al campeón y subcampeón.","Las publicaciones del proyecto visibilizan los pronósticos finales así como los análisis de los pronósticos y de los resultados finales de los eventos, sin embargo, para llegar a este punto hubo mucho trabajo que requirió de el uso de múltiples técnicas. Los pronósticos requerían de datos que fueron extraídos de varias fuentes Web, para ello se utilizó Python con las bibliotecas Requests y Selenium. Asimismo, una vez que se tuvieron estos datos fue necesario manipularlos, visualizarlos y construir los modelos de IA, en todos los casos se usó las biblioteca SKLearn, Numpy, Pandas y Matploblib. En el caso particular de los modelos, para el Atletismo se utilizó Kernel Distribution Estimation (KDE) para estimar la función de densidad de probabilidad de las marcas o tiempos mientras que para el fútbol se implementó un modelo de microsimulaciones basados en agentes, donde se simulaban los partidos en base al comportamiento de los futbolistas (uno a uno) en cancha simulando todos los partidos del mundial varias veces. Además, en el caso del fútbol para optimizar las alineaciones se utilizó la metaheurística Colonia de Hormigas. Para la visualización de los trabajos se utilizó html y javascript, los datos se codificaron en JSON, y se utilizaron bibliotecas y herramientas como Bootstrap, Jquery, JqueryTablesorter y jquery.bracket.","Postdata.club se desarrolla en Cuba en un entorno que no es favorable a la existencia de medios independientes, aún así el espacio ha logrado una coexistencia sin problemas y, además, lograr colaboraciones con medios estatatales y grupos universitarios. Este trabajo es resultado de la colaboración con un grupo de investigación de la Universidad de La Habana, varios de los autores del proyecto pertenecen a este grupo y, además, fueron estudiantes del curso de Periodismo de Datos que imparten parte de los miembros del colectivo de Postdata.club en la Universidad de La Habana como parte de su labor formadora. Este es el único curso de periodismo de datos que se imparte en la Universidad y tradicionalmente se imparte a estudiantes de periodismo y en esta ocasión también se impartió a estudiantes de Ciencia de la Computación de donde salieron los colaboradores de este proyecto.

Otro elemento a destacar es la situación de conectividad (acceso a internet) existente, que si bien es muchísimo mejor que la de otros años, no es la mejor para la realización de este tipo de proyectos y demanda un esfuerzo importante que involucra incluso la utilización de servicios de VPN para poder acceder a servicios que están bloqueados por su acceso.

Relativo a los datos, aquí también que hubo que pensar soluciones interesantes pues los datos, si bien estaban disponibles en la Web su descarga no era simple. Hubo que realizar varios scripts computacionales para la descarga de los datos que, además, en algunos caso comprendían varios años.

Asimismo, es relevante el uso de las técnicas de inteligencia artificial y de ciencia de datos para poder crear modelos predictivos que fueron la base de los trabajos. Postdata.club es el medio que ha introducido el uso de esas técnicas en el periodismo cubano y siempre lo ha hecho con alianzas con la universidad que es también el otro espacio profesional donde se desenvuelven algunos de los miembros del equipo.","En este caso creemos que es interesante:
-La aplicación de técnicas de Inteligencia Artificial y la Ciencia de Datos para poder generar modelos que permitan realizar publicaciones y trabajos periodísticos.
-La alianza con grupos de invetigación que permitan colaboraciones para la realización de trabajos conjuntos
-La enseñanza universitaria de los saberes que desarrollan los medios permite la vinculación de los propios estudiantes en trabajos del medio

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Participant,,Creating spaces for dialogue: Exploring queer cinema in Southeast Asia,2022-09-29,"Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Arts, Culture, Human rights","Google Sheets, Flourish, Mapbox","Southeast Asian queer creators are familiar with having their stories hidden or overwritten, but with films as their medium of choice, they are gradually reclaiming their places in society’s narrative. 

This story celebrates Southeast Asia’s queer cinema history. There are three main parts: exploring depictions of queerness in Southeast Asia’s traditions and local contexts (referred to as “vernacular queerness” in this story), analysing the changing perceptions around the queer community, and uplifting the community’s efforts in creating safe spaces for one another to freely express themselves.","This story as well as the database was featured by several noteworthy LGBTQ+ organisations and individuals in the region such as ASEAN SOGIE Caucus, Elsewhere Cinema Club, Kirsten Tan, U Bava Dharani, Pluto as well as Queer Asia Film Festival.
The story has also been used by educators at Future Forum Asia. 

The story also drew attention from audience members across the region, and many used it as a repository for queer cinema in the region. It drew 644 unique page views with an average reading time of 3 and a half minutes. On Instagram, the story reached 8,398 accounts, being shared 397 times and garnered 953 likes.

Our research relied a lot on audience input on our crowdsourced database, as well as existing community-driven archival efforts and independent film events across the region. People from the queer community not only led us to lesser-known works, but gave us feedback in regards to our accuracy and sensitivity while discussing the community.","The story uses a crowdsourced database of queer films made in Southeast Asia or by Southeast Asian creators as a base for its visualisations, as well as manually collected lists of film festivals and community spaces.

A combination of Flourish visualisations, Mapbox, and custom visualisations are used in the story. The section “Changing Perceptions” features two key visualisations: a timeline analysing the changing political landscape surrounding queer communities from 1970s to 2019, and a Flourish survey visualisation that provides a bird’s-eye view of Southeast Asia’s queer cinema development.

At the end of the story, readers are invited to explore a Mapbox map of queer-friendly collectives and an interactive database of the queer films we collected.","Queer films, and queer communities in general, typically have to stay under the radar in most of Southeast Asia. One of the issues discussed in the story, and part of why this story is so important, is the lack of widely available information on queer expressions, queer community spaces, and even laws surrounding queerness. Struggles or instances of censorship are often only known through word-of-mouth.

Queer films rarely reach mainstream cinema due to censorship or lack of resources (with a few exceptions such as the Philippines), which makes data collection a bit difficult. Many films are scattered in film festivals, Youtube links, and blogs. Language barrier also added a layer of difficulty. 

These difficulties, however, showed us the importance of community-driven data collection and preservation which served as the basis for the story.","Queerness is a broad topic that is constantly expanded and questioned. While Western LGBTQIA+ labels have become more widely accepted, there are a lot of queer expressions that go beyond these labels. 

Discussions about media queer representation in recent times can often focus on what counts as “good” representation, but we learned that it was especially important to be open to diversity of queer expressions and experiences. This is reflected in the data collection and cleanup process, where we decided not to be limited by clear explicit labels but rather look for exploration of gender, sexuality, and relationship dynamics.

This approach is especially important in Southeast Asia, whose queer communities are familiar with censorship by authorities and invisibility in global context. Discussions of queer issues often intersect with decolonisation. A lot of care is put into looking for research materials that come from the region or question Western-centric ways of thinking. As previously mentioned, it was important to rely on community-driven archival efforts and independent film events in the region.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/diversity-of-queer-and-lgbt-films-in-southeast-asia,,https://www.rnanews.eu/data-journalism-top-10-china-s-fishing-fleet-queer-cinema-hurricane-ian-iran-protests-313211.html,https://blog.datawrapper.de/data-vis-dispatch-october-4-2022/,https://www.the-tea.sucks/blog/is-queer-representation-enough,https://pages.datasketch.co/newsletter/data-culture/issue-21-art-that-resists-violence/,,"Griselda Gabriele / Multimedia Designer & Author

Oftentimes, our cultures are appropriated and reduced to stereotypes in Western media: white protagonists take the lead, while characters who look and speak like us are relegated to background roles. While Japanese and Chinese works in the genre have long enjoyed global recognition, gaps in representation in our own region continue to persist.

Our story maps out the state of Southeast Asia’s science fiction by showcasing our diverse collection of sci-fi stories and shedding light on how these works have reflected the region’s rich sociopolitical context across generations","Within the journalism community, the story has been featured by publications and newsletters such as those of the Global Investigative Journalism Network, Quantum of Solazzo and Data Sketches.

On our website, it garnered 1,499 unique page views with an average reading time of 5 minutes and 21 seconds. It reached 3,745 accounts on Instagram, being shared 250 times and also garnering 452 likes on the actual story post.","Drawing inspiration from the Hero’s Journey narrative structure, we challenged ourselves to create a data story that resembles an actual sci-fi novel! We combined an exciting plot told in the second person with breathtaking illustrations and “choose your own adventure”-like twists and turns. Allowing the reader to choose the country they wanted to dive into, as well as converting dialogue into text boxes (a nod to video games like Chinatown Detective Agency and comics like Trip to Tagaytay) allowed us to not only shorten the story’s scroll length and improve user experience but also replicate the immersive and interactive experience tales in the genre are known for.

Our team scraped through online databases such as Letterboxd, IMDB, and Goodreads and also crowdsourced science fiction titles from the public to put together an extensive database of works from the genre. We then ascribed themes and tropes to each title to create a scatterplot visualisation of the landscape of East and Southeast Asian science fiction using machine learning techniques (TF-IDF, tSNE) and Flourish. This was accompanied by scrollytelling (Scrollama.js) to reveal key points about specific stories.","To our knowledge, there remains no comprehensive repository about Southeast Asian science fiction. Many stories within the region are not well-known and often dismissed as empty entertainment. Thus, they’re hidden in anthologies that are often inaccessible online and in print. 

Support for local publishing also varies greatly per country: some industries have gone on to achieve international acclaim, while others have seemingly faded into obscurity. As a result, creators and enthusiasts alike have been hard at work behind the scenes.

This story is a testament to the importance of communities in keeping the industry afloat: we not only drew on and made links between several efforts of sci-fi writers and readers over the past decades in the narrative itself, but also relied heavily on their contributions to point us in the right direction and build up our Notion database. 

While our database definitely isn’t exhaustive, we hope to encourage readers to find new works similar to ones they already love and start conversations that keep these stories alive. This way, more people can come to understand – in innovative and ingenious ways – how the past has shaped our present and imagine how we can work towards better futures.","We sometimes have the tendency to view Asian issues from a colonial perspective because that’s what saturates the media we consume. It takes extra effort to highlight our narratives and tell them in new and exciting ways, on our own terms, but it’s a necessary endeavor.

For our story, we veered away from our usual writing style at Kontinentalist and chose to harness the power of creative nonfiction.

This story aims to highlight and illustrate the yawning wealth gap exacerbated by the pandemic, and the intersecting inequalities that lie beneath the surface. We worked closely with Oxfam Asia to highlight key findings and recommendations from published studies, particularly their 2022 report “Inequality Kills”. This was published a week before the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting as we wanted to generate conversations around inequality and put pressure on leaders to address the issue.","This story was published and shared widely in the lead-up to the 2022 WEF. It received a substantial amount of shares on Twitter, where our partner Oxfam Asia also shared our story alongside their own commentary.

Leveraging on the popularity of an established global NGO, we were able to spread important key messages on inequality in Asia. We were able to turn a relatively dry topic into a concise and engaging story that highlighted the most salient issues and humanised them by incorporating quotes and centering intersectionality in this story. 

As a result, the story had wide reach across our audience members with 5,081 unique page views with an average reading time of 5 minutes and 13 seconds. On Instagram, it gathered 281 likes, being shared over 230 times and reaching around 7, 713 accounts.","The story makes use of Lottie for animated elements and D3 for data visualisations and micro-animations, and also incorporates a unique horizontal scrolling slide format.","There is an extensive amount of data on issues related to inequality such as income, sustainable development indicators and access to basic goods.

Singapore,Kontinentalist,Small,Participant,,How attainable is the Singapore dream? An investigation into public housing,2022-08-30,"Investigation, Long-form, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Employment, Human rights","3D modeling, Personalisation, Google Sheets, Flourish studio, Scrollama.js, rough-nation js","This story takes a deep dive into Singapore’s public housing programme, long touted as an essential part of the country’s success. It investigates the programme’s evolution, and how accessible or attainable public housing is to the country’s poorest. It reveals, through data, research, and interviews, that the lowest income group lives in small rental flats, which are of a significantly lower standard of living and quality compared to the rest of the country. These present unique challenges to lower-income and minority communities. It calls for policy change to improve rental housing, making it more accessible for the most vulnerable.","This was one of our most popular and top stories of the year, having an extensive reach amongst our Singaporean audiences. It also saw several reshares and commentaries on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and an extensive Reddit discussion thread. It had approximately 3,500 unique reads since publication with an average read time of 5 and half minutes, and on Instagram, reached 20,500 accounts, almost 1000 likes, 530 over direct messages or reposts, and 350 people saving it as bookmarks. 

Other Singapore-based publications have covered the country’s public housing policy from a data-driven angle previously, but did not focus on the lower-income groups. Housing is an issue that affects all Singaporeans, and is often hotly discussed. Our story prompted empathy and debate amongst many, as evidenced by the extensive sharing and discussion around it. 

It has also pushed other organisations and publications to think about their own communicative outputs. For example, we were contacted by a few non-profits interested to engage their audiences in a similar fashion. We also inspired a partnering company, One Bite Studio in Hong Kong, to apply the same thinking to Hong Kong’s housing policies and this culminated in a separate partnership microstory on Instagram.

Within the journalism community, the story has been featured by notable publications, such as We, the Citizens, and the Global Investigative Journalism Network.","The overarching concept of this story is anchored in the definition of a Singapore dream. The story starts with a lift in the clouds to allude to this, and gradually descends into darkness towards the end. It concludes with a more uplifting colour and tone to encourage further conversations, and imbue a sense of hope for change. 

A major element in this piece features a “choose your own adventure” style of storytelling. Readers can pick a family and follow them on their journey of attaining a home. We used this to explain public housing eligibility and the hurdles families face in finding a home. 

This story has many interactive data visualisations, which were all made with Flourish Studio. Several data visualisations were also made as SVGs, with desktop and mobile friendly versions. We also had elements scrollytelling, using both vertical and horizontal scroll. To evoke the emotional and human element of this story, we also used illustrations to convey a sense of exclusion, loneliness, and solitude.

Other frameworks used were Scrollama.js and rough-nation js.","Housing in Singapore is a relatively sensitive topic despite the prevalence of the programme. In recent years, there have been other media outfits that have been at the receiving end of legal action due to incorrect statements regarding Singapore’s public housing. 

Within this big umbrella of public housing, a topic of general lesser focus is on the Public Rental Scheme, and lower-income households. The general, widely accepted narrative about families that fall into these groups, is that they have either failed to help themselves, or are there temporarily. Few media pieces cover their quality of living, and none talk about it from a data-driven perspective. Hence, our story was designed to bring the focus of public housing back to the groups that need it most. 

Data on public housing is not as easily available as we would like it to be. There are slices of data available, for example income and housing distributions, or flat sale prices, but no Singapore comprehensive data repository. Some of our data was also sourced from Teoalida, a freelancer who has been collating data on Singapore’s public housing programmes for years, and sells these collated datasets for a fee. When it came to data concerning flats under the Public Rental Scheme, it was even less granular. 

We supplemented these gaps with personal visits to flats under the Public Rental Scheme, and several interviews with these families.","There are two learning points in this story. The first is how to bring an emotional tenor and empathy not only into your writing, but the story design. From the background, to the illustrations, our story was designed to immerse the reader in an experience that helped them empathise with lower-income Singaporeans, their unmet aspirations, and their sense of isolation. By using examples of everyday families in relatable jobs, we also wanted to show that Singapore’s love for meritocracy has left hard working Singaporeans disadvantaged. 

Secondly, our story exemplifies how data journalism can add new perspectives to unchanging narratives. Singapore’s public housing programme is something widely celebrated, with plenty of data on flat prices and so on. However, that same data could be used to elucidate areas that has been given lesser attention to, but not any less important.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/affordability-of-hdb-housing-policies-and-living-cost-for-low-income-singaporeans,https://buttondown.email/puntofisso/archive/484-quantum-of-sollazzo/,https://www.wethecitizens.net/a-giant-kerfuffle-over-athletes-smoking-pot/,https://www.rnanews.eu/data-journalism-top-10-celebrity-jets-amazon-destruction-pakistan-floods-meme-origins-303273.html,https://twitter.com/gijn/status/1568202395703808000?s=20&t=InUEBbiK6O0ujD6iHxZE9Q,,,"Writers / Peiying Loh, Zafirah Zein

India,The Quint,Big,Participant,,Islamophobia 365: Lynchings & Beyond | How Anti-Muslim Hate in India's UP Has Grown Exponentially Since 2017,2022-03-09,"Explainer, Long-form, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Crime, Human rights",Infogram,"‘Islamophobia 365: Lynchings and Beyond’ is a data-driven multimedia interactive that documents instances of anti-Muslim hate in Uttar Pradesh, providing details of as many as 418 such instances since September 2015. 

The documentation and classification of these cases show how increasingly rampant and systemic communal prejudice has become in the state. 

The data was presented in an interactive manner - to make it more engaging for readers to go through the details. We created interactive data visualisations based on crucial data points that emerged through our research.

The incidents covered a range of Islamophobic acts and instances of intimidation and violence.","By being driven entirely through a plethora of individual incidents, the project doesn’t rely on hyperbole but is instead based on facts, figures and the stories of individuals impacted by anti-Muslim hate crimes. The details, data and anecdotes spoke for themselves, and resonated with our readers more deeply than any kind of sweeping statements or grandiose claims could have.
 
The project was widely shared and amplified by our readers on social media and other platforms - and was credited for comprehensively demonstrating how the imbalance in the right to identity, dignity and equality of the citizens of Uttar Pradesh seems to only be deepening ever further.

For instance, horrified by the details of the hate crimes and how it affected the victims, a woman named Chandrika Nair wrote on Facebook, “Why don't everyone put aside the religion and look at each individual as a human? (sic)”

Our project was the first major quantitative study that sought to measure the scale at which instances of anti-Muslim violence had increased in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, India’s most politically significant region.

It catalysed a conversation on the subject of anti-Muslim hate crimes in India on social media - across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, with thousands of comments, shares and interactions.

The average read time on the story was 2 minutes 24 seconds, 533% of the average across the website (27 seconds).

We received messages from other journalists and editors in the Indian media thanking us for our painstaking work on this project. They also echoed what several of our readers had messaged or posted publicly about the story - that it is an important, timely and thorough documentation of the rapid rise in communally-charged human rights violations in Uttar Pradesh, and an effective warning sign for readers in India and across the world.","Our research consisted of a collection of verified media reports, government data, and records from the DOTO (Documentation of the Oppressed) database which were further corroborated by news reports.

We listed a range of Islamophobic acts, including instances of violence, policies targeting Muslims, attacks based on religious identity, hate speeches, false accusations, calls for economic and social boycotts, and instances of intimidation.

We created the project on Infogram, an interactive data visualisation tool. We made multiple pages on Infogram, and separate ones for each year that our research covered (from 2015 to 2021).

We used various features of Infogram very creatively - from making the best use of the timed element animations, to introducing interactivity in numerous visualisations (of both data and infographics). The data was presented in an interactive manner - to make it more engaging for readers to go through the details. We used pop-ups that allowed the reader to find out more about any case that they wished to delve into further, and presented additional audio-visual and multimedia elements for cases for which they were available.

Then, the UI/UX for the microsite navigation was created on Adobe XD.

And finally, our in-house developer put it all together and built the site incorporating all our different elements.","Uttar Pradesh, the state which our project focused on, is one that has been ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since early 2017. That is also the year in which hate crimes against Muslims grew manifold in Uttar Pradesh. As per the instances documented in our database, there was a five-fold increase. The number of cases have stayed as high ever since.

As our reportage shows, a lot of the violence is executed by Hindutva outfits, which have the backing of certain ruling party leaders. Reporters covering such matters are routinely at the receiving end of abuse and trolling on social media, including threats of violence. Our team at The Quint is no exception to this, especially due to how persistently we have covered the worrying rise of Hindutva vigilantism and violence in places like Uttar Pradesh.

Another important context that we wish to draw your attention towards is how even the COVID-19 pandemic proved to be an opportunity for Hindutva hatemongers in Uttar Pradesh to spread disaffection against Muslims. As our project shows in detail, there were numerous instances of COVID-related misinformation and disinformation targeting Muslims, and attacks on Muslim street vendors and those looking 'visibly Muslim' during the pandemic - leading to many people losing their jobs.","One key takeaway for journalists and editors from this project is that when the story merits it, the best way to prove a large-scale hypothesis might be to document a database of incidents as exhaustively as possible, and let the numbers and the cases tell their own story. It will definitely require more resources than picking and choosing any two or three case studies and hoping they do the job of capturing the reality on the ground effectively enough. That latter approach can have its advantages in a lot of situations, but when it comes to quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrating a trend and its impact, the database method is arguably more effective and closer to being beyond reproach.

In many other Indian newsrooms, a project as resource-intensive as this one would have likely been shot down. But the significantly higher engagement rates on a project as thorough as this one should also inspire other journalists and editors to back more such projects in their newsrooms.

Lastly, based on the feedback we have received from several Indian journalists, this project seems to have inspired others to focus more on innovating in designing interactive and immersive experiences which will engage readers more actively in the story, and also thereby appealing to more readers to stay in the story for longer. As Naomi Barton of the Heartland Hatewatch Project by the Indian news publication The Wire wrote on Twitter about our project, “This is incredible work - style and content both!”",English,https://www.thequint.com/quintlab/acts-of-anti-muslim-hate-in-uttar-pradesh-interactive/,https://www.thequint.com/quintlab/acts-of-anti-muslim-hate-in-uttar-pradesh-interactive/2015.html,https://www.thequint.com/quintlab/acts-of-anti-muslim-hate-in-uttar-pradesh-interactive/2017.html,https://www.thequint.com/quintlab/acts-of-anti-muslim-hate-in-uttar-pradesh-interactive/2020.html,https://www.thequint.com/quintlab/acts-of-anti-muslim-hate-in-uttar-pradesh-interactive/conclusion.html,https://twitter.com/AdityaMenon22/status/1501646852600434689,https://twitter.com/khanthefatima/status/1501763946365161474,"Zijah Sherwani - Producer

It helps expose various amounts of bribes paid to corrupt security agencies by smugglers to transport freely smuggled petrol products across these borders which vary “from N2 million, N5 million or N1.5 million."" This helped heads of Nigerian Security Agencies to take administrative measures against such culprits, for instance, with the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) in an official statement announcing efforts to tackle the menace and weed out “bad eggs” within the agency.","We deployed various Multimedia tools I.e, Spy cameras were used to capture various security guards identified in the bribe scandal. Smartphones were used for effective communications and recording of voices of some respondents. Microsoft Productivity Tools were used to further analyze figures and raw data. While Canva and PowerDirector tools are used to produce bith videography and infographic.","The Reporters was able to overcome issues of language and communication encountered among some localities of these countries. Also, It was a known fact that the story was done in the wake of ongoing insecurity in Nigeria; as a result of banditry and Islamic insurgency activities operating within some border communities and forests of Niger Republic and Cameroon, hence, exposed all the Reporters to a consistent fear of being caught on the fieldwork by armed bandits. 

Aside this, two of these reporters who went undercover in Niger Republic and Cameroon communities during their fieldworks were faced with harassment and threat of arrest from security guards at both Ilela and Ekot border towns after being exposed by unsuspected locals whom they were earlier confined with vital information about the reporters.","The unique idea of this reporting project was its CROSS-BORDER collaborative approach.

We decided to tell this exploitation story through Myanmar and Afghanistan case studies, as these two Asian countries are commonly involved in complex state-conflicts. The conclusion hopes to call for an urgency for consumers, businesses and governments to enforce proper support and regulation for the mining community.","Gem mining as a whole is an underreported issue in Asia, despite the region being a key node in the gem trade and Myanmar’s jade industry receiving considerable attention in the last decade.

The infographics string together a story of local communities and workers being exploited for global mineral exports.","We felt it important to feature Afghanistan as a case study as the country was experiencing a difficult and tumultuous time in 2022.

As the landlocked nation opens its doors to foreign money, who is it inviting, and what troubles lay ahead?

This story deep dives into an extensive dataset on foreign investments into infrastructural developments in Laos in the last few decades, and explores the patterns and nature of these investment networks.","Laos is a country often overlooked in the media landscape in Southeast Asia. It is amongst the poorest, landlocked, and at present, most vulnerable to debt traps. 

This story was initiated via a collaboration with Open Development Mekong, who wanted to do a “follow-the-money” type story, tracing financial inflows into Laos, and the impact it’s making not just on the country’s physical landscape, but how it’s also shaping and influencing larger society. 

Our story spurred interest from the non-profit, research focused sector, with some journalism newsletters spotlighting our work. It was mentioned in Asia Undercovered, and the author, Pei Ying Loh, was also interviewed about it on a Data Journalism podcast. 

The story also received 1,326 unique page views with an average reading time of 4 minutes and 9 seconds. On Instagram, our post reached 7,713 accounts, being shared 230 times and garnering 281 likes.","In analysing the data, we utilised Google Excel, R, and Flourish. In executing the story, we used Mapbox, D3.js, Flourish visualisations, and unique SVGs. 

The cover art is illustrated in-house, and designed specifically to allude to the idea of Laos being vulnerable to geopolitical pushes between its neighbours.","The data collection for this by far, was the most challenging, gruelling part of this story. It is also probably the most data intensive project Kontinentalist has ever worked on. 

Collating and matching the data across several data sources took almost a year, and was done between two persons whenever we had pockets of time. We wanted to create a fairly comprehensive picture, and while there were several decent sources to refer to, not all of them were comprehensive. For example, they either focused only on hydropower projects, or when more general, they left out smaller investments. 

Pulling this data together was simply step one of the plan. Step two involved creating a list of companies and organisations that have links or investments in these projects, and create a dataset out of them that included their origins, and type. 

A lot of time was spent cleaning data, ensuring that spellings and names of projects and companies are standardised throughout. Once that was completed, we could properly match companies to projects to create a detailed network analysis, which we featured in the story.","This story exemplified two things. The first is the importance of collaborating with regional partners in sourcing and collating much-needed data, or supplement desktop research with on-the-ground qualitative insights. Our partner, Open Development Mekong, was instrumental in assisting us in the data process, and helping us understand which sources to look at. 

Secondly, the story highlights why it is important to invest in data-intense, longform pieces of journalism. While infrastructural developments and investments in Laos may not be immediately attractive or popular to read, the longer-lasting effect of this story is in it’s support to researchers and other non-profits trying to understand the financial and debt landscape of the country.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/foreign-investment-and-hydropower-development-in-laos-pose-problems,https://n3con.com/magazine/archives/3207,https://opendevelopmentmekong.net/news/money-flows-whos-investing-in-laos-and-what-problems-do-they-present/,https://buttondown.email/puntofisso/archive/473-quantum-of-sollazzo/,https://asiaundercovered.substack.com/p/asia-undercovered-round-up-18-august,https://news.futuresoutheastasia.com/p/hcmc-construction-update-2022,https://datajournalism.com/read/newsletters/the-rise-of-data-journalism-in-asia,Writers/ Pei Ying Loh & Zenn Wong,"Pei Ying co-founded Kontinentalist in 2017.

One year after the coup, Myanmar has shifted to the global news periphery. Yet, the consequences of sidelined conflict are still being felt today. Poor regulation and oversight have created a free-for-all condition for resource exploitation to intensify at the cost of local communities.

Google Sheets was the bread and butter of our hypothesis-driven research process. For each piece of our investigation, we kept track of where we found the data, how we cleaned it, and how we analyzed it, all in a sprawling spreadsheet which we called the “Masterfile”. We drafted our story on Google Docs so that our team members, many of whom were experiencing intermittent internet and/or power outages, could edit asynchronously. We then used our Google Doc as a “CMS” by marking it up with ArchieML, which allowed any team member to make changes to the webpage by simply editing the Google Doc.

[The Pudding’s starter template](https://github.com/the-pudding/starter) on GitHub helped us quickly scaffold our project using just vanilla JavaScript together with Scrollama for scrollytelling and Mapbox for performant maps.","In the aftermath of the 2021 coup in Myanmar, our team participated as data consultants in a fellowship run by the Earth Journalism Network. Together with journalists in the Mekong region, we produced over 15 data-driven stories investigating environmental issues. One of the fellows, Maran, reported on the illegal rare earth mining in northern Myanmar. As an all-Burmese team, we took on this exciting opportunity to further work with a compatriot journalist on a local issue with global supply chain ramifications.

With dismal scores on press freedom, reporting from within Myanmar obviously comes with hurdles. Due to the crackdown on journalists after the coup, our team has chosen to use pseudonyms to conceal our identities. Maran himself reports from an undisclosed location which experiences regular power cuts and internet outages. Safety concerns and lack of oversight also hinder us from measuring the true scale of the problem.

While Maran’s [original article](https://www.mekongeye.com/2022/05/23/myanmars-environment-hit-by-rare-earth-mining-boom/) focuses more on local activities and impacts, we believe that the issue can be made relevant to a wider international audience - anyone who may use rare earths. We were driven by the guilt that the devices we are using might have components that have been siphoned from our own land. We want to instill this awareness to our readers and prompt them to become more responsible consumers","Data journalism can be more inclusive and reflect the actual communities being impacted by the issue with more effort. In this article, the main author is a non-English speaking Burmese, the data and production team are Burmese, the editors are also Burmese. The story by an all-Burmese team serves an accountability purpose that a Western-led effort would struggle to achieve. To make the project work though, without the typical resources available in big newsrooms, it requires a highly collaborative team dynamic for putting together different skillsets to produce a cohesive piece. 

Due to limited press freedom and various other challenges imposed by an authoritarian regime, stories on Myanmar have mostly relied on diaspora voices and foreign academics. It is easy to overlook direct voices from within Myanmar. With the right mix of tools and determination, a quality data journalism piece produced mainly by an all-Burmese team can be achieved.","English, Burmese",https://kontinentalist.com/stories/myanmar-rare-earth-metals-minerals-mining,https://kachinwaves.com/archives/2237,https://www.mekongeye.com/2022/05/23/myanmars-environment-hit-by-rare-earth-mining-boom/,https://thedailyshot.com/2022/11/08/will-year-over-year-changes-in-home-prices-dip-into-negative-territory/,https://jasonanthony.substack.com/p/milestone-and-millstone-8-billion,https://blog.datawrapper.de/data-vis-dispatch-november-1-2022/,https://visualrebellion.org/words/airstrikes-leave-open-wounds-in-the-heart-of-kachinland,"Writers/ Maran & Myanmar Data Citizens

And yet, in any discourse on the community, misinformation, and sometimes disinformation, often takes centerstage. From their views on the institution of marriage and procreation to a woman’s status as laid down by Islam, it is largely preconceived notions that inform Indians’ understanding of the religion and the people. But how much of it is fact and how much is fiction? In a series of stories I have tried to bust these some popular myths about Indian muslims.","I did a series on the topic of ""Myths about Indian Muslims, which became very popular on social media. This series of twenty story's got more than 13 million views on my social media platforms. People appreciated my efforts to debunk the myths about the miniroties of India.","In this video series I have quotes data from international organisations, government research instituetes, NGOs. I have also done ground reports and cross check the claims made by the ministers in the parliament.","India is a secular nation. It is called a land of unity in diversity where people of different sects, caste, and religion live together. But the expansion and consolidation of the Hindu Right's political power has raised legitimate concerns about the future of India's secularism. 
 
Since 2014, there have been many cases of mob lynching, evictions, and arrests targeted at people from specific minority groups and activists in India. In 2021, over 30% of all detenues in Indian prisons were Muslims even though the community's share in the population is only 14.2% (as of 2011). This over-representation of Muslims in jail is the reflection of the communal bias of the police. Such organised crime has affected human rights in my home country. 
 
As a journalist I have been very vocal about such issues. I have been making videos in one of our regional languages to make people aware of their constitutional rights and show them how rising hate can destroy the social fabric of India. My documentary film 'Footloose' also tells a story about rising hate in India through the eyes of Pakistani Hindus and Rohingya Muslims who have settled in India as refugees due to their persecution as a result of similar hate in their respective countries.
 
My work has mostly revolved around spreading information to debunk myths and bring people together. I always try to put information in words that people can find convincing and moving. In the process, I have been living with minority communities and creating short videos to bring people together and spread the message of love and unity through social media. These videos are watched and shared by millions of people. Fortunately, the feedback is very positive. I usually see people mentioning in comments how much they would like to explore places and meet those people. In a country where minority communities are being targeted every day, I started an explainer series on debunking the myths about the Muslim community which was well-received.","After this project I feel that reporting, spreading awareness and advocating against rising communalism and hate is very important and also as an independent journalist we can use social media to publish our stories.","Hindi, English",https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSrAawR8UnX3pZuNJHiwoUbbhed9mO0Dl,https://www.facebook.com/watch/100063684881344/740372177043993/,,,,,,Rohit Upadhyay,"I am an independent journalist, documentarian and YouTuber from India.

It explores the pros and cons of both optimistic and negative views on the topic, and how these perspectives can affect actions and decisions related to climate change. The article also looks at the potential impacts of these differing views on society and the environment. The unique approach of this article is that the same data and charts are used to demonstrate how an optimistic and a pessimistic view on the same facts can change the way how we think of international climate policies.","The project from sueddeutsche.de on international climate policies has made a significant impact on the audience and community by providing a unique approach in data journalism. The article helped raise awareness and understanding of different attitudes and perspectives on climate change and policy, and how the same data and charts can support both optimistic and pessimistic views. It also inspired other journalists to take a more data-driven and analytical approach when reporting on climate change, by showing that data and statistics can present a balanced and accurate picture of the issue. The impact on the audience and community has been to help them understand the complexity of the issue and how different perspectives can shape public conversation and policy decisions. The use of data and statistics to support different viewpoints has also informed the public about the importance of considering multiple perspectives when making decisions about climate change.","In this project from sueddeutsche.de, the team used R for data analysis and visualization. They used R packages such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 for data cleaning, transformation, and plotting. The infographics department refined the data plots for better visual representation. The data sources used were from the Global Carbon Project, the Global Carbon Project, and UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme). These organizations provide reliable data on carbon emissions, climate change, and environmental policies. The team used this data to analyze and support the different viewpoints presented in the article. The readers can use a toggle to smoothly switch between the optimistic and pessimistic view in the article. This allows the readers to compare the different perspectives and make their own judgement. The combination of R and data sources from reputable organizations enabled the team to present a data-driven and analytical approach to their reporting on climate change.","This article was published during the Climate Change Conference in Egypt in November 2022, a crucial moment where the majority of countries' climate policies were rated as ""insufficient"" to meet the Paris Agreement goals by the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) project, an independent scientific analysis. The report also stated that the current policies would lead to a warming of 3.2 degrees Celsius or more. The article uses historic projections of potential global warming, which were acquired by retrieving historic data from CAT via the wayback machine. The timing of this article's publication during the conference is particularly relevant because it aims to raise awareness and understanding of the different attitudes and perspectives on climate change and climate policy and how these shape the public conversation and policy decisions. By providing a unique approach by allowing readers to smoothly switch between an optimistic and pessimistic view using a toggle feature, the article aims to educate the public on the complexity of the issue and the need for multiple perspectives when making decisions about climate change.","This project serves as an example of how data-driven journalism can provide a unique and informative perspective on a complex issue like climate change. Other journalists can learn from the use of data analysis and visualization tools, as well as the use of multiple data sources from reputable organizations. The toggle feature that allows readers to smoothly switch between an optimistic and pessimistic view can also be an inspiration for other journalists to provide multiple perspectives in their reporting.

TEXTY used open sources to collect information about the potential agents of Russia at various levels, from first-tier politicians to local promoters of the Russian World, and visualized the findings. The project covers more than 1,300 individuals and 900 organizations in 19 countries of which 17 are EU members. We used graphs to show the extent of the influence by countries and by spheres: politics, church, media, education etc.","For many years politicians, cultural figures, entrepreneurs, non-government organizations, and educational institutions connected with Russia promoted the ideas of “Russian world” (‘russkiy mir’ concept).

Political parties, which usually belong to the far-right or the far-left part of the political spectrum, are one of the mainstays of Russian political interests in Europe. While others may condemn the war, they still promote the idea of easing the sanctions or maintaining economic ties with Russia despite its aggression against Ukraine. Our protodatabase consists of a number of politicians due to their public or indirect support of Putin's actions.

As we were finalizing this project, the European Parliament adopted a resolution recognizing Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. A number of EP deputies voted against this decision. We were pleased to note that more than 80% of those who supported Russia in this vote were already in our database for their previous ""merits"".
The project is expected to contain further updates and will expand the search scope for Russian business lobbyists in Europe.

The data collected as part of this project offers only limited insight into Russia’s influence on the political and social processes in Europe. Ukraine has learned from its own experience that Russian tanks are the natural extension of the Russian World doctrine. **This visualization was intended to demonstrate the scale of the potential threat and help motivate officials, journalists and public activists to carry out a more comprehensive risk assessment in each country**. 

The project aroused big interest among the public, especcially in Twitter. About 2300 retweets of original posts, including accounts of well-known experts, influencers and institutions from Ukraine, Poland, Germany, US, EU headquaters. Project was demonstrated on Polish TV. **We received many requests to extension of the project to other countries in Europe, South America and US**.","The data was collected from open sources - the media, reports of state authorities, public data, research by scientists, and from registers of partnerships published by the representatives of the Russian government themselves.

All the subjects of our project were screened manually by our investigators using open sources. The first tier of our “screening” resulted in a substantial number (over 200 according to our estimates) of studies and investigations which were then analyzed for surnames and organization names which, in turn, were sorted by country.

To provide some insight into the subject, each card contains a link to his or her biography (most often from Wikipedia in the subject’s native language). If none is available, we provide references to other biographical sources.

For layout of circles with ""Russian germs"" we used d3.grid layout script written by Jeremy Stucki. If you are familiar with d3 circle pack layout, you probably know that it is hard to control the position of parent circles. We prepare a how-to sample, which shows approach to set the desireble position of parent circles and custom circles pack algorithm then. https://observablehq.com/d/1d81b62396cbbf42","On February 24, 2022, Russia’s unprovoked full-scale invasion of the territory of Ukraine began. For many years politicians, cultural figures, entrepreneurs, non-government organizations, and educational institutions connected with Russia promoted the ideas of “Russian world” (‘russkiy mir’ concept), the greatness of Russian culture, and the unity of the peoples of Ukraine and Russia. As a result, claims to the cultural heritage of Ukraine became one of the key stated reasons for the unprovoked invasion.

In a similar way, such organizations and personalities promote the humanitarian, economic and political interests of Russia abroad, especially in Europe. Often this happens at the expense of the state budget of Russia through the structures of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Agency for Cooperation with Compatriots (Rossotrudnichestvo), the Russian World (Russkiy Mir) Foundation, etc.
The task of our project was to gather information about these people and organizations in one place and indicate possible connections with Russia they have.

The scope of such actors appeared to be even wider than we anticipated. Accordingly, for the first stage, we have had to focus only on Europe countries and now working on the next part. 

We are open to provide the complete dataset for the project to everyone who are researching this topic and are interested in using the data for their projects.","The task of our project was to gather information about number of people and organizations in one place and indicate possible connections with Russia they have. We hope this will allow citizens of the European Union, national and local authorities, media, NGOs, and entrepreneurs to choose their partners more carefully or possibly refrain from such cooperation.

For the latest real estate prices, we rely on the Notary Barometer of the Federation of Notaries. The average price is displayed every quarter and per municipality. Quarters with insufficient transactions are extrapolated and displayed with a dotted line.

For family incomes, we rely on figures from Statbel, the Belgian statistics bureau. We only take into account joint tax returns and use the median taxable income for each city or municipality. The income data for 2020, 2021, and 2022 are calculated based on the latest tax returns from 2019 and corrected for inflation.

The production database of farmsubsidy.org is built upon Clickhouse, a state of the art column store that allows very fast lookups and aggregations about huge datasets like this one. The biggest challenge during the investigation was to cross-match recipients against company registries (and other registries such as the EU Lobbyregister or sanctions list) and to get a sense for the ""type"" of a recipient, if it is a company or a natural person. For both tasks we used open source technology involving machine learning models, such as the python tool ""nomenklatura"" for deduplication / cross-matching and in general the ""followthemoney"" toolchain from the aleph team (Organized Crime and Corruption Project). We trained our own machine learning model via pythons ""fasttext"" to predict the types of recipients. The website farmsubsidy.org is built with Next.js to allow static pre-rendering. To geocode the recipients addresses, we developed a batch geocoding tool called ""ftm-geocode"" that worked against a self-hosted instance of OpenStreetmap's ""Nominatim"" to allow fast geocoding of ~500k addresses without hitting the rate limits of the official nominatim instance.","It's important to note that the access to this huge amount of data has only been possible because the involved data team has been on this project for almost a decade. The data had to be archived every year because the EU and its member states – if they display it at all – only show the last two years of subsidies at any given time. Only through years long dedication was it possible to gather the data for eight consecutive years. In addition, in a couple of countries this data was only available through individual FOIA requests. This project came together about ten years ago through a cross-border collatoration initiated at Dataharvest and it's a project that's not possible for any single, traditional publishing house to build or maintain.","If you know your way around specific EU regulations, bring data journalists and traditional reporters together, use data, FOIA and reporting tools wisely and follow through over a couple of years, you can build very important public value investigations.","German, English, Dutch, Polish, Italian, Greek",https://farmsubsidy.org/,https://fragdenstaat.de/en/blog/2022/12/01/farmsubsidy-the-big-ones-profit-the-small-ones-die/,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/politik/agrarsubventionen-tierquaelerei-e115725/,https://www.ftm.eu/articles/european-agricultural-subsidy-farmers-billions,"https://biqdata.wyborcza.pl/biqdata/7,159116,29204509,ksiadz-jak-rolnik-na-wspolnej-polityce-rolnej-kosciol-zyskuje.html?disableRedirects=true",https://irpimedia.irpi.eu/farmsubsidy-politica-agricola-comune-ultraricchi-agricoltura-europea/,https://www.reportersunited.gr/10152/farm-subsidies/,"Simon Wörpel, Stefan Wehrmeyer, Vera Deleja-Hotko, Edoardo Anziano, Dinos Kontokostas, Adriana Homolova, Florian Koch, Jarek Kopeć, Alicia Prager, Paolo Riva, Natalie Sablowski, Laurent Schmit, Sotiris Sideris, Gesa Steeger, Dominik Uhlig, Sarah Wippermann, Yannik Achternbach, Daniel Drepper, Katharina Huth, Max Donheiser, Sabrina Ebitsch, Micael Perreira","The aim of farmsubsidy.org is to obtain detailed data relating to payments and recipients of farm subsidies in every EU member state and make this data available in a way that is useful to European citizens.

The research found an increasing number of job vacancies and a shrinking pool of potential candidates. The team based it's findings on a newly developped ratio that compares the number of vacancies to applicants. The findings are presented on an interactive webpage that guides readers step-by-step through an interactive scatterplot that positions all jobs on both axis.,"The new index, based on the number of open positions and the number of candidates, led to a prominently featured news article showing that the labor market tightness has increased to the point where there are now fewer than two candidates for every open position. The unique characteristics of the ratio were visualized in an interactive explainer, which starts from concrete examples and then zooms out to formulate findings about the overall labor market. The interactive article, based on the new index, was read more than 15.000 times and became a recurring news angle in our editors' data-driven labor market reporting.","The data were scraped from VDAB, the Flemish labor market organization. The analysis and data processing was performed with R. Using d3.js, a rotated scatterplot was developed that formed the central graph for an interactive story that used our internal scrollytelling template.","The development of the rotated scatterplot was the key element for the further processing, interpretation and representation of the data.","Learn how linking two individual public statistics can lead to new insights on a already heavily featured news topic.

Sweden,Aftonbladet,Big,Participant,,Aftonbladet's Election Results Graphics of the Swedish Elections 2022,2022-09-11,"Explainer, Long-form, Breaking news, Database, Open data, News application","Scraping, D3.js, QGIS, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Python","We want to nominate our mobile-first election graphics for the SIGMA Award.

The main graphic page provides an easy-to-use, interactive way to explore and understand the results of national, regional, and municipal elections in Sweden (**link 1**).

The same data and visualizations were then used in another publication (**link 2**), where we guided our readers through the complex realities of three election results in a scroll-based version of our map.

Positive feedback and 7.5 million page views prove the success of presenting the election results. First by exploration, and then by explanation.","Our main election page received an astounding 7.5 million page views in the first three days since launch, which is a testament to the success of our storytelling tools. We provided a clear and engaging service, which helped our readers understand the topic and the results.

One of our readers said about the main page “Comprehensive, user friendly, focused and educational in a way I have never experienced before.” This comment also underlines our newspaper’s mission – to help strengthen Swedish democracy by providing accessible and understandable information about the election results to the public.","The project was a complex build consisting of backend data piping to client-side frontend graphics.

The backend included complex data reformatting, and also config files to provide fast failover alternatives if data streaming failed. It was an event-driven backend based on serverless AWS components (S3, Lambda, SQS) to ensure fast updates, massive scalability, and low response times.

The client-side front-end widgets are built using the javascript frameworks Swelte, and D3. The election map is built using Maplibre.

But a lot of data was processed before election night. Historical data was reformatted using Python pandas, and election maps were adjusted to be more user-friendly (for example, removing waterways from polygons, and finding more accurate polygon borders) using the Python geopandas.","The Swedish elections are known for their complexities, with over a hundred parties participating and different parliamentary logic at play in the national, regional, and municipal elections. With eight parties present in the national parliament, the Riksdag, and different coalitions forming at various elections, it can be challenging for readers to understand the election results.

The design of our graphics guides the reader through the complex reality of the three elections taking place simultaneously and the various coalitions that can form in the different elections.

Our main pages, the election results presentation page (**link 1**), and our explanatory page **(link 2**) are designed to guide the reader through this complex reality and make the information easily accessible and understandable, using the interactive map as a main tool for telling the story of what were the most important results of the election.

One particular context we want to emphasize is the complexity of the election itself. We knew that our readers want to learn the main result on a national level, as well as what their neighbors voted for. National, regional and local votes for the national election is therefore important. But not only that, there are two more elections taking place on the same day – elections for the regional and municipal parliaments.

The official data is organized into 6 500 election districts, but depending on which election you focus on, these districts are organized in different ways. We, therefore, had to completely rebuild the structure of the data to be able to provide the user with a seamless experience. When you use the election results webpage, you can use the map to click your way down to a specific district – but on all geographical levels, you can also change which election type you want to see the results of. This was a completely unique feature in Swedish media and a new gold standard.","In our election graphics project, we published two main presentation pages.

The main one was the General results page (**link 1**), where readers could find their own local results, and explore the results as they wanted – an interactive and playful presentation of the results. Its design is meant to encourage the reader to explore the results. This page answered the questions “What are the latest results?” and “How did people vote where I live?”

The secondary publication (**link 2**) consisted of a storytelling version of our election map. Here, the readers are instead presented with a story about the election – and are guided through the most important takeaways from the election. The data is the same (election results data), and the tools are the same (same map, same graphs), but here the reader can no longer explore the data. Instead, through scrolling, we guide the readers through the most important stories of the national and various local elections of 2022. It answered the question “What happened?” and “What was important?”

In other words, journalists can use our election results graphics as an example of successful interactive visualizations of data – where state-of-the-art graphics can be used in various ways and provide the reader with a general overview of a complex story, as well as the possibility to explore the data exactly as they wish.",Swedish,https://www.aftonbladet.se/valresultat2022/,https://www.aftonbladet.se/valresultat2022/sa-rostade-sverige/,,,,,,"Johan Ekman - data journalist

Spain,"Maldita.es, Planta Baixa",Big,Participant,,Destino España / Destí Catalunya,2022-03-24,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Chart, Map, Politics","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","Destino España / Destí Catalunya es una investigación periodística sobre el control de fronteras y la gestión de los aeropuertos en España en pandemia. Fue desarrollada por Maldita.es y Planta Baixa (TV3). 

Destino España publicó por primera vez la base de datos con los registros de las más de 10 millones de personas que entraron por los aeropuertos españoles el primer año tras el confinamiento.

La investigación reveló información que hasta su publicación el Gobierno no quería hacer pública y descubrió, entre otras cosas, que a pesar de los controles nunca se registró cuánta gente llegaba con pasaportes COVID falsos.","La publicación de la investigación se dividió en dos partes. En un primer momento publicamos los resultados de analizar los más de 10 millones de registros de los viajeros llegados a los aeropuertos españoles. Esas piezas tuvieron un gran impacto en la web de Maldita.es y en la emisión de Planta Baixa ese día en televisión, que fue líder en Cataluña con un 14,1% de share. 

Además, nos permitió desvelar multitud de información. Pudimos, por ejemplo, contar cómo estaban llegando viajeros a regiones de España en momentos que estaban confinadas o cómo las mujeres venían a nuestro país más por motivos familiares y los hombres por trabajo.

En la segunda parte de la investigación, una semana después, revelamos todos los problemas que hubo con el control de los aeropuertos en ese primer año de pandemia postconfinamiento. Pudimos revelar que el ministerio no tenía ningún tipo de registro de personas que habían llegado con pasaportes COVID falsos aunque las empresas subcontratadas para el control debían vigilar y registrarlo. Además, para entrar a España había que rellenar un formulario en una app destinada a ello (el resultado de ese formulario son los 10 millones de registros revelados en la investigación), pero esta tuvo muchos errores e incidencias, que también detallamos en esta segunda parte. También falló la coordinación entre el Ministerio de Sanidad y AENA, la empresa pública encargada de los aeropuertos.

Más allá de las visitas, también hubo un impacto a nivel político y social. Justo un día después de la publicación de la segunda parte el ministerio firmó una resolución y dejó de ser obligatorio rellenar ese formulario para entrar a España. También eliminó la lista de países de riesgo para entrar a España, que como revelaba la investigación llevaba meses sin actualizarse. En este hilo detallamos más: https://twitter.com/MalditoDato/status/1511724115060797446?s=20&t=ku_vgtK_C9KcU2pC-HtlUg.","Para obtener información y bases de datos del Ministerio de Sanidad, las comunidades autónomas españolas, la Comisión Europea y otras administraciones utilizamos solicitudes de acceso a la información pública. De hecho, también tuvimos que reclamar ante el Consejo de Transparencica español por la negativa del ministerio a entregar mucha de la información y los datos solicitados. Para conocer los datos que estaban almacenando sobre los viajeros estas Administraciones y poder solicitarlos nos basamos en los registros de actividades de tratamientos de datos personales de los propios organismos.

Para el análisis de datos utilizamos Python para tratar con grandes volúmenes de datos y para calcular funciones de agregación. En concreto se utilizó la librería Pandas en mayor medida. También se utilizaron hojas de cálculo para el análisis manual de algunos aspectos concretos. 

La base de datos principal de la investigación, obtenida a través de solicitudes vía ley de transparencia, se trataba de una tabla en formato csv de 10,74 millones de filas y 14 variables en total. La analizamos con Python y también con extracciones más pequeñas en hojas de cálculo.

Para la elaboración de los mapas, usamos Python para realizar el preanálisis de los datos y Flourish para la visualización. 

Para el resto de gráficos online incluidos en los artículos se utilizó Flourish. En el tema principal de Maldita.es en el que se usa la característica scrollytelling, se utilizó la propia librería desarrollada por Flourish en Javascript. Este mapa también se utilizó como visualización/infografía en la emisión de Planta Baixa y para realizar vídeos de la investigación para redes sociales.","El punto más destacado de nuestra investigación, más allá de los hallazgos descubiertos, fue la publicación de una Información con unos datos con un gran grado de detalle y de profunidad que nunca se habían conocido hasta entonces. De hecho, hasta la pandemia no existía un registro de ese tipo con todas las personas que llegaban a los aeropuertos españoles. Conseguir esa base de datos y poder publicar el análisis con los registros de más de 10 millones de personas nos pareció super valioso. Permitió conocer multitud de datos que no se conocían hasta entonces, ya que antes no había existido un registro gubernamental de este tipo.

De todos modos, no fue sencillo. Tal y como contamos en la investigación, el Ministerio de Sanidad y el Gobierno no querían dar esa información: https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220331/sanidad-transparencia-datos-viajeros-aeropuertos/. De hecho, pusimos el foco también no sólo sobre nuestros hallazgos, sino también sobre todos los datos que el Gobierno tenía o debería tener y seguía negándose a hacer públicos.

Tras conseguir ese registro de los viajeros y analizarlo, no nos quedamos ahí. Investigamos los contratos públicos para el control y vigilancia en los aeropuertos, hablamos con testimonios, trabajadores y viajeros, fiscalizamos cómo habia sido el control en los aeropruetos y cómo había funcionado la aplicación donde tenían que rellenar el formulario, etcétera. Gracias a ello conseguimos muchas más bases de datos vía ley de transparencia. De hecho realizamos solicitudes a distintas administraciones y distintos niveles territoriales para conseguir el máximo de información posible y encontrar sus contradicciones. Pudimos revelar, también, por ejemplo, que el Ministerio de Sanidad reconoció que no comprobó la veracidad de los datos rellenados por los viajeros, pero que a pesar de que aseguraba que no era habitual que hubiera errores, en los primeros meses los había en cerca del 10% de los casos. O que se realizaron al menos 275.000 test COVID a viajeros llegados a los aeropuertos y sólo 890 resultaron positivos. El ministerio también admitió que había fallado en la comisión de control que había creado junto a la empresa pública AENA para vigilar las fronteras en aeropuertos. La crearon en julio de 2020, pero nunca llegó a reunirse, tal y como reveló la investigación.

Además, nuestra investigación no sólo se quedó a nivel español, también pudimos comprobar tras una solicitud de acceso a documentos a la Unión Europea, que el Gobierno español aseguraba a la Comisión que ya no tenía ""ninguna política de testeo a viajeros internacionales"" ni para los países de riesgo. A pesar de que en aquel momento España tenía a multitud de países extranjeros en su lista de riesgo. El Ministerio de Sanidad eliminó la lista unos días después de la publicación de la investigación.

La investigación también sirvió para evidenciar que las medidas de los controles fronterizos no estaban siendo útiles para el contral de la pandemia. Por ejemplo, los controles en los aeropuertos fueron poco eficaces y la información sobre los protocolos a seguir era escasa, incompleta y contradictoria entre distintas administraciones.","Uno de los puntos interesantes ha sido la colaboración entre dos medios de comunicación durante la investigación y en la publicación. En primer lugar, ambos medios cuentan con públicos objetivos distintos. Mientras que Planta Baixa se emite en televisión en horario matutino y únicamente en la televisión pública de Cataluña, Maldita.es lo hace en su web como medio digital y se dirige a toda España. De hecho, incluso los idiomas de ambos medios son distintos: catalán y español. 

Pero ese trabajo conjunto entre dos medios con un idioma y formatos distintos enriqueció en gran manera la investigación. Maldita.es pudo aprender de Planta Baixa la importancia de salir a buscar la historia, los testimonios y los personajes detrás de los datos y Planta Baixa pudo comprobar cómo podían trabajar en una investigación de largo recorrido basada en periodismo de datos a pesar de ser un medio audiovisual que luego tenía que trasladarlo a la pantalla.

Entre ambos medios de comunicación preparamos conjuntamente la investigación, pidiendo la información a través de la ley transparencia y compartiendo los hallazgos descubiertos. Hacíamos reuniones periódicas para poner en común los hallazgos, cómo avanzábamos en las líneas de investigación ya abiertas y cuáles nuevas podíamos plantear. En ese punto también fue muy importante una buena organización y coordinación continua a través de mails y de un archivo masterfile que manteníamos constantemente actualizado con los hallazgos que encontrábamos, las respuestas que conseguíamos vía ley de transparencia, los resultados de los análisis de datos que ibamos realizando y las diferentes fuentes que ibamos encontrando.

En resumen: un equipo más grande que unía a a ambos medios nos permitió ir mucho más allá y que nuestra investigación, además de tener más impacto y llegar a más públicos, lograra muchos más hallazgos y fuera mucho más completa.","Spanish, Catalan",https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220324/destino-espana/,https://maldita.es/tag/destino-espana,https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/planta-baixa/desti-catalunya-qui-ha-aterrat-als-aeroports-durant-la-pandemia/video/6150596/,https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/alacarta/planta-baixa/descontrol-als-aeroports/video/6151648/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220331/destino-espana-descontrol-aeropuertos-pandemia/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220324/trabajo-familia-viajes-genero/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220331/aplicacion-spain-travel-health-errores-pasaportes/,"Jose Molina Gracia, Andreu Merino Vives, Sergio Sangiao Pérez, Xavi Rossinyol Martínez, Yuly Jara Guarnizo, Ana Gómez Parra, Laura Chaparro Domínguez.","Por parte de la fundación sin ánimo de lucro Maldita.es el equipo encargado de la investigación fue Maldito Dato, la sección especializada en periodismo de datos, investigación y transparencia dentro del medio.

United States,LNP | LancasterOnline,Big,Participant,,Audit the Vote gave us its canvassing data to check the results. It was riddled with errors,2022-05-08,"Investigation, Fact-checking, Elections, Politics",Microsoft Excel,"This story obtained and examined data from an election denial group which was holding up the data as proof of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Audit the Vote PA had conducted a door-to-door voter canvassing effort in search of fraud and had claimed to have discovered ""anomalies"" in the election. The group, however, did not release its underlying data. We convinced the group to share the data with us. Our examination of the data and investigation of the canvassing effort revealed severe flaws in the effort. Our story also remains the only public release of this data.","This reporting was cited by The New York Times, Washington Post, Bloomberg, Politico, NPR, Slate, Huffington Post, Vice, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and in a timeline by the Pennsylvania House Democrats. The story became particularly important once it became widely speculated that Audit the Vote’s leader, Toni Shuppe, might have been Doug Mastriano’s pick for secretary of state. It also served to inform Pennsylvania state officials and county leaders as they considered the veracity of these and other claims made by Audit the Vote PA. The report was also cited in Maryland (The Baltimore Sun) as another group of election skeptics proposed a similar effort. 

While it is impossible to prove a negative, we also suspect the story contributed to the prevention of these claims gaining traction locally. Similar claims were made in other counties, most notably Luzerne. In that county there was not the same level of media scrutiny of these claims, and the county eventually agreed to a hand recount of the 2020 election, costing thousands of dollars and several weeks worth of man hours for very little change in outcome. Carter heard personally from local GOP party members in Lancaster who were pleased the group's claims were being thoroughly fact checked, and some local politicians became more willing to call out the group's misinformation following this report. The type of traction Audit the Vote gained in Luzerne was not seen in Lancaster.

Audit the Votes claims represent a serious accusation against our elections system, yet they have never released their underlying data. Our story remains the only release of this data to date.","Using a copy of Pennsylvania's voter roll, Audit the Vote PA conducted a door-to-door canvassing effort asking voters a series of questions about the 2020 election. The dataset provided to LNP | LancasterOnline by Audit the Vote PA did not contain the names or addresses of the voters they surveyed. These columns had been removed before it was provided. But, information contained in a “notes” column contained enough personal information that, when combined with a column referencing a voter’s “municipality,” could be used to identify several voters by cross referencing this information in the state's voter roll. The Audit the Vote PA dataset did not contain unique identifiers, so an SQL join could not be done on the dataset. Carter had to match the voters from one dataset to another manually. This sometimes resulted in multiple matches on the same voter. To find the correct voter he had to visit multiple homes in some cases. Once Carter had found as many voters as possible from the Audit the Vote PA data, he then reinterviewed those voters and showed the significant errors volunteers made when questioning voters and recording their responses. This involved multiple days of driving around the county to visit homes spread out over a large area.

The dataset also provided unclear information about whether the voters surveyed were registered in 2020 at the homes they were living in when Audit the Vote conducted the survey in 2021. Using OSINT investigative techniques, Walker found a photo of one of the original surveys on social media and used it to determine that the question asked was if the person surveyed was registered to vote in 2020, but not if they were registered to vote at this address. This represented a significant misstep in the survey process.","Following the 2020 election, grass roots efforts to prove fraud popped up in several states. The chief group pursuing fraud in Pennsylvania was Audit the Vote PA, run by Toni Shuppe. After an unsuccessful petition campaign to try to force the state to perform a forensic audit, in the fall of 2021 the group turned its effort toward a door-to-door canvassing effort in the hopes this would prove the fraud they suspected. Audit the Vote was very actively lobbying state and county governments for election concessions, and had the ear of some elected officials, most notably state senator and GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano. Once they had completed their canvassing effort, they began publicizing the results to elected officials and voters all around Pennsylvania claiming they had found an enormous amount of ""anomalies"" in the election and sought to use the results to leverage election administration concessions. Some outlets, including LNP | LancasterOnline, reported that these ""anomaly"" claims were being made, but until our report taking a deep look at the canvassing data and process, no outlet had critically examined these claims. Getting the data was not easy. Though Shuppe had directly challenged LNP | LancasterOnline to look at it for ourselves, it still took several weeks for us to convince her to actually provide it. Shuppe was also rumored to be Mastriano's pick for Secretary of State, which would have given her oversight on elections across the state. This story served as an important fact check on her knowledge and qualifications for that position.","I think this story should serve as a reminder to journalists to not be intimidated by hostile sources and to remember that our job is not simply to blindly present both sides of an argument, but rather to critically examine claims and test their validity. Prior to this story I had written about this group's claims and tried to make contact with the group's leader so that she could validate what they were saying. She did not respond, but posted on social media later challenging me to examine her data. Even though I knew this source was likely to be hostile to me and possibly deride me publically regardless of what my story found, I decided to take her up on her challenge. I interviewed her and examined her data in good faith, yet found many errors which I was obligated to inform the public of. I was correct in my suspicions, and she has disparaged me to her audience ever since. I have even been doxxed on social media by her followers. However, our job is not to quote one person who says it is raining and one who says it is not. Our job is to look out the window and find the truth. I am proud of myself and my editors for doing this story, especially because I did not see critical examination of their claims being done elsewhere.",English,https://lancasteronline.com/news/politics/audit-the-vote-gave-us-its-canvassing-data-to-check-the-results-it-was-riddled/article_8f0a6c2a-cd6e-11ec-9f73-b3e07fd7b64b.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/us/politics/republican-poll-monitors-election-activists.html,https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgpjdb/qanon-election-denier-pennsylvania,https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-voter-integrity-group-election-2022-20221013-llnlixfflfavbd4xuqghtn7pla-story.html,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/doug-mastriano-pennsylvania-gop-governor-candidate-secretary-of-state_n_62e4447fe4b0c60a5668334e,https://www.inquirer.com/news/pennsylvania/spl/pa-election-2022-voting-misinformation-unverified-drop-boxes-20221104.html,https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/02/rnc-stop-the-steal-advocates-poll-workers-00049109,"Carter Walker, reporter

Canada,CBC/Radio-Canada,Big,Participant,,We used AI to measure Canada’s urban sprawl,2022-03-07,"Investigation, Database, Open data, Satellite images","3D modeling, AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Three.js, R","To combat climate change, cities need to control their urban sprawl and intensify population density. To measure how much Canadian cities have grown over the last 20 years, we taught a machine learning algorithm to detect urban areas from satellite imagery and then used it on thousands of satellite pictures covering 47,000 square kilometres. By overlaying the Canadian census data, we were then able to measure the impact of this urbanized land growth on the number of cars on the road.","Because the project allowed users to check their city, it had a great reach and was widely shared on social media. CBC/Radio-Canada is Canada's national broadcaster and has regional stations across the country. The data for each city was shared in advance with local reporters, which produced TV and radio stories on top of the national ones. Urban sprawl is an important topic in many municipalities, but studies about this phenomenon are often limited and private. This data-driven project brought new numbers, with one consistent methodology for the whole country, allowing comparison between cities and forcing mayors and municipal councils to consider the problem more seriously.","The satellite imagery comes from Landsat 7. The satellite was launched in 1999 and is still active today, allowing us to study urban sprawl over more than 20 years with the same image source. We created a simple composite of images for each available year between May 1st and November 1st to get cloud-free pictures.

To classify each pixel as an urban or non-urban area, we trained Random Forest models with Canada’s 2015 Land Cover maps produced by Natural Resources Canada. After training, the models classified each pixel in the selected cities between 1999 and 2021. This procedure was done in Google Earth Engine.

Once each pixel was classified, we did a spatial join between the pixels and the Canadian Census dissemination areas to infer information on the residents from the latest census year (2016). We also used Statistics Canada population estimates from 2001 to 2021.

For the publication, we created 3D maps and 3D scenes with ThreeJS. The charts were coded with D3.js.

We published our detailed analysis with all of our code along with the main story: https://ici.radio-canada.ca/info/codesource/code-ouvert/2022/03/etalement-urbain/analysis.nb.html.","There's a lot of hype around artificial intelligence. However, finding a way to use machine learning algorithms from a journalistic perspective is difficult. As journalists, we deal with facts. But there is always a part of uncertainty with these algorithms. So it took us several months to gain enough confidence in our results to publish them.

However, the resulting story was worth it. From a data journalist's point of view, it was an extraordinary experience, and we want to keep exploring this way. The algorithms are getting easier to use, and the computing power is getting cheaper: the potential for future data-driven investigations powered by AI is real.

Maltego and Social Links Pro","We exposed a booming market in phosphates exported from Syria to European fertiliser companies by a sanctioned Russian oligarch. Our team untangled the complex network of shell companies, shady shipping operators and Syrian war profiteers benefiting from Europe’s appetite for cheap resources, despite their origin. 

Using trade data, customs records and open source tools we revealed for the first time Serbia and Ukraine’s reliance on Syrian phosphates, and new shipments to Italy, Bulgaria, Spain and Poland. We documented the tricks used to disguise the trade including a pattern of vessels turning off their radar before they enter Syrian ports.","The investigation was published by media in the UK, Ukraine, Lebanon, Bulgaria and Italy. The investigation’s findings were covered by Agence France Presse and featured in Arabic news bulletins around the region.

One month after the story was published, the EU sanctioned Sanad, the Syrian company transporting phosphates from the mines to the ports for shipping to Europe. We found evidence that the ex-militia turned security company was involved when we discovered a truck with the company logo on a social media post from inside Tartous port. We documented the company’s owners, Assad-linked businessman Ahmed Khalil and a security official named Nasser Deeb, who were also added to EU sanctions after we published the investigation. The sanctions cite their involvement in the Syrian phosphates industry, noting that “the exploitation of natural resources provides revenues to the Syrian regime.”

In Russia, the nonprofit founded by jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny used our reporting to dig further into the Russian companies involved. Their follow-up investigation into the senior Russian officials profiting from the Syrian phosphates trade reached several million Russian viewers at a time when Navalny’s declining health in custody has added fuel to his campaign against corruption, including profiteering from Russia’ brutal military campaigns in Ukraine and Syria. 

In Syria, the investigation was repurposed as a training resource for local journalists by SIRAJ – whose mission is to widen access to investigative tools among Syrian journalists and civil society, in the service of bringing some measure of accountability to an extremely opaque and authoritarian country. Several Syrian journalists trained in the investigation’s reporting methods have since embarked on potentially groundbreaking investigations of their own.","Syrian investigative journalist Mohammad Bassiki first spotted a pattern of ships disappearing from automatic identification systems (AIS) as they headed towards Syria from Europe. The vessels reappeared again several days later sailing back to Europe. He confirmed the ships were picking up phosphates in the Syrian port of Tartous during these blackouts by analysing records of vessels and cargo published on the port’s Facebook page. He noticed that data for ships collecting phosphates was regularly removed, and had the foresight to scrape the data as the port took down all these records shortly after.

To continue tracking these shipments, Syrian open source investigator Bashar Deeb scoured open source images of Tartous port. He found images of vessels docked in the phosphates-loading berths in the background of news reports and a dock-worker’s selfie. Satellite images of the berths also helped establish the vessels’ dates of arrival and departure. Deeb used multiple ship tracking services to triangulate AIS data and confirm Bassiki’s initial hypothesis - ships were regularly switching off their AIS before sailing to Syria to pick up phosphates for European countries. 

We then extracted and analysed official export data from the UN Comtrade and Eurostat databases to confirm the countries importing phosphates. This data helped us track the growing demand for the Syrian material, which we cross-referenced with the limited records available from Syrian authorities. 

Investigative journalists in Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Italy and Bulgaria joined us to identify the companies involved. They obtained customs records through sources and freedom of information requests which revealed the role of middlemen and shell companies in the trade. We mined national databases and corporate registries to expose how these proxy companies worked. We also consulted multiple shipping registries to establish the owners of the vessels bringing phosphates to Europe, including some under sanctions themselves.","The two principal reporters worked on this investigation for two years under extraordinary circumstances. Mohammad Bassiki from Syria started tracking disappearing phosphates shipments as he worked to rebuild a life in Europe and simultaneously establish a Syrian non-profit dedicated to investigative journalism and accountability reporting. Oleg Oganov from Ukraine kept up his pursuit of the Ukrainian oligarchs and front companies involved despite family tragedy during the Covid-19 pandemic and then the Russian invasion of his country. He fact-checked the final draft as Russian troops closed in on Mykolaiv, where he has a non-profit for investigative journalism. After almost a year of Russian bombardment, he continues to work from Mykolaiv relying on power banks amid rolling blackouts.

Access to data was a big challenge. Only a few dozen countries make customs data publicly available; for the purposes of our investigation, we only had this information for Ukraine. For the six other European countries importing Syrian phosphates, we had to come up with other strategies to obtain the data, including through freedom of information requests and sources. 

It was even harder to access data about the companies selling phosphates. The Russian oligarch-owned company that controls the Syrian phosphates industry created new companies to operate in the country and denies any connection to them. Syria is a tightly-controlled authoritarian state, but our Syrian reporters waded through the official gazette, leaked documents and open source images to find the contracts and confirm the names of key officials involved. Russian corporate registries are hard to navigate and contain partial information but OCCRP’s highly-skilled research team was able to identify some records of the companies and their Russian staff and owners. Several of the middlemen are located in almost completely impenetrable corporate jurisdictions like the UAE. 

The Syrian government’s hostility to independent reporting made reporting on the supply chain inside Syria challenging. Independent ournalists are not able to access the port, the convoys or the mines. Sources are very hesitant to speak and need to be able to communicate securely. Our Syrian reporters are skilled at navigating this context, but also have developed expertise in financial records and open source investigations in response to these severe restrictions on journalism in the country.","1) This story could not have been done except as a collaboration. A multidisciplinary team from nearly a dozen countries drew upon a large range of data sources in multiple languages/jurisdictions. But collaborations, especially across borders, only work when there is trust, communication and meticulous organisation. Our team met (online) regularly, looked out for each other, and worked together in OCCRP’s secure online workspace. 

2) To help all these journalists navigate such a complex investigation, we needed clear, easy-to-use working documents. Combining multiple data sources, we built a database of dozens of shipments from Syria to Europe and identified 15 key journeys where we could establish the full chain of custody. We also developed a company tracker with details of all the importers, shippers, exporters and middlemen and a directory profiling all the companies and key players. These resources enabled us to cross-reference, spot patterns and make connections between findings.

3) It was important to use as many data sources as possible to fill information gaps and verify findings. For example, freedom of information requests were unsuccessful in every country except Bulgaria, while Serbia has useful company-level trade data. 

4) But data would only take us so far: there were so many layers of proxy companies that it was hard to identify the final customer of the phosphates without an insider tip-off, which we then confirmed through interviews and documents. 

5) Despite its complexity, we wanted the story to be accessible and interesting to a general audience. We kept storytelling front of mind as we reported, looking out for compelling people and details that would be relatable to readers. OCCRP’s visual team also built interactive maps to simply and clearly convey a key piece of the story: the pattern of the disappearing ships.","English, Arabic, Ukrainian, Russian, Bulgarian, Italian",https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/europe-buys-bloody-syrian-phosphates/,https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/a-bloody-trade-inside-the-murky-supply-chain-bringing-syrian-phosphates-into-europe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/30/europe-syria-phosphates-trade-assad,https://daraj.media/92423/,https://nikcenter.org/newsItem/70294,https://bivol.bg/en/three-bulgarian-companies-importing-phosphates-from-bashar-assad-sanctioned-putin-oligarch-andrey-melnichenko-among-the-clients.html,https://irpimedia.irpi.eu/paradossi-delle-sanzioni-dentro-la-filiera-del-fosfato-dalla-siria-alleuropa/,"Mohammad Bassiki, Oleg Oganov, Bashar Deeb, Charlotte Alfred, Lara Dihmis, Jovana Tomić, Nikolay Marchenko, Lorenzo Bagnoli, and Ana Poenariu.

Reporter Alleen Brown worked with research engineer Akil Harris to harness datasets for heat risk, wildfire risk, and flood risk and juxtapose them against a federal government index of over 6,500 facilities from across the United States’s sprawling mass incarceration system. Our submission includes five stories, one short film, an interactive map, an explainer on our methodology and data, and the full dataset. The project launched on February 12, 2022; two additional stories were published on March 13 and March 31, 2022.","Until recently, very little scholarship or investigative journalism has focused on climate issues in prisons. As academics, policymakers, and organizers increasingly pay attention to this problem, “Climate and Punishment” is becoming a foundational resource for a burgeoning movement. From California to Florida, organizers pushing for installation of air conditioning or for the closure of prisons are using Alleen and Akil Harris’s work to argue for policy change. The work is also being used to support individual cases. For example, Alleen’s piece on ICE detention was made part of a campaign that led to Argueta Anariba’s release from detention on bond after seven years in detention. Argueta Anariba’s story was highlighted by High Country News as one of the biggest immigration stories of 2022.

The work is also influencing a range of academic disciplines. Alleen was invited to speak about the project alongside renowned prison scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore at the opening plenary of the 2022 Beyond the Bars Conference, Columbia University’s annual mass incarceration conference. The video has been incorporated into curriculum for medical students at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School, the map is now part of a course on heat and inequality at UCLA, and the series was recently cited in a Harvard Law Review chapter, focusing on what the climate crisis means for prosecutors. Alleen is aware of a human rights organization and a group of academics who are both preparing reports repurposing the data or methodology. 

The project received more than 128,000 page views in the first 7 days, and was shared on social media by a slew of social justice organizations, including Global Health Now, Innocence Project, The Marshall Project, Roots Action, and The Opportunity Agenda.","We used a variety of tools like Python, Node.js, PostGIS, PostgreSQL, D3.js, Pandas, AQIS, and Leaflet. Much of the geospatial analysis was done in QGIS, PostGIS/PostgreSQL, which would then be exported as Json or CSV to be used in Python with Pandas to do further analysis across the different climate factor datasets. This data was then used by Alleen to do analysis for her reporting and to power the interactive map. The map was built with a combination of Node.js, D3.js, Leaflet, and Svelte.js. The final data analysis is loaded into the map as Json, and the facilities with their respective factor ratings are plotted and searchable.

We collected and analyzed data from a number of different sources, including the Department of Homeland Security’s Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data, the U.S. Forest Service’s Wildfire Risk to Communities project, the First Street Foundation’s flood model, the Union of Concerned Scientists’s Killer Heat analysis, and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement's online list of holding facilities.","To our knowledge, no one else has conducted a prison climate risk mapping analysis like this, nor does there exist a comparably comprehensive exploration of the impacts of the climate crisis on prisons. Alleen struggled to find strong background literature to guide her reporting and relied on a variety of geographically diverse sources. 

Finding people who had experienced the impacts of flooding, heat, and wildfires inside prisons and were willing to talk about it took a significant amount of time on top of the data work. The prisoners who shared their stories did so at significant personal risk, because of the possibility of retaliation. To locate knowledgeable sources, Alleen spent weeks contacting public defenders, Facebook groups for loved ones of the incarcerated, formerly incarcerated people, prison policy advocates, and researchers. Because the reporting was conducted during the first two years of the pandemic, many people inside prisons had restricted access to phones and other means of communication, so reaching sources for a first phone call often took weeks or months. Incarcerated sources’ health, wellbeing and, in many cases, timing of release is largely dependent on the discretion of prison personnel, so many of the people Alleen reached ultimately chose not to share their stories publicly.

For the ICE reporting, Alleen conducted interviews in Spanish. Using a translator would have been virtually impossible, given the challenge of coordinating phone calls from ICE detention. Alleen and the Intercept’s video team put in additional effort to coordinate and record a video interview with Angel Argueta Anariba from inside detention, as we felt it was important to give him an opportunity to tell his own story. 

The team prioritized displaying the data in a way that could be used by families and communities impacted by incarceration. The map allows users to view individual facilities to understand how they are impacted by climate risk factors, or to view states and cities to see the range of climate risks facing people who are incarcerated in a given area. We also considered the fact that there exist few maps of the U.S. incarceration system that would allow a user to quickly get a sense of what prisons might be impacted as a storm or wildfire approaches. 

The marriage of data with the experience of individual incarcerated people was central to the project. As Nick Shapiro, head of UCLA’s Carceral Ecologies put it, “The project helps legitimize the experiences of millions of incarcerated people in a way that I haven’t seen data journalism do before.”","The project was always intended to be a resource to other journalists, so we published the full “Climate and Punishment” dataset on [GitHub](https://github.com/firstlookmedia/climate-and-punishment-data). Following the project’s launch, we hosted a press call to offer training to local and national journalists who were interested in utilizing the data in their own reporting projects. 

Local journalists can easily use the map to search their area and get a sense not only of what kinds of climate risks prisoners in their area face — but also simply where prisons are located. For journalists who are looking into a specific incident of climate impact on a prison, the risk ratings for individual prisons can deepen their analysis. For journalists watching as a storm or wildfire approaches their area, the map can help them get a sense of what prisons are in its path and what kind of vulnerabilities are built in. 

The stories, too, were meant to provide a comprehensive overview of the range of issues related to floods, wildfires, and heat prisons across the U.S. face. Our analysis provides a foundation for other reporters first digging into how the climate might impact people who are incarcerated. 

Finally, our methodology and presentation could be applied to other types of facilities, such as elder care facilities or homeless shelters. We’re aware of at least one team of journalists that is in the process of repurposing our methodology.",English,https://theintercept.com/series/climate-and-punishment/,https://github.com/firstlookmedia/climate-and-punishment-data,https://theintercept.com/2022/02/12/climate-and-punishment-data-methodology/,https://theintercept.com/2022/02/23/intercepted-climate-crisis-prisons/,https://www.democracynow.org/2022/2/14/climate_and_punishment_incarcerated_global_warming,https://www.wabe.org/new-series-investigates-living-conditions-at-prisons-amid-climate-change-crisis/,https://crooked.com/podcast/climate-behind-bars/,"Alleen Brown, Akil Harris","Alleen Brown is a New York-based reporter, focused on environmental justice issues.

En ella se han analizado todos los mensajes enviados entre enero de 2020 y septiembre de 2022 por 39 canales de Telegram desinformadores en español, que actúan como un clan del negacionismo en esta aplicación de mensajería.

El análisis e investigación de los 574.414 mensajes que han enviado en ese tiempo muestra cómo actúan, cómo se relacionan y reenvían entre sí, cuáles son las 'fuentes' que más utilizan y que desinforman sobre multitud de temáticas distintas y esto varía en función de la actualidad.","El impacto de la investigación en Maldita.es fue importante. Las distintas publicaciones estuvieron entre las piezas más leídas los días que se publicaban y posteriores. Además, también tuvo una gran distribución en redes. Hicimos publicaciones en Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook y Twitch, entre otras. Además, también realizamos un programa especial en el podcast de Maldita.es, 'Maldita la hora', únicamente sobre la investigación y una newsletter para nuestros suscriptores. De hecho, diversos medios de comunicación y distintos académicos expertos en desinformación se hicieron eco de la investigación y sus hallazgos y esta puede servir como punto de partida para muchas otras en el campo de la desinformación.

Además, la investigación también supone un importante impacto interno para Maldita.es como fundación y medio de comunicación especializado en lucha contra la desinformación. La investigación nos ha permitido conocer en mayor profundidad cómo actúan estos canales negacionistas, cómo se relacionan entre sí y cómo interactúan. También hemos podido conocer cuáles son las webs que más utilizan como fuentes en sus mensajes, esto ha solucionado un reto importante que teníamos como medio que realiza fact-checking. Es complicado categorizar webs en general como desinformadoras, pero ahora muchas de ellas podemos definirlas como una de las fuentes más utilizadas por estos canales negacionistas en Telegram que hemos investigado. También hemos podido comprobar sobre qué temáticas desinforman más para estar más pendientes de ellas a partir de ahora y qué palabras suelen asociar a esos mensajes y de qué forma lo expresan. Todo ese trabajo nos permite estar mucho más pendientes y tener mucho más conocimiento a partir de ahora para nuestra labor en desmentirlos. También hemos podido corroborar cómo cuando suceden determinados eventos se dedican a desinformar más sobre temas concretos, lo que nos ayuda a estar aún más alerta a partir de ahora cuanto esto suceda.","Para descargar la información y el contenido de los mensajes de los canales de Telegram que formaban parte de la muestra de nuestra investigación se creó un código para la extracción de datos utilizando la librería Telethon de Python. A partir de esa extracción creamos nuestra propia base de datos, de tipo relacional y en lenguaje SQL. 

Para el análisis de datos durante la investigación se han hecho consultas a la base de datos con la librería Pandas de Python. Además, para el análisis de algunas extracciones más pequeñas también se emplearon herramientas de hojas de cálculo.

Durante el análisis de los datos fue fundamental extraer las palabras más frecuentes incluidas en el texto de los mensajes y para ello se utilizó la librería NLTK de Python, utilizada para procesamiento de lenguaje natural. Así, después, pudimos categorizar palabras clave en distintas temáticas para añadir ese nuevo campo de información a los registros de nuestra base de datos.

En el análisis de la base de datos también necesitabamos poder ver a qué webs dirigían los mensajes enviados, pero una web puede contar con más de un dominio distinto que redirige a ello. Entonces necesitamos agrupar los dominios web, para lo que utilizamos el programa OpenRefine, en concreto los algoritmos de clustering.

También se obtuvieron datos históricos del número de suscriptores de cada canal utilizando las herramientas Telemetrio y TGStat, que permiten obtener estadísticas de canales y grupos en Telegram.

Para los gráficos interactivos de la investigación se utilizó Flourish. En las tres piezas de la investigación, además, se usó la característica scrollytelling. Para ello se utilizó la propia librería desarrollada por Flourish en Javascript.","La investigación partió de los desinformadores en español que en Maldita.es teníamos identificados en Telegram, una aplicación con muy poca revisión de contenidos y que sirve en gran medida para el crecimiento del negacionismo en internet. Esa identificación partía de nuestro trabajo diario de fact-checking y debunking y de investigaciones previas sobre las redes negacionistas.

Elegimos canales que son consumidos de forma masiva y que tienen un gran impacto. Debido a ese gran alcance, muchos de ellos son utilizados como fuente también por otros desinformadores, redes y webs. En ese punto, además, era importante que fueran canales, ya que así son públicos en todos los casos y podíamos extraer todos sus mensajes entre otras métricas y datos.

Gracias a ello y al análisis pudimos ver cómo actúan, que se retroalimentan (1 de cada 5 mensajes son reenviados de otros canales) y que sirven como puerta a otros lugares donde también se desinforma (1 de cada 3 mensajes llevan enlaces a otras webs y muchas de las webs que más utilizan son desinformadoras).

También hemos podido ver cómo cambian sus discursos, el contenido que envían y cómo aumenta mucho su cantidad de mensajes cuando ocurren hitos importantes, como el inicio de la guerra de Ucrania, cuando por primera vez la principal temática de sus mensajes dejó de ser la pandemia de la COVID-19 para centrarse en la guerra. Además, en esos momentos es cuando su actividad aumenta de forma exponencial.

Otra de las dificultades, además, es que el entramado acaba siendo internacional y se desinforma en muchos países e idiomas, pero nuestra investigación sirve como punto de partida para ver cómo actúan estos canales, que son de los principales desinformadores en español. Además, pudimos ver cómo ampliaban su actividad cuando ocurrían cosas en España como manifestaciones contra las medidas sanitarias de la pandemia en nuestro país, pero que sucedía también con eventos internacionales, como el inicio de la guerra o como manifestaciones contra las medidas sanitarias en otros países de nuestro entorno, como Francia.

En ese punto fue una investigación muy innovadora. Al tratarse de un análisis tan sistémico y de tantos canales, mensajes y tiempo de los desinformadores en un idioma en concreto. En definitiva, lo que hicimos fue aplicar el periodismo de datos para investigar la desinformación. La investigación, además, fue compartida con los miembros del subgrupo de monitoreo de crisis del Code of Practice on Disinformation, donde se sientan entre otros las principales plataformas digitales y la Comisión Europea, que es el principal ámbito de intercambio de información en materia de campañas de desinformación a nivel europeo.

The country has lost more than a third of its professional athletes in the past decade, which is approximately 350 thousand athletes. The decrease is caused by many reasons, one of which is the weak sports medical system and the lack of financial income for the athletes themselves.","The investigation has not created a wide impact yet at the official level. However, it helped clarify the environment and circumstances Egyptian athletes are living in, and the reasons causing to embark an early retirement, to look for other means of living. The investigation helped create more awareness about the lack of government care for athletes in different sports.","The investigation used open source tools to collect data. The journalist was able to gather data from official governmental sources on the number of athletes in Egypt in the past few years. The journalist sent out a survey to 200 retired athletes . Several tools were used in the investigation to scrape, analyze and visualize data such as Flourish and Excel.","The most difficult part in the investigation was reaching out to the largest number of retired athletes, to understand the different reasons that pushed them to retirement. The journalist was able to reach out to 200 athletes in different sports and different provinces.

UA:SOUTH journalists located in Turkiye, followed the ships that were illegally unloading grain and other goods from the occupied territories of Ukraine in bulk in the seaports of Iskendurun, Bandirma, Derindge, Samsun, Karasu, Sinop, Istanbul, and Izmir, asking the local authorities to provide the necessary documentation to prove that unloading of these ships was legal there. Due to this investigation, attention to this topic was brought, awareness was raised and the vast majority of the big Turkish transport companies stopped cooperating with Russian ships.","On July 8th, 2022 Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Russia and Turkey, Lavrov and Chavushoglu met without Ukraine participating on the subject of the Ukrainian grain stolen by Russia. The UA:SOUTH journalist, Muslim Umerov, asked Lavrov a question about what other stolen things from Ukraine apart from the grain Russia plans to sell, which Lavrov avoided answering and asked a question back (in his typical manner). The video of Muslim challenging Lavrov got millions of views among YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, facebook and other social media users.

Our July investigation of the stolen Ukrainian grain made UA:SOUTH famous among all the Ukrainian and many international publishers, such as Spanish El Pais, British 4th Channel, American CNN, Swiss Neue Zürcher Zeitung, and Czech Current Time, that used our footage.

United Kingdom,The Financial Times,Big,Participant,,The Climate Game,2022-04-21,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Quiz/game, Infographics, Environment","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Node.js, React, Redux, Javascript","The Climate Game is a lavishly-illustrated interactive game in which readers are elected Global Minister for Future Generations and tasked with reaching net zero emissions by 2050. 

The player is placed at the heart of the decision-making and must balance the trade-offs necessary to protect people and nature — as well as keep voters onside. 

We worked with climate modellers from the IEA, who produced bespoke, state of the art modelling for the FT, to simplify the road to net zero and create a game cemented in journalistic rigour which would appeal to policy makers and younger and non-specialist audiences alike.","The Climate Game has had almost 1mn plays since it debuted on the FT homepage. It has proved hugely engaging, with 56% of players who started the game playing through to the end. The game also exploded in popularity on social media, with more than 4,000 shares of the URL in the first week alone.

This early success inspired a flurry of follow-up content, including podcasts and articles explaining how the game was built. We also published cheat sheets, popular in gaming communities, to help readers navigate the game round-by-round.

We are exploring numerous requests for commercially-sponsored translations, including French, German and Spanish. In early September, Nikkei Asia launched a Japanese version. 

Staff at local councils across the UK and the Department for Business shared it internally to reiterate the importance of early intervention. The European Commission got in touch to say they had done the same.

Perhaps most importantly, The Climate Game is being used by teachers to create lesson plans in the UK as part of the ‘FT for Schools’ programme taught in sixth form colleges.","We built The Climate Game with React, using individual components that were shown and hidden based on their state. For the state management we used Redux — a way of storing the state in a centralised container that all components can refer back to.

We stored the user choices, including the final temperature players were able to achieve based on their answers, in a database via a POST request to a separate node API. This enabled us to have a customised final screen showing readers how well they had performed against other players.

But the real technological innovation was the state of the art climate modelling that the IEA provided exclusively to the FT. This enabled us to present each reader with bespoke charts for both emissions reductions and temperature projections based on their answers.

Climate models tackle a branch of science in which there is inherently a large degree of uncertainty, but the game gives readers a realistic response to their actions. The model does many hundreds of runs through the pathways included in the game, mimicking the emissions going into the Earth’s atmosphere from human and natural sources. 

The game results also show what the Earth’s median temperature is projected to be in 2100. The IEA calculated this using MAGICC v7+ — a reduced complexity climate model that accurately maps temperatures to the decisions made in the game. 

It means there are numerous ways to affect the emissions model to amplify different outcomes, and myriad results are possible in 2050.

Once the IEA had shared the data, we had to reverse-engineer it into the game. The raw figures were manually copied over and stored in JavaScript objects. We then wrote functions to calculate how a player was performing based on their answers, effectively replicating the formulas provided by the IEA.","Our greatest challenge was striking a balance between capturing the complexities of the journey to net zero without building something too daunting. It involved distilling hundreds of decisions into a manageable and comprehensible series of questions, while also calculating the effect these actions would have on reducing emissions.

Immersive, gamified visual storytelling allowed us to walk this tightrope, and through placing readers in the driving seat we were able to teach them about the biggest challenge of the 21st century through a powerful mix of innovation, entertainment and agency.

We spent almost a full year researching and interviewing to build The Climate Game, but also courting, as we needed to convince the IEA to buy into the project and provide us with the climate modelling we needed to power the game.

We identified the IEA Net Zero By 2050 report, the world’s first comprehensive study of how to shift to a clean energy system, as the ideal framework. Gaining access to the data underpinning this research, effectively 400 global actions focused on reducing emissions, gave the game its structure.

Each CO2-related question in the game is tracked to one of the IEA’s three emissions reductions pathways. But a player’s choices do more than just decide their trajectory within a sector, and answers are interlinked. 

If you make the right choice in the electricity sector early on, for example, it pays dividends in transport when you ban internal combustion engine vehicles later in the game. This helps us convey two key messages: early intervention is vital and everything must move together.

We consulted many other experts: Tim Lenton and Carlos Nobre on the impact climate change is having on global earth systems, and climate change analysts Nick Mabey and Mike Berners-Lee on the steps and trade-offs required to get to net zero.

We added questions on methane and land use, both not included in the IEA research, with their impact commensurate with the net zero answers in our CO2-related questions. 

We supplemented emissions-cutting questions with those focused on other levers crucial to a net zero future, such as international co-operation, innovation and adaptation. 

We gauged their impact using “effort points”, with 100 given to each player. Every answer costs points — as do setbacks such as natural disasters — with players having to weigh up where and when to expend their effort. 

We made an Excel spreadsheet to test hundreds of ‘points pathways’ through the game to ensure it was accurate without crushing hope. The fact that 32% of readers kept the planet’s temperature below 1.5C and 27% ended up destroying the world (or sacked!) confirmed we had the balance right.

In effect, the climate game takes hundreds of pages of climate science and distils it into a manageable series of questions and answers. We feel it is no exaggeration to say the game is likely the first time the cause and effect of actions across key emissions sectors and policy levers have been in the public domain in such a digestible format.","The climate crisis, in its near overwhelming enormity, is one of the defining issues of our time. But communicating its impact on society, finance, business and politics in an engaging way can be challenging for even the most adept journalists.

With climate change growing in saliency every year, it is vital we explain the importance of taking action in innovative new ways. The climate game shows that newsrooms can gamify the climate crisis (and other complex topics of global significance) in ways that are scientifically rigorous, informative and fun.

This is an approach we hope other newsrooms will emulate in future.","English, Japanese",https://ig.ft.com/climate-game/,https://www.ft.com/content/6c405e69-a7da-4a36-a3eb-ff3e5aecc60f,https://www.ft.com/content/ff6c1eba-4111-44cf-b37d-01b477a3761d,https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050,https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and-climate-model/understanding-gec-model-scenarios,,,"This game was created by Sam Joiner, Alexandra Heal and Leslie Hook in conjunction with Wongdoody, an Infosys company (Anthony Brooks, Anthony Cooke, Erin Davies, Jeremy Starr, Max Carroll and Rick Deeks).

The visual representations of the data feature multiple selected topics, starting from a general overview and leading to more specific questions, such as variants across species or reported clinical signs. The dashboard intends to support public education about the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission between humans and animals and raise public awareness about possible wildlife conservation issues posed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","The zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, is not yet fully resolved. Although natural infections in animals are reported in a wide range of species, large knowledge and data gaps remain regarding SARS-CoV-2 in animal hosts. We used two major health databases to extract unstructured data and generated a global dataset of SARS-CoV-2 events in animals, and created a user-friendly visualization dashboard for data exploration.This dashboard thus facilitates access to the data, favour animal health information sharing, and foster global understanding of the data among the scientific community, stakeholders, and the public. 
The continuous analysis of SARS-CoV-2 occurrence data in animals is especially critical to adapting monitoring, surveillance and vaccination programs for animals and humans in a timely manner and evaluating the developing threat SARS-CoV-2 represents for public and animal health as well as biodiversity and conservation.","The data used in this dashboard is manually collected and updated weekly from two major databases: the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases ProMED-mail and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) World Animal Health Information System OIE-WAHIS. The collected data is unstructured (narrative text) and/or available in multiple excel sheets or PDF files, therefore not usable without preliminary, time-consuming curation and formatting steps.
The generated dataset is publicly available on our Github(https://github.com/amel-github/sars-ani) and readily usable for analytical purposes. Using harmonized taxonomic names, the SARS-ANI Dataset greatly facilitates access to and re-use of data on SARS-CoV-2 events in animals.

The default scenario shows the global effects if Ukraine can no longer produce maize. Our model combines information on the trade, production, and consumption of 125 food products in 192 countries. As products turn into other products along the supply chain, the shock to Ukrainian maize production does not only affect the availability of maize but also causes losses of other products, such as pig or poultry meat due to a lack of animal feed.","The war in Ukraine called attention to the vulnerability of the global food supply system. This project utilizes a combination of data analysis, computer modeling, and simulations to investigate the effects of various potential scenarios such as natural disasters, economic crises, and pandemics on food production and distribution. 

Due to dependencies in the global food-production network, the local loss of one crop can lead to shortages in other countries and affect other products made from it. Instead of treating products in isolation, our model reveals the losses of 125 food products after a localized shock to agricultural production in 192 countries using a multilayer network model of trade (direct) and conversion of food products (indirect). 
This dashboard allows users to explore which food products are lost and which countries are affected most severely when a specific supplier stops producing a single food product. The goal is to facilitate policy makers,stakeholders, and the public to gain a better understanding of the vulnerabilities in the global food system and to identify potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of future food supply shocks.","The resulting losses in the dashboard are visualized in a map view and a 2D-grid view.

United States,The NewsGuild of New York,Big,Participant,,Study Reveals Racial Disparities in Performance Evaluations at The New York Times,2022-08-23,"Investigation, Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Business, Employment","Adobe Creative Suite, R, RStudio","A group of New York Times journalists — members of the NewsGuild of New York — conducted a statistical analysis of The Times’s performance review system, and found that their news organization had for years given significantly lower ratings to employees of color.

The report, which spurred changes in the practices of one of the country's largest newsrooms, relied on data journalism techniques to further the goals of diversity and fairness, in service not only of journalists but also of readers.","The goals of this project were similar to those envisioned regularly by journalists — revealing systemic inequalities and inspiring change to correct them. But this time, the journalists were turning a lens on an unusual center of power: their own newsroom. 

The project had almost immediate effects: Despite having previously denied and downplayed the racial disparities in the company's performance review process, The Times's leaders soon formed an internal team of top editors to tackle the problem.

As a result of that review, the company this year is providing additional training for managers and a more rigorous review of managers' proposed ratings for their employees. Journalists in the NewsGuild will conduct follow-up analyses to see whether these procedural changes lead to improvements, and will continue to press the company to provide a fair work environment. The goal is to ensure journalists from diverse backgrounds are fully welcome and supported at The TImes, so that the newsroom can better report on New York City and the country as a whole.

Since the project was published, it has been discussed in dozens of other newsrooms across the country. We understand that several are now working on their own analyses.","We used a wide range of statistical modeling techniques, including:

* linear regression
* ordered logistic regression (our main model)
* Poisson regression
* Hierarchical mixed-effects models
* Kruskal-Wallis and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests

We also replicated the methodology the company's consultant had used in claiming that its system did not show evidence of disparities -- and ran simulations using dummy data to test it. We also made several static data visualizations to help communicate our findings to readers.

All of this was done in the statistical programming language R. We shared outputs from our analysis with a range of experts, including leading econometricians who study racial discrimination.","Obviously, a group of journalists and other employees coming together to write a report that criticizes theit own employer is uncomfortable. The protections labor law gives us, as union members, to speak freely about the terms of our employment were critical in our ability to both do this project and to publish it publicly.

We also relied on data that the company is required, under our contract, to provide to the union. Performance review data is quite sensitive, and workers would not normally have access to this kind of information absent a negotiated union contract requiring the company to provide it.","It can be useful to train the kind of investigative and analytical lens we often apply to companies and organizations on our own newsrooms.

The article has been updated several times since then.

In addition, it made the front page of reddit and was picked up by a series of [enthusiast blogs](https://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/2022/06/how-big-is-occupied-ukraine.html) and non-English publications.","The interactive map was heavily inspired by projects such as [The True Size](https://www.thetruesize.com/), which allow users to compare the size of countries and territories, accounting for distortions caused by projections like Mercator.

We used Leaflet to build the interactive map and Svelte to build the rest of the app (search, infobox, etc).

We sourced the geographical features of the occupied territories of Ukraine from liveuamap.com and processed them in R. We also used Eurostat's country shapes to be able to calculate a percentage figure between the size of those territories and that of other countries.","The data was highly volatile, particularly at the beginning of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Liveuamap, the Institute for the Study of War and other sources were all keeping an updated map of the territories in Ukraine that were occupied at the time, but they all differed.

And based on this data, the journalist of Hankookilbo, participating in the project created an interactive article based on the analysis of the concurrent job status of local councilors.","This project provided citizens with easy-to-understand information for the monitoring of the interests of local council members, who are relatively blind spots in the surveillance area but are the basis of grassroots politics. In addition, it was the first time that basic data of local councillors nation wide was provided in South Korea. This data would be an useful source the media and activists in each region could refer to.","Citizens participating in the project collected the information of each local councillors from 226 local council websites, and requested for information through FOIA on concurrent positions and disciplinary details of local councillors. We collected, refine, verify data based on Google spreadsheet. And after the project, Journalists of Hankookilbo investigated and analyzed data for reports and constructed interactive article. We improved the performance and work efficiency of the page by using the Vue front-end library to organize and search the results of the concurrent positions of all 2,978 members by region. For plotting visualization, the chart was created using the D3.js library. Data filters for drawing, sorting, and dynamic animation effects for charts have been implemented.","I would like to emphasize that the project was carried out based on 'open data' in which many citizens and activists collaborated. With the participation of citizens the detailed history and current status of concurrent offices of council members across the country, with different forms and scopes of disclosure, was established as integrated data for the first time. Through the project we could broaden citizens' understanding of monitoring data and and data driven jounarlism as well. In addition, reporter Yoon Hyeon-jong of the Hankook Ilbo investigative reporting team participated in the project and collaborated to produce results as an investigative report that anyone can easily find the current status of concurrent positions and point out institutional problems in reporting concurrent positions. This can be a good example of collaboration between citizens and the press for data production and data-based reporting.","This project shows that there are various ways to collaborate not only in analyzing and visualizing data, but also in producing and sharing data.

Peru,"Coalición de medios LATAM, es una iniciativa de Factual / Distintas Latitudes para impulsar el crecimiento de nuevos medios fundados por jóvenes periodistas, cuestionó y decidió dar una mirada sobre cómo es el panorama que viven los productores, distribuidores y consumidores que han liderado la lucha como mujeres o como personas LGBTTIQ+ en comunidades rurales de la soberanía alimentaria.

En esta investigación, trabajaron los nueve medios de la Coalición LATAM: Revista Colibrí (Argentina), Memorias de Nómada (Yucatán, México), La Antígona (Perú), Altavoz LGBTI (norte de México), La Andariega (Ecuador), La Desvelada (Durango y Ciudad de México, México), Cápsula Migrante (Venezuela y Perú), EsParaMiTarea (TikTok) y Distintas Latitudes (América Latina y el Caribe)",Big,Participant,,"CULTIVAR, DISTRIBUIR, COMER: LA RUTA HACIA LA SOBERANÍA ALIMENTARIA",2022-08-10,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Crowdsourcing, Women, Agriculture, Human rights","Google Sheets, Wordpress","Investigación colaborativa, transfronteriza y multimedia sobre el proceso de la comida en América Latina. En notas de investigación, fotos, ilustraciones, videos y podcast se abarcan las historias de mujeres y poblaciones LGBTIQ+ en Argentina, Ecuador, Perú, México y Venezuela. Sus luchas y desafíos, las leyes que protegen (o no) sus derechos frente a la violencia estructural, contaminación ambiental y las empresas multinacionales. Durante 6 meses, 45 colegas de la región nos unimos para crear este especial, que brinda un panorama de la situación de agricultores, distribuidores y consumidores.","1. Difusión de un tema subrepresentado: a nivel regional, la problemática de la soberanía alimentaria está subrepresentada en los medios de comunicación, así que esta investigación puso en la agenda de cinco países de América Latina la situación de las mujeres y personas LGBTQ+ sobre la producción, siembra, cuidado y distribución de los alimentos agrarios. El micrositio y las publicaciones en los medios de la Coalición son una fuente de consulta y datos abiertos para periodistas y académicos para futuras investigaciones.

2. Se dieron puestos de trabajo a 45 comunicadores en toda la región de América Latina. En los procesos horizontales y con perspectiva feminista, se forjaron los lazos profesionales de la Coalición LATAM. Trabajamos en un ambiente interdisciplinario, interseccional y en el que se promovió el autocuidado. 

3. Capacitación en soberanía alimentaria: el proyecto comenzó con una capacitación virtual con Cultiva Alternativa, un proyecto de autoconsumo de una comunidad maya de Yucatán (México). Todo el equipo asistió, para lograr mayor empatía y cobertura en este tema.","1. Herramientas de trabajo remoto para colaborar y crear lazos, junto con información al alcance de todos: herramientas de Google y Zoom fueron utilizadas para trabajar en equipo. Reuniones abiertas y ejecutivas, links compartidos con todo el equipo y división equitativa de responsabilidades. 

2. Sensibilización del equipo y elecciones horizontal: nos inspiraron las mujeres y personas LGBTIQ+ que luchan por la alimentación y la defensa de la tierra en América Latina con conciencia soberana y agroecológica. Al elegir el tema de investigación, votamos y este fue el enfoque que decidimos colaborativamente.

3. Carta Gantt de la investigación: el trabajo se extendió durante siete meses, desde febrero hasta agosto de 2022. El primer mes fue de organización de reuniones y canales de comunicación, así como de equipos responsables de cada producto. Luego la capacitación inicial y tras ello, la coordinación editorial realizó una propuesta de enfoques para los productos que fue consensuada por todo el equipo. El segundo mes y medio fue de reportería, luego el fact-checking y la edición de los artículos, cuarto y quinto mes de producción audiovisual e ilustraciones, seguido de la elaboración de la identidad estética y el diseño del sitio web. 

4. Perspectiva de autocuidado: nos comunicamos mediante mensajes en días laborables, respuestas en horarios diurnos, pequeñas cuestiones que cuidan nuestra salud mental.","Nuestra investigación se centra en las mujeres y personas LGBT+ de la soberanía alimentaria que, muchas veces, son quienes trabajan la tierra pero no son propietarias: en Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador y Honduras, siete de cada diez mujeres rurales tienen acceso a tierra para producir alimentos, pero en solo tres de cada diez casos la tierra está a su nombre, segun el informe ""Ellas alimentan al mundo"".

Por otro lado, hay muchas mujeres que se organizan para llevar adelante proyectos de la agricultura y para dictar capacitaciones que beneficien el desarrollo de su labor. Como por ejemplo, Cultiva Alternativa (México), la organización que capacitó al equipo al comienzo.

Las historias de mujeres, lesbianas, travestis, trans, gay están subrepresentadas en muchos ámbitos, y es el caso en la agricultura. Sin embargo, nuestra hipótesis de investigación fue que América Latina comparte la problemática de inseguridad alimentaria y una estrategia en común: las mujeres y personas LGBT+ son protagonistas en la lucha por alimentos sanos y accesibles en la región. Además de producir, distribuir y consumir con conciencia soberana y agroecológica, priorizando las economías locales y nacionales y eliminando agrotóxicos, integran saberes ancestrales, fortalecen la salud de sus comunidades, dignifican su territorio y protegen los bienes naturales comunes a largo plazo.

Por ejemplo, en “Del campo a nuestras manos: el camino hacia la soberanía alimentaria”, la nota que hicimos sobre el equipo de distribución, se visibilizaron historias como la de Solbei Villamizar en Venezuela que, además de ser agroproductora, distribuye sus productos en una moto con su hijo de catorce años en una rutina de cada sábado.

Decidimos no solo centrarnos en cultivos y consumo, sino también en distribución. Un descubrimiento a través de las personas entrevistadas es que el trabajo de distribución está mayormente masculinizado. La logística y la distribución de mercancía en la cadena de producción queda en manos de los hombres y no intervienen mujeres ni tampoco personas de la comunidad LGBTIQ+.","1. Las mujeres y personas de la disidencia sexual sí participan en el cultivo, se organizan y gestionan la alimentación de sus comunidades. Las mujeres tienen un rol visible al frente de las tiendas, establecimientos de venta y gestión. Y pese a que la participación de la comunidad LGBT sigue sin ser tan visible, sí existen dentro del proceso de distribución. 
2. La poca difusión sobre la importancia y los beneficios de la agroecología es un factor común. Existen iniciativas impulsadas por productores que intentan conciliar el precio justo con la accesibilidad del consumidor, mediante espacios de compra alternativos y cercanos. Pero el estigma de que es más barato ir al súper que comprar agroecológico permanece. 
3. La soberanía alimentaria es sistemáticamente desvalorizada como trabajo, existen comunidades que viven del cultivo por las actividades económicas que esta genera. Tan solo en el Estado Aragua, Venezuela, hay más de 20 mil personas dedicadas a la actividad agrícola y su activación económica se genera a partir de la distribución del mismo.
4. El consumo de productos agroecológicos en América Latina y el Caribe va mucho más allá de poner vegetales sin agrotóxicos y/o agroquímicos en las mesas: remonta a formas ancestrales de producción e invita a pensar nuevas relaciones entre productores y consumidores. Las experiencias concretas de Ecuador, Perú, Venezuela, México y Argentina dan cuenta de la necesidad de pensar políticas que alimenten a las poblaciones desde la producción de cercanía.
5. Colaboración: comprobamos que es necesaria la planificación para organizarse en un grupo de 45 comunicadores. La comunicación, el autocuidado y la solidaridad son claves. Gracias al apoyo de los miembros, fue posible lidiar con tareas de último momento. Un aprendizaje fue dejar un mes más en el cronograma para últimos ajustes.",Spanish,https://cultivardistribuircomer.distintaslatitudes.net/,,,,,,,"ZOILA ANTONIO BENITO, KATIA REJÓN MÁRQUEZ, NICOLE MARTIN, KETZALLI ROSAS, SAC-NICTÉ GUEVARA CALDERÓN, MARIANA BELTRÁN, GIOVANNA CASTAÑEDA, NERY CHI, MARISOL CIRIANO, KARLA CRESPO, FLAVIA FIORIO, JOHANNA GALLEGOS, ARLETH GARCÍA, DAVID ADRIÁN GARCÍA, DIANDRA GARCÍA, GÉNESIS INDRIAGO MAYA, LUIS LEMINI, DANIEL PACHARI, LAURA RODRÍGUEZ, JAVIER ROQUE, PIERINA SORA, YOBAÍN VÁZQUEZ, AGUSTINA VERDI, VINICIO YUNGA, CHARO ZEBALLOS, ARANTZA GARCÍA, NICOLÁS ACHURY, PAULA COLAVITTO, ANDREA FAJARDO, MISAEL GARCÍA AGUIRRE, KELLY GÓMEZ, ARTURO GUTARRA, BICKY RAMÍREZ, ALANA RODRIGUEZ, MYA SÁNCHEZ, RENATO SILVA, MELANIE SOCA, VICTORIA LAPHOND, NATALIA LUJÁN, EMMA RAMOS, MARÍA JESÚS VALLEJO, KATT AGUIRRE, EVA BLANCO RANGEL, FLORENCIA NICOLINI, ALMA RÍOS.","Esta investigación fue realizada por la Coalición LATAM, una alianza de medios fundados por personas y equipos de jóvenes periodistas de México, Perú, Venezuela, Argentina y Ecuador.

Peru,"Manchados por el petróleo is a collaborative investigation by Mongabay Latam in alliance with Rutas del Conflicto and Cuestión Pública from Colombia, La Barra Espaciadora from Ecuador and El Deber from Bolivia.",Big,Participant,,Manchados por el petróleo / Stained by oil,2022-04-19,"Investigation, Long-form, Cross-border, Database, Infographics, Environment, Business, Economy","QGIS, Microsoft Excel, CSV, -Database, data visualizations, satellite imagery and gerreferenced locations, geospatial analysis.","The cross-border investigation “Manchados por el petróleo” revealed the serious social conflicts and enormous environmental impacts of the oil industry in the Amazon of Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador. What we found, after six months of work, is alarming: 282 sanctioning processes for environmental infractions against 72 oil companies and 169 millionaire fines against companies operating in the Peruvian Amazon and Colombian Orinoquia in the last ten years. The governments of Ecuador and Bolivia did not share official data. We also detected that, in the four countries, oil blocks overlap with 1647 indigenous territories and 52 protected areas.","We were invited to present the findings at an event attended by the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Toxic Wastes and Human Rights, Marcos Orellana, and the Special Rapporteur on Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Rights, Soledad García. We were also the only media outlet invited to the V Cumbre Amazónica of the Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA, for its acronym in Spanish) to present the investigation to indigenous leaders from the nine countries of the Amazon biome, government officials, scientists and environmental organizations. Also, José Gregorio Díaz Mirabal, president of COICA, spoke publicly about the research and shared some of the figures at a press conference during the first COP of the Escazú Agreement. Díaz Mirabal said later in a conversation with Mongabay Latam that ""Stained by oil [Manchados por el petróleo] was an investigative journalistic report, supported by science and technology, which has helped us to confront the speeches and actions from governments, from oil companies that always say that nothing is happening”.

In addition, the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN) and the Investigative Reporters and Editors published a step-by-step interview on the methodology, and recently GIJN included the work in the list of the best investigations in Latin America in 2022. Also Manchados por el petróleo has just been shortlisted for the Fetisov Journalism Award 2022 in the Excellence on Environmental Journalism category. Furthermore, four media outlets in the region interviewed us to present the work: IMER Noticias in Mexico; Radio from the Universidad del Rosario in Colombia; Radio Nacional in Peru and Radio Cultura in Argentina. Finally, after requesting the version of the Ministry of Environment of Ecuador for the report ""Sinchiurco is covered with oil"", the communications department informed that it had initiated ""legal administrative actions for the spill"".","One goal we set from the beginning was that all requests would be made to official institutions. What we were looking for was for the States to be accountable and to show the complete record of sanctions and fines imposed on private and state oil companies operating in the Amazon of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. We made a total of ten requests for information to eight state offices in Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia. In some cases, the information was incomplete, so we insisted and made a second round of requests.

For the overlapping database, we worked with the information about the location of oil blocks held by Red Amazónica de Información Socioambiental Georreferenciada (RAISG), which gathers information from the nine countries of the Amazon region, and based on this data, we cross-referenced the information and analyzed the territory of 2,652 communities and 305 protected areas. What we were looking for was to build a tool that would allow us to observe the percentage of overlapping and how this affects indigenous territories and key ecosystems. What we found is that oil blocks overlap with 1647 indigenous territories and 52 protected areas.

In addition, with the sensitive information gathered in the databases, the journalists were able to work on specific cases linked to the most fined companies, such as the stories of Perenco and Pluspetrol, or communities and protected areas affected by overlapping, such as the cases of the Inga people in Colombia or the Amazonian protected areas in Bolivia. In total, 16 stories were published throughout the project, which took us about six months to complete. The testimonies collected for each story were key, especially those of the Shipibo, Inga, Tacana, Siona, Nasa, Kichwa, Quechua, Kukama, Wampís and Achuar communities.","For more than five years the media that cover environmental issues have been reporting incidents associated with the oil industry operating in the Amazon. The most common are oil spills caused by infrastructure problems, obsolete pipes that break or poor disposal of the waste generated. The problem is serious. In Peru, more than 474 oil spills have been reported in the Amazon between 2000 and 2019, according to a recent OXFAM report. In Ecuador, between 2011 and June 2021, according to the Ministry of Environment, Water and Ecological Transition, 1202. In Colombia, we are talking about at least 272 spills in the Amazon between 2015 and June 2022, as indicated by the Environmental Licensing Authority (ANLA). And in Bolivia we keep reporting the problems without the authority sharing the official results and sanctions after the incidents occurred.

We considered that this panorama required an urgent investigation to establish the magnitude of the impact of the oil activity, to make official information available to the audience, which should be freely accessible, and to reveal the list of companies behind the sanctions and fines imposed in the last 10 years. The biggest challenge was to build the two databases. In the case of the one that gathers penalties and fines, it was difficult to access information that should be publicly available and to review more than 200 files . That’s why one of the most important findings of this work is the secrecy of the environmental authorities in providing information, with the exception of Peru. In Colombia, for example, only official data on companies sanctioned in one region, the Orinoquia region, was provided. The Ecuadorian government stated that between 2011 and June 2021, 1202 oil spills were registered but did not provide the list of those responsible. Bolivia did not even respond. However, the information gathered and analyzed allowed us to reveal that there are at least 282 sanctioning processes against 16 companies in Peru and 56 in Colombia. We were also able to establish, based on partial information provided by the authorities of both countries, that 169 fines have been imposed against 36 oil companies operating in the Peruvian Amazon and Colombian Orinoco for an amount exceeding US$55 million.

The second part of the investigation, which was also quite complex, was first to obtain the official geographic coordinates of all titled indigenous communities in the Amazon of the four countries and of the active oil blocks. This information was collected from each of the experts in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru who have contributed to the construction of maps for the Amazonian Network of Geo-referenced Socio-environmental Information (RAISG). After this, the participation of an expert in geospatial analysis was key because he helped us to extract the information from the maps to build a second database and cross-reference the location of indigenous territories and natural protected areas with the oil blocks. These cross-reference of the database helped us to establish the percentages of overlapping, which in many cases reaches 100 percent.","First, when it comes to an investigation in which requests for information from the State are key, it is important to map all the institutions that may have the data and to consider, within the investigation period, the clarifications and new consultations that will have to be sent to the authorities, as well as the extension of time that they usually request. On the other hand, it is not enough to wait for the response from the institution to the request sent, it is necessary to insist with the communications offices. At the same time, I recommend looking for data in environmental organizations that are mapping the issues we are interested in investigating, since many times they may have made the requests before and have the information that we are having trouble getting. Also, I consider it a very powerful tool for investigation, to use different layers of information and overlap them on a map to understand from different angles the problem we are covering and find more answers. That is why we built a database of fines and sanctions, but we also understood with the overlapping of layers of information how the extractive industry, with the endorsement of governments, is adding new extraction zones within indigenous territories and protected areas.
On the other hand, after publication, I think it is important to not abandon the database that you have worked so hard to build. In this case, behind those 282 sanctioning processes and 169 fines against companies and behind those 1647 indigenous territories and 52 protected areas affected by the overlapping of oil blocks there are socio-environmental conflicts that have not been told. That’s why one of the challenges now is to ensure that the media alliance remains united to continue monitoring the extractive industries.",Spanish,https://es.mongabay.com/2022/04/manchados-por-el-petroleo-un-historial-de-derrames-impunidad-y-abusos-en-la-amazonia/,https://es.mongabay.com/2022/04/multas-por-danos-ambientales-contra-petroleras-que-operan-en-la-amazonia-peruana-y-la-orinoquia-colombiana/,https://es.mongabay.com/2022/04/territorios-indigenas-y-areas-protegidas-afectadas-por-superposicion-con-lotes-petroleros-amazonia/,https://es.mongabay.com/2022/04/colombia-el-pueblo-indigena-que-el-estado-invisibilizo-ante-la-petrolera-gran-tierra-energy/,https://es.mongabay.com/2022/04/pluspetrol-norte-un-historial-de-deudas-sin-pagar-en-la-amazonia-peruana/,https://es.mongabay.com/2022/04/sinchiurco-esta-cubierta-de-petroleo-y-enfrenta-a-petroecuador/,https://news.mongabay.com/2022/05/stained-by-oil-a-history-of-spills-and-impunity-in-peru-colombia-ecuador-and-bolivia/,"Alexa Vélez; María Isabel Torres; Antonio Paz; Vanessa Romo; Gabriela Quevedo; Gloria Alvitres; Enrique Vera; Cristina Fernández; Yvette Sierra; David Tarazona; Angie Garay; Valeria Báez; Andrea Rincón; Nicolás Sánchez; Pilar Puentes, Catalina Sanabria; Diego Cazar Baquero; Ana Cristina Alvarado; Iván Paredes; Nelfi Fernández; Juan Julca; Rocío Arias; Daniel Gómez; Carlos Mazabanda; Eduardo Mota; Estudio Androide; Christian Ugarte; Kipu Visual; Dalia Medina y Richard Romero.","Mongabay Latam is a media outlet that covers the most relevant environmental stories in Latin America.

In [Russia’s Attacks on Civilian Targets Have Obliterated Everyday Life in Ukraine](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/23/world/europe/ukraine-civilian-attacks.html) (March 23), journalists examined thousands of photos and videos, identifying for the first time more than 1,500 Ukrainian civilian buildings and other structures damaged by Russian attacks.


In [What Hundreds of Photos of Weapons Reveal About Russia’s Brutal War Strategy](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/19/world/europe/ukraine-munitions-war-crimes.html) (June 19), journalists collected hundreds of images, showing that 200 cluster weapons and 2,000 unguided weapons were found in Ukraine, often in civilian areas — the most comprehensive collection of such weapons.","In March, 45 participating states of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the world’s largest regional security-oriented intergovernmental organization with observer status at the United Nations, established an independent expert mission on violations committed in the war. [The report](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/a/515868.pdf), presented to the OSCE Permanent Council in April, cited the civilian targets story in documenting clear patterns of violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. The authors wrote:

“It is even more evident, from reports of numerous official and unofficial sources, that tens of thousands of civilian objects have been damaged or destroyed in Ukraine, including houses, multi-storey residential buildings, administrative buildings, penitentiary institutions, police stations, medical and education facilities, water stations and electricity systems.” (Page 26 of [the report](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/f/a/515868.pdf).)

In July,[ a second OSCE report](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/3/e/522616.pdf) cited the weapons story as evidence that the invasion resulted in unnecessary, disproportionate harm to civilians in part due to indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas with, among other munitions, cluster weapons. The authors said The Times “discovered photographic evidence of widespread use of cluster munitions in a variety of civilian settings. It was noted that the majority were unguided, with a proclivity to cause collateral damage to civilians. It also discovered instances of other types of weapons that may be illegal under international law, such as land mines.” (Page 49 of [the report](https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/3/e/522616.pdf).)

In June, Evan Ellis, a professor at the U.S. Army War College, cited the civilian targets story in [testimony](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA07/20220720/115002/HHRG-117-FA07-Wstate-EllisR-20220720.pdf) before the Congressional House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee as evidence of “brutality in Russia’s targeting of civilian populations in the Ukraine.”

[Wikipedia’s page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#cite_ref-46) outlining potential war crimes committed during the war cited the weapons story as evidence of Russia’s use of cluster munitions, unguided missiles and landmines.","After Russia invaded Ukraine, software developers at The Times used Crowdtangle and other apps to scrape Twitter, Facebook and Telegram posts as well as press releases from Ukrainian government accounts and send them to a Slack channel. To help reporters search the posts, the developers created a custom translation bot that grabbed every message and instantly responded with the English translation by running each message through the Google Translate API. 

For the civilian targets story, journalists used this bot, as well as The Times’s database of photos from wire journalists and its own photographers on the ground, to manually collect evidence of more than 1,500 attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure in Google Sheets, including at least 23 hospitals and other health structures, 330 schools, 27 cultural buildings, 98 commercial or food-related buildings and 900 homes. The reporting showed how, in just weeks, normal everyday life for many people in Ukraine was obliterated. The images, all evidence of potential war crimes, were cross-referenced with government and N.G.O. records, Google Street View and other websites in both English and Russian, to help pinpoint locations.

For the weapons story, journalists used the translation bot again to collect and examine more than 1,000 photos and videos from government sources, plus more from Times and wire journalists on the ground. The images often showed multiple weapons and journalists identified more than 200 cluster munitions, widely banned in many countries, and more than 2,000 unguided munitions, which can kill and maim indiscriminately. Hundreds were found in civilian areas — evidence of possible war crimes. These records were cross-referenced for verification. This sometimes involved locating landmarks, like statues or signs, and then matching them on Google Maps or in other public records, sometimes with help from Google Translate and a digital Russian keyboard.","Times developers faced technological hurdles in assembling the archive of official Ukrainian posts that provided much of the data underlying these two stories. Given the urgency of the situation, three software developers worked to understand the need, write integrations to Slack and Google Translate, and get the app deployed in the span of a day. The work resulted in a database of nearly a year of official social media posts in both Ukrainian and English, in a searchable format, unavailable elsewhere, which has helped both The Times's live and investigative coverage of the war. 

At the beginning of the invasion, a small team of journalists who had specialized in collecting, verifying and analyzing Covid and vaccine data quickly turned their attention to the war. This was an around-the-clock operation — similar to the early days of the New York Times Covid tracker — with team members working all day, including on nights and weekends. The translation bot brought in multiple posts per minute during busy periods in Ukraine, so it was important to figure out quickly which posts could be triaged and which were important to code into the database. The work needed to be done efficiently but meticulously, so a rigorous sourcing and fact-checking system was implemented immediately, requiring multiple sets of eyes on each image added to the database that eventually turned into the underlying system that powered the civilian targets story. 

To identify the make and model of each munition in the weapons story, a journalist who formerly worked as a Navy explosive ordnance disposal officer painstakingly used several public and private weapons databases to systematically categorize each munition. This included systematically checking each item for unique markings, identification numbers and relative size and then comparing it with photos and schematics of weapons listed in the databases. In collecting visual evidence, reporters tried to catalog multiple photos of the same weapon from different angles, if possible, in order to help identify them more clearly (and to prevent counting duplicates). In the end, the number of cluster weapons and unguided munitions the team identified are undercounts because some weapons did not have clear enough markings in order for the journalists to confidently identify them.","There is power (and speed) in having multiple journalists curate a dataset, but it is essential to establish a process to constantly check intercoder reliability (the extent to which multiple researchers agree on how to code the same content). The team members working on collecting this data worked remotely and it was crucial that communication was frequent and didn’t waste time. The team developed a system for quickly alerting each other and talking through sourcing and problems with a set of emojis. If a reporter saw a traffic cone on a post, that meant a teammate was working through the sourcing and others could avoid it. A big red “X” on a post meant it had been triaged. A checkmark on a post indicated that it was a duplicate. Emojis are often used for lighter purposes, but they were useful on this project as a way of visually encoding cues that everyone immediately understood.

That said, there is something to be gained by not being super efficient all the time. It is important to understand that even data journalism can cause trauma. Team members working on these stories spent weeks upon weeks examining photos and videos of the aftermath of often horrific attacks and then logging them into databases. Journalists found photos of families murdered in their cars, rockets crumpled in playgrounds and many other awful images. It was critical to continually remind the people working on these stories to take breaks or time off, if they needed to. The team also got into the habit of sharing more “hopeful” images they found with the whole group — this included a lot of photos of animals who had been rescued in Ukraine. 

These stories exist because of a unique mix of automatically scraped data and hand-curated data. Both were crucial.",English,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/03/23/world/europe/ukraine-civilian-attacks.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/19/world/europe/ukraine-munitions-war-crimes.html,,,,,,"Rachel Shorey, Andrew Fischer, Asmaa Elkeurti, Keith Collins, Danielle Ivory, Jon Huang, Yuliya Parshina-Kottas, Cierra S.

We were able to detect changes in sexism expressions and in terms related to feminism and gender. It puts meaning on positive change, but also contains the opinions of readers in different age groups and the views of educators in the field.","""A backward step is memorable, but progress is not noticeable. It's like an article that visualizes it.""
It was an impression that a reader left while posting an article on his SNS. It is memorable because it accurately grasped the message that was intended to be contained in the article. There was a long way to go, but many readers found meaning in tangible changes. Investigation methodology(https://url.kr/mj6efh) on the interactive page also received good reviews. 
When I asked readers through the Instagram account of Kyunghyang Shinmun's women's narrative archive team 'flat', ""How do you deal with the question 'Are you a femi(feminist)?',"" more than 140 answers were returned. The article in the second episode, which pointed out the misogyny in the classroom, also received many responses on SNS.","A crawler that we made using python libraries 'Beautiful Soup' and 'Selenium' browsered and gathered headlines from 10 daily newspapers in Korea over the past 10 years on news anlaysis system named 'Bigkinds'. 
In order to classify headlines about women and headlines about other topics, the study employed the use of the 'Khan Gender Classifier' model developed by Junbum Lee who trained Korean comments ELECTRA(KcELECTRA). The model we used is based on the Korean comments ELECTRA (KcELECTRA).
The article utilized Mecab-ko, a morphological analysis tool from the KoNLPy library, to identify the words that were frequently used in headlines about women. 
In order to determine whether headlines about women were more emotional than those about other topics, we conducted an emotional analysis. This analysis was performed using the 'Pororo' tool from kakaobrain, which is a natural language processing tool that can identify and quantify emotions in text.","Recent controversies surrounding hate crimes and discrimination against women, including cases such as ""Nth Room,"" ""Female Polices are Useless Theory,"" ""Seoul Station Assault,"" and the ""The controversy surrounding the short hair of Ansan who is an Archery athlete"" have brought attention. 'Gender conflicts' have become a significant source of division in South Korean society. Some political figures have used anti-feminist sentiment to rally supporters, the media expanded the conflicts by mass-producing unconfirmed rumors. The current social atmosphere has made it difficult to address and resolve issues of gender equality and stereotypes. Despite the fact that structural gender discrimination remains a reality in South Korean society, it is difficult to raise awareness about the issue and to initiate a conversation about it.
Despite the backlash, it is important to evaluate efforts to spread gender equality. By confirming the results of efforts for gender equality, we can confirm its direction and try to gauge the direction of gender equality in Korean society.","The development and advancement of machine learning technology has been widely adopted across various fields, but its application in the media industry in South Korea has been limited. This article shows the potential of using deep learning models and various morpheme analysis libraries for in-depth data analysis in media companies.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Participant,,Dolly Setton,2022-01-29,"Cross-border, Infographics, Chart, Audio, Arts, Culture","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Python",Analysed weekly top 100 music hits across 70 countries over five years to track the evolution of musical tastes and linguistic preferences. Built scrapers and web crawler to gather data; assessed musical kinship between countries using clustering model and Principal Componet Analysis. Determined that countries clustered into three groups: one in which the English language dominates; one where Spanish prevails; and a third cluster that mostly enjoys songs in local tongues. The analysis revealed that the hegemony of English is in decline. Innovative interactive matrix visualization allows readers to grasp international patterns and hear top songs from around the world.,"The story won a 2022 Information is Beautiful Silver Award, beating out hundreds of other entries. The winners are determined by a panel of experts and a public vote. Winning the award increased the story's visibility and also, by extension, its ability to inspire other journalists and engage members of the public.

When the story came out, it was one of The Economist's most popular in terms of reader views. It also enjoyed unusually high average engagement times. The story continues to periodically enjoy high view metrics even now, a year-and-a-half since the story first appeared.

My analysis revealed that fears that globalisation would lead to a worldwide musical monoculture dominated by English-language hits have proven wrong. In fact, local music culture is on the rise across the non-English world. That insight inspired one of my colleagues to examine this proposition for pop culture more broadly, in film, television and Tiktok. She wrote a piece in October 2022 called ""How pop culture went multipolar"" which extends my thesis to those realms, for which I contributed additional analysis based on my earlier work.","Data gathering:
I scraped weekly top 100 hits over five years across 70 countries from Spotify's website; artist nationalities from popnable; genres from SoundCharts and music lyrics from Musixmatch and GeniusLyrics. I used the following Python libraries: Selenium, Requests, Beautiful Soup, tqdm, json,Traceback and re. These are all tools that are useful in complex scraping projects. Tqdm, for example, estimates how long it takes for code to run and provides a progress bar; Traceback offers insight into errors; Selenium automates web browsers. 

I also implemented an automated translation process using a library called googletrans that runs on Google Translate to determine lyrics languages. 

Analysis:
I used a technique called Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of my data. I then performed a clustering analysis using a machine learning algorithm called K-means to gain insight into musical similarities between the countries over this time period. Other python libraries used were StandardScaler, pandas and numpy, all foundational to data analysis and machine learning. 

To make data visualizations to help gain insight into my data, I used matplotlib and seabor. I also used bootstrap sampling to estimate language identification error rates and maks sure they were minimal.","It was time-consuming and complex to gather and clean this data given that over 300,000 records and many languages were involved. Lyrics take far longer to scrape than numbers; copyright issues precluded music lyrics APIs from posting enough lyrics or their search engines were overspecified; and there were various nuances that needed to be recognized to make sure the data was properly cleaned (e.g. songs with identical titles and artists might be in different lanaguages). 

Developing a webcrawler that prioritized two lyrics sources was my solution to the API limitations. Also, given the number of server requests, I had to get around blocks to my scrapers. 
I did a bootstrap error rate analysis to help refine my approach.","It's worthwhile to create original datasets to gain unique insights. Gaining expertises in tools beyond Excel and algorithms beyond regression can also open up new possibilities and perspectives, and help maintain long-term engagement by readers with your work.

Data visualization is valuable in making work engaging and accessible, as is choosing a ""fun"" topic like music or connecting to a larger theme like globalization.",English,https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2022/01/29/what-spotify-data-show-about-the-decline-of-english,,,,,,,"Dolly Setton, Olivia Vane, Rosamund Pearce, Idrees Kahloon","Dolly Setton - Data journalist with The Economist.

And more often than not, people are to blame. In taking over natural habitats, polluting pristine environments and fueling climate change, humans have unleashed what scientists consider a sixth mass extinction event – with some 1 million species on the brink. A U.N. conservation deal reached in December 2022 could start reversing the wilderness decline and help species to survive.

Prior to the U.N. biodiversity summit, Reuters used data, illustration and graphics to explain what was happening across some of the main biodiversity themes in a series of four visual stories.",The projects were instantly picked up and praised by the scientific community as well as readers. The projects were the most compelling and in-depth look at the state of biodiversity during the COP15 summit.,"All four pieces used a mix of data, visual information, words and beautiful illustration to tell the story. 

More than a hundred insects were illustrated and scaled to relative size to each other in order to connect with the reader and bring the important issue to life. Some were even animated using SVG and javascript. A careful balance of data visualisation, using D3 and Adobe’s creative suite, and text accompany the illustrations to explain the collapse of insect populations.

Beautiful illustration and visual storytelling are also at the heart of the plant stories as well as the extinction piece.","Accurately illustrating extremely rare plants was definitely a challenge. Our illustrator visited the remote cliffs of Hawaii in order to get a closer look at the plants as well as the drone equipment used. The conservation data and plant counts that were used in the graphic came from working directly with the scientists on site. 

The biggest challenge was making the stories come to life and engage readers while also providing enough accurate scientific context and data to explain the issues faced.","The design and feel of each piece should reflect the tone and subject matter. The art direction and design of a data project can help to engage the reader.

This graphics story brings together data visualization and on-the ground reporting to show how this phenomenon is gradually but irreversibly reshaping the lives of millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the river.","Scientists and environmental activists have for decades raised alarm over the main culprit behind diminishing sediment – upstream hydropower dams. Now, Reuters provides fresh evidence that the cascading sediment-trapping effect of these dams has far-reaching consequences downstream and is leaving millions with no choice but to adapt to the environmental changes forced on them.

The project was picked up and praised on social media by the scientific community as well as readers.","The analysis relied on measurements of turbidity depicted in satellite images – the amount of light scattered by solid particles suspended in water – as a proxy for sediment levels. Sediment clouds the water as it is carried along by the current: the muddier the water, the higher the turbidity and the more sediment it is likely carrying. Thousands of images were analysed.

The satellite images for the Mekong analysis date back to the 1990s, which “allows us to calculate turbidity levels before many of the dams were built,” said EOMAP data analyst Philipp Bauer.

After discarding images obscured by cloud cover or pollution, the team was left with 1,500 images depicting the turbidity around two dams in China and two in Laos. Scientists not involved in conducting the analysis agreed that the findings made clear that the dams were a key culprit behind the delta’s sediment loss.

Much of the mapping and analysis was conducted in QGIS. Python was used to process large batches of data. Lottie library as well as javascript was used for animation and interactivity. Adobe’s creative suite was used for much of the final styling of graphics.","The project began following a conversation with EOMAP about the technology they use to detect turbidity in water bodies. This led to a collaboration which explored multiple areas of the Mekong and took many months of research before any analysis and production began.

This was one of the most ambitious data exercises carried out on the Mekong. One challenge was refining the data and determining how to present the findings. 

The team also made efforts to visit those who are living on the banks of the river and add strong traditional reporting to back up the data extracted from satellites",There can often be innovative ways to acquire data if a public dataset does not exist.

Большинство матерей в отдельных интервью жалуются, что им приходится по много месяцев стоять в очереди, чтобы их детей приняли в дошкольные учреждения. Причиной всего этого является нехватка детских садов.
Даже по исследованиям Всемирного банка, многие сады даже в сельской местности переполнены и у детей нет возможности их посещать.","Одна из вещей, которую случитя с каждый журналист, — это оказывать давление власти через телефонных звонков. Мне звонили из нескольких районов и угрожали, что у них есть садик и мои цифры неправильные, после того, как я сказала, что запишу все ваши слова и передам в СМИ, пообещали, что в ближайшие годы построят садик для детей .

В регионах ситуация намного хуже: в Согде дошкольным образованием охвачены 16% детей, а в РРП и Хатлоне лишь 10%. В целом по Таджикистану этот показатель в районе 7%.
Вы сами смотрите, что всего 10% детей Хатлона и 7% РРП охвачены дошкольным образованием. Эти цифры несколько разнятся с данным ЮНИСЕФ, так согласно их докладу о дошкольном образовании (январь 2021 года) в Таджикистане, детские сады охватывают 16% детей страны в возрасте от 3 до 6 лет.

Reuters visualised and mapped how the lightning strikes were dispersed across the island skirting the Tonga capital of Nuku'alofa, situated only 65 km (40 miles) south of the eruption.

GIF","The Shrinking Lakes cross-border investigation is the result of the collaboration of 12 journalists from East Africa. The multimedia project was produced by an international team of journalists, designers and data experts from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Rwanda and it took over two years. It contains original data analysis and field reporting on threats to biodiversity in lakes across East Africa due to climate change and human activities. In general, it finds that many East African lakes are slowly receding, reducing in depth and drying up, impacting the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on water and fish.","The Shrinking Lakes multimedia project combines 9 stories commissioned and edited by InfoNile that were published in top media outlets across Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda over 2 years. The stories looked at the impact of oil drilling on Lake Albert in northern Uganda; Lake Wamala and how traditional spiritual practices influence conservation in central Uganda; the endangered Jipe Tilapia fish in a small lake that straddles Kenya and Tanzania; the threats facing Lake Nakuru and its famous flamingo population in Kenya; Lake Manyara, a lake that is drying up in Tanzania; how refugees are conserving Lake Nakivale in western Uganda; and the scientific factors that hinder the development of fisheries in Rwanda. The media outlets that published the stories have a daily circulation of about 35,000 - 50,000. The InfoNile multimedia cross-border story got about 2,000 views and the videos got 9,300 views.

According to the journalists, after the Rwanda story was published, “there was surprise on social media and radio talk shows that the country was buying fish from China yet it has many water bodies… The story raised the issue of overfishing as one of biggest causes of the loss of small fish. The government immediately began implementing the fish net rules as stipulated in an existing law.” The story on Lake Wamala helped the journalist gain a speaking opportunity at the Africa Investigative Journalism Conference in Nairobi and the Global Journalism Investigative Conference. The story on pollution of Lake Yirol, South Sudan inspired a reaction from a government official who was interviewed on a radio talk show and committed to protecting biodiversity and supporting civil society in this regard. The story of the drying-up Lake Manyara in Tanzania, published on Tanzania’s biggest daily newspaper, inspired “re-enforcement of by laws and prohibition of human activities near the lake.”","Five data wranglers from InfoNile and our partner organisation, Code for Africa, produced original data visualisations for the stories. These visualisations were integrated in the individual stories published on the journalists' media houses as well as the final InfoNile cross-border story.

17 maps and interactive data visualisations were included in the final cross-border project, many of which look at fish populations over time and the status of threats to the lakes, including growing human populations and climate change. The data was sourced from fisheries departments, government reports and ministries, as well as downloaded and analysed from the Uganda Freshwater Biodiversity Portal, which aggregates hundreds of datasets on fish occurrences. The story also includes a series of original artwork depicting traditional scenes of fishing in East Africa. It also included original graphics depicting scientific processes that affect freshwater biodiversity. Satellite images were used to show the changing size of Lake Wamala, and 6 original short video documentaries are embedded. Drone images provide a unique perspective to the environmental threats to these lakes.

All of the journalists who contributed to the story were given a spot in a 3-month InfoNile/Code for Africa’s annual data journalism training and mentorship program, where they went through a series of trainings and small-group mentorship sessions to learn the basics of data journalism and visualisation. The journalists also received individual mentorship, editing and data visualization support by InfoNile and Code for Africa as they reported their stories.","InfoNile and Water Journalists Africa exist to increase awareness and action on transboundary water and environmental issues through the media in Africa. While water and environmental crises are increasing across Africa, there is poor media coverage of these issues due to a focus on politics and entertainment, which are thought to bring in more revenue in low-resource settings. Compounding issues that lead to a lack of environmental reporting in the region include nationalistic reporting on water issues, low resources at African media houses for in-depth stories, a skills and knowledge gap in data and science journalism, challenges accessing high-quality open data, and a disconnect between journalists and scientists. 

These are the reasons that inform our model of supporting journalists: providing them with small story grants to facilitate them with resources to do in-depth field reporting on environmental issues; mentoring and training journalists in data and science journalism as they produce their stories; providing comprehensive editing and data visualisation for all stories; and producing cross-border stories that show the same issue across multiple countries (which reduces nationalistic views on water issues). As we collect and scrape data (often from PDFs) for the stories, we also upload it on openAFRICA.org, a platform run by Code for Africa, to enable more journalists to access and use water and environmental data from the region.

To address the gap between journalists and scientists, in 2022, we launched NileWell (https://nilewell.org/), a new platform to connect journalists with water and environmental scientists in the Nile Basin. 

The Shrinking Lakes cross-border project was launched as a NileWell public webinar on 1st September, 2022, where scientists and journalists who contributed to the project were invited to speak and share insights from their research and reporting. 149 people, mostly journalists from the region, registered for the event. Such events have been shown to increase journalists' interest in reporting about water and environmental issues and help them create linkages with scientists conducting research on these topics for follow-up reporting.","Journalists can learn how to conduct data-driven reporting that is accessible to any reporter working in Africa: identifying good sources for data and scientific studies on water issues in East Africa, learning from our analysis to determine trends in dta over various periods of time, and producing simple charts, maps and graphics using Flourish.studio online data visualisation software. Journalists can also learn how to integrate conclusions from data analysis alongside rigorous field reporting and information from scientists and experts. Thirdly, journalists can learn how to conduct cross-border and collaborative reporting to produce a bigger multimedia story with insights from reporters in multiple countries. An important part of collaborations is establishing partnerships between different media houses to cross-publish stories to reach a bigger audience. Also, translating and publishing stories in local languages is important to reach people who are affected by the issues presented.
 
Journalists can also learn how to merge solutions-based reporting with investigative and data-driven journalism. Although the project generally found concerning trends on shrinking and degraded lakes in East Africa, some of the stories in the project were solutions based, highlighting local models that have proven beneficial to conserving lakes. For example, the story on Lake Nakivale in western Uganda highlighted an approach driven by refugees in the area that is effectively conserving the lake. The Lake Wamala video also showed how fishermen in Lake Wamala, Uganda had successfully changed fishing approaches in order to conserve this lake. Merging such solutions stories with critical analysis on the overall negative trend provides in-depth information on some working models that can inspire readers as well as give them ideas for effective models to replicate in other areas.","English, Swahili, French, Kinyarwanda",https://infonile.org/en/shrinking-lakes/,https://www.chronicles.rw/2021/08/23/rwanda-the-fish-less-country/3/,https://www.independent.co.ug/saving-lake-wamala/,https://infonile.org/en/2022/03/climate-change-exacerbates-flooding-in-lake-nakuru-kenya/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cB4-Sb1JRpp8jn8a_p21RMzZUkEkKwif/view,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGH40-65-MQ,https://www.newvision.co.ug/news/1529585/refugees-idea-restore-degraded-ugandan-lake-pays,"Annika McGinnis, Fredrick Mugira, Janet Njunge, Nuru Saadun, Fred Mwasa, Sylidio Sebuharara, Andrew Aijuka, Cliff Abenaitwe, Kajumba Godfrey, Megan Lee, Ronald Musoke, Jacopo Ottaviani, Emma Kisa, Tricia Govindasamy, Sakina Salem, Ruth Mwizeere, Jonathan Kabugo, Mukalele Rogers, Delicate Sive, Curity Ogada, Alis Okonji, Christine Kandeo","InfoNile is a geojournalism platform and cross-border network of more than 800 environmental journalists working in 10 countries of the Nile Basin in East and Northeast Africa.

An important point of the material is that the government, spending large sums, uses the media for propaganda and denigration of opponents. The study focuses on the number of state-owned media outlets, the cost of maintaining them, and the state of freedom of speech. In addition, the material contains the opinions of deputies, experts and responsible persons. And the results of international studies reporting on the deterioration of the situation with freedom of speech in countries with a large number of state-owned media.","After publication, our material was reprinted by other media, such as “Kloop”, ""Bulak.kg"". Under the material, readers left comments about the need to reform the state-owned media. In addition, readers questioned the need to fund so many media outlets. After the publication of the material, the fact-checkers found out that in one of the major channels the funds were used inefficiently.","To obtain information on the number of state-owned media outlets and spending on them from the budget, we sent inquiries to the Ministry of Culture, Information, Youth and Sports and the Ministry of Finance. However, they did not respond to our requests within the time frame and we had to wait over 2 months to get the information.

In preparing this material, we used tools such as Google Sheets, a tool for visualizations Flourish. The main techniques for preparing the material were data analysis and content analysis. Since our editorial office is small, we use ready-made services for visualizations.","Great political changes are taking place in Kyrgyzstan. And information plays a big role in these changes. The government, allocating large funds, uses state-owned media as a propaganda tool. Using the power of the state, these media often disseminate false information and slander non-governmental organizations. There have been many cases of independent journalists exposing lies or misrepresentations by state media through fact-checking. On the other hand, in the material we draw attention to the large funds allocated annually and compare them with the internal debt of the state. The topic of public debt is acutely perceived by society. People are annoyed that the government, instead of using this money to solve social problems or pay off debts, spends it on supporting state media.
In addition, a complete list of state media cannot be found in the public domain. It must be requested from the responsible ministries, which may not respond to the request or not respond in time.","Our material is considered unique in the country. Because before us, no one has done such a study. The data that we used in the material is not in the public domain, so our material has become a good archive.

При этом растет количество случаев заражения ВИЧ половым путем.",После моей статьи нескольким женщинам с ВИЧ помогли организации.,"Google sheets, adobe illustrator и excel","Самый неочиведно втом, что в Таджикистане арестованы женщины за передачу вируса партнеру. 

В сентябре текущего года, Общественная организация «СПИН ПЛЮС» обратилась в офис главы представительства ВОЗ (Всемирная организация здравоохранения) в Республике Таджикистан с запросом дать экспертное заключение/мнение о возможности/невозможности передачи ВИЧ при половом контакте в случае, когда один из партнеров принимает АРВ терапию и имеет неопределяемую вирусную нагрузку.

Запрос был направлен в связи, с вошедшей в обычную практику правоохранительных органов, преследования и осуждения людей, живущих с ВИЧ как «угрозу» в передаче вируса партнеру.

Автором данного запроса является Пулод Джамолов, руководитель ОО «СПИН Плюс». В конце октября был получен официальный ответ от представительства офиса ВОЗ в Таджикистане. 

По мнению экспертов, часть 1 Статьи 125, Уголовный Кодекс РТ каждого ВИЧ-позитивного гражданина потенциально рассматривает как преступника, а не человека, нуждающегося в поддержке государства. По информации Минздрава РТ в стране проживает более 14 тыс. людей с вирусом иммунодефицита человека (ВИЧ).

9 ноября 2018 года, комитет ООН по ликвидации дискриминации в отношении женщин (CEDOW) опубликовал рекомендации в адрес Таджикистана, отметив наличие ряда барьеров в доступе к здравоохранению, которые приводят к стремительному распространению ВИЧ.

Так, в пункте 40 содержится рекомендация по декриминализации ВИЧ – полной отмене статьи 125 Уголовного кодекса РТ. В том же 2018 году было возбуждено 33 уголовных дела в отношении 26 ВИЧ-позитивных людей, а в 2019 году к этому числу прибавилось еще, как минимум, 6 дел. Эти данные озвучил прокурор Худжанда Хабибулло Вохидов на координационном совете правоохранительных органов, 2 мая прошлого года.

По неофициальным данным, с 2019 года к уголовной ответственности привлечено более 300 человек. С 2021 по 2022 год правозащитники “Таджикистанской сети женщин, живущих с ВИЧ» уже защищали 10 женщин, которые имеют такие кейсы.

По словам Тахмины Хайдаровой, директора “Таджикистанской сети женщин, живущих с ВИЧ”, когда они начали работать в этой сфере, увидели, что из всех женщин, которые обращаются к ним за помощью, не было случая заражения своего партнёра. «У женщин, которых мы сопровождали, были связи, половые контакты с людьми, которые не знали о диагнозе своих партнерш. Но никто из партнеров этих женщин не был инфицировае. В социальном значении женщины из уязвимых групп – это женщины, которые экономически зависимы от других членов семьи, это женщины, которые во многом нуждаются, не владеют достаточным уровнем знаний, не имеют образования и постоянную работу. В отношении таких женщин открываются уголовные дела по статье 125 части первой, — считает она.

Тахмина говорит: “если посмотреть на закон с точки зрения международных норм, тут обозначаются дискриминационные действия в отношении людей, живущих с ВИЧ. Во время судебных процессов не учитывается использование презерватива, устное согласие половых партнеров, нулевая вирусная нагрузка, приверженность к АРВ-терапии. Такие моменты не учитываются. Если ты ВИЧ-позитивная, ты не поставила в известность своего партнера и вступила с ним в половой контакт, тогда отвечай по законодательным нормам. Тебя будут судить"".

Эксперты говорят, что люди, у которых есть вероятность инфицироваться ВИЧ, не будут обращаться в медицинские службы, из-за страха, что об этом узнают третьи лица, органы. Они боятся попасть под статью 125. 
Пожалуйста, смотрите мой подготовленный материал по этой ссылке,

всю эту информацию я взяла и подготовил в виде инфографики.","Эксперты считают, что иногда именно журналисты являются причиной их задержания. 
По словам Тахмина Хайдарова – директор Таджикистанской сети женщин, живущих с ВИЧ (TNW Plus), жительница Шахритузского района была приговорена к 1 годам лишения свободы после публикации материалов под названием «ВИЧ-террор в Шахритузе» или «Женщина заразила как минимум 10 
мужчин».
 
Жительница Шахритузского района была задержана в апреле прошлом году в ходе правоохранительной операции. Её дело было рассмотрено в соответствии со статьей 125 Уголовного кодекса Таджикистана, что означает «заражение двух или более людей с ВИЧ», что предусматривает от пяти до 10 лет лишения свободы.
И в июле прошлом году Суд Шахритузского района приговорил А. З. «секс-работницу, заразившую ВИЧ-инфекцией 10 мужчин», к одному году лишения свободы.

О ней было написано много газет и сайтов, но ни у одного из них не было мнения представитель Республиканский центр по профилактике и борьбе с СПИДа или Таджикистанской сети женщин, живущих с ВИЧ (TNW Plus). Статья содержала только мнения прокурора, судьи и полиции.

Я приведу пример здесь:

Осужденной 30 лет, у нее двое детей. После развода она стала заниматься коммерческим сексом и с 2014 года состоит на учете местного центра по борьбе с ВИЧ/СПИД. Несмотря на выявление ВИЧ, она продолжала предоставлять интимные услуги. Некоторые ее клиенты были установлены по звонкам и сообщениям на ее телефон. Среди клиентов жрицы любви были в основном молодые неженатые парни и несколько семейных мужчин. Все они – жители Шахритузского района.

На самом деле, бывают случаи, когда вместо помощи ВИЧ-инфицированным, журналисты создают ненависти в отношении людей, живущих с ВИЧ.

Мы журналисты должны подготовить материалы, так, чтобы других людей знали, что ВИЧ-инфекция перестала быт смертельным заболеванием.

Журналисты должны подготовить статью, чтобы других людей помогали лечить пациентов с ВИЧ, а не относиться к ним с презрением.

К сожалению, я вижу много недостатков в статьях своих коллег по подготовке к ВИЧ.",Russian,https://vecherka.tj/archives/55616,,,,,,,Я автор Мижгона Халимова,"Меня зовут Мижгона Халимова.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Participant,,War in Ukraine: When Russian artillery falls silent,2022-08-08,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Map, Satellite images, Politics","QGIS, CSV, R, RStudio","This article from Süddeutsche Zeitung, published in August 2022, uses satellite data from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) to analyze the intensity of Russian artillery attacks in the ongoing war in Ukraine. The data shows that the intensity of attacks has decreased in recent weeks and that Russian forces have even lost ground in the south. The article also raises questions about whether the Russian army is capable of continuing their offensive and what the satellite data can reveal about the situation on the front.","The project from Sueddeutsche Zeitung on the war in Ukraine has had a significant impact on the audience and community. By using satellite data from NASA, the article was able to show that Russian attacks in the Donbass have decreased in intensity, providing a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the situation. This unique approach in data journalism has helped to educate the public on the potential uses of satellite data in conflict reporting and has received praise from many journalists for its in-depth analysis. The project has been able to provide a more accurate picture of the situation, rather than relying on emotive language and sensationalism, and has helped to inform the public about the complexity of the issue. Overall, the project has made a difference by providing a new perspective on the war in Ukraine and has helped to raise awareness and understanding of the conflict.","The project used various tools, techniques and technologies to analyze and present the data. Firstly, we used satellite data from NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) to map the intensity of the artillery attacks in the war in Ukraine. The data was then cleaned and analyzed in R, a programming language commonly used for data analysis and visualization. Additionally, we also used GIS software to create maps and visualizations of the data. These tools and techniques were used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground and to present this information in a clear and concise manner to our audience. The use of satellite data and data analysis in R allowed us to provide a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the war in Ukraine than would have been possible with traditional reporting methods alone.","One of the key aspects of the project is the use of simple, publicly available, open source data to provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of the complex Russian invasion in Ukraine. It's worth mentioning that the main objective of this article is to show that with publicly available and open source data it is possible to create a simple but powerful visual representation of a complex subject such as a war. The twitter thread https://twitter.com/marius_saeltzer/status/1556993329857961985 praised the article's dataviz for its ability to clearly tell a story, its dimensional reduction, and its intuitive scales, comparing it to what Edward Tufte called the greatest graphic ever. The context of the project is important for understanding the challenges and considerations that went into the creation of the article.","Other journalists can learn from this project that simple, publicly available, open source data can be used to explain complex issues like war and invasion. The use of data visualization can also be an effective way to communicate the information to the audience. The article uses the data from Nasa's Fire Information for Resource Management System to present the intensity of the Russian artillery's impact on the cities and towns in the war-affected areas of Ukraine. The data was analyzed and cleaned in R, and the final visualization was able to provide a detailed and nuanced understanding of the situation in Ukraine.

South Korea,"KBS, Korean Broadcasting System",Big,Participant,,Ending the Vicious Cycle of the Child Abuse,2022-02-06,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Documentary, Open data, Human rights","JQuery, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, R","This investigative report aims to raise awareness about child abuse and call for institutional change.

The reporters attempted a kind of ‘social autopsy’ on child abuse crimes. We wanted to discover why child abuse crimes are repeated through an accurate diagnosis of the phenomenon, as you would a physical autopsy when searching for the cause of death. 

1,406 first-instance criminal judgments related to child abuse were collected from July 2019 to July 2021 via the Internet reading service of the Supreme Court rulings. Based on this, we analyzed all available records, which consisted of 2,367 victims and 1,406 perpetrators.","We are the first in Korea to conduct a comprehensive analysis to identify the reality of child abuse crimes hidden in statistical figures. In addition, all the child abuse cases covered in the report have been disclosed for the first time.

The reporters obtained over 1,400 first-instance criminal judgments from courts across the country over the past two years related to child abuse and analyzed the records of 2,367 victims and 1,406 perpetrators. Three keywords came out as a result.

The first is ‘hidden.’ Most child abuse perpetrators were family members or guardians such as schoolteachers. The location of the crime was particularly high in residential areas. The greater the damage, such as a child being injured or killed, the more it took place in a residential area. Child abuse was structurally difficult to discover from the outside.

The second is ‘excuse.’ In the rulings, perpetrators gave 1,152 reasons for their abuse. 8 out of 10 claimed that children’s trivial words and actions were the cause. Experts point out that these were excuses made by abusive parents and guardians.

The last is the ‘rescue signal.’ Result of a separate analysis of 55 severe damage cases, such as serious injury and death, revealed suspicious signs, such as the perpetrator’s history of abuse or the victim’s old wounds. Experts emphasize that people must pay close attention to discovering children’s rescue signals.","Korea discloses the verdicts of civil and criminal cases in which actual sentences have been confirmed on the Internet through a service. Using this service, we secured 1,406 first-trial criminal rulings for child abuse sentenced in the last two years with the keywords’ child’ and ‘abuse.’

The reporters built a database based on the contents of the rulings. First, it was typed in Excel to be categorized for data analysis. The 20 or so classification criteria for categorization include perpetrator-victim relationship, punishment, type of abuse, duration of abuse, age and gender of the victim child, degree of damage, and reason for sentencing. 

Since the reporters read the rulings one by one, minor errors may have occurred in transferring the contents of the rulings to a Word document. However, no errors were overseen during the statistical data analysis based on the transferred data. Accordingly, the reporters cross-checked the contents over three months to see if there were any incorrect items or contents. The rulings were also rechecked more than five times.

In the process of analyzing the child abuse verdict, various experts such as child human rights lawyers, social welfare professors, members of child protection agencies, and Save the Children were consulted. We studied the correlation between the sentencing in the rulings and the crime facts, abuse type, abuse duration, and the reasons for sentencing. We identified the attitudes of judges in adjudicating cases of abuse and trends in sentencing.

Among the data analysis and field coverage results, we included some of the representative content in productions such as documentaries and broadcast news. An interactive news page and a data archive page were newly built and organized for more detailed information. In this process, we used Excel, word cloud, R, html5/css3, jquery, and javascript for data visualization and website creation.","We also uncovered hidden child abuse cases unknown to the public, holding our society and the state responsible for these happenings. The death in a dance academy in Tongyeong, South Gyeongsang-do, and the death of a 16-month-old infant in Dangjin, South Chungcheong-do, are prime examples. 

Our in-depth coverage period lasted for more than three months and was conducted through various sources of information, such as the victim’s children and the police in charge of their cases. We also obtained exclusive material, such as prosecution investigation data and NFS autopsy data, to investigate the issue. In addition, we accused our society’s indifference for repeatedly ignoring the rescue signals sent by children, the negligence of duty-reporters, and the state’s insensitivity.

Furthermore, through overseas coverage, we criticized the passivity of domestic child abuse prevention. We pointed out that, unlike the United States, which reformed the overall child protection system through a national fact-finding investigation into child abuse and death cases, Korea has not conducted a single national fact-finding investigation despite the proposal of related laws. In addition, we gained exclusive access to the national fact-finding report of the United States. We studied the above to provide concrete solutions to child abuse, including social welfare promotion, perpetrator education to prevent recurrences, strengthening social duty to report child abuse, securing facilities and human resources to protect child victims, and expanding the government’s child abuse budget.

Like all journalists, the KBS Special coverage team poured their hearts into this more than ever. It was because this report covered dead or injured children.

The coverage team was engulfed in many worries as they faced the horrid scenes of the incidents, met the victims, and listened to their earnest appeals. If we wanted to get ‘viewership’ by conveying these events and voices in a very raw way, there were infinite ways of doing so. We considered this, as we thought if the coverage gains the spotlight by showing provocative and violent content, people’s interest could help raise awareness about child abuse crimes.

However, the reporting team decided to preserve the dignity of journalism. Provocative and violent scenes or stories out of line were intentionally excluded from the article’s content. We portrayed stories objectively and dryly as much as we could rather than appealing to the viewers in an emotional and stirring way. A desperate story, or a story of good and evil, is great for attracting attention, but its fatal flaw is that it taints the purpose of the story being told in the first place.

The reporters hope that the stories told in this project will remain in viewers’ hearts for a long time, even if they are a little less intense than others.","This investigative report aims to raise awareness about child abuse and call for institutional change. We focus on proposing systematic problems and their solutions rather than providing a sketch or fragmentary coverage that mainly deals with stirring or provocative content.

In response, we decided to break the custom of the Korean media that does not disclose the coverage data and organize and disclose the ruling data analyzed over several months. This is because we hope that the materials used in the report will be used in various ways in Korean society and the media.

Already, our coverage materials are being used everywhere. A research team led by Jeong Ik-joong, a professor at the Department of Social Welfare at Ewha Woman’s University, who has studied the issue of child abuse for a long time, wrote a research paper on ‘reasons for sentencing’ based on the results of the ruling analyzed by KBS reporters. It was published in issue 131 (2022) of ‘Criminal Policy Research.’ A research team led by Professor Lee Soo-jeong of the Department of Criminal Psychology at Kyonggi University also wrote a thesis in line with the “Criminal Psychology of Abuse Perpetrators.”

The interest of national institutions was also hot. The National Institute of Scientific Investigation prepared a research report on child abuse and death cases along with the results of the KBS reporters’ rulings analysis. The Seoul Metropolitan Government Child Abuse Response Team is also establishing preventive measures to eradicate child abuse based on the reporters’ coverage. The civic group “Political Mothers” also shared the contents of the broadcast and voiced the need to pass a special law on child abuse fact-finding at the national level.

France,"Groupe mind, mind Media",Small,Participant,,Which French media websites use Google Analytics ?,2022-11-25,"Investigation, Chart, Business","Scraping, Google Sheets, Python","The current configuration of the Google Analytics web page traffic measurement tool was officially deemed contrary to the GDPR by the French data protection authority early 2022. In the fall of 2022, the mind Group's datajournalism unit and mind Media's editorial staff wanted to know to what extent Google's tool is still used by French media and e-commerce publishers. 

To do this, we developed a crawler that automatically visits 450+ home pages, clicks on the ""Accept"" button of the CMP, and then checks the HTTP requests to see if the call corresponding to each of the tools has been triggered.","We were able to show that among the sites using Google Analytics, 45.4% use it in its ""Universal Analytics"" (UA) configuration, which is considered non-compliant by the CNIL. 9.6% use it only in its Google Analytics 4 version, which has not yet been approved by the CNIL. 45% combine both versions of the tool. 

This work, which has been widely consulted and praised by digital professionals in France, has shed light on the market's practices and contributed to an awareness of the issues.","To determine if a site uses Google Analytics (GA) or not, we developed with Python and the Selenium library, a crawler that automatically visits the homepage of the sites in our panel. This script presses the ""Accept"" button of their CMP, then checks in the network requests if a JavaScript call ""analytics.js"" is triggered. Indeed, in order for their GA interface to display their traffic data, sites configured before August 2017 had to have previously installed a piece of code (or ""tag"") on each of their pages.
The presence of this ""analytics.js"" tag alone, however, does not mean that the tool is active. The site may have stopped using it without removing the tag from its pages. To make sure it is active, we looked for the ""collect"" parameter in Google Analytics queries (google-analytics.com, analytics.google.com, region1.google-analytics.com for Google Analytics 4, etc.). When ""collect?v=1"" appears, the site uses Universal Analytics. 
When ""collect?v=2"" appears in the queries, then the site publisher uses Google Analytics 4. Both versions of the tool can be used at the same time. Google Analytics 4 no longer requires the installation of the JavaScript tag ""analytics.js"".
Limitations
Several biases are possible. When sites have opted for a solution hosted on the server side, when they use the proxyfication process (use of a proxy server to avoid any direct contact between the user's terminal and the servers of the measurement tool, or when they use a delegation of subdomain to a third party via a redirection (or ""CNAME cloaking""), the identification of a solution may be more complex, and this one may have escaped us. In addition, some sites implement specific configurations of their tools, which make their solution undetectable to our network query-based method.","In opaque sectors (finance, health, digital adverstising...), where our journalists sometimes find it difficult to get around the communication wall put up by the companies they are investigating, we are particularly specialized in identifying the relationships between technology companies and their clients (media publishers, banks, retailers, e-commerce sites, pharmaceutical laboratories, etc.), thanks to the digital traces that each of them leaves on the Internet (cookies / HTTP requests, SDKs, ads.txt and sellers.json files, etc.)",This project can help other journalists to take advantage of the information available in the HTTP requests of a website.,French,https://www.mindmedia.fr/medias-audiovisuel/65-des-editeurs-de-sites-francais-utilisent-google-analytics/,https://www.mindmedia.fr/adtechs-martechs/etude-mind-media-google-analytics-quelles-sont-les-alternatives-utilisees-par-les-editeurs-de-sites-francais/,,,,,,"Sara Chaouki, Paul Roy, Aymeric Marolleau","Sara Chaouki is datajournalist at Group mind since September 2020.

Cameroon,The MUSEBA Project,Small,Participant,,"Bois de rose : volé au Cameroun, blanchi au Nigeria, expédié en Chine",2022-01-28,"Investigation, Cross-border, Open data, Infographics, Map, Satellite images, Audio, Corruption, Crime",Animation,"Ces dernières années, des operateurs chinois à la recherche du bois de rose (Pterocarpus erinaceus) pour la fabrication des meubles de luxe se sont associés à des trafiquants locaux pour piller les forêts nigérianes. 
Comme le bois de rose se raréfie dans les forêts nigérianes, des trafiquants, voulant continuer à satisfaire les demandes des Chinois coupent sans autorisation le bois de rose au Cameroun voisin en versant des pots-de-vin aux chefs traditionnels et fonctionnaires camerounais. Dès que le bois est sorti du Cameroun, ces trafiquants corrompent des autorités nigerianes pour changer l'origine du bois frauduleux avant son exportation en Chine.","Après la publication de cette investigation, la Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) a suspendu le commerce du bois de rose au Cameroun, comme vous pouvez le lire via ce lien: https://www.themusebaproject.org/impact/cites-suspends-cameroon-rosewood-trafficking/

Actuellement, une délégation du CITES travaille avec le gouvernement camerounais pour s'assurer que les mesures de protection du bois de rose sont efficaces sur le terrain avant de voir comment éventuellement lever la suspension, selon une de mes sources au ministère des forêts. ""La réglementation sera plus dure contre les trafiquants locaux ou étrangers"", a déclaré cette source.

Cette investigation a également eu un impact sur les communautés. Des comités de vigilance de la forêt, constitués notamment de jeunes, ont été mis en place dans plusieurs villages. Ces comités de vigilance ont sensibilisé des chefs traditionnels qui prenaient de l'argent pour donner accès à la forêt aux trafiquants. Et ces comités font un travail de gardiennage. Par exemple, des journalistes travaillant pour la chaine de télévision turque (TRT) qui voulaient enquêter après mon investigation ont témoigné de la rigueur de ces comités de vigilance qui tenaient à savoir les motivations de cette présence.

Un autre impact important de cette investigation a été mon invitation à deux événements internationaux pour parler du trafic de bois de rose. D'abord en Octobre 2022 au festival Double Exposure à Washington aux Etats Unis, puis en Novembre à Johannesburg en Afrique du Sud où j'ai fait un exposé lors de la récente conférence africaine des journalistes d'investigation.","Cette investigation s'est déroulée au Cameroun et au Nigeria pendant plusieurs mois. J'ai utilisé plusieurs techniques de collecte et de présentation de l'information. D'abord, j'ai fait des interviews et pris des images des communautés affectées au Cameroun y compris un témoignage audio d'un garde forestier condamné à des années de prison pour avoir aidé des trafiquants nigérians à se procurer du bois de rose. A ce niveau, j'ai aussi utilisé le GPS, googlemap, google street view pour la localisation exacte dans ces zones de forêt. A la frontière entre les deux pays, on retrouve des localités portant le même nom et il devient difficile de se repérer; c'est grâce à ces outils de précision que j'ai pu obtenir les données exactes. 
Ensuite, j'ai utilisé la technique d'infiltration (undercover) pour rencontrer les trafiquants de bois de rose ainsi que leurs complices chinois, car ils étaient méfiants et ne faisaient pas confiance aux journalistes. D'ailleurs, un journaliste nigérian qui a été mon fixeur pendant a essayé d'approcher les trafiquants en se présentant comme journaliste, il a été repoussé. Il fallait que je change de stratégie pour arriver au résultat escompté. Aussi, ce journaliste fixeur me servait de guide, il traduisait en anglais les propos des trafiquants qui ne parlaient que la langue haoussa. 
Enfin, l'article final comporte des cartes, des graphiques, un audio, des photos; Surtout, une visualisation dans l'article permet aux lecteurs de voir en images la route empruntée par les trafiquants partant de la forêt camerounaise jusqu'au port de Lagos au Nigeria d'où est exporté le bois de rose frauduleux.","Cette investigation a failli connaitre une fin malheureuse parce que j'ai reçu des menaces verbales de certains trafiquants et une autorité appartenant au gouvernement local de Maiha, au Nigeria. Ils n'ont pas été contents que je sache leur proximité. J'étais d'autant plus apeuré sachant que certains trafiquants utilisaient des tronçonneuses, d'armes blanches et à feu lorsqu'ils se rendaient au Cameroun pour couper illégalement le bois de rose. Bien plus, ils m'avaient avoué avoir coupé le bois dans des secteurs contrôlés par la secte islamiste Boko Haram et qu'ils n'avaient peur de rien.
Après la publication de l'investigation, tout était redevenu calme. Au Cameroun, l'accès aux données officielles a été incroyablement difficile car aucun fonctionnaire du ministère des forêts approché ne voulait se prononcer. Mais, les mêmes qui refusaient de me parler m'ont appelé après la décision de CITES de suspendre le commerce de bois de rose pour me féliciter et m'annoncer qu'ils travaillent avec le groupe du CITES pour se conformer. C'est grâce à des outils comme Global Forest watch, World Resources Institute, que j'ai pu avoir des données récentes sur la déforestation au Cameroun. 

Par ailleurs, grâce à l'équipe d'experts en journalisme de données du centre Pulitzer, j'ai été formé pendant des mois sur l'utilisation des technologies innovantes comme la visualisation des données et son apport a été important à la publication de l'histoire.","Si cette investigation a eu un impact aussi important, c'est parce qu'elle a été bien conçue dès le départ. Tout part d'une vidéo sur les réseaux sociaux présentant des villageois qui se plaignent de ce que des inconnus coupent nuitamment le bois de rose dans leur village puis ils prennent la fuite. Ces villageois utilisent les feuilles du bois de rose pour nourrir les animaux, et se soigner contre certaines maladies. J'ai dépêché sur place un membre de mon équipe pour savoir ce qui se passe réellement dans ce village du Nord Cameroun. C'est après cette recherche préliminaire que j'ai décidé d'investiguer sur le trafic transfrontalier du bois de rose. Les confrères devraient retenir l'approche utilisée pour dénicher une histoire sous évaluée. La question était de savoir comment fonctionne ce trafic, qui sont les profiteurs, quelles lois ont été violées, qui sont les victimes et pourquoi devrions nous nous en soucier? 
Etant donné que c'est une histoire complexe, il était primordial d'utiliser et de bien présenter les données pour faciliter sa compréhension. Cela passe par la formation à l'utilisation des technologies innovantes. Outre les données, l'histoire a été rendue digeste avec des photos, audio, visualisation. 
Ensuite, les confrères doivent faire montre de courage et prendre des mesures appropriées pour leur sécurité physique et digitale parce que lorsqu'on traite avec des trafiquants tout peut arriver à tout moment. 
Enfin , personnellement, je suis toujours préoccupé à bien faire mon travail et savoir que le produit final a eu un tel impact signifie qu'on a contribué au changement des choses de près ou de loin.",French,https://www.themusebaproject.org/investigation/exploitation-forestiere-crime-corruption-bois-de-rose-vole-cameroun-blanchi-nigeria-expedie-chine/,https://africauncensored.online/timber-logging-and-crime/,,,,,,Christian LOCKA,"Christian Locka, is an award winning freelance reporter of Cameroon nationality who exposes corruption, illicit finances, human rights abuses, and organized crime for a couple of years now.

Netherlands,"De Groene Amsterdammer, Utrecht Data School",Big,Participant,,The Dutch Telegram landscape: How the marginal went mainstream,2022-08-17,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Chart, Politics, Money-laundering, Women, Covid 19, Crime, Gun violence","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Python, Machine learning/AI, Gephi","In collaboration with Utrecht Data School (Utrecht University), De Groene Amsterdammer charted the Dutch Telegram landscape. We collected data from more than 4,000 active groups and analyzed over 30 million messages – the most comprehensive picture of the Dutch Telegram sphere to our knowledge. Our project uncovered a predominance of conspiracy groups, arms and drugs trade, and (child) pornography. Furthermore, we found over 14,000 explicit death threats. Combining this data driven approach with interviews with victims and legal experts, our project highlights the importance of effective moderation on (and regulation of) Telegram – in the Netherlands and elsewhere.","The article was featured on the cover of De Groene Amsterdammer and it was picked up by the largest radio station in the Netherlands. The news was also discussed by major news outlets in Austria including public broadcaster ORF, Heute, and Wiener Zeitung, as well as in Luxembourg's L'essentiel. The methodology we developed for identifying and mapping Telegram groups in the Netherlands was recognized by journalists from other countries and could serve as a valuable tool for similar investigative journalism projects in other languages. Finally, the list of Dutch Telegram groups identified in the research is currently being used as a starting point for a multi-year research project on radicalization in the broader Dutch media landscape.","To uncover the dynamics of Telegram groups in the Netherlands, we used a method called """"snowballing."""" This involved starting with a seed list of groups, which we found by searching for links to Telegram groups on other social media platforms like Twitter (using the Twitter API) and Facebook (using CrowdTangle). We then followed the references and links within these groups to find other groups, repeating this process until we could no longer find any new public Dutch-language groups, resulting in a comprehensive list of over 4,000 active groups. To collect the data from these groups, we used the Telegram API and the Python package Telethon.
 
Besides, we combined network analysis and keyword analysis to chart the Telegram landscape. We started by creating a network visualization of the Telegram landscape using Gephi and NetworkX, which helped us identify groups that were closely connected and sharing information. Then, we dove deeper by using keyword analysis to understand what topics were being discussed in these groups. 

Finally, we also used machine learning techniques to identify and quantify the number of death threats present in the messages. By fine-tuning a pre-existing classifier (the hate speech model of IMSyPP, based on the Dutch-language BERT model) on a custom dataset of 6000 manually labelled messages on Telegram, we were able to scan through the 30 million messages.","This project took several months to complete, from April to August 2022. Just over a month earlier, Russia had invaded Ukraine, and Telegram received praise for being a safe place for dissidents. We wanted to know what kind of conversations Telegram facilitates in the Netherlands, as the free marketplace of speech does not only serve dissidents. Freedom of speech, as championed by tech innovators like Elon Musk often leads to clashes with the law at a basic level. What if leads to hate-speech, child pornography, and death threats? 
 
The project is part of an investigative journalism cooperation called ""Data & Debate"", a cooporation between De Groene Amsterdammer and Utrecht Data School, which focuses on the way in which (online) public debate takes shape. Its goal is to understand and investigate the dynamics of how information is shared, debated, and moderated in the digital age. This includes studying the role of social media platforms, algorithms, and disinformation in shaping public discourse. The collaboration is a well-established partnership that combines journalistic expertise and storytelling methods with scientific research methods.

Charting the entire public landscape of Telegram in the Netherlands was a complex task, as groups on the platform are interconnected and often link to one another. Telegram is a global platform, and there were many groups that were not related to the Netherlands. This meant we had to (automatically) check every group that was linked to for Dutch language. Combined with the Telegram API’s inconsistent and untransparent rate limits, it took us over four months to finally complete the landscape. 

For a long time, we only looked at the public groups. However, these linked to 'hidden' groups that we could not map automatically. What we encountered in these groups pulled our overview off track: the hidden groups, dealing in sex, drugs and weapons, turned out to be even bigger than the public ones. We kept the public landscape for analysis, as we could analyse and discuss it with a lot of certainty. Besides, we also discussed the hidden groups. 

The parts of the data we used in the published article are only part of the data retrieved. For instance, we labelled all Dutch court rulings on Telegram, but ultimately chose not to delve further into them due to the project size. 

Crucial was the help of AI, which allowed us to handle the volume of messages. Moreover, that is where journalistic skill comes in: diving into groups ourselves, talking to moderators ourselves. 

To conduct investigations where you encounter images of beheadings, pornograhpy of underage girls and hate-speech, it is necessary to create some distance from it for yourself, but when writing, you have to let go of some of that distance, otherwise you cannot properly convey why what is happening is bad. For example, we only contacted the victims of expose groups (young women) about a week before the publication date. Here, too, journalistic craftsmanship is important: dealing responsibly with these women and their data, giving them the space for a safe conversation.","The main takeaway for other journalists is that it can be beneficial to combine academic research (techniques) with journalistic endeavours to create a story. In our academic-journalistic collaboration, rigorous data scraping techniques and analysis were translated to a tangible story, which makes the data-driven results comprehensible to the wider public. 

Another distinctive takeaway from our collaboration is methodological transparency, which was uploaded as a separate article on the website of De Groene Amsterdammer [https://web.archive.org/web/20221202031842/https://www.groene.nl/artikel/verantwoording-bij-het-onderzoek-naar-het-nederlandstalige-telegramlandschap]. As data-journalism can seem complicated, and sometimes overwhelming for most readers, it is important to be transparent and explain the methods and research in comprehensible steps.

A third takeaway is that it is important to keep having a critical view on (tech-)platforms which are being praised for security, freedom, and safety, especially as this can turn out to be distinct in different countries and their respective political landscape/context.

Spain,Civio,Small,Participant,,Excessive workload stifles primary care,2022-11-24,"Investigation, Database, Infographics, Health","D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Mapbox GL JS","The healthcare system in Spain is in the middle of a turmoil. Primary care professionals are taking the streets demanding better conditions. In this investigation, we release, for the first time, the data that reflects the issue: the **care pressure is extremely high in some regions, rising to more than 40 patients per day for some physicians and pediatricians**. Nevertheless, experts declare the problem is worse than the official data shows.","The workload of healthcare personnel in Spain has reached unprecedented levels, even when the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic seemed to be behind us. Many primary care professionals are taking the streets demanding better conditions at work, in a situation where patients wait even weeks for a doctor appointment. With this investigation, we quantify the overwork with unpublished data up until now: the care pressure -number of patients seen per healthcare professional per day- is around the record figure of 40 patients in the case of family doctors and pediatricians in some health areas in the country. This means that a doctor can spend less than 8 minutes caring for each person. However, specialists warn that the reality is much worse than the numbers reflect.

It doesn’t look like this situation will be temporary. The data shows that the deterioration of primary care comes even before the pandemic. For this reason, we have created a search engine so the reader can find out two key data on primary care saturation in their own health area from 2018 to late 2022. These are: 1) the care pressure, and 2) the assigned quota of patients. We intend to keep this map alive and updated by requesting new data to public administrations every year.

All our work is open for republication and the database is available for anyone who wants to check it or use it for research purposes. It has been downloaded more than 40 times by researchers, organizations and journalists. Thanks to this way of doing journalism, at least nine regional media outlets have created their own stories with the data on care pressure: Cadena Ser, La Verdad de Murcia, El Diario de Córdoba or Atlántico Hoy, among others.","Getting the data this investigation is based on was the first and probably most difficult step taken. We did several FOIA requests since the data was not published. Actually, we are still fighting with public administrations to release the care pressure data of some health areas, even after the publication. Once we had most of the data from 2018 to 2022, we started working on homogenization and analysis of the database with Excel. 

Then, we decided to create a map-search engine with all the health areas data. To do so, we contacted the open data portals of each region. All of them had this information geolocated and downloadable except the Community of Madrid. Our numerous attempts to obtain their 7 health areas of that region were unsuccessful, no one has been able to provide us with such geographic information to date. Then, we had to use the Mapshaper and to elaborate the map in Observable with Mapbox GL JS and d3.js.","This investigation is a data-driven one, but data, in this case, was not of public domain. However, it didn’t stop us from doing seventeen FOIA requests for each one of Spain's regions and two more for the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla. This was a procedure that took us five months to complete -in part. Several administrations denied our right to access to the information and we had to reclaim it. Others gave us the data in a different format, time gap and/or desegregation level. 

Once we have the database in a reusable format -with some of the information still lacking- we decided to create a map in which the reader could search for its own healthcare region and look at the data of the mean of patients seeing each day for each type of professional and the quota of patients each professional had. This meant that we encountered a new difficulty: we had to contact all the 19 administrations once again for the healthcare regions shapefiles. All of them had it and sent it to us, except for the one with more population: Community of Madrid. Then, we had to use the Mapshaper tool to copy the healthcare regions of Madrid by ourselves.

We plan to keep this investigation ‘alive’ by updating the information every year. Up to this day, we have already made all the nineteen FOIA requests once again for the data regarding the second trimester of 2022.","That data doesn’t tell everything. Giving voice to experts and healthcare professionals has been key to understand the real issue as well as to fill the gap on certain matters. For example, we couldn’t realize that the mean number of patients seen per day wasn’t taking into account holidays enjoyed by healthcare professionals. Then, the quota of patients would be higher per professional because they will have to assist patients assigned to their colleges on holidays. We also realized that the kind of patients health professionals have in their quota can affect the so called care pressure (mean of the number of patients seen per day): it would take longer to assist elderly people or people with comorbidities than young healthy people. Listening to people who suffer this situation both as a patient and as a professional has been the most important part of the data analysis in this case.

Also, something that Civio has learnt during all the years of investigation is that the reader often wants to interact with the data. That is why many of our investigations have interactive visualizations that locate the IP of the reader and offer a personalized experience. In this investigation, we have kept that in mind, developing a map where the reader can search for its own healthcare region and look at the care pressure where he or she actually goes to the physician. 

The methodology and database of this investigation is open and free to be checked by anyone interested in it, specially local journalists. This allows new approaches to be developed with the same exact data. We believe that transparency in the process and limitations allows readers to trust the final work.",Spanish,https://civio.es/medicamentalia/2022/11/24/atencion-primaria-espana-presion-asistencial/,https://civio.es/medicamentalia/buscador-presion-asistencial-atencion-primaria/,https://datos.civio.es/collection/atencion-primaria/,,,,,"ÁNGELA BERNARDO, MARÍA ÁLVAREZ DEL VAYO, CARMEN TORRECILLAS and DAVID CABO","We are the first organisation in Spain to specialise in monitoring public authorities.

Spain,"Civio, El Confidencial, DW, Eurologus, Divergente, VoxEurop",Small,Participant,,Prisoners awaiting trial: use and abuse of preventive detention in Europe,2022-05-10,"Investigation, Cross-border, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Infographics, Immigration, Human rights","D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Pre-trial detention is an exceptional and temporary measure according to the law, yet in this investigation, we discovered that its use has increased in recent years in Europe. In Civio, along with partners from all over Europe, we have spoken with experts who consider the use of preventive detention to be abusive -sometimes discriminatory-, and we tell you stories of people who have suffered it. Also, we investigated the consequences: suicides in this situation are much higher than in people already convicted; and compensations, when pre-trial prisoners proved innocent, are still unruled.","Almost 100,000 prisoners in Europe have something in common: they are locked up without a final sentence. Despite its profound consequences, the use of preventive detention is very high: one in five prisoners in European prisons are held under this measure. Civio has collected data, testimonies and cases from the 27 countries of the European Union in a cross-border investigation with the European Data Journalism Network into the use (and abuse) of this exceptional measure, which is often forgotten and little discussed due to populism.

Born in Peru, Viviana Verástegui has had Spanish nationality for nine years and a stable job when incarcerated. The risk of flight is one of the reasons for ordering pretrial detention; showing rootedness in the country can, in theory, avoid pretrial jail. Viviana Verástegui spent 11 months in prison until she was liberated. The investigation demonstrates that discrimination is key in these cases. 

This in-depth investigation also reveals how the harshness of this measure triggers the probability of suicide. Being in pretrial detention, in fact, is one of the main risk factors for a person to take their own life in prison. But, what if the prisoner in pretrial detention ends up being innocent? The government must compensate, but the questions about how much freedom is worth is still unanswered. We delve into these and other questions through sentences, official documents, investigators, specialists, affected people, lawyers and data collected for the first time.

This three part investigation uses data, visualizations, testimonies and documents to narrate the issue. The articles have been translated into Italian, English, German, French, Portuguese, Polish and Arabic and have also been published in several outlets, such as Deutsche Welle (Germany), Vox Europe (Europe), El Confidencial (Spain), or Divergente (Portugal), among others.","This cross-border investigation, composed of three articles, led by Civio as part of the European Data Journalism Network (EDJNET) has drawn on journalists in nine countries. For the main data of people in pre-trial detention in the 27 countries of the European Union, we extracted the data from Tables 8 and 24 of the SPACE I 2021 report produced by the Council of Europe. With the same source, we could calculate the suicide rates per 10,000 inmates by using the total number of inmates, the number in preventive detention and the number of suicides among pretrial and general inmates. For context, we add also the national suicide rate, sourced from Eurostat. For this purpose, we used basic data extraction and analysis tools. We also created a data visualization of the percentage of prisoners in pretrial detention in 2021 and the suicides ratesusing Observable and D3.js. 

However, collaborative journalism in this investigation was key. Being able to interview and gather experiences from several countries allowed us to understand the real impact of pre-trial detention in those who suffer it. To work together in such a way we had to have monthly meetings, share documents and interviews and help each other in gathering local data and stories. Also, having the same methodology of work has been very important to trust the process.","Pre-trial detentions is not a topic often discussed due to populism. Talking about prisoner’s rights is not something that will get you votes. However, we feel the need to introduce the issue in the public debate. We investigated about the suicide rate of people in this situation, the discrimination in the decision making and the consequences of being in jail while being innocent. Even when proven innocent, people often find themselves without compensation from the administration or fighting for one. These are serious questions that we believe should be raised, and hope this investigation helps doing it.","To work by yourself is not always the best way to report on an issue, especially when talking about the European Union. It is complicated to organize a cross-border, collaborative investigation, but it is completely worth it. In this kind of collaboration it is very important to share a common methodology on how to work with data, documents and interviewers. We, as Civio, have reached people and experts that we couldn’t dream about thanks to this type of collaboration and the European Data Journalism Network. Also, we have the opportunity to get to readers in other languages we couldn’t have reached on our own.","Spanish, English",https://civio.es/2022/05/10/use-and-abuse-of-preventive-detention-in-the-european-union/,https://civio.es/2022/05/17/europe-prisons-suicides/,https://civio.es/2022/05/11/cuando-ser-extranjero-te-da-mas-papeletas-para-acabar-en-prision-provisional/,https://datos.civio.es/collection/prision-provisional/,,,,"EVA BELMONTE, CARMEN TORRECILLAS, MARÍA ÁLVAREZ DEL VAYO, DAVID CABO and MIGUEL ÁNGEL GAVILANES from Civio.

A team of five journalists exposes injustice in access to public services for children in Jordan, discrimination against girls in marginalized communities, deprivation of free health services for the majority of the child population, and insufficient government expenditures to provide a safe environment in public schools. The stories were published between September and December 2022.","Story on Children with Cochlear Implants 

A member of the board of trustees of “The Higher Council for the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities'' in Jordan contacted the journalist to tell her that the Civil Health Insurance Fund, a government agency, intends to cover the cost of spare parts needed for the cochlear implants of children ( the decision not declared officially). Later, the committee of the Forum of the Parents of Children with Cochlear Implants confirmed that the Fund started a registry for the children with cochlear implantation.

Story on School Maintenance

A senior official of the “Building Management and International Projects” department, at the Ministry of Education (MOE), told the journalist, after publishing the story, that a substantial increase in the expenditures for schools' maintenance is expected in 2023 ( the government budget is still not approved).


Story on students with visual impairment

Sara’s father, one of the sources in the story, called the journalist and thanked her after accepting his daughter in the boarding house of the school. Weeks later other students from grades 7 and above, who live in distant areas were accepted, solving a problem that existed for years.This was confirmed by the director of Programs for Students with Disabilities at the Jordan Ministry of Education.
This story won “2nd place - written media category” at the media competition launched by “The Higher Council for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in Jordan”. 

Story on Secondary Education for Girls
The Journalist keeps contacting the local community in the villages .An 11th grade classroom was added to the school in one of the villages, and another one to be added to the school in the other village next year. Both schools will be upgraded by MOE into secondary schools next year ( after adding 12th grade), the schools’ administrations confrimed.","Different tools and techniques were used:
.
Excel Sheets: It was an essential tool in the data workflow. The journalist used it to clean and analyze data. Also, it was used to build a database of children with cochlear implants in Jordan .The journalist reached almost 200 with the help of social activists. In the case of the schools’ maintenance story, data was scraped from more than 400 pages of annual reports of government budget and then organized in excel sheets.
Flourish: Flourish was used to visualize data, using different types of interactive charts. Also, GeoJSON files were used to create a map for Jordan on Flourish. This will be available to many other journalists who might need it.
Google map: it was a tool for collecting data as well as for visualization .The journalist visited the schools to get the coordinates of schools using google map application, as there was no accurate geo data for these sites. After applying data to google map, the latter showed that girls from districts in the capital territory have to continue their secondary education in schools located in distant areas, while boys from the same districts study in a nearby school.
A structured questionnaire was used to get the required data of almost 200 parents of cochlear implants children.","The team found it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to access public data because of the lack of national registries, poor data automation, and bureaucratic procedures. In more than one story, the journalist waited for months before getting the data.
Although, in Jordan there is a Law for Access to Information, it authorizes state employees to determine if the requested information is classified or not without any judicial or administrative supervision.
Also, the law authorizes denying the request of information under vague reasons.
The National Center for Human Rights in Jordan observes an expansion of information classified as confidential, along with the lack of clear and accurate standards for the process and procedures.
On the other hand, journalists in Jordan may be summoned for interrogation by national security agencies after requesting information; others were detained for reporting on certain topics.
In 2021 the Center for Defending Freedom of Journalists in Jordan rated the media environment in the country as “restricted” for the second year running.
While working on the story about deprivation of public health insurance for children above 6, the council of Ministers (the Cabinet) passed the bill for the child’s right. Later it was approved by the parliament. Many sections of the law spark controversy among Jordanian and create media debate.The article related to child’s health didn’t get enough attention, although it states that it may take the government 10 years before fully implementing the public health insurance for children.","Journalists can learn not to be deceived by the results of macro-level analysis. Using micro level scale could expose more and tell stories that might otherwise be overlooked. In the story on secondary education for girls, the journalist found nothing wrong after analyzing the data of students and classrooms at the main-district level (cities). Later, she tried to get data on the sub-districts, which wasn't provided by the Ministry of Education. The journalist chose a sub-district where some stories were circulating about girls dropping out of schools because of the lack of convenient education services. She contacted a number of school administrations and got the data. To her surprise, the journalist found that girls in some areas have no equal opportunities to receive secondary education as boys. These areas are in the capital territory.

A lack of public data doesn't mean the journalist has to drop the case or quit reporting data stories on important topics. In the story on children with cochlear implants. After working for months, the journalist was able to reach almost 200 children with cochlear implants. 

The state budget shows information and stories that can be revealed if analysis is performed appropriately.

Viet Nam,Mekong Eye,Small,Participant,,Vietnam’s fishermen battle a lack of fish and China,2022-04-25,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Chart, Politics, Environment, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","The story speaks to the desperation of Vietnamese fishermen, exposing the unsustainable exploitation of China's fishing industry as well as Vietnam itself ― the world’s fourth-largest seafood exporter. Not only has the South China Sea become a hotbed of tension over sovereignty disputes among the 10 countries and territories in Asia for decades, now its ecosystem, which includes Vietnamese waters, is also on the verge of collapse. 
The piece is published on Mekong Eye, supported by the Mekong Data Journalism Fellowship jointly organized by Internews’ Earth Journalism Network and the East-West Center.","It is the first time that the destiny of Vietnamese fishermen, who are contributing a lot to the country's economy and the global seafood supply chain, was told in the country.

The story did not bring immediate changes to the fishermen and the marine environment, but I believe that when the story was told, the problems related to uncontrolled fishing as well as the damages of fishermen would be known more, and thereby having changes in the community's perception.","I used data on Vietnamese fishery production and capacities provided by Vietnam’s General Statistics Office. Trade data on Vietnam’s seafood exports was taken from ResourceTrade.Earth, which is developed by an independent think tank, Chatham House, who sourced and re-adjusted bilateral trade data from UN Comtrade. This was complemented with data from Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers. To assess the conditions of Vietnamese seawaters, I referred to the Ocean Health Index, which is a research collaboration between the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis from University of California, Santa Barbara and Conservation International, with scores contributed by independent research teams. Data findings were cross-checked and validated during interviews with 3 experts including one environmental expert working at Vietnam Institute of Sea and Islands Research, one expert specializing in fishery economics research at Nha Trang University (Vietnam) and one political researcher at the Center for International Studies, University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Vietnam National University-HCMC and the South China Sea Chronicle Initiative; three fishermen including two in the Vietnam Mekong Delta and one in the Central Vietnam. The links to all the data sources and analyses have also been compiled in Google Sheet (link below).
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19g76IqV-zyWBwiIG4algKkfZvtn21AWLzy_CIuauhRo/edit#gid=1704579008","I carried out this project while the Vietnam seafood export industry faced the prospect of getting a red card from the EU due to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. Once this happens, a complete ban on fish exports from the country to the EU will be enforced. At that time, the Vietnam government was looking for ways to stop the punishment by trying to show its improved efforts in fishing management on the South China Sea.

My story is a contradiction to the government's wishes as it provides a lot of evidence confirming the violation of human rights and the unsustainability of Vietnam's fishing, which have been happening more and more dramatically. 

Besides the English version on Mekong Eye, I published a Vietnamese version in a domestic magazine. Before my story, there had not been a single piece of local newsroom writing on the marine depletion on South China Sea and the destiny of the fishermen. The government and the domestic media only released the huge amount of foreign currency that the seafood export industry brought in.

On international media outlets, Vietnamese fishermen have been often accused of being fish poachers because of illegally fishing on another country's waters. My story, however, paints a much more complex picture, one which highlights the true human between the economic and political interests of governments including China and Vietnam itself. The piece serves as an excuse for Vietnamese fishermen, explaining why they have gone beyond Vietnam waters, showing that after all, they have been also victims of the unsustainable economic policies of many countries on the South China Sea. ","I think Vietnamese journalists can learn more about how to explore and collate data to find out the true story behind the figures.
While data is limited by the censorship and lack of transparency of government, the journalists can look to international sources.

Brazil,"TV Globo and G1 (TV Globo's news website) publish this work as a three-part series. First, the story aired on television news program SP1. Then, the online version was published and embedded the original video alongside the texts, photos and graphics.",Big,Participant,,The toll of the pandemic on early childhood education in São Paulo,2022-11-16,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, OSINT, Infographics, Video, Map, Women, Covid 19","Adobe Creative Suite, CSV, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap, Flourish","This multiplatform series combined data science and on the road investigation to measure the impact that closing schools during quarentine had on children who were still not old enough for remote schooling and needed constant mediation from their parents to join a virtual classroom. Time and financial difficulties led many families to unenroll their children, causing a record number of private preschools to close and depriing children of social activities that are crucial for their development. We focused on three main actors: schools, families and, finally, teachers who found ways to bypass this problem and guarantee children's right to education.","This multimedia (TV and online) project was selected for the Dart Center 2022 Early Childhood Latin America Fellowship, which focused on inequality and Covid-19.

Over the course of 2021 and 2022, we had already covered the impact of the pandemic on other levels of education, mostly on school evasion of teenagers, the obstacles for young and adult education (a relevant phenomenon in Brazil), and on 6 and 7 year-old children who had migrated from the private sector to public schools and provoked an expansion on the public netwoork to absorb this new demand.

Common sense was clear: education was suffering losses both in access and in quality. Commom sense also said that, during an emergency, the younger children didn't need to be prioritized because they would have ""more time"" to catch up. 

But we wanted to show just how big a loss we were facing, both on the structure of the system (the schools that closed), on the individual level (how a child's development would be halted or delayed, especially the ones from low income families) and on society in general, because science has already showed that early childhood education has the potential to mitigate the social inequality that only increases with age. 

We also wanted to hold the government accountable for their constitutional role guaranteeing these children rights to education. Our data showed that, in the State of São Paulo, especially in the Metropolitan Region of the Capital, private schools, more so daycare centers, are much more predominant, which can be explained by the fact that these regions concentrate more women who are economically active. Many of them have to pay for what is a public right because they don't find public options, especially options that will take their children for the entire day.","Data analysis and mapping was done using R. The graphics fot the television version, used the Adobe packages. The online version had dataviz from Flourish.

The first part of the series envolved applying data science to cross the different editions of the official School Census, published every year by the Brazilian federal government. The consolidated version of the Census simply counts the number of schools by city. state and country, but our analysis envolved finding the daycare and preschools in the São Paulo State that were open and running and had at least one students in 2020, but in 2021 listed their status as inactive/extinct, without enrollments. We then applied geolocation techniques to map these schools and used OSINT to track previous school owners of to begin shapping the story.

Other analyses were made to better describe the private to public ratio of daycare and preschools in São Paulo and the rest of Brazil, to go beyond common sense and better explain the phenomenon.

For the second part, the focused was on the parents. We used quarterly data from Pnad, a questionnaire that asked a sample of household if they had children from the age of 5 that attended preschool. With help from specialists we applied techniques to weigh the responses and achieve an equivalente percentage of the population. The data showed that, from July 2020 until March 2022 the percentage of cchildren not attending preschool was twice to three times as high as before the pandemic, which pointed to a strong backset in a trend of access to education and risked the goals established by the National Education Plan.

The third part used concepts of Solutions Journalism to tell successful stories from teachers by explaining step by step their projects and results in ways that could be replicated.","Access to data was the main obstacle for this project. In 2021, the Brazilian government, under Bolsonaro, decided that the Education disaggregated databases were not in accordance to the new personal data protection legislation. However, instead of adapting the databases, they simply stopped publishing them, and removed over ten years worth of historical data from their website.

Nowadays, the only database available is the one where each line is a school. They have added consolidated number, such as the total of enrollments and some details like how many enrollments are from each race. But there are no more databases where each line was a student, but anonymized, or each line was a teacher, also anonymized. It is impossible now, for example, to discover the average age of students by group of race, or the percentage of black teaches according to their education.

We tried to request information using the Information Access Law, Brazil's equivalente to the Freedom of Information Act, to ask the government to send us the number of students who were enrolled in each category of school (private or public) in 2020, and where they were in 2021 (in the same category, in a new category, or not at all enrolled). But our request was denied on all instances, in a process that took a few months.

The alternative they gave the public was to apply to use the ""Safe Room"", a service where a researcher can be allowed in the physical data storage to write SQL queries and search and cross the non-anonymized databases. However, this is a service created with academic researchers in mind, which require a scientific project to submit a request, and several months waiting for the authorization. The query itself would involve travelling to Brasília and most likely spending weeks in the ""Safe Room"" trying to collect the data, then waiting for a review of the results before actually receiving them to begin the analysis. Paper and pen are forbidden, and there is no internet connection, so the queries need to be memorized. In conclusion, this alternative is impractical for the journalism's timing and needs.","Here are five lessons:

1- Data journalism can be useful in all areas of coverage, not just Politics, Elections or Police. These areas might get more audience or a more visible impact, but using data to tell other stories can be just as helpful to sensitize the population on subjects that get almost no space in the news.

2- Education journalism in Brazil, for example, has been an entry door to data journalism because, over the last 15 years, the federal government had done a remarkable job in making very rich educational databases public and accessible.

3- The transparency backlash that affected many areas, including Education, need to always be on the journalist's mind when deciding what to write about. The more people requesting and pressuring for more transparency, the better our odds to reverse it.

4- Different news formats impose different data journalism challenges. Television is a format with specific limitations. Time is the first one: whereas on a website or on print a reader can spend unlimited time reading a graphic, on TV the graphic is on the screen for mere seconds, so they need to be as simple and straight-forward as possible to be understood by the public. The audience is also different, especially on open channels, where the news is consumed by a majority of lower income households. Nevertheless, this audience also deserves to be informed, so data journalism needs to be especially aware of how to communicate effectively with them. In this project, we show the same graphics, but designed in different ways because they were conveyed in two different formats, TV and online.

5- If I may leave a suggestion: Education is not on the list of Tags on the Sigma Awards submission form. Maybe it should be, just like Agriculture, Health and Culture.",Portuguese,https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/educacao/noticia/2022/11/16/fuga-de-matriculas-tirou-quase-16-mil-vagas-do-ensino-infantil-so-na-cidade-de-sao-paulo.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/educacao/noticia/2022/11/17/frequencia-a-pre-escola-em-sao-paulo-so-retomou-patamar-pre-pandemia-no-2o-trimestre-de-2022.ghtml,https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/educacao/noticia/2022/11/18/como-professoras-do-ensino-infantil-remaram-contra-a-mare-para-manter-contato-com-as-criancas-na-quarentena.ghtml,https://github.com/anacarolinamoreno/educacao_infantil_pandemia/,,,,"Ana Carolina Moreno (producer and online reporter)

Kazakhstan,"Telegram and YoyTube channel @shishkin_like, Center of Journalistic Investigations LLP.",Small,Participant,,How to make a cash cow out of state property? (Как из государственного ХОЗУ сделать дойную козу?) Investigation in 5 parts.,2022-11-03,"Investigation, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Politics, Corruption","OpenStreetMap, The illustrations were made in FIGMA.","In my previous [investigation](https://t.me/shishkin_like/1568?single) I wrote about the “miraculous” transformation of the state-owned CJSC ""HOZU"" into a private enterprise as a result of a strikingly soft investment tender. One of the buildings turned out to be in hands of President Nazarbayevs' daughter.
 
In this investigation I'm telling how the vast majority of the previously state-owned residences and administrative buildings in Almaty (35 properties) became profitable business for Nazarbayev's nephew Satubaldy, oligarchs V.Kim and V.Dzhumanbayev and his partner from Liechtenstein. For example, one of their office centers alone has the potential to bring $13 million per year.","Currently, our telegram channel has more than 8 thousand subscribers, which is quite a significant for a new media that started only in May, 2022. In addition, this is a rather serious audience for the media working exclusively in the field of open data investigations and using telegram messenger as the main outlet. YouTube version has 5,86 K.

Each of the parts of my investigation received coverage from 2651 to 2911 views. I assume that the publication did not go unnoticed among the interested parties. For example, the oligarch Vladimir Dzhumanbayev officially resigned from the founders of the company which now owns property (previously owned by the state). I guess it happened because of the investigation. 

In addition, one of the political science experts [believes](https://t.me/chebotarev_kz/150) that our media is in the top 10 socio-political channels in 2022. I assume that our audience is specific, to a large extent it is made up of decision-makers.

I can't say anything about inspiration for other journalists, but they often use our investigations in their work, sometimes they forget about links. But it's still very nice.","In this investigation, as in others, I used the business registers of Kazakhstan, as well as the legislative base containing government resolutions and presidential decrees since 1998. Also I used the business register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce. As it turned out, one of the beneficiaries is the founder of a Dutch company and citizen of Liechtenstein engaged in fiduciary services. His name is Clemens Laternser.

In addition, I used maps and websites with commercial real estate rental ads. Maps were useful for analysis of location of real estate and for illustrations. Some ads gave me information about the approximate cost of rent. In general, my sources are open data.

Project designer Maria Mamaluga created illustrations and infographics (see additional links). Please, note: the introductory part (where main link leads) contains links to the parts with the continuation of the investigation. You can find these links under the text of the introductory part. There are 5 such parts in total. Also 7th additional link leads to the video version of the investigation. The presenter of the video version is a chief of our media Dmitry Shishkin.","Firstly, few words about political context: a transit of presidential authority was happened in Kazakhstan in 2019. Nazarbayev, who ruled the state for about 30 years, transfered the power to Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. Since then there have been presidential elections for 2 times. And Tokayev won twice. Especially the first time there were issues related to some violations. However, now it is no longer possible to say that he is a protege of Nazarbayev (although initially he was). Over the past year and at the beginning of this year a number of changes have taken place at the legislative level. These changes aimed to reduce the rights and guarantees for the former president and members of his family.

Despite the fact that Nazarbayevs' brother, nephew and others close people are now under investigation for corruption crimes, his family's strength is still quite great. The largest objects, including mining, mineral resources, manufacturing industry, construction, commercial real estate and even utilities sector belong to people who are somehow connected with the old team. Therefore, it is important to talk about the assets that they unfairly own.

And it is important that evidence should be absolute, for e.g. in the case of legal claims. Therefore, I use business registers, information about tax payments, financial reports and other documentation from the public domain. 

The second important thing is that Kazakhstan is on the 122 position (out of 180) in the World Press Freedom Index in 2022, and on 102 place (out of 180) in the Corruption Perceptions Index (2021). This facts show the general context regarding journalism and some frames of our work.","Other journalists could probably gain knowledge of working with the business registers of Kazakhstan and foreign countries. However now, unfortunately, the European Union has temporarily restricted public access to information about the ultimate beneficial owners of companies. I hope that journalists will still be able to receive such information upon request.

In addition, the value of the work lies in the analysis of data from different sources and the ability to compare them. Accuracy and precision are also important.",Russian,https://t.me/shishkin_like/1646,https://t.me/shishkin_like/1647,https://t.me/shishkin_like/1651,https://t.me/shishkin_like/1657,https://t.me/shishkin_like/1661,https://t.me/shishkin_like/1667,https://youtube.com/watch?v=EUdDf3iJqqM&feature=shares,"Contributors to my investigation:

The investigation is based on a leak of sensitive texts, emails, invoices, briefing notes, presentations and other documents exchanged by top Uber executives, government bureaucrats and world leaders in nearly 30 countries. It provides an unprecedented look into the ways Uber defied taxi laws and upended workers’ rights.","The resulting impact was far-reaching, fueling angry protests in Italy, where taxi drivers blocked roads, a political scandal in France, where Emmanuel Macron came under fire from political opponents over a secret deal he forged for Uber's lobbyists when he was economy minister, and controversy in the United States over the role played by two former White House aides in facilitating Uber's global lobbying efforts.

Revelations about Uber’s use of a “kill switch” to prevent police and regulators from accessing sensitive data during raids in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, India and Hungary made headline news across the world. So too did revelations about Uber’s lobbying efforts in Putin’s Russia, where its executives, in a bid to win political support, courted several now-sanctioned oligarchs perceived as close to the Kremlin, and paid a political operative despite corruption concerns over the risk of bribery. 

In Brussels, revelations about former EU Commissioner Neelie Kroes’s role in Uber’s lobbying efforts triggered an investigation by the EU’s anti-fraud agency and sparked a wider debate about the revolving door and lobbying of EU institutions. Responding to the disclosures, Ireland’s Taoiseach, Michéal Martin, said there should be “full transparency” about how businesses lobby EU governments. 

Reverberations from the Uber files continue to be felt. As the EU considers legislation to reclassify millions of digital platform workers as employees, Politico observed how the disclosures have emboldened lawmakers to push for tighter regulation of digital platforms. Mark MacGann appeared before a committee of MEPs debating these proposals. Speaking alongside the EU Commissioner for jobs and social rights, the ex-lobbyist warned lawmakers that “giving disproportionate power in legislation to huge tech platforms risks shattering social justice” across Europe.","The Uber Files records were mostly emails, which comprised 83,000 of the leak’s 124,000 files. After receiving the files from The Guardian, ICIJ uploaded them onto its research platform, Datashare, allowing journalists from more than 40 media partners in 29 countries to search and review the documents. Datashare also converted the text of some files that were in French to English. 

ICIJ built several databases using Apache Tika, Python, Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. In the leak there were calendar files as well as message exchanges that pointed at potential meetings between Uber and public stakeholders such as politicians. ICIJ extracted details of scheduled meetings, then reviewed thousands of internal emails and messages to confirm that the meetings took place. Additionally, ICIJ explored public records in countries and institutions where officials are required to declare their meetings and schedules.

ICIJ also used public databases such as the European Union’s transparency register, the disclosure logs for the U.S. Senate, and the French lobbying registry.

ICIJ extracted the email addresses as well as names and domains linked to them. The information was organized on a spreadsheet to help identify key people that Uber executives contacted.

The team gathered information on correspondence between academics and Uber and later explored publicly available databases of academic papers to identify additional publications funded or supported by Uber.

ICIJ identified spreadsheets in the leaked records that contained information about what the company called potential “stakeholders” that could be of interest for Uber. ICIJ combined the information in one master spreadsheet and organized it by country to help partners’ reporting.

ICIJ and The Guardian used the WaybackMachine from the Internet Archive to analyze previous versions of Uber’s website and gather historical reports in a spreadsheet about how the location of the company’s operations grew and changed over time.","The Uber Files is based on a collection of more than 124,000 records, including 83,000 emails and other files created between 2013 and 2017, a period when the U.S. ride-hailing giant was expanding across the globe. The files were leaked to The Guardian and shared with ICIJ. After publication, ex-Uber lobbyist Mark MacGann came forward as the source of the leak.

Like all leaks, the documents represent only a small slice of a larger reality. Not all countries where Uber had operations were mentioned in the records. The files covered only through 2017. As always, additional research and reporting was necessary.

The effort involved mining thousands of records that were shared securely and made searchable through ICIJ’s research platform Datashare.

An important part of the more than 124,000 records were emails. There were also calendar files, documents and some spreadsheets. The team had to organize the information to make sense of it and connect it with public records as well as reaching to different sources across countries as part of the reporting effort to identify the stories of public interest for the audience. The collaborative effort involving journalists from more than 40 media partners in 29 countries was central to address the complexities of the data and the reporting effort.

ICIJ also encountered a discrepancy between what the company said in its financial statements and what it told users on its website about how many markets it was in. The team had to check for methodological differences in the two figures. Uber eventually told ICIJ that “with respect to city counts, the way we calculated that number changed in 2020.”

ICIJ had to parse countries’ varying lobbying and meeting-disclosure records, accounting for variations in the type of data available and its quality. Not all countries have lobbying regulations or public lobbying records and not all require politicians to report the meetings they hold as part of their official responsibilities.

Despite the existence of a calendar, the files sometimes would suggest that a meeting might have taken place, however, it was not possible to know whether they happened or not or if an aid attended instead of an elected official. The team did additional reporting through public records and sources to confirm this information and expand the information on Uber’s tactics in trying to gain access to markets around the world.

Regular meetings and sharing findings and information across countries through ICIJ’s communication platform Global I-Hub, was also important to coordinate efforts and help connect the dots about Uber’s lobbying efforts and practices across countries.","Keep in mind that having a centralized place to share documents securely and to communicate powers up a collaboration. For the Uber Files the team used ICIJ’s research tool Datashare (which is Open Source) and the Global I-Hub for communicating and coordinating efforts.

Remember to connect leaked data with public records. This helps with validation efforts and provides additional information that can be valuable for analysis.

Understand the limitations of each dataset, its structure and quality, and which questions can or can’t be answered through data analysis.

Review regulations across countries and how they affect data gathering and analysis. Talk to experts to get perspective of how regulations are applied in the real world.

When structuring data and performing different types of analysis, document the process and leave plenty of time for fact-checking. All data gathering and analyses performed by ICIJ for the Uber Files was fact checked.

Believe in the power of collaboration: through the contributions from journalists around the world it is possible to advance the reporting and connect the dots across borders. A collaborative approach where all team members have access to records as well as ongoing reporting findings is key while investigating corporations that operate across borders, and helps identify patterns and practices that repeat themselves in different countries.","English, Spanish, German, French, Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Arabic, Lithuanian, Dutch, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Swedish, Turkish",https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-global-rise-lobbying-violence-technology/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/how-we-unearthed-ubers-controversial-playbook-from-a-cache-of-employee-communications/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-tax-havens-dodge-drivers/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/key-people-in-uber-files/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/macron-kroes-under-pressure-as-uber-files-puts-spotlight-on-high-power-lobbying-in-europe/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/uber-files/uber-deals-russia-putin-allies/,"Journalists from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, The Guardian and more than 40 media partners in 29 countries.

Germany,ZEIT ONLINE,Big,Participant,,What you can earn where in Germany,2022-09-06,"News application, Economy","D3.js, Three.js, Canvas, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js","In which place in Germany do residents earn the most, and where the least? Talking about money and salaries is still a taboo in this country. ZEIT ONLINE has brought transparency to the debate and used exclusive data to show for the first time how salaries in Germany's municipalities have developed over the past 20 years.","ZEIT ONLINE obtained and analyzed salary data from the Federal Employment Agency from all 4,252 municipalities in Germany. The analysis shows what effect inflation has had on earnings, where the top earners live and how much East and West Germany still differ. 

For the first time, the data analysis provides a detailed picture of salaries in Germany's municipalities. ZEIT ONLINE has published 4,252 individual articles - one for each municipality in the country. This allows readers to find out how salaries have developed in the municipality, how great the disparity is between low and top earners, and how the locality compares to neighboring municipalities.

Nationwide, the data analysis shows that salaried employees earn an average of 3,525 euros per month, and their salaries have increased by 7.3 percent over the past 20 years, adjusted for inflation. But wages are not rising everywhere: eastern Germany has continued to catch up in the nationwide salary comparison. From 2002 to 2021, wages there rose by 17.3 percent; in the west, by contrast, by only 5.5 percent. At the same time, the dataset shows that top- and middle-earning communities are often separated by only a few kilometers. High-income earners are drawn primarily to the suburbs of major cities. The lowest earnings are in tourist strongholds such as Binz on the Baltic Sea. This shows how little employees in clinics, hotels and restaurants in tourist regions or health resorts usually earn.","From a technical perspective, it was a challenge to visualize all municipalities at once. We knew that we wanted to show them in different states and then find a way to elegantly switch back and forth between those states. The tool of our choice was therefore three.js. Each of our municipalities was actually a small sphere in a 3-dimensional space, which we then repositioned depending on the state. This had the great advantage that we could move the 'camera' around the thousands of circles in a very smooth way with simple moves and zooms. The Javascript libraries D3 and React helped us with the computation and logic of the visualization.

For the data analysis itself we used a combination of Python and R.","We have already started the project in 2021. Due to current developments in the Corona pandemic and subsequently the Ukraine war and the energy crisis, we had to interrupt work on it again and again. Since this is a cross-departmental project, the coordination for it was very complex.","In comparable articles, interactivity is often used to make the data of one's own place of residence visible. In this case, ZEIT ONLINE took a different approach and used virtually no interactivity.

Instead, a separate article was published for each city. For this purpose, we created a template and filled it with data. The graphics and texts automatically adapted to the respective figures. Thus, the story was not only findable on the homepage of ZEIT ONLINE on one day, but also visible as a long-tail via search engines for people who are not regular readers.",German,https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/2022-09/gemeinde-gehalt-deutschland-vergleich-daten-entwicklung,https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/gehaelter/hamburg-gehalt-vergleich,https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/gehaelter/berlin-gehalt-vergleich,https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/gehaelter/koeln-gehalt-vergleich,https://www.zeit.de/arbeit/gehaelter/muenchen-gehalt-vergleich,,,"Paul Blickle, Annick Ehmann, Christian Endt, David Gutensohn, Carla Grefe-Huge, Valentin Peter, David Schach, Julian Stahnke, Julius Tröger, Benja Zehr","Julius Tröger leads the interdisciplinary team of data journalists, designers and developers ""Data and Visualization"".

Sweden,Sveriges Radio,Big,Participant,,Trains almost always cheaper than planes,2022-12-16,"Investigation, Podcast/radio, Chart","Scraping, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","This investigation set out to answer the question: which is cheaper, rail or air travel? 

We scraped over 22,000 ticket prices to get an answer to our question and found, to our surprise, that domestically the average price of travelling by train was cheaper than flying 9 times out of ten. Even more surprisingly, flight prices were affected more by waiting until the last minute.

Even when we made flights as cheap as possible, by removing hand luggage and by comparing only the single cheapest departure each day - hello, RyanAir - trains still beat planes seven times out of ten.","Our investigation became a big story when published in the travel-heavy week leading up to Christmas. It was picked up by national news agencies and all major outlets. 

Within Sveriges Radio, alongside the national news stories and social media output we produced, the reporters also appeared on radio to comment on the story, and we shared the data with local radio stations who used it to get a local follow-up on the story.

The results of our investigation were quite controversial and garnered quite a bit of attention from both environmentalists and proponents of flying. This quickly became obvious from the many - many! - readers and listeners getting in touch, and our story was hotly debated that week, with social media discussions and emails both praising and questioning our methods. 

The first article we published about this was the most read of any I published last year - and by far the story with the most audience feedback. 

We think this was down to the unexpected outcome. As the Royal Institute of Technology expert we spoke with said, it’s communicated in Sweden that trains are expensive, and so many intuitively think flying is cheaper. This misconception was something we were able to correct with our analysis, backed up by the rigorous method we used.","To scrape the ticket prices, we built scrapers using Python and Selenium. These were set to loop through all desired travel routes and dates - a total of over 1,000 different combinations! To optimise such a large number of requests and speed up the scrape, we used Python’s multiprocessing module to allow several requests to run concurrently. 

Once the ticket price data had been collected and saved out in csv format, the actual data analysis was done in R, largely using tidyverse packages. Grouping the data by travel type, route and date, we calculated the average and lowest price of a ticket, and then counted the number of times air or rail travel was cheaper. We also additionally grouped the data by number of weeks between the travel date and the scrape date, and were thus able to see whether air or rail travel increased more in price when booked last minute. 

Before publication, a coworker on the data team checked the scrapers and the results of the data analysis, using Python. This is a standard part of our team’s process, as we always verify one another’s results before publication, ideally using another method to reproduce the results. 

Local reports to share data with Sveriges Radio’s local radio stations were produced using R Markdown. The output of our investigation was obviously mainly radio news stories, but was also published on the Sveriges Radio website and shared on our national and local social media channels. For this, we created visualisations using R’s ggplot2 library as well as a custom-built package our team has built to create graphics in Sveriges Radio’s in-house style.","Building the scrapers was technically complex and quite time-consuming, but despite this the most difficult thing for this project was not necessarily the technical side, but - as always with data journalism - simply ensuring we were measuring the right thing. Were we getting an accurate picture of people’s travel experiences? What was the fairest method of comparison between trains and planes? 

For instance, we spent a long time debating how to look at the ticket prices - was the average price more reflective of most people’s trips, or the single cheapest ticket each day? Both have their up- and downsides, and neither paints a complete picture of reality. In the end, after discussing internally with other data journalists and with experts at the Royal Institute of Technology, we focused on the average price, as giving a more complete picture, but also looked at the single cheapest ticket each day as a secondary measure. 

Similar discussions were had over the fairness of the time period we looked at, the type of ticket collected, and so on. Going through our methods with external experts was, as usual, an invaluable step in the process.","There are a number of concrete things to take away from this project. Hopefully, of course, it’s a good example of how to use Python for a scraping project. 

Using the graphics created, the project could also be used to illustrate how to use R’s ggplot2 package for data visualisation, and also how to create a custom-made package for publication-ready visualisations in R, in an in-house style. 

The national story was broken down locally for Sveriges Radio’s local stations around Sweden, and the data was shared by programmatically creating local reports using R Markdown, something which may be of interest to other news organisations with both national and local stations.",Swedish,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/taget-nastan-alltid-billigare-an-flyget,https://sverigesradio.se/artikel/domestic-train-travel-cheaper-than-flying-in-sweden,https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F8PiZ4RxS9PkO-W81vivKrv2Z1KkxybU41rgY4eC7-0/edit#,,,,,"Clara Guibourg, Isak Krona",Clara Guibourg is a data journalist at Sveriges Radio.

Spain,Newtral.es,Small,Participant,,The streets of the women,2022-06-27,"Long-form, Open data, Infographics, Chart, Map, Women","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, OpenStreetMap","In Newtral.es we analyzed the names of 39,251 streets in 69 cities of Spain to check how many of them recall a woman. But we have not done it alone: we developed an algorithm to reduce the enormous work that would have involved identifying, reviewing, and manually annotating each and every one of the streets of the 69 cities analyzed using Open Streets Maps. Therefore, we opted for a hybrid working mode in which the algorithm automatically labeled the gender of the streets supervised by the 'human' team and retrieved the information from open sources such as Wikipedia.","The project allowed to measure for the first time the size of the gender unequality in our own streets as a sign of recognition to prestigious people in the country. To realize this special, Newtral was inspired by other projects in this field, such as those developed by Geochicas and the Mapping Diversity project. The technology team developed a crawler (an automated program that crawls and extracts content from the web) that goes through the cities that have been studied and obtain both the names of the streets and their geometries so that the bot can decide whether it refers to a person and what their gender is.","It required creating a classifier based on artificial intelligence (AI), which separates street names and identifies those that refer to male or female characters. This process is done in two steps: the first step is based on rules and dictionaries, in which the automatic association is made if the street name contains a reference to professions, aristocratic and/or religious titles that allow determining the gender (e.g., Father Damien street). A second step is based on our artificial intelligence model, in which, having identified the name of a street, it is determined whether it refers to a person and its gender (e.g., Méndez Álvaro street). The training of the AI model was performed in two phases: the first, from a set of unrevised data with the association between the name and gender of streets in different Spanish and Latin American cities. In the second phase, the model was retrained from data reviewed by the Newtral.es team of journalists for more than 20 Spanish cities. The accuracy of this second algorithm in determining the gender of a street was above 93% for the cities analyzed. Finally, for the streets that refer to a character, a new automated process performed a search in Wikidata to find information of interest about each one. For visualization, two access screens were chosen: a scrollytelling, highlighting some data in a journey through the cities and their profiles, and an interactive map with a text analyzing the data.","Almudena Grandes is the latest great female figure to enter the Spanish street map after the Madrid City Council agreed last November 27 to name a public street after her death. The writer thus joins the small group of women who have managed to be represented in the public space: streets named after women barely account for 15%. In some cities, representation is even lower, as in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Melilla and Tarragona, where they do not reach 8%. The large gender imbalance is also surrounded by the origin of the women represented in the streets, as most of them come from a religious or monarchical background. We wanted to expose this.","The project is very useful as a way to process a huge amount of data with the aid of an algorithm that helped us to analyzed the names of the streets of 69 cities to check how many streets remember a woman, how many of them are dedicated to religious, fictional or mythological characters, how many of them have a Wikipedia page, and thus evaluate their significance. Crossing these sources gave as a really interesting material to work with in a journalistic level. Including a piece of these results in a scrollytelling way was a challenge necessary to accomplish to better tell the story.",Spanish,https://www.newtral.es/las-calles-de-ellas/tour/,https://www.newtral.es/las-calles-de-ellas/mapa/,,,,,,"Javier Beltrán, Paula Boira, Abraham Carrera, Cristina Pita da Veiga, and Irene Larraz.

United States,USA TODAY,Big,Participant,,Title IX: Falling short at 50,2022-02-03,"Investigation, Database","Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Python","USA TODAY exposed how the nation's largest and most recognizable universities violate Title IX on the 50th anniversary of the landmark federal law banning sex discrimination in education. They underfund women’s sports to the tune of just 71 cents for every dollar spent on men. They shortchange women on athletic opportunities and scholarships, and they rig roster numbers to inflate their count of female athletes. Their understaffed Title IX offices struggle to investigate sexual misconduct. Some schools discourage women from reporting incidents. Few offenders are suspended or expelled. Schools violate Title IX with impunity because of toothless federal enforcement.","Our series led to major changes in the California State University system. CSU Chancellor Joseph Castro resigned amid pressure just two weeks after we published our first story in the series. CSU's Fresno campus announced it would hire two full-time deputy Title IX coordinators and a second survivor advocate, launch a task force to improve Title IX processes, and engage in a “series of efforts” to understand and improve the campus culture around sexual violence. The CSU Board of Trustees commissioned an outside assessment of CSU’s Title IX practices and reformed its “retreat rights” policy that enabled problematic administrators to avoid termination. The California state legislature ordered an audit of four CSU campuses’ Title IX and human resources programs. 

At Marshall University, students marched on campus and demanded a meeting with the campus president, who announced two days later that the school would begin the search for a new Title IX coordinator, restructure its Title IX office and strengthen its procedures.

Officials from the National Women’s Law Center, It’s On Us, Know Your IX, and Public Justice said our first-of-its-kind data analysis countered the narrative that schools weaponized Title IX to unfairly discipline male students for sexual offenses. The Trump administration cited such claims to pass new federal regulations limiting schools' ability to find alleged perpetrators at fault. Those regulations could end under rules proposed by the Biden administration.

The series also prompted action in the area of women’s sports. Four members of Congress introduced a bill in December seeking to address the problems we exposed: specifically, disparities in athletics and the lack of federal enforcement. The legislation, called the Fair Play for Women Act, requires more public reporting of athletic data by schools and gives the Secretary of Education the ability to fine schools for violating Title IX.","We used a range of data analysis techniques from complex web scraping to old-fashioned shoe-leather reporting to methodologically prove that colleges perpetuate systemic inequities in Division I sports and turn a blind eye to campus sexual misconduct.

Reporters collected data from universities and the U.S. Department of Education through a combination of public records requests, by downloading it from websites and by and writing Python programs to scrape rosters from schools’ athletic department websites and from the Track & Field Results Reporting System.

We used Tabula and Google Pinpoint’s “Extract structured data” tool to extract data from PDFs. We used the optical character recognition (OCR) tool of the Python library “tesseract” to extract text from some scanned and flattened PDFs and make it selectable.

We also manually entered reams of data, including the dollar amounts of multiple athletic department purchases from photocopied receipts, into Excel and Google spreadsheets. 

Assembled into various spreadsheets, the data formed the basis for our analyses revealing how universities disproportionately divvy up scholarship money, count male practice players as women, shortchange women’s teams while spending lavishly on men, and fail to hold accountable perpetrators of sexual misconduct. 

We studied complicated legal guidance to learn the mathematical formulas federal investigators use to assess Title IX compliance. We identified loopholes in the their methods that allow schools to comply with the letter of the law but not its spirit. We showed the harm behind the numbers by finding and earning the trust of female athletes who had faced discrimination and students who had experienced sexual misconduct.

We used Infogram and Adobe Illustrator to visualize the data into charts, graphs and other features allowing readers to interact with the numbers. We used hand-drawn illustrations and Adobe Photoshop to produce a graphic novel-type story explaining how schools rig their rosters.","At a time of unprecedented assault on women’s rights, universities should be bastions of enlightenment. Instead, they perpetuate antiquated notions about women and their bodies, especially when it comes to sports and sex, USA TODAY showed in a series of stories that built a damning case against higher education’s commitment to gender equity. 

The idea for the series was conceived in summer 2021, after we had just published more than 40 stories over eight months detailing systemic mishandling of sexual misconduct by Louisiana State University’s Title IX office and athletic department. 

USA TODAY editors and reporters wondered if LSU was an outlier or the norm: Did other universities similarly violate Title IX? 

With the 50th anniversary of Title IX being signed into law just over one year away, we set out to examine the extent to which colleges were complying with the law. Although Title IX requires schools to crack down on sexual harassment and assault, it’s best known for opening the door for women athletes to play college sports. So the team investigated compliance with both areas under the law. 

We began by defining the scope of our project. With more than 4,000 colleges nationwide, we decided to focus on the most recognizable – the 107 public institutions in the NCAA's Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, which includes some of the largest and wealthiest schools in the nation. We then launched our data-collection effort by sending waves of public records requests to each school and to the U.S. Department of Education, downloading publicly available data from websites and scraping other numbers where we could.

The data, some of it gathered in one place for the first time, proved invaluable. We were able to identify broad patterns of systemic discrimination in athletics and reveal a dismal track record of investigating and adjudicating sexual misconduct reports. We also were able to pinpoint specific schools meriting closer attention. Two of those schools – Fresno State University in California and Marshall University in West Virginia – became the focus stories that sparked immediate outcry and significant change. 

We faced numerous obstacles along the way. Several universities refused to give us data or charged us exorbitant fees. Some claimed not to have the information we sought. Some provided only partial data. Reporters spent more than a year haggling with universities. The Department of Education also dragged its feet providing records, taking more than a year to fulfill some of our requests and still owing us dozens of documents. We hounded top officials at the federal agency for months before gaining access to the head of the Office for Civil Rights for interviews. Despite their reluctance to talk or share records, no university or federal official disputed our findings or requested corrections.

While other news organizations covered Title IX on its 50th anniversary, USA TODAY’s series was by far the most comprehensive examination yet of how universities have fallen short of the law’s promise.","Sometimes the most powerful stories are hiding in plain sight. 

It was certainly no secret that universities prioritized men’s sports over women’s. One need only look at the outsized share of resources and attention lavished on college football to know the scales have long been tipped in favor of men’s athletics. Or to read study after study showing that 1 in 5 college women report being sexual assaulted at some point during their higher education to know that universities have failed to make campuses safer. 

These are not intractable problems or the unfortunate byproducts of our historically male-dominated society. They are illegal practices under a federal law that turned 50 years old last year. We used the law’s anniversary to expose exactly which universities were violating Title IX, how they were doing it and showed the harm suffered by women whose athletic opportunities were diminished and sexual assaults minimized. 

By putting hard numbers and real faces to the issue, we were able to rescue these wrongs from the realm of the intangible and show how they're actually perpetuated by universities that, for five decades, have resisted doing the right thing to fix them. 

Journalists should not shy away from reporting on problems that readers might already accept as “just the way it is.” If they can find a way to prove – with data, with sources, with deft storytelling – that these issues have both identifiable causes and common-sense solutions, they can shift the paradigm and affect societal change. 

We believe our project serves as proof of that and hope other journalists find inspiration to look for their own stories in plain sight.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/05/26/title-ix-falling-short-50-exposes-how-colleges-still-fail-women/9722521002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/02/03/cal-state-chancellor-joseph-castro-mishandled-sexual-harassment-fresno-state-title-ix-frank-lamas/9109414002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/11/16/title-ix-campus-rape-colleges-sexual-misconduct-expel-suspend/7938853001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/11/16/marshall-university-title-ix-college-sexual-assault-rape-survivors/9587150002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/03/30/title-ix-50th-anniversary-women-short-changed-major-college-sports/7090806001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/05/26/college-sports-title-ix-and-dark-illusion-gender-equity/7438716001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/08/17/female-athletes-stiffed-scholarship-money-colleges-title-ix/7640647001/,"Kenny Jacoby, Rachel Axon, Nancy Armour, Steve Berkowitz, Lindsay Schnell, Dan Wolken, Alia Dastagir, Jessica Luther, Jim Sergent, Andrea Brunty, Todd Pendleton","Our team included reporters and editors from USA TODAY's investigations, news and sports desks, as well one freelancer, who spent more than a year working together on the project.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Participant,,The Great Gap: how rich don’t pay their fair share in Spain,2022-09-25,"Investigation, Explainer, Chart, Map, Economy","Personalisation, Scraping, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio",Do the rich in Spain pay their fair share? “The Great Gap” is a journalistic project that focuses on the increasing inequalities between rich and poor in the country and reveals holes in the taxation system that allows millionaires and large companies to pay less taxes for their capital gains and business profits. elDiario.es dived in tax records and income statistics to explain how the rich avoid paying their fair share and mapped economic segregation in Spanish cities to provide context to these inequalities.,"The investigation revealed for the first time how the 0,01% of richest Spanish taxpayers benefited from a dual system that allows them to pay less taxes on gains produced from what they own instead of incomes produced by their work (link 1). We proved that these capital gains that are less taxed contributed to multiplying the gap between the super rich and the rest of the population producing income segregation mainly in large cities. “The Great Gap” also unveils how taxes to business profits have fallen due to dozens of tax reforms that have contributed to erode tax bases and reduce the tax bill, especially for large business groups and multinationals (link 3).

These revelations had a direct public impact: the Government announced fiscal measures barely a week after their publication, which included tax increases and regulatory changes that corrected part of the holes discovered in this investigation. The articles were shared by dozens of economists, politicians and stakeholders during the week it was published. Also the four pieces have been viewed by more than half million users and they were of the most visited this year. The project was not only text and charts and it was adapted to other channels. The project was intended to be transferable to other formats in order to reach more and different audiences. That's why we did an episode of our daily podcast that reaches more than 20.000 users per day and delivered a targeted social media campaign to reach younger audiences in TikTok and Instagram. The stories opened elDiario.es' front page for 3 consecutive days, making other citizens engage with the topic.","We used Google Spreadsheets, Excel and R programming language to compile for data compilation and analysis. Datawrapper, Javascript and D3 for graphics and data visualizations. Mapbox and Javascript for census block maps.","The hardest part of the project was to obtain and understand official tax records that proved the gap between the 0,01% richest and the rest of taxpayers in Spain. We searched dozens of Tax National Agency documents to obtain the data and also to comprehend which numbers we had to use. For example, we examined all double taxation agreements signed by several Spanish Governments to unveil how multinational companies can use them to pay zero taxes for repatriating dividends. This investigation of income and business taxes paid by the rich was combined with personal income database analysis of more than 36.000 censal blocks.

For example, we programmed a R script that analyzes which income sources are more important in each neighborhood in the country that revealed how capital gains compute a third of rich neighborhood earnings. We also revealed dozens of income islands from automatic processing in R of income statement records that show income borders and economic segregation in Spanish cities. 

Furthermore, the project used educational journalism techniques: we did not want to only demonstrate the inequalities but make them understandable to readers. The pieces included interactive data visualizations and scrolling narratives that helped understand high volumes of data and technical explanations. For example, the specific fiscal aspects that allow rich people to not pay their fair share: the story explains, step by step, how people who earn their income from salaries pay more taxes in Spain than people who earn the same income from stock market investments and real estate or capital gains.","This project shows how the information available in official tax records could be exploited in other countries to check if the richest 0,01% and large companies are paying their fair share in other jurisdictions. Are these trends repeated in Europe, America or Asia? Is inequality growing in the rest of the world?

This one can be a transnational investigation to analyze the gaps of effective rates between income percentiles in all countries and also how income sources are important to determine if a household is rich or poor.

Climate change brought to the country record temperatures and lack of rainfall. These had consequences in water reserves, fire activity and mortality. elDiario.es monitored maximum temperatures, wildfires, basin water levels and excess deaths during the whole season and published automated articles to track how these different indicators were evolving in comparison to previous years. The collected data and rolling analisis was also used to inform and contextualize, in various moments, the records that had been broken.","Our record summer coverage included a maximum temperatures tracker (link 2) and a wildfires tracker (link 4) that were updated every morning. Apart from the daily automated reports, we periodically updated our articles about dam water levels (for example, link 5) and excess deaths during heatwaves (link 7). 

We were the only media in Spain that published a daily tracker during the summer. This allowed the audience to verify with data if their feelings of it being a hotter or colder summer than the previous one in their region, or one with more surface being burnt, were real. They shared their specific territorial visualizations on social media. So it was a public service tool to raise awareness about the consequences of climate change. 

As we had the data collected, we used it to publish a final overview of how hot the summer had been (link 3) and a historical analysis of the increase in tropical nights in different cities. A similar historical analysis was published about how this summer Spain experienced a record in deaths caused by hot temperatures (link 6). 

Apart from the usefulness, some of the pieces included in this coverage were highlighted by its use of interactive data visualizations that helped understand and access a high volume of data.","To automatise the data collection from multiple sources (for example, the Spanish climate agency API for the hourly temperatures data) and in different formats (for example, shapefiles from the NASA for the wildfires data) we used R. The same software was used for data wrangling, analysis and automatic update of the visualizations, which were created using Datawrapper, Flourish, Javascript, D3.js and Canvas. To illustrate the articles about wildfires and dams, we used a slider of Copernicus satellite images programmed with Javascript.","To develop this series of articles, reports and trackers, we needed to look for data from many different sources. Selecting the ones that best explained the problem and putting them all together in a fast and automated way was one of the challenges of this project. 

We programmed an R script for each indicator that put together some manually collected data with automatic downloads in various formats and compared this summer data with previous ones. With the same code, charts and visualizations were updated just with a click. 

Also, apart from the trackers, the situation analysis included examples and expert voices to contextualize the data and visualizations, so we made sure we delivered a global approach of the climate change problem and its multiple faces.","With this series of articles we show the importance of talking about weather not only for forecasts. We interpreted and visualized the daily temperature data so that the reader could understand whether or not what was happening was normal. In this way we brought a global problem as the climate change problem closer to the audience daily life.

We also linked different events together as they were different sides of the same problem: deaths caused by heat waves, drought or wildfires are all consequences of climate change. And we approached this problem linking its causes and consequences, not as if they were single and apart events. 
 
It also showed that live data monitoring and visualization, widely used nowadays for the pandemic coverago, can be exported to other fields.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/son-5-am-20-grados-noches-tropicales-multiplican-cuatro-ciudades-espanolas_1_9263791.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/calor-record-media-espana-verano-caluroso-30-provincias-hay-registros_1_9283908.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/ola-calor-provincia-compara-temperatura-verano-historica-calentamiento-mapas-graficos-septiembre-2_1_9165639.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/peor-ano-superficie-quemada-30-anos-evolucionan-incendios-activos-espana-agosto-31_1_9189252.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/espana-inicia-otono-embalses-vacios-siglo_1_9559866.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/verano-mortal-1950-espana-registra-20-000-muertes-esperadas-junio-agosto_1_9278237.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/calor-mata-mortalidad-dispara-olas-vez-extremas_1_9217920.html,"Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres, Ana Ordaz, Raúl Rejón, Carmen Martínez","Raúl Sánchez: Spanish data journalist covering stories of inequality, health, taxes and urbanism at elDiario.es.

I researched who people dreamt about, what did they feel like and what did they do. Most of dreams were scary, people felt fear and unsuccessfully tried to do anything. Vladimir Putin was the most often ""guest"" of the dreams, followed by Volodymir Zelensky and Ekaterina Shulman, a popular opposition political expert.","Total coverage is almost 6,000 views, however, overall impact of this project is a bit hard to measure. The dreams research is a way to document reality in times when the human capacity for self-deception increases. I also hope that people who stay in Russia and don't support the government saw that they are not alone to live those painful feelings they can’t do much with, that there are a lot of people with similar fears and antagonism to the war. The psychoanalytic I interviewed stated that even telling a dream to someone helps coping with the distress. As for the colleagues, a Russian independent media ""Bumaga"" (""Paper"") took an interview with me and one of the sociology student about the working process and the results, and our projects was [mentioned](https://twitter.com/gijn/status/1598619467038134272) by Global Investigative Journalism Network on Twitter and their [website](https://gijn.org/2022/12/07/top-10-ddj-chempionat-mira-po-futbolu-snyi-rossiyan-vo-vremya-voynyi-i-ozvuchivanie-diagramm/). I also wrote an article about the research for The Nightingale Magazine, hope to see it published soon.","We first asked people to fill the Google Form and describe their dreams. Then we had a Google document with their answers. Then we read them and manually marked them by the role of the dreamer, the emotions (using the emotion wheel theory) and by the actions they took. So we used:

– Excel to analyse the collected data and make it machine readable and ready for visualization;
– Python spaCy library to drag the proper nouns so that we knew which famous people, relatives and places the dreamers mentioned, lemmatizied them and then could count their occurrences;
– Flourish to create interactive Sankey charts;
– Illustrator to draw the static infographics;
– Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E to illustrate the dreams' plots;
– Figma to create the website prototype and pictures for sharing on social media;
– Readymag to publish the project.","I suppose the political landscape is more or less known, however, I'd like to tell a bit about the situation in Russia. On December, 26 a man got an administrative penalty because he wrote in his instagram that he had a dream about Volodymir Zelensky. People, especially the younger one and with an active civic position feel extremely under pressure because of the censorship. We made sure of that reading the dreams people sent us, of course, anonymously. Only one from four sociology students agreed that I mentioned her in the authors section – she had left Russia before. Others were afraid because of the word ""war"" used in the article, the word which Russian officials prohibit to use to describe the invasion. These are minor threats, however even dreams are not safe from repression: some plots might be interpreted as ""defamation of the army"", and publishing them may lead to a keen interest on the part of the police.","Even topics which seem too abstract and which presume only qualitative data can be approached. There are a lot of bright themes which get undercovered every time because authors don't know how to enrich them with data and what methodology to apply. Also, data collected and marked by you manually makes your project outstanding, not necessarily amateur. 

While working for a media outlet, I often heard from my editor that the ideas I bring to status meetings require too many resources and are therefore out of that media format. I find the word ""format"" destroying creativity. I mean, I understand the editor and his worries, but to me there is nothing better than combining everything that exists in journalism: reporting, telling stories, interviewing, data analysis. This gives much a broader picture.","English, Russian",https://readymag.com/u94255285/wardreams/2/,https://readymag.com/u94255285/wardreams/,,,,,,"Caroline Nugumanova, Karina Levitina, Yana Sosnovskaya, Anna K, Liubov Popovets.

Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Participant,,How the probability of giving birth with a C-section in Spain depends on the hospital a woman goes to,2022-10-16,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Open data, Chart, Map, Women, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio","A journalistic investigation that reveals for the first time in Spain the rate of caesarean sections across 360 public and private hospitals, that allow the public to determine if hospital’s are using more than medical criteria to define how a woman should give birth. By unveiling the data hidden in anonymized records requested by the journalists to the Health Ministry, the project investigated the phenomena behind the data on how a C-section is determined by resources, weekdays, doctor’s schedules or the health policy of your hospital or region, among other reasons.","For the first time, we revealed the C-section rates of almost all public and private hospitals in Spain. Never before have women and citizens in the country have had this data available to make better informed decisions about their childbirth. In fact, making this available as a service was the main goal of this project. For example, this investigation allowed a lot of hospital managers and chiefs of obstetrics to know their C-section rate in comparison with other hospitals of the country, their region or even the same city, which could lead to a change of policies based on data. 

The investigation reveals that 28 hospitals had a C-section rate of more than 45%, roughly triple the ideal rate, an indicator that these centers are doing unnecessary C-sections.

In addition, several organizations related to the promotion of natural childbirth shared the research and congratulated the newspaper for revealing this data. This publication also opened a sharing space, during days women in social media shared their experiences of obstetric violence or cases of scheduled births with C-sections without being needed. This interaction showed how the data is related to personal experiences and proved a systematic phenomena. 

The core investigative team collaborated with our regional editions to do powerful and local stories about causes that explain the rates of individual hospitals or about health policies carried out by regional health departments. More than 20 pieces were published in the investigation including a podcast episode. The main publication has been viewed by more than 200.000 users and it was one of the most visited this year. The story opened the elDiario.es front page for two consecutive days and it was included in Top 10 Data Journalism Projects from 2022 at GIJN.","We used Google Spreadsheets, Excel and R programming language for data compilation and analysis. Datawrapper, Javascript and D3 for data visualization.","The information was obtained after a legal battle lasting several months in which the government refused to provide the information. This project started with a freedom of information request where we asked for the C-sections rates of all hospitals in Spain. Information that is held by the Ministry of Health but has never been released to the public. First, the Government declined to reveal this data. elDiario.es sent a complaint to the Transparency Council, the body in charge of ensuring compliance with the law, which agreed with this media and forced the Government to send the requested information. The Ministry of Health understood it in its own way and they sent us the anonymized records on C-section deliveries of each hospital in Spain, but unidentified. 

To identify all hospitals included in the anonymized records, we cross-reference these data with open data sources like annual reports, official websites, public documents, health databases, scientific papers and archived websites. Finally we were able to detect 360 Spanish public and private hospitals in our data.

This analysis lead us to prove that the probability of giving birth by caesarean section multiplies depending on the hospital a woman goes to. This analysis shows the wide disparities of the C-section rate between regions, public and private hospitals or even between hospitals located in the same city.

We interviewed more than 20 obstetricians, experts, doctors, hospital managers and senior officials to understand the reasons behind this gap between hospitals. For example: the lack of resources of some public hospitals located in rural areas, the economic approach of private health sector where doctors schedule births on weekdays to avoid working on weekends or holidays or preventing natural birthing, the interventional model of childbirth or the outdated protocols of some hospitals that indicates a caesarian section in case of any complication.","This project proves that we journalists can fight against Governments that don’t want to disclose information and it shows other colleagues that anonymized data can be desanonymized. The identity of public institutions (like hospitals) shouldn’t be protected because accountability of public administration is essential in democracy. This investigation of hospitals that abuse C-sections creates a methodology to cross-reference anonymized records with open data sources that can be copied by other professionals.

Also, it can inspire journalists from other countries to request public data on C-section rates in all hospitals to analyze the evolution of the medicalization of childbirth in each country and also to check if the probability of giving birth with a C-section depends on the hospital a woman goes to. Is there a trend in other countries to give birth with a caesarian section or to schedule births on working days to avoid holidays? This can be a crossborder project that tries to collect hospital data from a list of countries.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/mapa-tasa-cesareas-espana-hospitales-abusan-partos-quirurgicos_1_9545161.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/parir-hospital-privado-influye-edad-madres-probabilidad-cesarea_1_9581255.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/buscador-consulta-tasa-partos-cesarea-hospital-espana_1_9622470.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/datos-senalan-programan-cesareas-espana-evitar-partos-semana-festivos_1_9636522.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/norte-sur-cesareas-espana_1_9579935.html,https://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/fabricas-cesareas-alicante-ciudad-real-hospitales-tasas-elevadas-espana-60_1_9621260.html,https://www.eldiario.es/euskadi/maniobra-atender-bebes-nalgas-convierte-euskadi-comunidad-cesareas_1_9620553.html,"Raúl Sánchez, Ana Requena, Sandra Vicente, Lucracia Hevia, Maialen Ferreira, Francisca Bravo, Laura Martínez","Raúl Sánchez: journalist and coordinator of elDiario.es data team.

En esta investigación trasnacional entre ambos medios investigamos quiénes eran las principales figuras en las redes de desinformación durante la pandemia. Pudimos comprobar cómo Heiko Schöning creó 'Médicos por la verdad' en Alemania, uno de los principales grupos desinformadores, y cómo luego esté salto a España, donde lo fundó Victoria Prego y de ahí acabó saltando a Latinoamérica. Además, pudimos comprobar la organización y relaciones que tienen entre ellos y cómo actúan coordinadamente.","La investigación publicada en Maldita.es y Correctiv funcionó muy bien entre el público de ambos medios, fue de lo más leído en el momento de su publicación. También tuvo una buena distribución en redes sociales.

En cuanto al contenido, permitió a ambas redacciones y otros medios especializados en fact-checking y lucha contra la desinformación, conocer en mucha mayor profundidad el origen, entramado y relaciones de los negacionistas de la pandemia de la COVID-19. De hecho, sirvió también para que el público general conociera cómo funcionan y actúan los negacionistas y de donde venían. Más en un momento en el que estaban en el centro de la opinión pública debido a toda la desinformación que ha habido durante la pandemia. También sirvió a otros sectores interesados en esta temática como académicos e investigadores. Nuestra investigación pretendía, como medios especializados en desinformación, poner el foco en estos grupos de los que estabamos 'hartos' de desmentir falsedad tras falsedad durante toda la pandemia y descubrir sus relaciones y 'modus operandi'. Creemos que es algo fundamental que hicieramos esto como redacciones expertas en fact-checking, pero también en investigación y periodismo de datos. Además, en ese momento el debate público estaba muy embarrado y era muy necesario poner luz sobre estos grupos.

Gracias a esa investigación pudimos ver como este tipo de grupos nació en Europa con el 'Médicos por la verdad' alemán y después fue saltando a otros países, entre ellos España, donde se creo otra versión de 'Médicos por la verdad', que acabó saltando a Latinoamérica. También pudimos comprobar que no actúaban de forma aislada, sino que se relacionaban entre sí, que en la mayoría de grupos había miembros que también formaban parte de otros y que los principales líderes, Heiko Schöning en Alemania y Natalia Priego en España, tenían relación entre ellos.","Para poder realizar la investigación recopilamos multitud de información para crear bases de datos y poder analizar y estudiar a los grupos negacionistas de forma sistémica.

Así recopilamos la información de los principales grupos desinformadores en Alemania, España y otros países europeos y recogimos en qué redes o aplicaciones on-line tenían presencia, en qué eventos participaban, con qué otros grupos tenían relación y qué portavoces, cargos y miembros tenían, entre otros datos. Así pudimos ir tejiendo las relaciones entre ellos y acabar visualizándolo en un gráfico de nodos. Comprobamos que los principales protagonistas de la red europea de corona-negacionistas eran el alemán Schöning y la española Prego. 

También recopilamos la información sobre los eventos internacionales de ambos líderes para tener una base de datos y poder saber a dónde habían acudido a eventos negacionistas, con quién intervenían y cuánto coincidían entre ellos. No sólo analizamos sus coincidencias en eventos, recopilamos todas las personas que eran anunciadas en estos eventos para también ver las relaciones entre los otros líderes europeos del negacionismo pandémico.

Este trabajo de datos reveló que los otros grupos negacionistas que habían surgido tenían relación con los primeros de 'Médicos por la verdad'. Además, compartían miembros entre sí y participaban de los mismos eventos. De hecho, en el caso de España en Maldita.es pudimos comprobar que se habían creado otros grupúsculos de supuestas profesiones 'por la verdad' a raíz de esos primeros 'Médicos por la verdad'. Muchos de ellos, además, se dedicaban a pedir dinero a las personas que consumían sus contenidos o donaciones en internet para poder financiarse y seguir con esta actividad desinformadora a nivel internacional.

Con toda esa información utilizamos distintas herramientas para realizar visualizaciones que permitieran comprender más fácilmente nuestras informaciones, datos y hallazgos a nuestros lectores. Usamos mapas, gráficos de nodos, tablas, explainers...","Para este proyecto los periodistas de ambos medios estuvieron consultando e investigado durante meses tanto canales como grupos de Telegram de negacionistas de la pandemia, ya que esta aplicación debido a su baja moderación es primordial en la distribución de desinformación, aunque también se observó y rastreó su presencia en otras redes sociales. Investigando esos grupos pudimos ver qué personas formaban parte de ellos públicamente y qué líderes y portavoces tenían. También pudimos ver cómo en los distintos países repiten los mismos argumentos y desinformaciones y cómo reenvian los mismos contenidos y comparten eventos y estrategias públicas.

Este tipo de grupos son muy hostiles con los medios de comunicación y aún más con los dedicados a la verificación de datos y al fact-checking. Cuando se publicó la investigación varios de los desinformadores cargaron contra Maldita.es y Correctiv, principalmente a través de sus canales de Telegram. Además, para la investigación los periodistas no sólo ejercieron periodismo de datos, también realizamos un periodismo más tradicional consultando fuentes personales y hablando con los entornos de varios de los cabecillas de la red, como sus colegios profesionales (varios eran médicos o abogados, por ejemplo) o sus antiguos lugares de trabajo.

No sólo acumulamos la información de sus miembros públicos y los eventos de los que participaba o promocionaba el grupo, también compilamos en nuesta base de datos en qué redes sociales tenía presencia cada grupo, si tenían página web propia, si estaban constituidos de alguna forma legal como podía ser una asociación, con qué otros grupos tenían relaciones o conexiones, si tenian una dirección física pública y mucha más información. Todo ese trabajo lento, arduo y de investigación nos permitió crear nuestra propia base de datos única y poder conocer en profunidad cómo actúan y cómo se relacionan. Por nuestro trabajo como medios especializados en desinformación teníamos algunas hipótesis e indicios, pero sin todo ese trabajo de periodismo de datos e investigación no podríamos haberlas comprobado ni extraer muchas otras conclusiones y descubrir otros hallazgos que alcanzamos con esta investigación.

También recopilamos las aparaciones en eventos negacionistas en público de todos los miembros públicos de cada grupo y los discursos que habían hecho para poder estudiar cómo se conocían entre sí, montaban eventos conjuntos, compartían estrategia y tenían un discurso común.","Consideramos que lo más interesante de nuestro proyecto a nivel periodístico es que es un buen ejemplo de que tejer alianzas transnacionales es fundamental hoy en día para realizar periodismo de investigación en general y sobre todo para realizar investigaciones basadas en periodismo de datos, como es este caso. Esta organización y coordinación completa que tuvimos entre ambas redacciones, trabajando con archivos compartidos, motando una base de datos conjunta, con reuniones periódicas y comunicación constante, nos permitió comprobar que las redes que podíamos considerar aisladas en nuestros propios países en realidad eran una red internacional mucho más grande que actuaba de forma coordinada y compartiendo 'modus operandi' a nivel internacional.

Para poder desde el periodismo parar las mentiras que estaban contaminando el discurso público necesitábamos como medios de distintos países trabajar de forma coordinada e investigar conjuntamente, ya que los desinformadores precisamente estaban actúando de forma coordinada y conjunta. Por ello, consideramos que hacer la investigación fue una decisión totalmente acertada y que se puede aprender en ese sentido de la importancia de colaboración entre medios y de la realización de investigaciones a nivel internacional en una materia como es la desinformación.

Cada vez, además, está más claro que el contexto global en el que vivimos y con el gran alcance que puede tomar cualquier contenido en el mundo digital el problema de la desinformación es un asunto global y no endémico de cada país. Por ello, tenemos que abordarlo de forma conjunta como periodistas, investigar en común y enfrentar la desinformación como un reto global que nos sacude e incumbe a todos.","Spanish, German, English",https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220407/european-network-corona-denier-spain-germany/,https://correctiv.org/faktencheck/hintergrund/2022/04/06/wie-die-corona-leugner-ein-internationales-netzwerk-aufbauten-heiko-schoening-haintz-prego-coronaleugner-europa/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220406/negacionistas-coronavirus-europa-espana-alemania/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220407/biologos-policias-abogados-corona-negacionistas/,https://maldita.es/tag/corona-negacionistas,,,"Rubén Díaz Grano de Oro, Alice Echtermann, Tania Röttger, Sergio Sangiao Pérez, Matthias Bau, Sarah Thust, Uschi Jonas, Sophie Timmermann, Ana Gómez Parra, Laura Chaparro Domínguez","Maldita.es es una fundación y medio sin ánimo de lucro que lucha contra la desinformación y promueve la transparencia a través del fact-checking y el periodismo de datos.

We analyzed interest in the term 'racism' and related words through Google Trends searches, and we reviewed images in the Wikipedia entries. We also extracted texts from Twitter in which we could see the reflection of this very subtle thing we were trying to report: the denial of being racist with comments that are racist.","Several organizations and recognized voices in the sector reflected the impact of the special report to address a topic that rarely has a place in the media. In Spain, racial gaslighting is found through the denial of racism itself, the minimization of the facts and the absence of political action, all of them are difficult to measure.","For this special, we wanted to go beyond the traditional data on the subject, which referred to data on hate crimes, and we sought to explore alternative data sources.

Or one of the most recent, stating in Congress that ""having the DNI does not mean being Spanish"" and that ""Spain is a historical project that cannot be open to just anyone"". Even more difficult to perceive racism: that of not recognizing the diversity that makes up Spanish society today. For all these reasons, it seemed relevant to show how in politics and society there is a racial gaslighting effect.","With this special report we lost the fear of exploring data in a different way. For example, how to interpret the date referred to in the images associated with the term 'racism' in Wikipedia, and try to extrapolate that data to tell a story of how racism is approached in Spain today, from a distant perspective and interpreted as something external.

[Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/)","Consumers often shy away from buying electric vehicles (EVs) because EVs cost more than fuel-based cars. But EVs are cheaper on the road since one doesn’t need to purchase fuel every week. They often wonder how long it will take for that shiny new electric vehicle to pay off its extra cost compared to a petrol/diesel car? Well, this handy free tool, created by Business Today called [EVnomics](https://www.businesstoday.in/electric-vs-non-electric-vehicle-bt-evnomics-best-tool-to-calculate-ownership-cost-of-an-EV), first of its kind, has got you covered. Just enter the cars you want to compare, and your daily running and the EVnomics tool will give you a detailed report on it.","[EVnomics](https://www.businesstoday.in/electric-vs-non-electric-vehicle-bt-evnomics-best-tool-to-calculate-ownership-cost-of-an-EV) was pushed to production in the month of December 2022. However, in less than a month since its launch we have received positive feedback from our audiences and users of this tool as it fills a much-needed void consumers face while purchasing a car and especially while buying an EV, as it costs more than its fuel-based counterpart.

The easy-to-use, visually appealing interface has been appreciated by many users of the EVnomics tool, as this is one of a kind solution in the Indian automobile industry that helps consumers make a more informed, intelligent, and smart choice while purchasing their favourite car.

Other impacts of EVnomics is the data-driven and transparent approach used in comparing the fuel based cars with their electric counterparts. As it helps the readers with a deeper understanding of the tentative costs, they are likely to incur in future on the car of their choice. 

Many users of the tool have also liked the user experience, aesthetics and gamification used to present data and information to make complex calculations behind the methodology of comparing the two cars more accessible and easy to understand in a form of a race to a much wider audience.","Powered by the loaded analytical data covering 940 cars from 31 brands sold in the Indian market, the [EVnomics](https://www.businesstoday.in/electric-vs-non-electric-vehicle-bt-evnomics-best-tool-to-calculate-ownership-cost-of-an-EV) tool is truly interactive and a revolution in India's digital business news space. Its web interface allows the audience to compare all the available EVs in India with other comparable petrol/diesel car models. It also gives the user an option to choose their estimated daily run. Available on both mobile and desktop versions, the free tool was designed and developed using various tools and technologies as mentioned below. 

Design - User interface of the EVnomics is created using the design tool [Figma](https://www.figma.com/login). We have paired interaction and animation to gamify the interface. We have made EVnomics stand out from the generic and created a friendly and inviting environment for the users. With simplified steps, the tool allows users to focus on one feature at a time while featuring helpful and visually pleasing micro animation for new users. We have given our users a colorful and aesthetically harmonious overview making the tool all the more delightful to navigate and meaningful to use.

Development - We used [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) (an open-source JavaScript library for building interactive data visualizations) and the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework, an open-source web application framework for the development. We also used [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/) to integrate different animations and transitions, as it is lightweight, works on any platform, and is easily scalable.

Data - The proprietary data and analytics from our sister publication [Auto Today](https://www.magzter.com/IN/India-Today-Group/Auto-Today/Automotive/) powers the EVnomics tool. Keeping the dynamic nature of the car and fuel prices, we have designed and developed EVnomics with a flexibility to update the backend data of items such as car and fuel prices etc., as and when they are revised in the market.","When it comes to electric vehicles (EVs) in Indian markets, there are many unknowns. EVs are priced significantly higher than their alternate fuel engine counterparts, and even the servicing and maintenance requirements are very different. The question that every potential new car buyer wants to be answered is - will they EV recoup the extra money spent on the EVs, and if yes, how much time will it take to do so?

Created by [Business Today's](https://www.businesstoday.in/) Innovista Lab, the BT [EVnomics](https://www.businesstoday.in/electric-vs-non-electric-vehicle-bt-evnomics-best-tool-to-calculate-ownership-cost-of-an-EV) tool is India's first data-driven authoritative solutions journalism tool that can answer such questions.

It intends to declutter an extremely jumbled marketplace and help consumers make more informed and smart choices. It can also help policymakers understand if the present subsidies and relaxations on EVs are enough to support the general consumer's preference for green tech over traditional fuel-based cars.

The interactive and responsive design is tailor-made to keep the users engaged, share and re-use the tool multiple times with the cars of their choice. 

The unique and custom race interface between a selected fuel-based car and a selected EV stimulates a car race experience while providing a calculative estimation of the cost incurred on fuel/charging and maintenance of both cars by the users in the future. 

The tool is powered by the proprietary data and extensive analytics from our sister publication [Auto Today](https://www.magzter.com/IN/India-Today-Group/Auto-Today/Automotive/) , a top leading magazine in India on auto industry.

Apart from the racing stimulation, the ability to edit and change the backend data on car pricing and fuel costs is one of the features incorporated in the tool. This has been done while keeping in view the dynamic nature of the car and fuel prices, which makes the EVnomics an evergreen and more relevant tool with a much longer shelf life.

We did extensive referencing to find relevant examples, online games to put together a smooth user experience in EVnomics. The tool allows a user to first choose a car manufacturer of their choice and a fuel-based car model, then prompts to pick an alternate EV car they plan to compare. Next the user needs to feed in how much distance they typically drive daily, and the EVnomics will do the rest of the calculations.

The web-based solution contains a car race simulation between the chosen EV and fuel-based car, and includes smart placements over the racetrack, pit stops and finish point. The pit stops appearing during the race contain valuable snippets to inform consumers regarding the annual costs incurred on each type of vehicle per year. At the end, the tool gives a timeframe, by when a user will be able to recover the extra money spent on purchasing the EV.

To conclude, we have also incorporated the opinions of the experts in the form of informative nuggets for better understanding of users to help them make informed choices.","[EVnomics](https://www.businesstoday.in/electric-vs-non-electric-vehicle-bt-evnomics-best-tool-to-calculate-ownership-cost-of-an-EV) is a part of the data-driven solutions journalism. It is powered by the data and analytics of more than 940 cars from 31 manufacturers available with our sister publication [Auto Today](https://www.magzter.com/IN/India-Today-Group/Auto-Today/Automotive/), one of the top leading magazines on Auto industry in India.

EVnomics is India's first definitive solution that helps the new generation of smart customers examine if their EV would fulfil its promise of being cost effective than its petrol/diesel counterparts and in how much time they would be able to recover the extra money spent on the EV. 

With countless electric vehicles coming to the market on a daily basis coupled with bags of promises, the consumers have no way of knowing if the extra money spent on the EVs could be recouped in near future or not. Potential car buyers struggle to calculate how much time it would take to redeem the extra cost spent or premium paid on a particular EV. Keeping the young, tech savvy customers in mind, the EVnomics has an interactive design with a comprehensible methodology. As, the EVnomics comes to the rescue of a disempowered reader by the multiple car options available at their disposal. 

It provides a solution to a much-needed problem to already overwhelmed consumers in today’s world. This type of solutions journalism has the potential to empower readers by providing them with much needed information and inspiration to take more informed decision and action in their daily lives.

Rather than simply highlighting the problem, it is the need of the hour to come up with more and more such data and fact/evidence driven journalistic solutions for the readers.

United States,The New York Times,Big,Participant,,Inside the Apocalyptic Worldview of ‘Tucker Carlson Tonight’,2022-04-30,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Database, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Audio, Elections, Politics","Animation, Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, Python, For the Tucker Carlson story: Google Sheets, Adobe Illustrator, JavaScript, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Premiere and Adobe After Effects","The project is an investigation into the apocalyptic narrative of the most-watched show on cable news. The backbone of the story is a rigorous data effort conducted by a team of Times reporters. It definitively and quantitatively demonstrates that the show has been a platform for legitimizing white nationalism and other extremist ideologies since it began in 2016. 

The Times’s unprecedented reporting takes readers on a journey into the conspiratorial worldview that Mr. Carlson paints night after night for his more than three million viewers. The systematic analysis captures the scope and scale of the dangers posed by the show.","The data investigation became the [framing](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/30/us/tucker-carlson-gop-republican-party.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article) of The Times’s Tucker Carlson series, which also included two narrative stories. It provided the evidence needed to unequivocally characterize the show as promoting white nationalism and other extremist ideologies. The data project was one of the most-read articles on The Times's website the week it was published and has been widely cited by government officials, advocacy organizations and the news media as the authoritative source for understanding the dangers that Tucker Carlson poses. Senator Chuck Schumer referenced the project’s conclusions in a [letter](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/in-new-letter-to-rupert-murdoch-and-fox-news-executives-schumer-implores-fox-news-to-immediately-cease-dissemination-of-racist-great-replacement-theory-echoed-by-buffalo-mass-murderer) after the Buffalo mass shooting urging Rupert Murdoch and other Fox News executives to acknowledge “their role in the insidious spread of false far-right, white nationalist conspiracy theories like the ‘Great Replacement Theory.’” The analysis was also [cited](https://www.rules.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Nelson%20Testimony.pdf) in a Senate hearing about threats to democracy. Amy Spitalnick, executive director of Integrity First for America, a pro-democracy group, lauded the investigation for putting “concrete numbers behind Tucker Carlson’s normalization of white supremacist Replacement Theory.” Rachel Maddow [praised The Times](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/08/exclusive-rachel-maddow-gives-her-first-interview-as-she-steps-back) for deconstructing the show. The Poynter Institute for Media Studies commended the “incredibly detailed reporting.”","In order to trace the origins of Mr. Carlson’s rhetoric, the team systematically reviewed language used by the most extreme fringes of society and consulted experts in authoritarianism and propaganda about the findings. From this, they created a strict methodology for the data collection so that an apple-to-apples analysis would be possible.

The team then got to work watching and reading the transcripts of every show Tucker Carlson hosted from Nov. 14, 2016, through 2021. Video clips of the show were downloaded from the Internet Archive’s TV News Archive. Transcripts were pulled from LexisNexis. Segments were manually categorized and time-stamped in Google Sheets and meticulously sourced in corresponding Google Documents. 

The team also counted the number of guests appearing in the 1,150 episodes based on whether the person agreed or disagreed with Mr. Carlson. The amount of time that Mr. Carlson spent speaking directly into the camera, uninterrupted, was also recorded, then the number of words were counted to track the length of his monologues.","Tucker Carlson made headlines in April 2021 for promoting white replacement theory. Many believed it was the first time he had done so. A small group of reporters and editors began to think about creative ways to capture and quantify Mr. Carlson’s racism and divisiveness. They wanted to go beyond just showing anecdotal examples of Mr. Carlson’s extreme language, which other news organizations had already done. 

Times journalists explored ways to do the investigation programmatically, through computer-driven language processing, but decided that this approach would not allow for the kind of nuanced, contextual analysis that would recognize the subtleties of his rhetorical manipulation. They also considered reviewing a subset of the shows, but decided that only a sweeping, comprehensive survey would be authoritative. 

So they started watching and encoding every episode, building their own thorough database by hand. The data team’s unprecedented reporting revealed that Mr. Carlson had persistently pushed racist, misogynistic and anti-Semitic theories since his show launched in November 2016, correcting a public misperception that the show had only recently become more extreme.

Watching about 700 hours of the show and reading thousands of pages of transcripts was challenging in itself. It required perseverance over more than six months for several Times journalists. To put this in context, it would take a single person five months to continuously watch 700 hours of a show during normal work hours. And encoding data while watching quickly increases the time needed because of the need to go back and watch portions to ensure they were recorded correctly. 

Once the team assembled the entire database, the challenge shifted to narrowing down the thesis, to present the massive dataset as a story that readers could easily follow. The team tried several different story forms, working through numerous storyboards. The team landed on an interactive form that would show the breadth of the reporting and let readers experience what it’s like to watch the show every night. 

In crafting the narrative, the journalists took extra care to make sure that the piece was not amplifying Mr. Carlson’s rhetoric, but rather explaining his techniques while clearly letting readers know fact from fiction.","Sometimes it’s necessary to build a dataset from scratch when one is not available. Automated techniques have the potential to make large data collection easier, but some data projects need human curation. The experience of collecting the data yourself can lead to unexpected insights that you might miss if you have too much distance from the raw material.",English,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/04/30/us/tucker-carlson-tonight.html,,,,,,,"Karen Yourish, Weiyi Cai, Larry Buchanan, Aaron Byrd, Barbara Harvey, Blacki Migliozzi, Rumsey Taylor, Josh Williams and Michael Zandlo","This project included journalists working for the Graphics, Video, and Digital News Design Desks."

Will the storage facilities last through the winter? How are the prices for gas, electricity and gasoline developing? Will enough wind turbines and solar plants be built to achieve the energy turnaround? ZEIT ONLINE's energy monitor answers these and other questions with daily updated data in a separate article (zeit.de/energiemonitor) and as a dashboard directly on the homepage (www.zeit.de).","ZEIT ONLINE was the first medium in Germany to visualize all important key figures on energy supply in Germany and to classify them in data-based analyses. The focus is on both the acute gas crisis and the medium-term transformation to a climate-neutral energy system. We always compare the actual development with targets resulting, for example, from the Energy Security Act or climate targets.

For the first time, key figures from various authorities, companies and NGOs have been compiled and made as easy as possible for non-experts in the field to understand. With the Energy Monitor, we have tapped into new data sources that have now become standard in reporting in Germany. 

The Energy Monitor not only maps data from various sources, but also contains its own, exclusively calculated indicators. For example, we calculate a value for gas savings adjusted for the effect of fluctuating temperatures. To do this, we link gas consumption data with temperature measurements from the German Meteorological Service and apply to them a statistical model that we developed ourselves in the editorial office. We have derived an expansion path for solar and wind energy with annual expansion targets up to the year 2030 from the requirements of the Renewable Energy Sources Act. Every day, we scrape an extensive national register of all power generation units to compare the expansion actually realized with these targets.

The Energy Monitor provides numerous readers with important orientation in the energy crisis that also threatens many private households. We know from numerous discussions that the Energy Monitor is also used intensively as a source of information by the top echelons of government, the energy industry and the scientific community.","The Energy Monitor shows data sets from very different authorities and institutions. Using scripts in Python and R, we regularly query our sources, prepare the data, and store it in a central PostgreSQL database. To make the database accessible to the frontend, we use a Hasura instance. Through it, we can flexibly retrieve our data via GraphQL.

We develop the frontend with React and the Javascript library D3. A self-developed build tool based on Vite allows us to render a large part of the energy monitor on the server side. This way, the energy monitor loads faster and is also easily readable by search engines.

For the many graphics and maps in the energy monitor, we use data wrappers. This allows us to quickly and easily customize the look of our displays. We update the graphics with Python and R scripts via the Datawrapper API.","The energy crisis is seen as a very big, historic challenge, especially in Germany. A good overview of the current situation is crucial here.

However, in the German federal government, in public authorities and in many large companies, working with data is severely underdeveloped. As a result, there is also a lack of up-to-date, comprehensive and well-prepared data in the energy sector. This gap is filled by the ZEIT ONLINE Energy Monitor, which is why it is used intensively not only by the general readership but also by decision-makers in government, administration and industry. The Energy Monitor is constantly being further developed. This is always done in consultation with the large community directly in the comments. This unique collaboration between readers and editors makes it possible to always adapt the overview to their information needs.

This dialog with the community has resulted in new charts and features, such as a constantly updated classification of the situation written by an editor, in order to be able to read up on all relevant developments on a weekly basis, even if one has not otherwise followed the news.","The Energy Monitor is not limited to visualizing data in charts and dashboards. It is the starting point for numerous data-based analyses written in the editorial department week after week. This linking of dashboards and more in-depth articles allows data journalism to develop its full power.

By now, the Energy Monitor database consists of dozens of data sets that can be used by the editorial team at any time as a data source for breaking news in the liveblog, advanced analyses and interactive tools for the most important topic of the year (zeit.de/energiewende-daten-visualisierungen). 

Specifically, we rely internally on the concept of ""data stringers"" (first heard in 2013 at the Mozilla Festival in London). Via Slackbot, the editorial team is alerted to the achievement of certain target values in the current data. For example, when the gas levels reached 100% for the first time, we were the first to announce this on the newsdesk.",German,https://www.zeit.de/energiemonitor,,,,,,,"Jakob Bauer, Paul Blickle, Annick Ehmann, Christian Endt, Elena Erdmann, Carla Grefe-Huge, Valentin Peter, Julian Stahnke, Julius Tröger, Rina Wahls","Christian Endt has been working as a Senior Data Journalist in the Data and Visualization department at Zeit Online in Berlin since April 2021, where he is responsible for quantitative analyses.

This innovative approach to data journalism has received overwhelming interest from readers, who appreciate the concrete and detailed reporting on the effects of climate change in Germany. The project was also presented at several conferences, further showcasing its impact and importance.","In this project, we used a variety of tools, techniques, and technologies to research, analyze, and present the data on the impact of climate change in Germany. We used satellite data to track the destruction of tree populations, models from the Helmholtz-Klimaforschungszentrum Gerics and the German Weather Service to project future temperature and precipitation patterns, and R to parse, clean, and analyze the data.

The resulting story found deep geographical disparities: while Barcelona and Madrid have several hospitals offering radiotherapy services, five Spanish provinces and two autonomous cities do not have any. Furthermore, according to the analysis, 10% of the population would have to travel for more than two hours to get treatment.","With this article (link 1) we published, for the first time in Spain, the inequalities in cancer treatment access in different regions. With an innovative approach, we calculated how far people really were from medical centers, going further than the usual analysis of radiotherapy centers per province. 

It was shared by multiple stakeholders, including subscribers of elDiario.es, but also medical societies and activists for public health. It was also highlighted by other media and investigative journalists for its innovation in data compilation as well as its visualization. It was also selected by the Global Investigative Journalism Network (link 2).","For this report we created a database compiling the fastest route using a private vehicle between each municipality in Spain and the nearest hospital with a radiotherapy oncology service. We crossed the coordinates of the location of the hospitals with the coordinates of each municipality centroid using the Open Street Maps (OSM) API. With this methodology, approximate route times without traffic were obtained. In the case of trips between islands and between Ceuta and Melilla and the mainland, air travel times have been calculated, but probable waiting times have not been added.

All this process was coded in R, the same language we used for the analisis. The map was programmed using Javascript and D3.js and Datawrapper was the tool used for the rest of the charts.","The first problem we faced when developing this investigation was to find which medical centers had a radiotherapy machine in Spain and classify them between public or private. There was a directory from the Spanish Oncological Society, but it was not up to date. As it did not include all the hospitals and also had some that closed the radiotherapy department, we needed to verify them one by one from their websites and reading newspapers.

After verifying the list, we had to localize every hospital (latitude and longitude) and get the centroids of every municipality for the crossing. The actual process of getting the route times was automatised with R, but lasted more than two days. 

We also talked to multiple sources to know factors such as if it was possible for the patients to change to go to a hospital from another province if it was closer to their home than the one in their own province. Or if they could be referred to a private one if there was no service in their area. Knowing these factors helped us focus the analisis.","With this project we proved that sometimes the inexistence of data is not an impediment to start a project, but an opportunity to create a database and exploit it exclusively. 

Also, it shows an innovative way to talk about regional inequalities in health data, with a bigger breakdown than the usually used. Using municipalities made the audience closer to the data, as they could find themselves portrayed in the story. 

The data analysis was complemented with stories of different patients that had to travel long distances to receive the treatment and with explanations of cancer experts.

[See Which 2020 Election Deniers and Skeptics Won and Lost in the Midterm Elections](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/09/us/politics/election-misinformation-midterms-results.html) (Nov. 7): Journalists showed that many election skeptics faced few penalties at the ballot box.","All of the stories in the series were shared widely on social media and cited by the news media and politicians, as well as non-profit organizations. 

The Times received roughly 130,000 reader-submitted maps from the gerrymandering game, and many readers replayed the game multiple times, a testament to how engaging and immersive the experience was. Many readers posted on social media about how “easy” and “scary” it was to gerrymander and disadvantage certain voters. It was the kind of emotional takeaway journalists had hoped an interactive puzzle would elicit. The Times also heard directly from educators who are using the game in their classes to engage students with the dynamics of gerrymandering.

The analysis of more than 550 Republican political candidates was cited in [an amicus brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/243966/20221026120922177_221003a%20Amicus%20Brief%20for%20efiling.pdf) filed at the Supreme Court of the United States by a bipartisan group of former public officials, former judges and election experts from Pennsylvania in support of the respondents in Moore v. Harper, a North Carolina gerrymandering case that could have serious implications for future elections. 

The original database used for this analysis powered the reporting for other stories, including on the night of the midterm elections, and as recently as early January when [20 Republican lawmakers](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/01/04/us/politics/house-speaker-republicans-vote-against-mccarthy.html) defied Representative Kevin McCarthy and voted against him for Speaker of the House. (In the latest piece, Times reporters used the database to show readers just how far-right that coalition was.)","For the gerrymandering game, Times journalists built an interactive game where readers were encouraged to gerrymander districts in the fictional state of Hexapolis. The game was written in JavaScript and uses a database to store and display the scores of each player. Journalists spent many weeks iterating on the design of the game to ensure that the gameplay was as intuitive as possible. They wanted readers to figure things out on their own rather than having to read long sets of instructions. They created custom animations and illustrations to give the game a fun and lively feel and added a “wordle” style social feature that allowed players to share an emojified version of their game score on Twitter. 

For election skeptics stories, two reporters manually conducted a sprawling search of each person’s internet footprint, using a mix of publicly available databases, like Facebook, Twitter, DCInbox, congressional websites, Youtube, CSPAN and Rumble. They also used databases requiring subscriptions, like LexisNexis and AdImpact. Some of these websites could be keyword searched, while others required scrolling through dozens of pages, or listening to or watching hundreds of hours of podcasts or videos. 

For the polarizing rhetoric story, The Times evaluated nearly three million tweets, more than 100,000 email newsletters, 300,000 Facebook ads and 350,000 statements from the Congressional Record from 2010 through this past June. The analysis employed language software, [Receptiviti](https://www.receptiviti.com/), to tally how often the legislators used words that academic researchers [had linked](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/1/pgac019/6546199) to antagonistic speech online. To learn about different subjects lawmakers discussed, The Times relied on [topic modeling](https://www.structuraltopicmodel.com/), a machine learning technique that calculates which words are likely to cluster together to form topics. And The Times evaluated religious content using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, a tool that checks texts for related words.","Redistricting is a routine part of American democracy, yet most people are unaware of how it works or do not realize its implications, even as every American is affected by its longstanding impacts. There have been many text-based explainers on redistricting, but often these stories can be hard to read or easy to gloss over. The Times wanted to create an interactive game, putting readers in the shoes of public officials. By trying their own hand at redistricting a state, readers learned about gerrymandering tactics, such as “packing” and “cracking.” The game provided some constraints based on real-world laws — districts needed to be the same size, minority interests needed to be protected, and compactness was encouraged — but otherwise left it up to readers to discover the best strategies to benefit their assigned political parties. Readers were able to see how changing certain parts of their own custom map could lead to different electoral results.

For the polarizing rhetoric story, it was important not to rely only on the software’s output because doing so could result in errors. Human language is complicated and can be easily misinterpreted by machines. Reporters read thousands of randomly selected tweets, email newsletters and other examples of political speech, checking whether words were indeed being used in a hostile way toward the opposing party. This resulted in some words being removed from the evaluation list. Reporters also performed a [computer analysis](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html) on another large sample to determine which words were much more likely to appear in messages that expressed anger, disdain or distrust toward the opposing party. When negative terms were strongly identified with one party — such as “left-wing” — reporters included [a corresponding term](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17748/17555) from the other whenever possible. 

For the election skeptics story, the methodology of the data collection had to be refined as the database was built because the reporters discovered along the way that they wanted to capture certain data points that they had not anticipated at the inception of the project. For instance, several weeks into reporting on each candidate, the reporters decided they should draw a distinction between candidates who questioned the election and those who fully denied the results and, unlike several organizations that tracked election denial, Times journalists decided that objecting to the 2020 Electoral College or supporting lawsuits challenging the results would not automatically count as denying the election results outright. [As another Times investigation reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/us/politics/republican-election-objectors.html), those candidates often cited more nuanced arguments for their votes or said they did not want to overturn the outcome. Reporters also decided to track the timing of statements about the 2020 election in order to identify candidates who continued to cast doubt on the contest in the runup to the midterms — something that had not been done by other organizations tracking election denial. In order to draw these sort of distinctions, the reporters had to check each candidate multiple times.","The skeptics project used both programmatic and hand-curated data collection. Complex projects often require both techniques.

Advanced data analysis techniques can help journalists shed light on problems that seem to defy quantification. Determining whether speech is demonizing, for example, is the type of problem that requires human judgment and thus seems impossible at the necessary scale. But natural language processing, although imperfect, made this analysis more feasible. Still, though the project relied tremendously on computer techniques, it also required many hours of manual work from reporters. Journalists evaluated thousands of randomly selected texts by hand.",English,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/27/us/politics/congressional-gerrymandering-redistricting-game-2022.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/13/us/politics/republican-candidates-2020-election-misinformation.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/22/us/politics/republican-election-objectors-rhetoric.html,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/09/us/politics/election-misinformation-midterms-results.html,,,,"Ella Koeze, Denise Lu, Charlie Smart, Karen Yourish, Danielle Ivory, Aaron Byrd, Weiyi Cai, Nick Corasaniti, Meg Felling, Rumsey Taylor, Jonathan Weisman, Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, Steve Eder, Ashley Wu","This project included journalists working for the Graphics Desk, the Investigations Desk, the Politics Team and the Video Desk."
United Kingdom,The New Humanitarian,Big,Participant,,"WhatsApp, Lebanon?",2022-07-28,"Explainer, Long-form, Illustration, Infographics, Politics, Lifestyle, Culture, Human rights","Adobe Creative Suite, Tools we used to produce this story included Adobe Illustrator, Figma, React, GatsbyJS, Framer Motion, Visual Studio Code, Gatsby Cloud, Vercel, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Speadsheets.","WhatsApp, Lebanon? is the story of Afaf, Bassel, Mohamad, Roger, and Roza, told through the WhatsApp conversations they’ve had with their friends, family, and colleagues over the past few years.

During that time, their lives have been shaped by the tumult they and the other 7 million residents of Lebanon have been forced to endure as they navigated the country’s massive economic collapse.

This is what life over the past three years looked like for five young people in Lebanon, as they WhatsApped it. This timeline is their story, and it’s Lebanon’s too.","Our goal with this project was to raise awareness of a slow crisis for both mainstream and Lebanese/diaspora audiences, as well as those interested in storytelling. We wanted to create a sense of empathy between readers and people in Lebanon, allowing them to understand what it feels like to live through a crisis like this. 

We believe we achieved this. The local contributors were the directors of the storytelling, the project manager and illustrator were both local as well and given much input. We published perspectives that pushed beyond victim-centric narratives, allowing participants to tell their own stories.

The story generated more than 12,000 page views, while time on page was higher than many of our more intensive interactives. Additionally, we were able to put this story across multiple platforms, including YouTube, Instagram, and Spotify, where we published a playlist curated by the story contributors. This story brought many new readers to our platform, including a large portion from within Lebanon. 

We received a lot of positive feedback about this story, particularly from those in Lebanon and diaspora around the world, highlighting how this story travelled across the globe.

Social anthropologist Andreas Hackl said, ""The New Humanitarian's story on Lebanon based on WhatsApp conversations is now almost everywhere on my feed. This shows how investment into creative story telling pays off and can convey immersive experiences that make the average news report seem very out of date.""

AFP journalist Dene-Hern Chen said, ""A really innovative way of showing the compounding misery of Lebanon, as the country goes through economic crisis, the Beirut explosion, COVID pandemic. Scrolling through the WhatsApp messages makes it a very intimate reading experience.""

The feature was also longlisted for the 2022 Information is Beautiful Awards.","When we began WhatsApp, Lebanon?, we truly didn’t know what to expect. We tried to create space for a free flow of ideas and emotions, between us and everyone involved. We wanted the people who opened their phones to us to share the chats and voice notes that were important to them, not the ones that we thought mattered. Building trust was crucial, so they knew their stories would not be distorted, and that their voices would truly be heard.

We asked a renowned Lebanese artist, Rafik El Hariri, to drive the visual direction of WhatsApp, Lebanon? You can see in his illustrations that he’s been living through the same crisis that he’s drawing. 

This was the first bilingual interactive standalone story that we had ever done, which presented its own challenges, but we felt was worth the extra effort to ensure we were able to tell the story in the words of those who lived it, and connect with a wider audience than if we had only published in English. 

We also partnered with local and pan-Arab news platforms to distribute the story, including Daraj, L’Orient Today, VICE, The New Arab, Sa’alouni El Nas (a newsletter for the Lebanese diaspora) and the “It’s Nice That” newsletter.","It has been two years since a deadly explosion tore through Beirut’s port, destroying part of the capital, shocking Lebanon, and making international headlines.

The blast was devastating and, for a short time at least, it made front pages and home pages. But the truth is that it happened when Lebanon was already deep in the throes of an economic and financial crisis – a slow-burn catastrophe that the international media has really struggled to cover.

That’s something we have tried to change with our illustrated interactive timeline, WhatsApp, Lebanon? It looks at how Lebanon’s collapse has impacted the lives of five young people in Lebanon – Afaf, Bassel, Mohamad, Roger, and Roza – through their WhatsApp conversations. 

Why WhatsApp? Well, because when journalists ask people questions, they know what story they’ve been assigned. They can’t help but drive the narrative. That’s just not good enough for complex and multi-layered crises like Lebanon, where traditional news stories fail to capture just how much every aspect of daily life has changed.

Over the course of around three years, Lebanon’s currency has lost 90 percent of its value, and the vast majority of the population has been thrust into poverty. But journalists aren’t usually there to witness late night feelings of despair when the power has been out for hours, nor are they waiting in hours-long petrol queues. 

The great thing about WhatsApp messages is that they offer a locally rooted archive of history, of conversations that have already happened. As journalists, we can’t shape them, but we can – with the permission of our contributors – make them a valuable resource, and a jumping off point for inclusive storytelling.","This sort of non-traditional collaborative journalism is an investment in time and resources, but we believe it’s worth it. 

Journalism has a tendency to dramatise and simplify humanitarian crises, at the same time that it profits from them. People surviving in places like Lebanon are often called “resilient”. But there are so many layers, so many untold stories, behind their survival. We believe the people living through this can, and should, be the narrators of their own stories.","English, Arabic",https://interactive.thenewhumanitarian.org/stories/2022/07/28/whatsapp-lebanon/,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/2022/07/28/whatsapp-lebanon-go-behind-scenes,https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/2022/07/28/playlist-whatsapp-lebanon,,,,,"Annie Slemrod, editor

Brazil,Aos Fatos,Small,Participant,,Escriba,2022-08-20,"Investigation, Open data, Fact-checking","AI/Machine learning, Json, Python","O Escriba é uma ferramenta de transcrição automática criada pelo Aos Fatos para facilitar o uso de vídeo e áudio como fonte de dados para projetos editoriais.

A iniciativa foi concebida para as eleições de 2022 e permitiu que produzíssemos projetos e coberturas que tiveram grande impacto no debate eleitoral do Brasil. Criamos o Banco de Discurso, um repositório público com transcrições dos candidatos à presidência; publicamos checagens de debates em tempo real; e fizemos apuração exclusivas — por exemplo, processamos dezenas de horas de áudios para desmentir relatório que acusava rádios de não veicularem propagandas obrigatórias de Jair Bolsonaro.","O Escriba nos permitiu converter informação de áudio para texto em escala e com rapidez. Isso abriu uma nova frente de reportagens e projetos editoriais baseados em dados para nossa redação.

Um dos trabalhos feito durante as eleições foi o Banco de Discursos, uma plataforma que compilou transcrições de todos os discursos, entrevistas e lives dos candidatos à Presidência. Além de deixar a informação pública em um site, fizemos uma API para pesquisadores que foi usada, por exemplo, pelo departamento de Ciência Política da Universidade Federal de Pernambuco. A plataforma também foi usada para embasar matérias de grandes veículos, como UOL e do próprio Aos Fatos.

Um dos exemplos de investigações que fizemos durantes as eleições usando o Escriba foi uma que investigou dezenas de horas da programação de rádios brasileiras e descobriu que um relatório apresentado pela campanha de Jair Bolsonaro tinha informaçãos falsas. O documento alegava que o então candidato estava recebendo menos tempo de propaganda eleitoral obrigatória do que seu adversário, o que seria ilegal. Alguns aliados de Bolsonaro chegaram a defender o adiamento das eleições. A reportagem do Aos Fatos, impossível de executar a tempo sem o Escriba revelou uma série de falhas no relatório e ajudou a conter o ímpeto antidemocrático. 

O Escriba tornou nossa redação muito mais eficiente, agilizando o processo de transcrição que consumia centenas de horas por mês dos nossos repórteres, especialmente em um agregador que checa todas as declarações do então presidente Jair Bolsonaro.","Construímos o Escriba usando uma combinação de tecnologia diferentes. O ""motor"" de transcrição é um algoritmo de inteligência artificial do tipo deep learning, executado em Python. A arquitetura foi criada em Django (também python) e o frontend do editor de texto criado para corrigir erros de transcrição foi desenvolvido em Javascript puro e React. Também usamos uma série de outros pacotes para outras funções como detecção automática de falantes","Idiomas como o inglês e o espanhol já tinham uma série de ferramentas de transcrição automática de boa qualidade e preço acessível, mas esse não era o caso do português antes do Escriba. Por isso, reportagens que envolvessem grandes volumes de áudios e vídeos eram inviáveis sem uma equipe enorme.

Outro aspecto é que, diferente de outros países, no Brasil não existe uma tradição criar banco públicos de discursos de candidatos a cargos públicos. O Banco de Discursos foi, no nosso conhecimento, o primeiro a fazer isso.","Informações de áudio e vídeo são uma fonte rica, mas pouco explorada, de dados que podem embasar reportagens e visualizações com enorme impacto.

United States,Taiwan Data Stories,Small,Participant,,"All the Ways to Make Bubble Tea, Taiwan's Pearl-fect Drink",2022-01-06,"Explainer, Quiz/game, Open data, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Culture","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV",This is a visual Interactive make-your-own-drink bubble tea adventure. We wanted to answer the question of how many unique boba drinks are there in Taiwan? And how many different combinations can one make with the various customizations? This project attempts to answer both through the visual journey.,"This is the first project to kick of our “Taiwan data stories” serie, a passion project initiated by Julia and I to expand visual storytelling in the Asian community. We chose bubble tea as our first topic in hopes of using a relatable topic as a friendly stepping stone for more in-depth topics we want to explore in the future.

We presented our collaboration journey during the 2022 Outlier DataViz conference, and were thrilled to see much support and interest from other like-minded talents. The small side project grew from the two of us to now a team of 14, and the interactive was featured by the SND newsletter, FlowingData, the 2022 Pudding Cup and various platforms. We have now built five stories, and are constantly exploring new ideas and approaches. This is our budding effort to diversify the media landscape that’s often curated through a Western lens.","**Overview of tools, techniques and technologies used:**
* Interactive design: Javascript, more specifically d3 (By Julia Janicki)
* Data analysis: Excel and google sheet (By Julia and Daisy) 
* Illustration: Hand-drawn every bubble tea drink using procreate (By Daisy Chung)
* UX/UI design: Paper/pencil sketching and Adobe XD (By Daisy Chung)

**In depth creative process of using these tools: **

For the data we selected the top five most popular drink stores in Taiwan as of Feb 2021, based on data from data66 who used Google Trends data. We then collected all the most updated menus, and started distilling the data to find only the unique drinks using excel and google sheet. This turned out to be much more challenging to untangle, as each store has different categorization systems. After much exploration, we developed six main categories (milk tea, pure tea...), then broke them down further into components (base 1, base 2, milk, flavor, texture), with different combinations of components leading to 157 unique drinks.

With the cleaned data, a hierarchical format seemed most appropriate. Using D3, Julia rearranged the tabular data into a hierarchical data, and drew a visualization that has such layout. 

The design seen on the live page was inspired by Wendy MacNaughton’s illustrations of kitchen shelves in the book Salt Fat Acid Heat, and the curvy lines of the treemap as flows of tea ingredients all cascading and colliding into the final product.

To create a story experience, it was important to provide cultural context. For us, the most interesting part of boba is the experience of customizing the drink.We wanted our users to experience the joy of building their own tea. Through a step-by-step drink ordering experience, we introduced the Taiwanese unique tea culture, local ingredients and texture preferences, and recent environmental efforts to reduce single-use plastics.","Since this project was purely a passion project with no resource and funding support, and with time constraint since both Julia and I having full-time jobs, it was challenging to carve out time and resources to navigate our goals and structure for this first project that will define the direction of our Taiwan Dat Stories series. However, it was immensely rewarding to see how two Taiwanese connected by a mutual goal were able to collaborate across two continents (Daisy in the US and Julia in Frace) to really create something together! It especially allowed us to see the impact of combining complimentary skills to build something that neither of us can achieve alone (see our presentation at link4 where we discuss about our collaboration journey).

In addition, it was important to have the story in both English and Mandarin, so that we can truly break down the language barrier and connect with a wider audience. We did not have connections to professional translators, so this heavily relied on help from our relatives and friends back home in Taiwan.","If you are wondering if it is worthwhile to pursue a passion project, we say go for it! While it’s nice to get paid and have defined structure on an assignment, doing personal side projects allowed us to have room to play without the fear of being judged by a roomful of directors and we became much braver and confident in our decisions. It was definitely not easy to craft out additional time on top of our careers, and hard to justify initially without taking the first step. But after one year, we also realized the collaboration has pushed us to explore new learning experiences that extend to our professional practice. 

And if you also resonate with our observation that the current visual storytelling scene is in need of diversification and broadening of perspectives beyond the western lens, we invite you to find other creative ways to share your own stories from your culture or unique perspectives. 

In the creative industry space where new tools, techniques, and amazing work are being shared every second, t’s common to feel that we don’t know enough or can’t keep up. But maybe, we’re not supposed to try to do it ALL by ourselves: instead of feeling like we need to compete with others, we are really destined to work together and collaborate to create something amazing!","English, Chinese",https://taiwandatastories.com/bubble-tea-guide/,https://taiwandatastories.com/zh/bubble-tea-guide,http://taiwandatastories.com/post-boba/index.html,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpfu9NbNNmE&ab_channel=DataVisualizationSociety,https://www.instagram.com/taiwandatastories/,,,"Daisy Chung, Julia Janicki","Daisy is a visual communicator from Taiwan and New Zealand.

Mexico,"Quinto Elemento Lab, es una organización independiente, sin fines de lucro, que busca alentar y realizar reportajes de investigación que empoderen a la ciudadanía, fortalezcan la rendición de cuentas y ayuden a construir una sociedad más justa y transparente.",Small,Participant,,"La vigilancia del agua en México, en caída libre",2022-10-04,"Investigation, Explainer, Solutions journalism, Documentary, Database, Fact-checking, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Audio, Environment, Lifestyle, Human rights","Drone, Scraping, QGIS, Canvas","La á Comisión Nacional del Agua (Conagua) en México que se encarga de la proteger los ríos, cuencas, lagos , pozos, arroyos no cumple con su tarea de vigilar las descargas tóxicas que contaminan el agua.

El reportaje utilizó diversas bases de datos: las inspecciones realizadas en territorio nacional del año 2009 a 2022; el número de inspecciones; sanciones, procedimientos legales; inspectores; el número de usuarios del agua, y el presupuesto histórico.","El reportaje demostró que la deficiente administración e inspección del agua nacional por parte del Gobierno de México provoca que industrias, empresas, sector público o privado se mantengan impunes ante la contaminación que generan al desechar sus tóxicos a los ríos; y que no cumplan con los parámetros exigidos por las normas ambientales mexicanas.

Demostró que en 2020, había 149 inspectores del gobierno federal (Conagua) que realizaron 1,336 visitas en el territorio nacional, lo que representó vigilar sólo 0.25% del total del padrón que ascienden a 523 mil permisos otorgados para empresas, industrias o particulares que usan el agua de la nación, estos datos mostraron que ese 2020, fue el más bajo en materia de fiscalización en los últimos doce años.

Mientras que, en el territorio de Jalisco, un lugar donde fluye el Río Santiago el más sucio del país, había un solo inspector quien sólo realizó 34 inspecciones, lo que significó 0.08% del padrón de los 41 mil usuarios del territorio jalisciense. 

Las experiencias recabadas con personas que habitan a un costado del Río Santiago, el más contaminado del país demostraron que la mala calidad de los cuerpos de agua representa un daño a su salud física, mental y económica. Se demuestra además el aumento en el número de enfermos con daño renal.
El reportaje fue publicado con apoyo de Quinto Elemento, una organización que ofrece beca al periodismo de calidad. Fue divulgado en la primera plana del periódico impreso nacional El Universal, uno de los periódicos más visitados en México, y fue replicado por Zona Docs en Jalisco, por Canal 44 Televisión Abierta y en la XEDK del 1250 AM. Para ampliar el tema acudí a las instalaciones de la televisora y radiodifusora.","El reportaje multimedia está compuesto por crónica, fotografías, videos, videoretratos, e infografías. Estos elementos periodísticos los elegí porque iban de acuerdo con mis posibilidades narrativas y tecnológicas, así como las probabilidades de concretar alianzas con otros colegas a fin de presentar mejor la información.

La idea de usar la narrativa digital fue para lograr que el lector comprendiera de manera más sencilla y atractiva una realidad tan compleja como es la histórica contaminación del agua, especialmente de la Cuenca Santiago- Lerma- Pacífico y mostrarle, por medio de infografías y videos, la deficiente vigilancia que hace la autoridad a los cuerpos de agua y las consecuencias que trae consigo la contaminación, que se reflejan en la población enferma.
 
Las imágenes fueron tomadas con cámaras fotográficas y con dron. Se editaron videos para las redes sociales acompañados por audio y texto que explican las principales ideas de la investigación.

Se editaron además seis videos cortos de con un tiempo de entre uno y dos minutos con las entrevistas de los habitantes de El Salto Jalisco que expusieron las problemáticas de salud y socioambientales que trae consigo vivir a un costado del Río Santiago, considerado el más sucio del país, y se diseñó además un mapa de la cuenca Lerma Santiago Pacífico por donde fluye este caudal. Los videos se colocaron en la página de YouTube de Quinto Elemento.

Para los datos estadísticos se usaron infografías que dieron a conocer número de inspectores, inspecciones, procedimientos y sanciones, así como el número de inspectores comparado con los títulos de concesión o permisos fueron presentados a través de infografías, ya que para nuestro oficio- juegan un papel fundamental, pues complementan el sentido de la información o, en ocasiones, le dan el sentido a la información.","Hacer periodismo en México es muy complicado. El problema mayor es que el Gobierno y el Narcotráfico que trabajan juntos tienen todas las herramientas, y dinero para silenciar, censurar, intimidar o limitar la información que da a conocer las violaciones a los derechos humanos. En las últimas dos décadas, 157 periodistas han sido asesinados.
Otra problemática, es que los medios de comunicación no dan cabida a la investigación de largo aliento, y como periodista debes solventar económicamente las investigaciones o buscar financiamiento externo, siempre con la posibilidad de sufrir amenazas o perder la vida. 
La impunidad y la falta de rendición de cuentas es también un grave problema debido a que los funcionarios públicos no contestan las solicitudes de entrevistas y los mecanismos de transparencia que existen en México son ineficientes.

En 1999 comencé a laborar como periodista y he notado que hay más opacidad. Por ejemplo: los funcionarios públicos no otorgan entrevistas; los voceros piden cuestionarios que tardan varios meses en contestar; si hay dudas, pocas veces las contestan; la información en la web no está clara o no es de fácil acceso; las metas que señalan las secretarías, municipios, o institutos sólo cubren pocos aspectos, pero no ofrecen detalles sobre si cumplen metas presupuestales, sobre el uso de recursos humanos, y materiales. Hay secretarías que no contestan ni una pregunta a los cuestionarios que exigen.

Para este reportaje, ningún funcionario quiso darme entrevista, sólo una persona a nivel local en Jalisco me dio información. Lo demás fue investigación vía las bases de datos y entrevistando a expertos académicos y comunidades afectadas por la contaminación del río. 

Tambíen para reallizar este reportaje, sufrimos de acoso por parte de la policía. En agosto de 2021, cuando grabábamos entrevistas frente a la cascada que divide a los municipios de El Salto y Juanacatlán, lugar donde el río lleva espuma blanca a causa de la contaminación. Ese día, varios policías municipales nos tomaron fotografías, y me solicitaron la credencial de elector y licencia de conducir para también fotografiarlas, documentos en donde están escritos mis datos personales. 
Los policías municipales se justificaron alegando que investigan robos a los cables de la luz. El hecho que se hayan quedado con mis datos personales me dejó con un mal sabor de boca. Nos sentimos amenazados e inseguros de estar en el municipio de El Salto. 

Además, este reportaje no lo hubiera logrado sin el apoyo de la beca editorial que me otorgó Quinto Elemento, una organización independiente, sin fines de lucro, que busca alentar y realizar reportajes de investigación que empoderen a la ciudadanía, fortalezcan la rendición de cuentas y ayuden a construir una sociedad más justa y transparente.
El reportaje quedó entre los 6 seleccionados de las 80 investigaciones que aplicaron.
De esta manera, hacer periodismo en México es casi imposible, más para una periodista como yo que trabajo de manera autónoma, sin ningún medio de comunicación que me respalde, y sin sueldo fijo. Pero aún así apuesto por el periodismo.","Es posible aprender que formar alianzas con personas y medios de comunicación éticos abre la posibilidad de publicar productos de calidad que subsistan en el tiempo, y que sean indispensables para la toma de decisiones, pues se reconoce que la credibilidad y la investigación son los recursos más valiosos.

Debo recalcar que, al ser reportera independiente, sin contrato de trabajo estable en un medio de comunicación, es decir, al no contar con respaldo económico, ni una ventana para colocar las investigaciones, es mucho más complicado vivir produciendo reportajes de largo aliento, pues uno se siente en constante incertidumbre, como andar con ojos vendados, o de estar sola contra el mundo. 

Por ello, las alianzas también son fundamentales para arropar a reporteras y reporteros que están en mi situación. En mi caso, las alianzas las encontré con la organización no gubernamental Quinto Elemento Lab que me apoyó a poder analizar grandes volúmenes de información superando los 500 mil usuarios del agua. Por esta razón, las alianzas y el apoyo de expertos para descifrar y comparar los ficheros fueron fundamentales para concluir y proponer esta información que no había sido publicada a nivel nacional.

También para la producción del reportaje necesité del apoyo de otros colegas, no sólo en el aspecto editorial, también en la creación de imágenes de video, en uso de dron, fotografía, diseño y programación virtual. Por ello, estoy convencida de que, para lograr un producto de investigación de calidad y largo aliento que tenga como meta lograr una mejora en la calidad de vida de las comunidades, se requiere formar alianzas para incorporar experiencia, visiones, y fortalezas.",Spanish,https://quintoelab.org/project/vigilancia-agua-mexico-contaminacion-caida-libre,https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/nacion/se-reduce-la-vigilancia-de-descargas-toxicas,https://www.zonadocs.mx/la-vigilancia-del-agua-en-mexico-en-caida-libre/,https://udgtv.com/tag/adriana-navarro/,https://udgtv.com/noticias/conagua-abandona-tarea-bajan-90-inspecciones-9-anios/,,,"Armando Talamantes.

zero-tolerance pledges, thousands of people have been trafficked into labor by private contractors on U.S. military bases. Workers have been paid less than promised, charged recruiting fees that leave them deep in debt, and pressured to sign improper contracts and work
long hours.","Stars and Stripes, the news organization for the U.S. military, reprinted the Washington Post
story. The Hill responded with an impassioned op-ed calling for changes. “Startling reports from the Washington Post, NBC News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICRJ) last week paint a sordid picture of the reality of human trafficking carried out by some U.S. government contractors on American military bases abroad,” wrote
Nate King, director of U.S. congressional affairs for International Justice Mission, a global non- governmental organization that protects people in poverty from violence.
“This kind of investigative reporting is so vital. It sheds a light on unacceptable complicity in forced labor, which undermines other efforts of the U.S. government to address trafficking around the globe. Americans ought to be outraged that human trafficking continues to occur under the watch of the U.S. government in this way — and we can look to recent history for how the public might respond.” The Global Investigative Journalism Network has deemed this one of the top international investigations in 2022.
The Pentagon’s office for preventing trafficking (CTIP) is officially incorporating the NBC Nightly News video segment as part of its training for contracting officers, to prevent trafficking and stop new contracts going to those who have engaged in trafficking. And the GAO said the work by the journalists was responsible for the passage of Senate bill S.3470, the End Human Trafficking in Government Contracts Act of 2022; the months of questions by reporters led to the passage of the bill just as the stories were being published, according to the auditors.","We built data to track companies we uncovered that had engaged in trafficking, including many that the Pentagon or other government agencies knew had substantiated cases of trafficking workers. We also built data sets to track the dozens of workers we had reached out to or interviewed. We used google sheets and excel for these tasks.
For tracking spending, we used python, excel and access. For tracking that government contracting officials had failed to flag companies it knew engaged in trafficking, we used access and excel.","This project faced many hurdles: Government secrecy that shielded the names of those who have violated U.S. trafficking laws, the extreme reluctance of victims to come forward and the sheer geographic challenges that come with this global reporting effort. Though such information is supposed to be public, the Pentagon would not disclose the names
of the contractors with violations, despite multiple inquiries, including Freedom of Information Act requests. Through extensive reporting, including FOIA requests, court documents, and records complied other governments like those in India and the U.K., the journalists were able to identify close to 50 of the companies that have been Pentagon contractors with troubling records, trafficking thousands of workers.
One key was convincing insiders and whistleblowers to come forward. In the end, about a half dozen former government and company contracting officials helped with this reporting. Victims of trafficking were reluctant to come forward for various reasons. Often it was because they come from impoverished backgrounds and despite abuse and illegalities, they want to work. They are often fearful – with good reason -- that if they go public, no other employer will want them. Many times, the pressure comes from family members who are relying on them to send money home. Then there are high-interest loans that the worker may have taken to pay a recruiting fee. While illegal, recruiters often charge fees equal to a year or two of their prospective salaries. If they lose work, they lose the ability to repay those loans, jeopardizing what meager property or savings held by the family at home.
The reporters worked carefully and respectfully in doing these interviews, with extensive conversations with dozens of workers and following protocols similar to those outlined by the The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma. In the end, close to 50 were willing to be either on the record or be on background, where their names were not revealed but their comments were on the record. For the NBC Nightly News segement, one worker agreed to appear in shadows,
but his voice was not altered. Their trafficking claims were verified by checking countless documents, photographs and other evidence. The sheer geographic challenges were immense. We interviewed one trafficked worker from his dirt floor home near Pokhara, Nepal. Another from a place in Uganda so rural it was off the grid. In Kuwait, our ARIJ reporters could not go near U.S. bases because of security. The obstacles were surmounted various ways, but took time, patience and logistical planning. Reporters would meet in neutral locations, careful that those speaking with us would not be seen by others going to meet us. Because of vast distances, some interviews were done via WhatsApp or FaceTime,
often involving arranging for someone to lend a phone that could shoot video, or for workers to
get to other villages with wifi or internet connections.","The most important aspect is the power of collaboration between different newsrooms and entities around the world on producing such a big investigation. Journalists should always look for those collaborations which make the tasks within a complex investigation become easier, especially with on-ground interviews, understanding local context, translations, networks of sources, and much more.","Arabic, English",https://arij.net/investigations/labor-trafficking/,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/private-contractors-are-accused-abusive-labor-practices-us-military-ba-rcna52110,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/10/27/defense-contractors-persian-gulf-trafficking/,https://vimeo.com/787640183,,,,"Molly Boigon

Meta’s Facebook Pixel Helper
Datawrapper","With the help of web surfing records shared by volunteers, The Markup revealed that websites across multiple industries and government agencies were transmitting sensitive information to Facebook through the Meta Pixel, a Facebook tracking tool that helps site operators better target their advertising. This included health systems, hospitals, and telehealth providers sharing information on users’ health conditions, medications, alcohol use, and reports of self-harm; tax preparation sites sharing information on income, refunds, and dependents; and the U.S. Department of Education sharing the personal contact details of student aid applicants.","As of Oct. 20, 2022, at least 35 of the 40 hospitals and health systems identified in our coverage had removed the Meta Pixel entirely, or from portions of their websites. At least four health care systems sent federally mandated “breach” notifications to 6.3 million patients and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), disclosing possibly inappropriate transmission of data to Facebook. Numerous telehealth companies said they had removed the trackers or were reviewing their use of the tools.

Tax preparation companies TaxAct, TaxSlayer, H&R Block, and Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, all either removed their Meta Pixels or changed the pixels’ settings to capture less data after they were contacted for comment.

The U.S. Department of Education, after initially denying the tracking happened, reversed course before we published and changed the settings of the pixel to reduce the information gathered on applicants.

Three big tech companies—Google, Snap, and Pinterest—said they took action to investigate or stop the data sharing detailed in our stories. Facebook said it contacted the Department of Education.

Hospital patients filed at least five proposed federal class action lawsuits against Meta, alleging that the company broke various state and federal laws. Customers of H&R Block also filed a proposed federal class action lawsuit against Meta, alleging that the company violated contractual promises.

HHS cited our story in new guidance on the lawful use of online tracking technologies.

Our coverage prompted questions in hearings in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and was cited in letters from eight senators and three members of Congress to subjects of our stories. One of the letters, signed by six U.S. senators, said the sharing of tax information was “an appalling breach of users’ trust” and “potentially illegal.”","In 2019, Surya Mattu, a data journalist and engineer at The Markup, began studying how and where Facebook’s pixel was used. By late 2020, he’d discovered that close to a third of the world's top 100,000 websites had the pixel installed, and he launched an online tool called Blacklight so our readers could discover for themselves whether a particular webpage was using the tracker.

To find out what sorts of sensitive information the pixels were funneling to Facebook, Surya and Markup co-founder Julia Angwin brought a proposal to Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox web browser. They asked to work with Rally, a Mozilla project that allows participants to opt in to sending data to researchers studying online activity. The Markup provided Rally with specifications for the type of data sharing we were interested in, and Rally added the collection functionality to its tool as a project called “Facebook Pixel Hunt” that Firefox users could join (more than 5,000 ultimately did). 

The project captured data in places that are challenging to observe, such as behind login pages. Although Rally had worked with university researchers, The Markup was the first (and is so far the only) journalism organization to tap its data. 

To better understand the pixel ecosystem, Markup engineer Simon Fondrie-Teitler created dummy pixels, Facebook business accounts, and websites. Reporters Todd Feathers and Colin Lecher, working with Simon, helped to test each of the websites we wrote about, including by going through the appointment booking process on more than 100 hospital websites and completing onboarding forms on 50 telehealth sites. A “Show Your Work” article detailed the methodology The Markup used along with what we learned about the inner workings of the Meta Pixel. For many of our stories, we released the data we collected on GitHub.","The data collected in partnership with Mozilla Rally was reasonably straightforward to use, but there were two main pieces of work that needed to happen before we could begin looking through it in earnest. One is that the data collected by Rally was in Google Cloud Platform’s BigQuery database but was not in a format that was easy to parse. We had to create scripts to parse and reformat the existing data into tables with a structure that was easier to query—so we could more quickly find the information we were looking for. 

We also needed to figure out what we were actually looking at. Meta documents how to use its pixel as an end user, but doesn’t document what the parameters sent by network requests made by the pixel represent. So we read the existing documentation, then created a sandbox website with an instance of the pixel, fed in our own data to the JavaScript API Meta provides, and tweaked settings in it to see how data being sent changed. From this information we could infer the meanings of the unknown parameters.

We also faced challenges deciding what tracking evidence we were going to collect and how we were going to categorize it. For example, on the telehealth story we examined not only the Meta Pixels but also trackers from Google, TikTok, and others. Trackers from different companies all behaved slightly differently, and one company's tracker often behaved differently on different websites, so we had to do a lot of data collection, cleaning, refining, and recollecting before we finalized 1) what we were able to measure conclusively and 2) how we were going to categorize it (i.e., what constitutes personal information, what constitutes a ""checkout"" or ""add-to-cart"" event).","We hope Pixel Hunt inspires other newsrooms to think creatively about how to get the answers they want. In our case, we knew there were millions of Meta Pixels in the wild and that close to a third of the largest 100,000 websites had the pixels installed. But before we launched Pixel Hunt, we didn’t have a clear path to answering our most pressing question: What sorts of sensitive information were all these pixels funneling to Facebook?

We suspected that answering this would require getting inside walled off parts of the web like patient portals, tax preparation apps, and government benefit sites. This led us to our partnership with Mozilla Rally. From our experience with Rally and on Pixel Hunt, we learned lessons that could prove useful to other journalists, including:

People are often willing to share personal data with you if you ask them the right way. Our project page for Rally users (https://rally.mozilla.org/past-studies/facebook-pixel-hunt/) provided a nine-item list of exactly what data we were interested in collecting along with three ways we protected the data once we had access to it.
Partnerships magnify journalistic power. Our work with Rally helped us obtain sensitive data, a reporting partnership with STAT expanded our range of stories, and co-publishing with STAT, The Verge, and Chalkbeat helped reach larger audiences across multiple industries.
It pays to show your work. We published a dedicated methodology article and also detailed some of our methods within each article. We also kept records of the web browsing sessions we conducted to verify what we saw in the Rally data. All this bolstered the credibility of our coverage and helped us confidently answer questions from readers and the subjects of our stories.",English,https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites,https://themarkup.org/privacy/2022/12/13/out-of-control-dozens-of-telehealth-startups-sent-sensitive-health-information-to-big-tech-companies,https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook,https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/04/28/applied-for-student-aid-online-facebook-saw-you,https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2022/04/28/how-we-built-a-meta-pixel-inspector,https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/09/19/meta-faces-mounting-questions-from-congress-on-health-data-privacy-as-hospitals-remove-facebook-tracker,https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/12/14/sen-elizabeth-warren-questions-tax-filing-companies-meta-and-google-about-sharing-of-financial-data,"Simon Fondrie-Teitler, Surya Mattu, Colin Lecher, Todd Feathers, Angie Waller, Katie Palmer, Micha Gorelick","Simon Fondrie-Teitler, infrastructure engineer

United States,"The Mercury News, San Jose, California",Big,Participant,,"650,000 Would Still Be Alive if the Nation had the Bay Area's Death Rate",2022-05-15,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Covid 19, Health","Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","If the United States had the San Francisco Bay Area’s death rate from COVID-19, 350,000 people would have died so far — not 1 million, the astounding number of deaths the country reached in May 2022.

How did the Bay Area avoid the worst of the virus’s wrath? In short, it behaved – and reaped the rewards.

The Mercury News analyzed more than two years of state and regional COVID death and vaccination rates, and census, health and mobility data to explore how and why the Bay Area and California stood out from the pandemic pack. The numbers tell the story – loudly.","The project was the first comprehensive examination of how the San Franscisco Bay Area's aggressive COVID policies -- the first regional lockdowns, comprehensive masking rules, high vaccination rates -- and other regional factors -- demographics, obesity and other chronic health rates -- factored into its comparatively low COVID death rates nationally. The story took a deep dive into the fraught political debate over public health measures during the pandemic. It provided one of the most thorough reviews of how California and the Bay Area fared remarkably better than other parts of the country that were quicker to reopen and dismiss the public health threats. The outcome was not only a major Sunday spread in our newspapers, marking the month in which the U.S. registered its one millionth COVID deaths. With its vivid and expansive interactive data visulations online, it will serve as a lasting accounting of the Bay Area's experience during the biggest pandemic of our lives.","The design and layout was created using Webflow.com, which helped produce the animated scroll effect. To create the infographics, we gathered and analyzed the data using Excel, Google Sheets and visualized the data with Flourish.com.

The online story is filled with comphrensive graphics, including the variations among death rates in all 50 states, examinations of the lowest death rates among major US counties, vaccination rates among major US counties, animated graphics showing the deadly path of COVID state-by-state across the pandemic, and more.","As the U.S. approached its one millionth death from COVID in early 2022, editors and reporters at the
Bay Area News Group began a discussion of how to commemorate this awful milestone. What, we asked
ourselves, was the distinctive story for our news organization to tell – the one that stood apart from the
litany of misery and suffering around the country? And we quickly realized that our story was the way this
region itself stood apart: high vaccination rates, strong masking and social distancing policies, and a
widespread commitment to following the guidance of experts in science and health. We had told pieces of
that story many times, but we’d never tried to pull it all together and quantify the impact of the Bay Area’s
singular approach to COVID health policies. This was the time to do it.
Data journalist Harriet Blair Rowan teamed with John Woolfolk, a key member of our main COVID
team and one of our best critical thinkers, to dig into the numbers – looking not just at key metrics for the
Bay Area but putting them in state, national and worldwide context. But as we pulled together the
individual components – vaccination rates, infection rates, death rates, and measures of underlying health
– we strained for the one key data point that would tell the story powerfully and succinctly. Then it hit us:
The country was closing in on a million deaths, but if the Bay Area’s death rate could be replicated around
the country, we would be nowhere close to that milestone. Instead, we calculated, the U.S. would be
closing in on 350,000 deaths – 651,000 people would still be alive. It was a contrived number, to be
sure, but one that hit with potent force.","Journalists recognize the challenge of saying something new, compelling and instructive in stories that mark milestones and anniversaries. That's why we began planning conceptually for a way to definitively mark the millionth COVID death in a distinctive way that would differentiate our coverage from everyone else's. Deep data analysis was the way to go. But we also recognized numbers alone were not enough. Despite its comparative successes, the Bay Area had its own tales of tragedy, and we realized that the thrust of our reporting might risk minimizing the heartbreak. So we enlisted Julia Prodis Sulek, a gifted feature writer, to chart the course of COVID through the tales of individuals, bringing emotion to otherwise flat numbers. Julia hit upon the device of obituaries, written by families, as a public manifestation of how our region
dealt with disease and deaths that, in many cases, could have been prevented. Her poignant work became part two of our series, and is attached as a supplement to our entry.",English,https://extras.mercurynews.com/millionth/,https://www.mercurynews.com/2022/05/22/a-million-stories-just-as-heartbreaking-as-mine-how-humble-death-notices-captured-covids-historic-toll/,,,,,,"John Woolfolk, Harriet Blair Rowan, Pai","John Woolfolk is a veteran reporter and editor covering news in the Bay Area since 1990.

Netherlands,Pointer (KRO-NCRV),Small,Participant,,How dirty is your pension fund?,2022-11-30,"Investigation, Database, Open data, News application, Chart, Environment","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Node.js","No meat, no flying, quick showers. Trying to reduce your personal carbon footprint can be discouraging. Besides: while you may be doing your utmost, financial institutions, including pension funds, are still investing billions in the fossil fuel industry. They can make a big difference. Our data team collected the investment portfolios of the largest pension funds in the Netherlands and linked them to a database of fossil companies. This revealed how many fossil euro's, and in which fossil companies, the pension funds were investing. This resulted in a new dataset and interactive production which exposed the size of harmful investments.","One of Dutch largest pension funds PME (metal and technology industry) is putting 286 million euro in fossil investments from 29 companies on sale following our investigation. This includes 230 million in coal investments and 56 million in investments in gas and oil extraction. PME stated being ""coal-free"" back in 2018 and said it would sell all fossil investments by 2021. But after Pointer's analyses, it turned out there were still fossil fuel companies in their portfolio. Among which one of the biggest coal mine companies like Glencore and BHP Group. ""I found it really frustrating, but also very good that you guys found this. We take our climate ambition very seriously,"" said PME's Executive board member Marcel Andringa.

In a broadcast we created, we showed our findings and examined the two investing tactics at play in the pension world: Divest from fossil fuel companies (PME) or continue with engagement (PFZW). We also confronted PFZW about their failure to adhere to their own exclusion criteria when it comes to coal companies. They changed their exclusion text on their website. The broadcast was well watched by Pointer standards with an average of 312,000 viewers.

This is only the tip of the ice berg. This investigation will go on for at least the first quarter of 2023 in which we try to hold other pension funds to account.","The hardest part, like most data stories, was collecting the pension funds' investment portfolios and then neatly linking them to the Urgewald Global Coal Exit List (GCEL) and Global Oil and Gas Exit List (GOGEL). These are recently published public datasets that screen the activities of almost all the world's coal, oil and gas upstream and midstream companies.

Each pension fund publishes its investment portfolio in different ways and file formats. Most published in very long PDFs that we scraped and had to capture in a spreadsheet. Others published their data in their own dynamically loaded forms on the website. These therefore had to be scraped with Python and Selenium. For a few, the data could be found via the API. Eventually we had a dataset with the columns: pension fund, company, type of investment (bonds, equities etc.) and market value.

Now we have a list of investments in companies from eight pension funds (we also researched three others, but they did not publish their portfolios). The trick is to match the portfolio company names with the company names that also appear in the GCEL and GOGEL lists. This way we reveal all fossil investments and the value it represents.
To do this, we used a ""fuzzy matching"" technique to link the three data sets. Then it was still a lot of manual work to verify all the matched company names.

R was used for data analysis.

We built an interactive story where people find out what harmful fossil activities their pension fund is (indirectly) investing in.

For a detailed methodology, please refer to the making-of article that accompanies this research. Also included here in the appendices.","Avoiding the most disastrous consequences of global warming will require major financial institutions to shift their billions in investment and financing to renewable energy. They reached $632 billion per year for 2019-2020. But we need an increase of at least 6 times that number in annual climate finance to get on track for the goals of the Paris Agreement (UNEP - Emission Gap Report).

We found out through this research how old-fashioned the world of pension funds and asset managers is. They invest billions that can make a big impact, but don't actually know where their money ends up. Quality data on the activities of fossil fuel companies is scarce. We used Urgewald's public and thus verifiable datasets that for the first time transparently map current plans for expansion for fossil fuel extraction. THis investigation is only scratching the surface. We know that multiple pension funds are working with incoherent or at leat questionable data that favour the fossil fuel industry.

What also surprised us is that such a detailed screening of pension portfolios did not exist before. Several universities informed us that it has not been done like this prior to our efforts. 

That it has not been done before by another journalistic title is due, we think, to several factors. First, it's only the second year that Urgewald published their lists on Oil and Gas companies. Second, that few news rooms in the Netherlands possess the know how to apply the fuzzy matching technique. In addition, it still took a total of three full days with three people to verify the fuzzy matches. And that's only to verify the matched data set. Let alone all the research, building the story and online experience.","That in a relatively boring topic like pension fund investment portfolios, an awful lot can be achieved in terms of impact. But also that in a relatively boring topic, like pension fund investment portfolios, an awful lot can be achieved in terms of impact. A lot of money is involved. 

And behind every investment is a company that is somewhere, in our case, extracting fossil fuels where people live who suffer and where nature is destroyed. 

Ultimately we (in the Netherlands at least) cannot choose where our pension money gets invested in. Employers decide that. Just as you can switch banks, you can't vote with one's feet when it comes to pension funds. The only thing you can do as a retiree or someone who works for their pension, is to make your voice heard. But that starts with knowing how your money is being invested. That, in the end, takes journalists who can take the time to unravel and reveal that.",Dutch,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/hoe-vies-is-jouw-pensioen,https://pointer-dev.kro-ncrv.nl/tdebeus/how_dirty_is_your_retirement_translated.docx,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/pensioenfonds-pme-verkoopt-286-miljoen-aan-fossiele-beleggingen,https://pointer-dev.kro-ncrv.nl/tdebeus/PME_pension_fund_sells_286_million_in_fossil_investments_after_Pointer_investigation_translated.docx,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/hoe-we-de-fossiele-beleggingen-van-pensioenfondsen-tegen-het-licht-houden,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/pensioenfondsbeleggingen-in-fossiele-industrie-dataset,https://pointer.kro-ncrv.nl/groen-pensioen,"Thomas de Beus, Isa Martens, Els Engel, Jerry Vermanen, Wendy van der Waal, Els Engel, Sietze van Loosdregt","Datajournalist Thomas de Beus was the driving force behind the data research, data-analysis, concept and text.

United States,"BBC, The Gecko Project, and Mongabay",Big,Participant,,Palm oil firms depriving tribes of millions of dollars,2022-05-23,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Open data, Chart, Video, Map, Audio, Environment, Corruption, Agriculture, Economy, Human rights","Animation, Drone, Scraping, QGIS, Satellite imagery analysis; Tabula and OpenRefine for data cleaning/manipulation; Google Earth Engine; USGS Earth Explorer; Google Earth Pro","Buy something in a supermarket and there's a good chance it will contain palm oil. Follow it back through the supply chain and eventually you'll find an oil palm tree, likely in Indonesia. But the companies that sell it to major firms like Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg's and Mondelēz are depriving Indigenous communities - on whose land much palm oil is produced - of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of income, by not conforming with legally mandated profit sharing regulations, a joint BBC/Gecko Project/Mongabay investigation found, by gathering and analyzing all the available data.","Two days after the investigation was published, the national government announced a major audit of the palm oil sector. This involves the Attorney General's Office and ""at least 80 BPKP auditors"" from 29 provinces. “We have to audit all these oil palm plantations to find out how large they are and how much plasma they have,” senior Cabinet minister Luhut Pandjaitan told media outlets. Multiple concerns drove the decision, including a recent scandal over companies evading export restrictions, but also the issue at the heart of the investigation: the exploitation of local communities. Luhut told the media: “If a company doesn’t provide plasma (palm oil profits)…is that fair?” 

Plasma problems were raised in parliament several times afterward: one called for government focus on it, calling it a “fundamental issue” that was causing land conflicts. Industry association Gapki described it as an “urgent” problem, while the Association of District Plantation Agencies called for companies to “fully realise their obligations regarding providing 20% plasma for the community.” The main oil palm smallholders’ organisation used it to call for a government review of the scheme through which companies provide plasma.

We documented 38 public statements highlighting problems with plasma and calling for action from provincial and district-level officials from 13 administrations across 9 provinces, and 12 steps taken by provincial and district governments, including parliamentary ‘special committees’ to investigate plasma, and threats to revoke licenses of companies that refused to provide plasma. 

The report sparked a petition calling for Mondelez to stop sourcing palm oil from Golden Agri-Resources, one of the plantation companies named in the article, with more than 128,000 signatures. Four major consumer goods companies committed to determining and mitigating their exposure to problems with plasma.

The investigation text received over 562,000 views across the three media outlets' platforms.","This was probably the first attempt to investigate problems with companies sharing plasma (palm oil profits) with communities on a national scale in Indonesia. It therefore involved collecting and analysing data from government, corporations and the media, and triangulating this with data obtained from our field reporting in nine provinces across Indonesia's three largest islands. We collated data from multiple palm oil companies' websites and public reporting, cross-referenced this with data auto-transcribed from dozens of government reports in PDF format, extracted from consumer goods firms' public disclosures, and collated from in-depth open-source research into court records, companies' corporate structures, academic research, NGO reports and media articles. Tools used included Tabula, OpenRefine and Google Sheets. 

We then built a single dataset bringing this together, which served as a foundation for the investigation, allowing us to target our field reporting at 27 companies where there was compelling evidence of problems, and identify trends and common threads that informed our reporting. We also used the dataset to create visualisations showing the spread of plasma-related protests across Indonesia over time, and the scale of major consumer goods firms' exposure to this problem. (We used DataWrapper and Flourish to create the charts and visualisations.) We also used the data to create animations simplifying the complex supply chain links between our case studies and companies such as Unilever and Nestle. 
 
We also analysed satellite imagery to show when companies had planted oil palms and georeference the plasma area owned by Indigenous people and villagers. Finally, we built a separate dataset of profits villagers were earning from partnership plasma schemes, which we collected over a three-year period through field reporting in ten communities across five provinces, and compared this to national and international poverty lines as well as academic research on profits that plantations typically generate.","- Historically there is little to no transparency provided by the palm oil industry, in Indonesia or elsewhere: government data is widely acknowledged to be flawed and contradictory. 
- Company structures are designed to avoid accountability: palm oil companies will operate under multiple names and set up shell companies to obscure the identity of parent companies
- Borneo and Sumatra are generally described as a ‘Wild West’ in these above regards, with huge problems of land grabbing, where companies gain illegal access to tribal lands
- No central, agreed-upon map of palm oil concessions exists – so one will often see multiple overlapping claims
- Palm oil companies' supply chains are deliberately murky — this makes it challenging to trace where palm oil that ends up in a consumer product is produced.
- Senior government figures are routinely involved in – and benefitting from – the palm oil industry
- The police are often hired by the industry as security guards, resulting in the local community and journalists facing threats that can’t be remedied by law enforcement
- The work is built on a database of more than 240 reported cases, which will be published in the coming weeks here, https://thegeckoproject.org/topics/plasma/","- How to break down and make sense of vast amounts of complex data
- Cross-checking of government and company available data against promises and regulations
- Even when government data contains flaws, you can still use it to build or strengthen your story
- Organizing that analysis of the data can provide surprising revelations, as this project did
- Being open and transparent with consumer companies about our data can provide valuable insight

Spain,Meininger's Wine Business International,Small,Participant,,Produced from thin air - the mystery of Russian wine,2022-01-10,"Investigation, Explainer, Fact-checking, Politics, Business, Agriculture, Crime, Economy",Microsoft Excel,"This material is the first systematic analysis of counterfeit Russian wines and grape distillates. 

Using official data from Russian regulators, it has been proved that the production of Russian wines and brandy exceeds available resources by 23-31% and is counterfeit. 

The trend for fraudulent products is increasing: in 2019 23% of products were counterfeited, in 2021 - 31%, or almost a third of all Russian wines and brandy.","For Meininger WBI, the article remained in the top five most-read stories for several months. 

In Russia, the material's methodology was used by [Republic](https://republic.ru/posts/103028), which continued to investigate the scale of counterfeiting. The problem was soon brought to the attention of one of Russia's popular tabloids, [Argumenty i Fakty](https://spb.aif.ru/money/bumazhnyy_urozhay_kak_lenoblast_stala_glavnym_vinodelom_strany). Even the media, loyal to the Russian authorities, drew attention to the fact that a significant portion of the country's yield is harvested only on paper. 

The material caused a controversy among a new wave of Russian media outlets, the telegram channels that specialize in the alcohol market. The official Russian regulatory authorities did not react to the publication, not least because it showed huge inconsistencies between the data of different agencies.","The main resource I used was a systematic approach to analyzing different types of data. Using a systematic approach and converting different metrics using a single unit of measurement allowed me to give an accurate estimate of the scale of the counterfeit wine problem. 

The enormous scale of counterfeiting, accounting for almost a third of the market, is in the shadows because of the scrappy data provided by various ministries. The Ministry of Agriculture reports on the grape harvest, the regulator of the alcohol market on the production of wine in hectolitres, and the Customs Service on the imports of wine materials in tons, which are also used for wine production. 

The main challenges of the project were two: 
* To collect sparsely available data from the various agencies for the last three calendar years 
* To bring different metrics to the same denominator. The analysis had to take into account how many liters of wine would be obtained from a ton of grapes, how many liters of cognac would be obtained by diluting a ton of cognac distillate with water, etc. 

The innovation of this investigation was in choosing one unit of measurement, into which different indicators were converted. That unit was the hectolitre of wine. This choice brought the different metrics of weight and volume to the same denominator. Harvest in tons of grapes, hectoliters of must and bulk wine, distillation of cognacs and brandies - all these values can be directly or indirectly converted into hectoliters of wine. The data summarized in one table proved the existence of the problem and its scale.","Just as a drop of water reveals an entire ocean, so the Russian wine industry reflects the criminal nature of modern Russian power. 

Meininger's subsequent investigation revealed that one of the main beneficiaries of the annexation of Crimea was Vladimir Putin's closest friend Yuri Kovalchuk, who seized 5,950 hectares of Crimean vineyards - almost a third of the entire 20,800 under vine on the peninsula. 

Already after Meininger's publication on Russian wine counterfeiting, it became known that the largest producer of still wines in Russia was the Gatchinskiy Spirtzavod (Gatchina's distillery). This company is located not far from the Estonian border, where even cucumbers have to be grown in greenhouses, and does not have a single hectare of vineyards. Its owner is the family of the head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, Sergey Naryshkin. 

And the key fact published by Republic that explains the strong position of counterfeit producers is that of Russia's 20 largest wineries, 11 are connected to Kremlin's cronies. In total, more than 30 wine producers in the country belong to Russian corrupt officials and criminals.","A systematic approach can be useful to find the logic in the data from different areas. Thus, the use of a single denominator in the form of a hectoliter of wine helped to build a chain of relationships between different indicators. As a result, the unexpected was demonstrated: from year to year, 20-30% of Russian wine appears literally out of thin air.",English,https://www.wine-business-international.com/wine/news/produced-thin-air-mystery-russian-wine,https://www.wine-business-international.com/wine/vladimir-putin-and-his-friends-taking-control-russian-wine,https://republic.ru/posts/104165,https://spb.aif.ru/money/bumazhnyy_urozhay_kak_lenoblast_stala_glavnym_vinodelom_strany,,,,"Sergei Panov, freelance journalist
Robert Joseph, Editor-in-chief","Sergey Panov writes about the wine market for Meininger WBI and Russian investigation outlets Republic.ru and The Insider. The last two were recognized by the Russian authorities as foreign agents, and their websites were blocked in Russia.

Ukraine,TEXTY.org.ua,Small,Participant,,A WALL OF FIRE,2022-06-23,"Explainer, Video, Map, Audio","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite","We decided to show what happens around the Ukrainian frontline position when it’s showered with ""lead rain"" by Russians. This is the reality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We made a graph that illustrates one minute of shelling when several Russian systems are firing on Ukrainian positions simultaneously. Using a hypothetical trench as an example, which we reproduced based on the data from one of our previous projects, we decided to show what kind of fire our soldiers can experience in the hottest spots at the frontline.","Up to 3-5 thousand shells can be fired at a single section of the frontline every day. This is the reality of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Our project gives a real view on the frontline reality, with ""lead rain"" Russian tactics. To turn the tide, Ukraine needs even more arms, including long-ranged weapons, such as M777 howitzers and HIMARS, as well as shells in very large quantities.

Nevertheless, in this text, we are not consider the quantitative indicators of the weapons available to the conflict parties. Instead, we are trying to systematize the key factors that will allow readers to better understand what is happening in the hottest spots on the battlefield of Russian-Ukrainian war.

This project was well-shared on Facebook and prevailed 100,000 views on different platforms. It really works as an explainer, responding to a high demand from people in a rear.","We decided to show ""a wall of fire"" on a hypothetical trench, which we reproduced based on the data from [one of our previous projects](https://texty.org.ua/articles/101984/vkopani-u-kamin-yak-vlashtovani-ukrayinski-okopy-na-shidnomu-fronti/). We made a graph that illustrates one minute of shelling when several systems are firing on our positions simultaneously. 
Shelling pattern was reconstructed from a [detail discription](https://texty.org.ua/articles/106927/ya-bachyv-peklo-doba-na-donbasi-v-lysti-ridnym/) of a real day of Ukrainian defender Oleksander Yeremiahin near Bakhmut.

We found the real sounds of volleys of this caliber and set up the program to simulate the stated intensity of the shots. The project also shows differences between several types of artillery, and how it works in reality - on another graph.

We used D3.js and Adobe illustrator for design and layout.","This project was spontaneously born in editorial office. One day, we thought in the office about what kind of reality it is, given in sensations, for our fighters. And then decided to visualize artillery fire from those weapons that are currently on the frontline. 

In fact, we superimposed the content of one of our articles about artillerymen onto the reconstruction of a trench, which was reproduced in another project of ours. Then applied sound, added a visual component and so created an explainer that has been showing stable interest for more than six months.","After the publication of the material in the comments on our Telegram channel, one of the Ukrainian defenders added important clarifications about what is happening directly on the battlefield.

Singapore,"Thanh Nien, Mekong Eye",Big,Participant,,"In the Mekong Delta, sand mining means lost homes and fortunes",2022-04-25,"Investigation, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Environment, Agriculture, Economy","Drone, Scraping, Google Sheets, CSV","This investigation, published in a mainstream Vietnamese newspaper, revealed that Vietnam reports only a fraction of the sand it exports annually, exposed tax evasion strategies employed by illegal mining enterprises through original documents and interviews and quantified the land erosion, the houses lost and the number of people affected by the sand mining black market. Vietnam ranks 174 out of 180 countries, one of the lowest in the world, in the RSF press freedom ranking and this investigation represents a rare instance of an investigation that exposes widespread corruption published first in Vietnamese for a national audience.","Just one month after publication, our story prompted Vietnam’s Deputy Prime Minister Le Van Thanh to call for increased oversight of sand mining [in an official letter](https://baochinhphu.vn/pho-thu-tuong-yeu-cau-tang-cuong-quan-ly-hoat-dong-khai-thac-cat-102220527191417888.htm) referencing our article and findings. This letter was addressed to nine ministries, management branches, and all local authorities in Vietnam’s provinces and cities, leading to tightened management of sand mining nationwide.

Our story contributed to promoting the development of a new policy for river sand as well as a draft amendment to the Law on Minerals of Vietnam, which is expected to be completed in 2024. All these efforts aim to redefine the value and role of river sand from common building material to strategic resource.

Our story spurred the media’s interest in sand mining as a number of well-known media organizations in Vietnam—including Tuoi Tre \[Young People newspaper\], Nong Nghiep \[an agriculture newspaper\], VnExpress, Vietnam Television (VTV)—have all reported on the issue after the publication of our story. Vietnam National Television even aired a special documentary on sand mining featuring an interview with Dinh Tuyen while investigative journalist Lam Le, writing for the Mekong Eye, [reported](https://www.mekongeye.com/2022/09/02/journalists-report-illegal-sand-mining-in-vietnam/) on our story’s impact in Vietnam.

Our story also received positive feedback from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Vietnam as well as other environmental experts and scientists.","A great deal of our data was locked away in non-machine readable PDFs, so we used **Tabula** to extract data from these documents. When we encountered limitations with Tabula due to character encoding problems, we used Google OCR engine to scrape the remaining data.

We mainly used **Google Sheets** to clean and validate the data, keeping a “data diary” of each step we took as well as backups of the original datasets for reproducibility. We also ran our analysis on Google Sheets, using pivot tables to combine results across different sources. In our original Vietnamese article, we share a public Google Sheets link to all the datasets we used in our investigation, including raw and cleaned spreadsheets.

We used **Tableau Public** and **Flourish** for data visualization depending on the interactive charts that we want to illustrate. The design team at Thanh Nien also crafted custom graphics for the story.

**Video and photography**, including drone footage, were key components to the story. As soon as Vietnam’s COVID-19 travel restrictions started to relax, Dinh Tuyen took numerous trips to communities impacted by sand mining to hear their stories as well as to capture documentary evidence.","Vietnam’s position in the bottom 10 of the RSF press freedom index is due to the state’s almost complete control over the press environment. According to RSF, censored topics include “political dissidents, cases of corruption involving senior officials, the single party’s legitimacy, relations with China and, of course, human rights issues.” RSF also reports that there are currently 39 Vietnamese journalists in prison. Navigating the very limited press freedom space by leveraging the state’s own official statistics to expose the issue enabled the team to publish on a topic that would have been censored had it been reported without findings solidly rooted in official data. Nevertheless, sources took tremendous risks in turning over data and granting interviews on the issue. 

The murky world of sand mining in the Mekong Delta is a risky subject even for international journalists to cover in Vietnam. Data collection in Vietnam is difficult as the government is not eager to fully recognize and disclose its own complicity in the system. Since there were no online sources for sand mining, Dinh Tuyen visited government offices one by one as each province collects their data differently.

Through interviews and investigations, Dinh Tuyen realized how licensed sand mines cheat when reporting their reserves by not issuing sales invoices to extract more than the allowed amount of sand. They also cheat by mining outside their licensed scope. In addition, theft of sand also occurs in many places.

Local authorities and the police are involved and in some cases have good intentions, but the cases they pursue are very few compared to the actual scale of the highly visible mining activities. Currently, local governments and state management agencies are stuck between the benefits and needs of construction and development and irreparable damages caused by landslides.

Reporting on illegal sand mining is a dangerous activity. Because journalists are viewed with hostility by sand miners, Dinh Tuyen had to maintain a very low profile to collect information on the sand market. Furthermore, due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Dinh Tuyen had to quarantine every time he traveled within the country and even contracted COVID-19 himself during his travels. It was also risky for villagers impacted by the mines to speak on the record due to the potential for retaliation by mining companies. 

With a widespread culture of impunity, nobody involved in the investigation expected any kind of legal protection for potential backlash.","Publishing impactful data journalism that successfully combines data investigations with traditional journalism can have a ripple effect in your own newsroom and beyond even under the most repressive regimes. The publication of our story was a new endeavor for Thanh Nien and it generated much interest in data journalism within the organization as well as a desire to produce more in-house data journalism in the future.

Though we were not the first to report on sand mining, we were the first to cover the problem as well as its causes and impacts comprehensively, drawing threads between sand mining, landslides, livelihoods, and government regulation.

Because the public seeks reliable reporting, storytelling with data as evidence helps build that trust. Though our story was much longer than the typical story published by Thanh Nien, we still received attention and a multitude of positive comments from our readers.

Data journalism is hard work requiring grit and passion of a dedicated team. You’ll have to explore and dig through countless datasets to find overlap between issues in the public interest and issues for which the data is available. You need people with complementary skill sets working together to produce the most comprehensive investigation possible. 

This project was Dinh Tuyen’s first foray into data journalism. Previously, for a typical story, he would pick a topic, secure some interviews, and head straight to writing and publishing. The hypothesis-driven approach to data journalism presented Dinh Tuyen with a steep learning curve at first. As a result, he would like to advise journalists new to data journalism to follow through with perseverance and not give up on the investigative process.

Finally, even though data is foundational to a data story like ours, remember at the end of the day that you are covering a human story.","Vietnamese, English",https://www.mekongeye.com/2022/06/23/sand-mining-means-lost-homes-and-fortunes/,https://thanhnien.vn/cat-nao-len-tien-do-xuong-ky-1-xung-dot-cat-sat-lo-post1451832.html,https://thanhnien.vn/cat-nao-len-tien-do-xuong-ky-2-het-cat-thu-thach-song-con-cho-dong-bang-song-cuu-long-post1452405.html,,,,,"Le Dinh Tuyen, Sam An Mardy, Thet Paing Myo, Eva Constantaras, Lam Le, Toby Quốc","Le Dinh Tuyen (pen name “Dinh Tuyen”), is a dynamic journalist at Thanh Nien, one of Vietnam’s leading newspapers.

Spain,Maldita.es,Small,Participant,,El aborto en la Comunidad de Madrid,2022-09-22,"Investigation, Database, Chart, Women, Health","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, FOIA","En Maldita.es publicamos este mes de septiembre una investigación sobre el acceso al aborto en la Comunidad de Madrid.

A través de solicitudes de acceso a la información pública vía ley de transparencia obtuvimos los datos de los abortos que se realizan en la región y que los médicos que los practican tienen que notificar a la Administración.

Así, pudimos descubrir que la última vez que un hospital público notificó la realización de un aborto fue el 22 de mayo de 2018, hace más de cuatro años, o que un tercio de los abortos los pagan las propias mujeres.","La investigación de Maldito Dato sobre el acceso al aborto en la Comunidad de Madrid funcionó muy bien entre nuestra audiencia. Los temas fueron de los más leídos esa semana y la distribución en nuestras redes sociales, y de otras personas que lo compartían y se hacían eco, también fue muy positiva.

Además, los hallazgos de la investigación fueron utilizados por partidos políticos y colectivos que reivindican que haya un mejor acceso al aborto en Madrid. Muchos de los datos revelados por la investigación, que no se conocían hasta entonces, como que no se notifican abortos en hospitales públicos desde mayo de 2018 o que el 29,63% de los abortos en 2021 los pagaron las propias mujeres de su bolsillo, fueron utilizados incluso en manifestaciones y reivindicaciones políticas, en vídeos y campañas de partidos y colectivos e incluso llegaron a discursos realizados por diputados en el Congreso regional. También se hicieron eco otros medios.

Son hallazgos que no se habían conocido nunca y que gracias a la obtención y análisis de esos datos pudimos revelar. Se sabía, por ejemplo, que los hospitales públicos actualmente no notificaban abortos, pero no se sabía desde cuándo exactamente y cuáles fueron los últimos hospitales en dejar de hacerlos, cosa que reveló la investigación.

Además, no existía hasta entonces ningún dato público de que había mujeres pagando sus propios abortos. De hecho, el propio Gobierno de la Comunidad de Madrid, antes de la publicación de la investigación, contestaba a las críticas sobre que no se realizaran abortos en hospitales públicos asegurando que no era un problema porque se realizaban en los privados, pero las mujeres no tenían que pagarlos. La investigación reveló que un tercio de las veces no era así.","Para obtener los datos en los que basamos nuestra investigación utilizamos solicitudes de acceso a la información vía ley de transparencia ante el Gobierno de la Comunidad de Madrid. Para poder saber qué información tenía la Administración realizamos una investigación previa y vimos como eran los formularios que rellenan los médicos para notificar que han realizado un aborto. A partir de ahí realizamos distintas solicitudes de información para acceder al máximo de datos posible y montar nuestras propias bases de datos para la investigación. Además, combinamos esta información con otras fuentes, utilizamos también datos públicos sobre los hospitales y los profesionales que hay en Madrid y España, por ejemplo, y otros datos que obtuvimos vía ley de transparencia también. Posteriormente analizamos todo ello con hojas de cálculo.

La intención de utilizar tantas fuentes de datos distintas y tantos datos diferentes era para poder hacer una radiografía real y la más completa hasta el momento del acceso al aborto en la Comunidad de Madrid. No nos quedamos sólo en esos datos de los abortos que se realizan, también investigamos y analizamos los datos de cuántos hospitales públicos tienen unidad de ginecología y podrían realizar abortos aunque no los estén practicando, por ejemplo.

Además, complementamos nuestras publicaciones con un periodismo de invetigacion más tradicional, con trabajo de campo y hablando con distintas fuentes.

Para los gráficos interactivos de la investigación se utilizó Flourish. En las piezas de la investigación, además, se usó la característica scrollytelling. Para ello se utilizó la propia librería desarrollada por Flourish en Javascript. También realizamos mapeo para mostrar la situación concreta en cada hospital de la región.","La investigación partió del periodismo de datos y del uso de la ley de transparencia, pero tras conseguir la información, crear y analizar las bases de datos, no nos quedamos sólo en esos hallazgos.

Fuimos más allá. Después de analizar los datos y encontrar las historias hay que hacer el resto del trabajo periodístico tradicional. Complementar las historias, buscar testimonios, hablar con fuentes y expertos, etcétera.

Por ejemplo, también investigamos las webs y la publicidad de las clínicas privadas que realizan los abortos, ya que los hospitales públicos no los hacen. Gracias a ello pudimos comprobar como las propias clínicas se publicitan asegurando que es más rápido abortar y tiene menos trámites si lo paga directamente la mujer de su bolsillo. Así pudimos revelar que un tercio de los abortos en la Comunidad de Madrid los pagan las propias mujeres, pero también que las propias clínicas publicitan e inducen a elllo.

También hablamos con fuentes personales, involucradas en el proceso y expertas en el tema, para saber por qué estaba pasando todo esto. No nos quedamos con que ningún hospital público estaba realizando abortos desde mayo de 2018, sino que fuimos a hablar con los expertos para saber por qué pasaba esto, buscamos más datos para contextualizarlo y así pudimos explicar a nuestros lectores qué causas y motivos había detrás de la problemática. Contamos la raíz del problema y no únicamente la problemática que habíamos descubierto con nuestro trabajo de periodismo de datos.

Esto nos permitió conocer mucho más la situación y poder contar los motivos que habían causado los problemas de acceso al aborto que descubrimos con el trabajo de periodismo de datos. Para no quedarnos sólo en los hallazgos y poder contar también las causas y el contexto a los lectores.

También es importante contextualizar que en España hay una sanidad pública muy fuerte, que es uno de los principales motivos de orgullo en nuestro país, y que en teoría cubre multitud de procesos sanitarios que los ciudadanos no tienen que pagar. Entre ellos está el aborto. Por ello, la investigación tuvo un gran impacto, ya que descubrió que muchas mujeres en Madrid, la región donde está la capital del país, estaban pagando su propio aborto a pesar de que en teoría la sanidad pública y las Administraciones cubren esos costes.","La importancia de no creernos lo que dicen los políticos de forma acrítica sin investigarlo y analizarlo como periodistas. Es importante que tengamos el chip del fact-checking y lo apliquemos al periodismo de datos e investigación. En la Comunidad de Madrid el Gobierno presumía de que no había ningún problema porque aunque los abortos se hicieran en clínicas privadas, los estaba pagando la sanidad pública y las mujeres no tenían que correr con esos gastos. Pero pudimos comprobar que en un tercio de las ocasiones no es así.

También se puede aprender que en cualquier base de datos puede haber historias que no esperes. Hay que analizarlas sin nuestros propios sesgos y ver qué hallazgos encontramos. Se sabía que los hospitales públicos no estaban haciendo abortos en la Comunidad de Madrid, pero no que había ese problema de mujeres pagando sus propios abortos. Pudimos descubrirlo al hacer un buen análisis de todos los datos obtenidos.

Por ello, también hay que tener claro que es muy importante el trabajo en materia de transparencia y solicitudes de información. Conseguir datos que tienen las Administraciones es fundamental para revelar problemáticas importantes para la sociedad y poder hacer un buen periodismo de datos. Si no los conseguimos nosotros como periodistas, nunca se podrán conocer muchas historias que están ocultas en esas bases de datos que al ser de los Gobiernos, nos pertenecen a todos los ciudadanos. Por ello, al solicitar información también hay que tener claro que hay que intentar solicitar y conseguir la máxima posible y luchar por obtenerla. Podríamos no haber pedido la variable de quién estaba pagando cada aborto notificado porque en principio ahí no se sabía que había un problema, pero nos hubieramos perdido una parte fundamental de la historia y de la problemática que acabó denunciando nuestra investigación.",Spanish,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220922/abortos-publica-excepcion-madrid/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220922/mujeres-aborto-madrid-pagaron/,https://maldita.es/tag/aborto-comunidad-madrid,,,,,"Sergio Sangiao Pérez, Ana Gómez Parra","El presente trabajo ha sido publicado por Maldito Dato, la sección de Maldita.es (una fundación sin ánimo de lucro y medio de comunicación independiente) especializada en periodismo de datos, transparencia y derecho de acceso a la información.

El procesamiento de los datos permitió identificar anomalías en procesos de construcción en tramos a cargo de Grupo Carso, propiedad de Carlos Slim, así como la pérdida de documentos con pruebas clave para identificar a los responsables del derrumbe del Metro.","La investigación reveló irregularidades en la planeación y en la construcción de la Línea 12 del Metro de la Ciudad de México, con lo que se demostró la responsabilidad compartida de autoridades y empresas constructoras. Esto contribuyó a que los familiares de las 26 personas fallecidas en el derrumbe del Metro, así como los lesionados, recibieran una indemnización.
La Jefa del Gobierno de la Ciudad de México atacó a los periodistas que elaboraron la investigación, acusándolos de haberse confabulado con la empresa Det Norske Veritas (DNS), de Noruega, la cual determinó que la falta de mantenimiento de parte de las autoridades fue un factor que provocó el desplome del Metro. Fue una acción para tratar de desacreditar los hallazgos de la investigación periodística.
Este proyecto fue galardonado con un Premio EPPY por innovación en Estados Unidos.","Un primer paso fue realizar el scraping de noticias publicadas en medios digitales sobre el desplome del Metro de la Ciudad de México, para identificar vetas novedosas de información.

El hostigamiento gubernamental ha ido acompañado de un bloqueo informativo; el Gobierno mexicano ha cancelado fuentes de datos abiertos y es frecuente que oculte información de interés público, como contratos y expedientes de casos de corrupción.
En ese contexto adverso, de violencia y acoso contra la prensa, es que se realizó la investigación periodística sobre el desplome de un tramo del Metro de la Ciudad de México que provocó la muerte de 26 personas. El Gobierno reaccionó a la publicación con acusaciones y amenazas contra los periodistas.","El volumen de documentos y datos por procesar requirió el trabajo colaborativo entre periodistas, programadores y diseñadores.

These volunteer diplomats work from their home countries to promote the interests of foreign governments, typically in places without an embassy or consulate.

Shadow Diplomats, an investigation by ICIJ, ProPublica and 60 media partners, identified at least 500 current and former honorary consuls accused of crimes or embroiled in controversies, before, while or after they were appointed, including some caught exploiting their status for personal gain. The team found that convicted drug traffickers, murderers, sex offenders and fraudsters have served as honorary consuls.","“Shadow Diplomats” forced reforms to a mainstay arrangement that for decades resisted even modest change. The governments of seven countries have so far announced investigations, removed consuls or pledged changes to the system that empowers them. Two honorary consuls resigned even before the stories were published.

In Finland, the protocol chief at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said he was unaware that some consuls had been convicted of tax fraud, bribery and environmental crimes. The ministry planned to conduct an immediate review. 

In Brazil, authorities opened an investigation into crimes committed by honorary consuls following a request by Deputy Prosecutor General Lucas Furtado. “It is clear that there may be damage … to public coffers,” he said.

A top official in Paraguay said the government is planning to review its diplomatic laws and regulations.

In Germany, politicians called for change, citing national security concerns. “It would therefore be necessary to reform the system, which invites abuse,” said German Parliament member Roderich Kiesewetter. “Regular training, security clearance must also be enforced.”

The Foreign Ministry in Latvia said it would investigate an honorary consul representing Indonesia who had tried to claim diplomatic immunity in legal proceedings for domestic assault.

And in the United States, national security experts called on the federal government to review protections and privileges granted to the more than 1,000 consuls here.

“It’s the one guaranteed area where the rule of law doesn’t matter — the law has no teeth,” said Suzanne Hayden, a former federal prosecutor focused on national and international security. “There is not even an opportunity to test the law because all you have to do is say, ‘I have diplomatic immunity,’ and when confronted, the local cops simply put their hands up and walk away. It’s just the perfect scenario for crime.”","Shadow Diplomats identified at least 500 current and former honorary consuls accused of crimes or embroiled in controversies, before, while or after they were appointed, including some caught exploiting their status for personal gain.

ICIJ’s data team spent months structuring and cleaning official information released by countries, and then categorizing the controversies surrounding the honorary consuls identified by the reporting team.

The data was collected during a five months-long effort that involved students from Northwestern University’s Medill Investigative Lab, overseen by Debbie Cenziper of ProPublica, ICIJ reporter Will Fitzgibbon and media partners around the world, who reviewed court cases, NGO reports, news clips, government investigations, sanctions lists and other reports. Reporters searched court databases in Brazil, France, Ukraine, Spain, and Germany, and submitted public information requests in Croatia, Finland, El Salvador and Honduras, among other countries.

Then, using Google Sheets, ICIJ’s data team researched every case, flagging honorary consuls to specific categories and scrupulously checking sources. Out of nearly 700 cases, the team trimmed duplicates and controversies that didn’t fit selection criteria to reach a list of just over 500, which were key to identifying leads and helping with reporting efforts. 

ICIJ also reviewed what type of information was provided by governments about honorary consuls. ICIJ’s analysis found that only 42 governments provided information updated in 2022.

Separately, using information from public records’ requests and lists of consuls published online, the ICIJ data team created a first-of-its-kind “transparency index” to compare what information countries make public about their honorary consuls’ appointments. ICIJ reviewed Ministries of Foreign Affairs websites and showed that the quality and availability of the information varied greatly.

The team contacted the ministries of those countries for which no information about honorary consuls could be found. Dozens of those requests went unanswered or were refused outright.","The “Shadow Diplomats” investigation was entirely original. Though thousands of honorary consuls are in place worldwide, pre existing information about the system was scarce. Governments and law enforcement acknowledged having no information about criminal honorary consuls identified by reporters, and even leading academics on diplomatic law conceded they knew little or nothing at all. 

Because honorary consuls are most often prominent and powerful private citizens, our reporting partners in countries that included Lebanon and Honduras faced particular dangers in raising questions and seeking information. In Guinea, our reporting partner was sued by an honorary consul who is one of the richest men in West Africa; the case was ultimately dropped.

The quality of the data on honorary consuls reviewed for the case studies as well as the transparency index varied significantly. The team looked for additional public records that would help confirm whether the person was ever appointed as honorary consul and whether the events associated with them happened while they were honorary consuls. Whereas the case studies gathered (which were not published in full) don’t include every possible case of controversies involving honorary consuls, it is still a fair representation of the most egregious stories identified by ICIJ, ProPublica and its media partners across the world.

It wasn’t always possible to identify the conclusion to a controversy mentioned in a press article or court case — for example, whether the person was convicted of a crime they were accused of committing. ICIJ therefore applied a conservative approach: cases were divided between “allegations” and “convictions” so that only proven convictions were included in a specific final count.

For the transparency index ICIJ’s data team selected six criteria against which each Ministry of Foreign Affairs website was evaluated: has the information been updated in 2022? Is the website available? Are the dates of appointment available? Do we have information for both appointed and hosted consuls? Are their names visible? Is a stand-alone list displayed (in HTML or PDF format for example), or is the information buried across different web pages?

It was also important to review foreign affairs policy by nation, as some countries share a common one — Curacao, Aruba and St Maarten are constituent countries part of the Netherlands, which publishes information on the honorary consuls present in those countries. Therefore, the index focused on analyzing countries who oversee diplomatic relations.","The lack of public data around the world on a topic of interest can be the beginning of a global investigation. It is possible to start organizing information to explore that topic in a systematic way, by selecting what type of information to look for, where to look for it across borders and also how to document the lack of it.

For example, the team decided to gather information on what information governments made publicly available around the world and how citizens could access that information through the Ministries of Foreign Affairs websites for all countries in the world and published a transparency index ranking a total of 196 countries.

While working on topics at a global scale, it is important to review each country's regulations to assess how the information will be gathered. 

Public records requests, confidential sources, online research through news reports and on-the-ground reporting can lead to court records, government reports, media archives and intelligence reports that can be key to gather information on case studies as well as report on key stories.

A collaborative effort with journalists across countries can help advance both data gathering processes as well as reporting efforts. It can help cross-seed data findings and support and motivate journalists who might have never used data.

While organizing information on a spreadsheet tied to case studies, it is important to document the process, establish the criteria that will be used, keep track of the sources that support each point of information and allocate time to fact-check the information that was gathered.","English, Albanian, German, Belarusian, French, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Spanish, Croatian, Finnish, Hungarian, Hebrew, Italian, Arabic, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Nepali, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish",https://www.icij.org/investigations/shadow-diplomats/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/shadow-diplomats/accused-terror-financiers-arms-drug-traffickers/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/shadow-diplomats/how-a-global-data-dive-uncovered-hundreds-of-honorary-consuls-linked-to-crimes-or-scandals/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/shadow-diplomats/honorary-consuls-country-list/,https://www.icij.org/investigations/shadow-diplomats/controversial-honorary-consuls-profiles/,https://www.propublica.org/article/honorary-consuls-russia-vladimir-putin,https://www.propublica.org/article/honorary-consuls-shadow-diplomatic-immunity-reforms,"Journalists from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, ProPublica and more than 60 media partners in 46 countries.

This project crawls through the bills proposed by each councilor from Taiwan's six major municipalities. From the number, the categories and the key words of bills, our project provides a clear and complete councilor bills analysis for voters from each area.","Voters in different regions with different identities will receive customized analysis reports on local bills, allowing them to better understand the performances of local candidates before voting and observe which candidate's bills align most closely with their own concerns. We are the first Taiwanese news media to quantitatively present the performances of councilors' bills. After the release of the project, it was re-posted by political figures and candidates from various parties. According to feedback from readers, this project effectively helps readers to analyze candidates rationally and avoid blind voting.","We used Python to scrape the websites of the six major municipalities’ councils. The file formats include PDF, DOC, and JSON. We removed the text data irrelevant to the bills and converted remaining data into analyzable structured data. In terms of bill content processing, we used the CKIP Tagger, an open-source Chinese language processor to segment words, which was developed by Academia Sinica, Taiwan’s top research institution. We then filtered out nouns (excluding postpositions and quantifiers), verbs, and adjectives based on word attributes for subsequent frequency statistics and visualization.

Next, we compared data from the Central Election Commission to find candidates' current positions and the number of terms she/he had been elected for analyses of her/his qualifications and proposal performance. Finally, we used Python to produce the corresponding word cloud of bills and data analysis according to the district and candidate.","The data of some cities lack accessibility. In addition to file formats being hard to organize, there are problems such as irregular Chinese characters, errors in councilors' names, and missing information. Therefore, a lot of time was spent cleaning and verifying the data in the early stages. We also made the project available to some communities before completion, allowing people to find and correct errors. Some of these people included current councilors, who then urged the council to complete the missing data and in turn improved the quality of public data.","In recent years,Taiwan’s Academia Sinica has been constantly improving its Chinese word segmentation system.

Este proyecto surgió con la certeza de vigilar el presupuesto gubernamental.
La plataforma incluye una sección para el seguimiento de los contratos del gobierno para saber qué y a quién se está contratando, con especial énfasis en la detección de casos irregulares en los que el dinero público, aportado vía impuestos, termina en manos o destinos indeseables, como son empresas fantasma, negocios de políticos o familiares o pozos de opacidad sin fondo.","La plataforma ""Nuestro dinero"" fue desarrollada por la unidad de datos de la organización Mexicanos contra la Corrupción y la Impunidad, la cual se ha convertido en un referente en la vigilancia del uso de recursos públicos en México. 
La confiabilidad y oportunidad de la información generada ha permitido que periodistas de distintos medios de comunicación, así como organizaciones, la retomen como fuente para otras investigaciones.
La plataforma ""Nuestro dinero"" ha logrado realizar un seguimiento tan puntual y preciso del presupuesto público, que podemos determinar cuánto gasta el gobierno por segundo, por minuto, por hora, por día y por mes.
Esos indicadores son fuente de información muy valiosa que con frecuencia retoman periodistas e investigadores académicos.","La plataforma ""Nuestro Dinero"" fue realizada para tratar de hacer más accesible y fácil de consultar de manera permanente el gasto público.
La información fue extraída de bases de datos públicas, tanto del gobierno como de organizaciones civiles, de los años 2019, 2020, 2021 y 2022.
En nuestra unidad de de datos hemos automatizado una serie de indicadores y verificaciones que nos arrojan alertas o ""banderas rojas"" de posibles irregularidades.
Estas alertas se logran con la combinación de bases de datos; por ejemplo, hemos automatizado el cruce del sistema de compras del gobierno (Compranet) con una listado de empresas ""fantamas"", que simulan operaciones o que están involucradas con ilícitos como lavado de dinero y evasión fiscal.
Además, la automatización de las bases de datos nos ha permitido identificar patrones anómalos, como el acortamiento de plazos de contratación, procedimientos que superan los umbrales legales de montos permitidos para exceptuar la licitación y asignaciones a empresas de reciente creación.
Una vez identificadas potenciales irregularidades, se realizó trabajo de campo y cotejo con fuentes vivas, para validar los hallazgos.
El siguiente paso sumó a los integrantes de la unidad de comunicación, que realizaron visualizaciones sobre los principales hallazgos, así como infografías animadas del comportamiento del gasto.
Si bien la plataforma se lanzó en julio de 2022, se le añadieron en el transcurso del año nuevos análisis y visualizaciones.
Se utilizaron herramientas de web scraping y automatización de búsquedas y cruce de datos (Octoparse, Cyotek WebCopy y ParseHub, entre otras). La información extraída se colocó en formatos estructurados de Excel y CSV, además de utilizarse el lenguaje de programación R para el análisis estadístico.","En el año 2022, México se convirtió en el país más peligroso para ejercer el periodismo, con 17 periodistas asesinados, según registros de la asociación Artículo 19. A eso se añaden los constantes ataques verbales que el Presidente de México lanza todos los días contra los periodistas y organizaciones que ejercen la crítica. El hostigamiento gubernamental ha ido acompañado de un bloqueo informativo; el Gobierno mexicano ha cancelado fuentes de datos abiertos y es frecuente que oculte información de interés público, como contratos y expedientes de casos de corrupción.
En ese contexto adverso, de violencia y acoso contra la prensa y las organizaciones civiles, es que se realizó la investigación sobre el presupuesto gubernamental.","La vigilancia del poder político y gubernamental es una tarea fundamental del periodismo en general y del periodismo de investigación en particular.

However, in Taipei City and New Taipei City, nearly 90% of the listings are illegal. Some of these listings have also become a breeding ground for criminal industries such as sex and gambling. However, as Taiwan's tourism market is not large enough, the government is unable to push for specialized laws or effectively collaborate with the Airbnb platform to take down illegal listings.","Our project aims to raise awareness among consumers about the high proportion of illegal accommodations on Airbnb and the risks of unlicensed accommodations, such as carbon monoxide poisoning and consumer disputes. Through our dialogues with government inspection agencies and data analysis, we have also pinpointed the types of listings that fall into legal gray areas, so that governments can develop effective control measures for diverse types of listings.

For short-term rental businesses and governments, there has been little progress in communication with the Airbnb platform in recent years. After the project was released, Airbnb issued a statement saying that it will work with government agencies and relevant departments to establish clear, fair, and reasonable standards for the management of short-term rentals.","We used Python to scrape data from Airbnb listings in Taipei and New Taipei cities, comparing the latitude and longitude, names, descriptions, and minimum rental periods to the legal addresses and information of accommodations in the region that were published by the Taiwan Tourism Bureau. We then excluded legal monthly rentals with a minimum rental period of one month, compiling a list of legal and illegal listings. Finally, we used the latitude and longitude data of the listings to create a map for the cover of the report using Python.","This project was re-posted by illegal accommodation businesses on private social media groups. The Chief of the Taipei City Department of Information and Tourism, who was originally a named source, was doxed and received online threats. His name was subsequently taken off the report. In terms of data collection, some accommodations have applied for temporary suspension of business to officials but have not been removed from the Airbnb website, so it cannot be confirmed whether the data was out-of-date or the accommodation has continued to operate illegally.

United States,TAP was created by The Investigative Reporting Workshop at American University. It moved to The Center for Public Integrity in October 2022.,Small,Participant,,The Accountability Project (TAP),2022-10-03,"Database, Open data","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, PostgreSQL, Python","Public data is everywhere, collected by government agencies, advocacy groups, news organizations and an ever-expanding set of specialty sites. But that data is in too many different locations to easily search. The Accountability Project cuts across these data silos and gives journalists and the public a simple way to search huge volumes of public data about people and organizations.

So far, we’ve acquired, standardized and uploaded hundreds of databases, accounting for more than 1.5 billion records. The data has been used by journalists across the country to identify patterns and draw connections between people and organizations.","The goal of TAP was to provide research data to newsrooms and researchers that might otherwise not have access to such data. We have worked with several nonprofit newsrooms to help them with investigations using TAP data, including stories about dark money, nonprofits and health care.

We have nearly 20,000 unique users with more than 400 sign-ups for the data that requires a logon. Because the site is free, it is difficult for us to track how individual searches generate stories, but anecdotally, users say it is a valuable resource.","TAP is built on Amazon cloud technologies: an EC2 web server, a Postgres Amazon RDS database, as well as an Elasticsearch account with [elastic.co](https://elastic.co). Our data is stored as a data lake, with only a subset of fields as native Postgres columns. The full data is kept in JSONB. 

The website itself is built with Django, and an administrative tool allows contributors to tag and standardize the data fields, including names, addresses, dates, and other key fields. The search pages are built using Svelte.js.
The data is split into entities and transactions. Names and addresses are searched in Elasticsearch and transactions are stored in PostgresSQL. 

Data is tested on a staging site, so we can check that search results work as intended before publishing to the live site. 
Many of the TAP’s databases required filing open records requests or extracting data from documents. Reviewing hundreds of data sets with a scrappy crew of fellows and data journalists has meant a lot of hard work to gather, check, and add the data to the site. To help keep things organized and on track, we keep a log of every database from request to upload, including the name of the person responsible for it. We’re software agnostic, as long as users can create a reproducible workflow or script, but most of the data processing is done in R or Python.","We took on what seemed like an impossible task. 

Every stage of this project offered unique challenges. At the onset, we needed to develop a shared vision for The Accountability Project among our team, mapping out an ambitious but manageable path for what we could realistically build with our resources and timeline. 

Every TAP data set originated in a different format and under different open records laws. Very few of the data sets we included were readily available online. We had to write scraping tools to pull data from government websites and even, in some cases, documents. We faced long negotiations with some agencies over access or excessive fees. 

Once we acquired the data, the team had to develop creative solutions to scraping and standardizing hundreds of different data sets.

Now that CPI has taken over TAP, we are seeking ways to connect with local newsrooms who often lack research resources. We’re exploring new opportunities and partnerships that could help expose more journalists to The Accountability Project and establish it as a go-to tool for reporters. 

At the same time, we plan to add new features to the site, including geographical searches and the ability for users to run their own data against what is on the site. We’re also planning to conduct more user experience research to get a better understanding of how people use the site and how we can improve its functionality.","TAP was built to help journalists find stories they can’t find any other way. Users will be able to discover relationships between people, addresses and companies, political groups, nonprofits and other entities that they wouldn’t have noticed otherwise because they weren’t previously searchable from one place.

We hope our experience in developing the tool also can serve to help others interested in taking on similar projects.

Our advice:

1. Research what else is available. What does your project do that is unique? Find people and organizations that you can partner with instead of recreating the wheel.

2. Understand and communicate your shared vision from the outset.

3. Plan for the long, long term. If you want your project to live for a long time, make sure you have a sustainability plan to keep it going. It likely will take longer than you anticipate to launch. We’ve watched plenty of well-intentioned search projects die a slow death from lack of funding because it’s hard to find long-term support. We’re working to lower our operating costs, but also taking steps to make sure the data we’ve gathered helps others.

4. Use a structured workflow. Even if your workflow changes, it will keep everyone on the same page in the direction of success.

5. Have fun. Projects like this are an incredible amount of work. If you can’t have some enjoyment doing them, your product will not be as effective.",English,https://publicaccountability.org/,,,,,,,"Jacob Fenton, Jennifer LaFleur, Megan Gayle Crigger, Kiernan Nicholls, Yanqi Xu and Aarushi Sehejpal","Jacob Fenton is TAP’s lead developer.

* Qualtrics","Sheriffs run jails across the U.S. In rural areas, they are functionally police chiefs, overseeing everything from traffic patrols to homicide investigations. Their policy decisions about enforcement—from immigration to abortion to evictions—shape the lives of millions of Americans. But unlike police chiefs, they face very little oversight and some stay in power for decades. Recently, many have earned national notoriety for their controversial opinions and abusive jail conditions. Our goal was to understand how sheriffs’ personal views shape their policy decisions—and how many subscribe to a growing far-right movement that teaches them they are more powerful than governors and presidents.","More than 500 sheriffs responded to our survey – roughly 1 in 6 nationwide. Hundreds agreed with a far-right idea that their power supersedes that of governors and presidents. Many expressed negative attitudes toward immigrants that help explain their enthusiastic embrace of Donald Trump’s policies. Dozens said they personally agreed with Oath Keepers, the militia associated with the Jan. 6 invasion of the U.S. Capitol. 

The team produced two stories on the results, which were co-published with USA Today. The first outlined the history of sheriffs — from the British colonies to the Jim Crow South — and used survey results to dissect their modern-day role as politicians, jail wardens, and law enforcement policymakers. The second story documented the rise of the far-right “Constitutional Sheriff” movement and its charismatic founder Richard Mack. 

Partnering with USA Today, which distributed the stories to its vast network of local newspapers, gave our reporting broad reach. USA Today also did an interview with Chammah on its [“Five Things” podcast](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/11/04/cop-27-climate-summit-trumps-ongoing-legal-issues-5-things-podcast/8264866001/). 

Chammah was interviewed by Cheryl Thompson for [NPR: Inside The Constitutional Sheriffs Movement](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/22/1130755532/inside-the-constitutional-sheriff-movement), which was picked up by 36 public radio stations nationwide. He was featured on NPR's [WBUR Here and Now](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/and%20mirya%20on%20the%20takeaway%20https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/do-you-know-whos-running-sheriff), Vox’s podcast [Today, Explained](https://www.stitcher.com/show/today-explained/episode/power-tripping-sheriffs-209557595), Wisconsin Public Radio’s [The Morning Show](https://www.wpr.org/people/maurice-chammah), the Fever Dreams Podcast with [Mule Manjia](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/mule-majnia-w-maurice-chammah/id1558716930?i=1000583911536) and on Radio France’s [American Fractures](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceculture/podcasts/cultures-monde/mid-terms-la-democratie-en-ballotage-2628813) series.

A New York Times editorial, “[Extremists in Uniform Put the Nation at Risk](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/opinion/us-police-military-extremism.html?partner=slack&smid=sl-share),” referenced our story: “A recent investigation by the Marshall Project found that hundreds of sheriffs nationwide are part of or are sympathetic to the ideas behind the constitutional sheriffs movement, which holds that sheriffs are above state and federal law and are not required to accept gun laws, enforce Covid restrictions or investigate election results.” The survey was cited by numerous local news outlets, including in [Washington](https://crosscut.com/politics/2022/11/right-wing-constitutional-sheriffs-ballot-wa) and [Colorado](https://www.kunc.org/news/2022-11-23/sheriff-opposition-to-colorados-red-flag-gun-law-under-scrutiny-after-club-q-shooting).","Chammah’s key innovation in reporting this story was a collaboration with two political science professors, Emily Farris and Mirya Holman, with whom he had developed trust as sources over the course of several years. Together, they worked out a unique arrangement. Working with the Institutional Review Boards at Tulane University and Texas Christian University, Chammah had to make careful decisions about the ethics of a project that needed to meet the demands of academic research as well as journalistic integrity. The Marshall Project purchased a contact list from the National Sheriffs Association, and then Farris and Holman scoured dozens of websites in order to produce a total email list that nearly accounted for all of America’s 3,000-plus sheriffs. Farris and Holman preserved the anonymity initially promised to responders, but allowed sheriffs to agree to follow-up interviews, which Chammah performed. 

Anastasia Valeeva used Python scripts and a lot of back-and-forth with the researchers to analyze the data for the stories. Katie Park and Anatasia took the data and built it into dozens of graphics powered by D3.js used to provide rich context on the views of sheriffs and make thorny comparisons clear.","To report this story, Chammah attended a training hosted by the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers association. At this gathering of far-right sheriffs, one speaker repeatedly threatened him and other journalists, who were identifiable as some of the only people present wearing COVID-19 face masks. But even so, Chammah managed to secure an interview with the organization’s leader, Richard Mack, who regularly accuses journalists of lying but praised Chammah’s rigor and professionalism, even as the article itself gave voice to claims that Mack is dangerous to American democracy. 

Chammah worked with the professors to design survey questions that would parse the connections between opinions and policies. To give one example, they used questions written by the nonpartisan American National Election Studies to assess negative views of immigrants. They asked the sheriffs to agree or disagree with the statement, “Immigrants today take advantage of jobs and opportunities here without doing enough to give back to the community.” Then they asked the sheriffs whether their deputies check the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, traffic violators or people arrested for non-violent crimes. They were able to show that sheriffs who hold negative views of immigrants are more likely to aggressively check immigration status, shedding light on why so many sheriffs have worked with the federal government on immigration enforcement. They took a similar approach to questions about gun control, policing reform, and the 2020 racial justice protests.","They can learn how to hold their local sheriffs accountable, by understanding with more depth what the sheriffs actually do at a practical level and how their policy choices affect the lives of residents, as well as what ideological forces are shaping their policy choices.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/we-surveyed-u-s-sheriffs-see-their-views-on-power-race-and-immigration,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/10/18/does-your-sheriff-think-he-s-more-powerful-than-the-president,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/11/03/sheriffs-elected-survey-political-views-police-immigration/10627451002/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/11/03/county-sheriff-constitutional-power-richard-mack-oath-keepers/10627256002/,,,,"Maurice Chammah, Emily Farris, Mirya Holman, Anastasia Valeeva, Katie Park","Maurice Chammah is a staff writer for The Marshall Project and the author of ""Let the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.”

United States,"The Marshall Project, Politico",Big,Participant,,No Place for A Child,2022-06-16,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration, Immigration, Human rights","D3.js, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Observable notebooks","In an analysis of previously unpublished records, reporters Anna Flagg and Julia Preston found that one in three migrants detained by the Border Patrol since early 2017 was a minor under the age of 18. That was a far bigger share of detainees than had been reported before. Children and teenagers were held in cold, crowded cinder-block cells under the 24-hour glare of white lights, with stale food and no medical care, often for longer than the 72-hour limit on detention of children. A Guatemalan teenager we interviewed said she was held for 18 days in a south Texas facility.","Our story revealed for the first time and at a crucial political moment the huge number of children being held along the border and allowed them to describe their experiences. In thousands of interviews with legal services providers, children reported being yelled at, cursed, kicked and shoved by Border Patrol agents. Many young people said the food was frozen or stale and made them sick. We found that more than 220,000 of the minors, about one-third, were held for longer than 72 hours, the legal limit for border detention of children, our reporting showed.

As the Border Patrol prepared for a new influx of migrants after the lifting of a Title 42 pandemic order, our story showed the urgent need for broader reforms.

By partnering with Politico, we were able to reach a wide audience as well as political decision-makers in Washington. Politico included the story in its Playbook morning newsletter, which is read by more than a quarter million global influencers every morning. We did an Instagram collaboration with the Politico team, and co-hosted a Twitter Space with our reporters and the Politico editor. The story also had 236,000 views on Apple News. 

The story also was the lead in National Immigration Forum’s June 21 newsletter, The Forum Daily. The influential immigration index, which reaches both immigrant advocates as well as pro-immigration conservatives and Republicans, quoted liberally from the story.","We submitted FOIA requests to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency for person-level data on both child and overall border detentions, obtaining multiple datasets from different time periods. We found further detention counts online and in published documents for the time periods that CBP posted them publicly. We then used programming language R to compile and standardize these many datasets, and calculate both the monthly detention total and the percent of detentions that were children between February 2017 and June 2021. We compared our findings to CBP’s published results, as well as estimates put out by other organizations, whenever such information existed. After analyzing this data, we charted it and mapped it using JavaScript visualization library D3.js.

Our reporters wanted to make in-person, high-quality audio recordings of the unaccompanied minors in the story. This involved months of communications with them and their attorneys, to make sure they entirely consented to the interviews. The multi-hour recordings allowed the young people to recount precise details of harrowing journeys in their own words at their own pace. Finding minors who could identify and describe with certainty the border facilities where they were held was an important challenge we overcame in this reporting.","Customs and Border Protection had consistently refused to acknowledge the high percentage of people it detained who were minors, including young children. Officials denied there was any urgency to create more child-appropriate conditions for holding children at the border, even though most of their facilities are little better than county jails. 

Collecting this data involved months of requests to CBP and long delays for agency processing. While working to update our datasets with the most recent available data, CBP would sometimes deny requests for data they had previously released, making it necessary for us to file appeals, leading to further delays. Fact-checking the data and the results was also time-consuming as the agency was not always able to provide complete explanations of their data and potential inconsistencies.","Combining revelations based on hard data with deeply felt personal stories is a powerful way to tell this kind of story about the harsh and sometimes life-threatening effects of border and law enforcement policies and practices.

One lesson we learned during this project was how important it was to triangulate our findings with several different sources of data. Sometimes Customs and Border Protection simply wasn’t able to give us an answer we needed about their data; but we validated our work by collaborating with other subject-matter experts. For example, historically CBP has not always provided an official figure for the percent of detentions that are kids. But organizations like the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) have found ways to estimate the number by looking at the historic reported number of family detentions, and the number of children versus adults in those families, for other years. Methods like these, which immigration researchers were generous enough to share with us, made our project possible.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/06/16/no-place-for-a-child,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/16/border-patrol-migrant-children-detention-00039291,,,,,,"Julia Preston, Anna Flagg","Anna Flagg is The Marshall Project's senior data reporter, covering immigration, crime, race, policing and incarceration.

United States,"ProPublica, NBC News",Big,Participant,,Overpolicing Parents: How America’s CPS Dragnet Ensnares Families,2022-04-22,"Investigation, Database","Scraping, D3.js, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","Our investigation went beyond the prevailing narratives about child welfare investigations — that state agencies either do too much or too little to keep children safe. Instead, we revealed a system that deprives people of their rights in ways that neither protect children nor their families. We tracked the sequence of a child welfare case, examining how authorities wielded their power to investigate and separate families — beginning with the initial, usually anonymous, tip that a child might be in danger. Our investigation was fueled by an unprecedented analysis of tens of millions of child welfare records from the past decade.","In the wake of our story in Arizona, the office of the state’s incoming governor said it had read our work and wanted to take the agency in a new direction. She chose a new director of the state’s CPS department: a Black community advocate whom we had highlighted in our story.

In New York, both the City Council and the state Assembly appear poised to pass bills creating a “Miranda warning” notifying families being investigated by CPS of their rights. This comes after our story about how the city conducts tens of thousands of warrantless home searches every year. Our report had highlighted the Miranda idea as a possible solution.

In response to ProPublica and NBC News’ findings on mandatory reporting, a bipartisan group of state lawmakers in Pennsylvania has called for the legislature to conduct a study of the 2014 child welfare law that we highlighted. In West Virginia, two state legislators said their staffs would examine the state’s practice of terminating parental rights in light of our story there. In response to our story in Illinois, two lawmakers in the state called on their governor to improve access to mental health and substance abuse treatment to ensure that families repeatedly investigated by the state’s child welfare agency can access help.

Our project could also prompt the federal government to pass reforms to the child welfare policies that our series examined: Members of Congress are planning to introduce a bill this year that would end the strict federal timeline for the termination of parental rights. They were shocked by our findings — including a state-by-state analysis of termination timelines that no other institution has conducted — and agreed that such realities could help shift attitudes on the child welfare system and create bipartisan momentum for change.","We filed requests for data from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect for their National Child Abuse Data System (NCANDS) and Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS). The NCANDS data required a research proposal documenting how we would keep the information secure and approval from an institutional review board.

Both databases are incredibly large (millions of entries per year) and messy, so over the course of a year, we developed a careful methodology for analyzing them. A single child can appear many times in the data, so we employed multiple large queries — written and executed in R — to pull relevant information from different parts of each database to create as accurate a list of children and cases as possible. Even still, we made sure to be as conservative as possible in interpreting our analysis results, especially because there were differences in how certain fields were tracked among states. We also shared our methodology and analysis results with multiple experts familiar with both sets of data as well as the data archive itself who confirmed the validity of our methods.

Our reporting in Illinois used data obtained from that state’s child welfare department through a public records request. This data allowed us to track the same family over time, which isn’t possible with NDACAN. The resulting story drew attention to thousands of Illinois families who cycle through multiple cases, centering on one rural family whom authorities investigated 10 times without successfully stabilizing them.","To access the NCANDS data used in this project, we had to seek IRB approval, which required a written project proposal and $1,125 fee.

Politically, child welfare is a fraught topic. Stories typically focus on outlier events, such as cases of extreme child abuse or neglect or stories of innocent parents who were wronged by the system. But our data analysis and reporting told a different story – one in which millions of families became ensnared by a system that has much the same power and disproportionality of the criminal justice system without the same constitutional protections. This required uncovering the trends through data analysis and featuring parents who may not be perfect, but for whom the punishment didn’t appear proportional to what they were accused of. Reporting this story was particularly challenging because access to documents is tightly guarded in nearly every state and child protective services workers and judges don’t typically comment on them. This required meticulous work on the part of the reporters to comb through what was publicly available and fact check what our sources were telling us.","The greatest strength of this project is that it documented systemic issues in a topic in which most investigations typically focus on outlier events. For example, most assume child protective services only deal with cases of extreme abuse, but our analysis found that the majority of cases do not involve those allegations, and very few are substantiated. By zooming out and cataloging the outcomes and disparities of the system, we were able to show the very real harm it has on the majority of people it comes in contact with, and the ineffectiveness of supposedly “common sense” policies, such as mandatory reporting.

From a data perspective, the project’s success in uncovering meaningful findings on child welfare, a traditionally difficult and opaque subject, demonstrated that there are many opportunities to do original and impactful reporting on traditionally under-covered or poorly documented subject areas.

This project also showed that there is a lot to be gained in telling the stories of people who may not be traditional “perfect” victims. In each story, we pushed ourselves to feature parents who were representative of the trends we found in our reporting, regardless of how spotless their records were.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/for-black-families-in-phoenix-child-welfare-investigations-are-constant-threat,https://www.propublica.org/article/six-months-or-less-parents-lose-kids-forever,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-child-welfare-investigation-data,https://www.propublica.org/article/dcfs-illinois-investigations-child-welfare,https://www.propublica.org/article/child-welfare-search-seizure-without-warrants,https://www.propublica.org/article/mandatory-reporting-strains-systems-punishes-poor-families,https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-matthew-stewart-child-safety-hobbs,"Eli Hager - ProPublica, Agnel Philip - ProPublica, Hannah Rappleye - NBC News, Mike Hixenbaugh - NBC News, Suzy Khimm - NBC News, Lucas Waldron - ProPublica, Molly Parker - The Southern Illinoisan, Vernal Coleman - ProPublica, Haru Coryne - ProPublica","Eli Hager is a ProPublica reporter covering issues affecting children and teens in the Southwest.

United States,"OPB, ProPublica",Big,Participant,,Broken Promises: Salmon Disappear From the Pacific Northwest,2022-05-24,"Investigation, Explainer, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Documentary, Open data, Crowdsourcing, Infographics, Video, Environment, Culture, Health","Drone, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Python",The U.S. guaranteed that the Pacific Northwest tribes would have access to salmon forever. But the fish are dying – blocked by dams; contaminated by dumping; threatened by climate change – and government policy is largely to blame. The series sheds light on the agencies and policies that are responsible and on a way of life that is ending.,"Presented with our findings about contaminated fish, Oregon Health Authority and Washington Department of Health toxicologists are meeting with officials about a possible advisory or river clean-up plan. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon called the work “[deeply troubling](https://www.propublica.org/article/toxic-salmon-columbia-river-basin-lawmaker-response)” and is exploring, with other lawmakers, new legislation or avenues for funding. One state legislator added that if lawmakers fail to take action, they could be held legally liable for treaty violations. 

After the first two installments in our series, a coalition of 60 nonprofit and tribal organizations across the Northwest cited our work in a letter to Congress calling for a major overhaul of salmon recovery efforts. The lead organization, the National Wildlife Federation, is currently negotiating with the Biden administration on major changes to Columbia River management, and called our reporting “a great service” to the public. 

The response also has been positive among Columbia River tribal members. Tribal leaders said they are grateful for the commitments from legislators and regulators and that they are seeing more momentum around toxics than they have seen in a decade.

Finally, a number of experts wrote to thank us. “I appreciate all the care you put into understanding the data,” wrote the head of the team at the University of Washington, whose data we used to analyze hatcheries; she reported that the article was being shared within government agencies. 

A senior advisor for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who is also a member of a Northwest tribe, said our coverage “was amazingly good. The writing was superb and outlined the history of the Basin in a blunt and sincerely honest manner. It is THE conversation lots of folks in the political realm have trouble with. … Your article should be read by anyone living and about to live in the PNW.”","For our first story, our goal was a comprehensive analysis of each publicly funded salmon and steelhead trout hatchery in the Pacific Northwest. But hatcheries don’t keep or analyze their data in consistent ways, making this analysis impossible. So data reporter Irena Hwang took an innovative approach based on a smaller number of fish, but more easily comparable across populations: data from PIT microchips, which are detected at dams the way automated toll readers work on the highway. We used Python and other open-source software, and consulted with data advisors to assess the validity of our findings using statistical techniques. 

To our knowledge, this was the first time such an analysis had been performed, and it cast a significant shadow on the multi-billion dollar government-funded system. We used a combination of Adobe Illustrator and hand-painted watercolors to visualize our analysis, and laid out the difficulties in “[How Not to Count Salmon](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-hatcheries-pnw-fish-data).”

For our other data-heavy story, we set out to determine the level of contamination in Columbia River salmon. We worked with toxicologists and a certified lab to test 50 fish, then consulted current and former EPA and state health agency scientists to calculate the estimated health risks for the estimated tribal diet. (Consumption estimates help states determine how much pollution companies can discharge, and have historically undercounted how much tribal members eat.)

The data revealed two chemicals – mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs – at high enough levels that health agencies would deem the fish unsafe when consumed at just over half the rate commonly reported by tribal members. The levels of PCBs in the salmon also pose cancer risks under the average tribal diet that are five times greater than what the EPA considers sufficiently protective of public health. Our raw data is available on ProPublica’s Data Store.","No journalistic outlet has examined the crisis of salmon in the Pacific Northwest as deeply from the perspective of Native American treaty rights. This series revealed how government decisions today have reaggravated harms Native people suffered centuries ago, with a sharp focus on the institutions and policies that still fail to protect the fish. 

Nearly 170 years ago, the U.S. government started signing treaties with indigenous tribes in the Pacific Northwest, some of whom were threatened with violence if they refused. Under those treaties, the U.S. amassed millions of acres of land for new settlers; tribes retained the rights to critical natural resources, including fresh water and salmon. Oregon Public Broadcasting and ProPublica teamed up for a [year-long](https://www.propublica.org/series/broken-promises) effort to show the many failures of the U.S. government to fulfill its salmon-related treaty obligations. 

The stories on hatcheries’ failings and toxicity in fish were major undertakings. (We spent roughly $17,000 to determine the level of contamination in Columbia River salmon, using a sample size larger than health officials had used in the past as a basis for health advisories.) But these data efforts were only part of the story. Throughout the series, we have elevated tribal voices about the devastating decline of salmon. Gaining their trust was hard: Historically, they told us, journalists have ignored and misrepresented them. We spent many months with tribal members, attending council meetings, introducing ourselves, answering questions about our goals. 

As readers absorb the non-data elements of the project – whether it is [the film](https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-people-a-native-fishing-familys-fight-to-preserve-a-way-of-life) and accompanying piece about Randy Settler’s [family history of heartbreak](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-fight-of-the-salmon-people), or Tony Shick’s column on the [racism embedded in government policy](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-racism-and-resilience-behind-todays-salmon-crisis) – it becomes possible to see the data findings in all their richness: not abstract numbers, but measurable harm that has been largely ignored until now.","This project resulted in what felt like two very different, but both important takeaways.

First, we found that if you encounter data gaps while trying to answer a reporting question, you can often find ways to work with communities to fill those data gaps. For example, one of the central unanswered questions confronting our reporting on pollution in this series was whether Columbia River salmon contain levels of contamination that could harm tribal health. Regulators responsible for tracking this information told us that there has been a dearth of monitoring – particularly as it comes to salmon. Not only did this reveal a data gap, but also an accountability point that we delved further into in our reporting. Our journalists then asked tribal communities for their help in collecting our own data on this question, and devised a methodology with the help of former and current regulators to conduct our own testing. The resulting data was the backbone of the story. As other reporters continue to be met with data gaps, we hope this project will push them to think through creative ways to work with communities and fill those gaps.

Second, we also encountered the dangers of too much data. After wading through thousands of pages of data about salmon production, we realized that when it came to assessing hatchery performance, less is more. Rather than getting lost in the weeds about every step of salmon hatcheries, like egg health or genetics, we decided to focus on a simpler quantity: the ratio of juvenile salmon leaving hatcheries to the number of adult salmon coming back. Best of all, the ratio could be directly compared to a benchmark established by the hydropower industry, allowing us to hold the industry accountable to their own metric.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-hatcheries-government-climate-change,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-us-broke-promise-to-protect-fish-for-tribes,https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-hatcheries-pnw-fish-data,https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-protection-dam-bonneville-power-administration,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-racism-and-resilience-behind-todays-salmon-crisis,https://www.propublica.org/article/salmon-people-a-native-fishing-familys-fight-to-preserve-a-way-of-life,https://www.propublica.org/article/the-fight-of-the-salmon-people,"Tony Schick, Irena Hwang, Maya Miller, Katie Campbell, Kristyna Wentz-Graff","Tony Schick is a reporter for Oregon Public Broadcasting, where he's covered the environment since 2013.

United States,"The Texas Tribune, ProPublica",Big,Participant,,Military Injustice,2022-08-09,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Women, Crime","Python, * Datawrapper","Our first-of-its-kind analysis revealed that Army soldiers accused of sexual assault are less than half as likely to be locked up ahead of trial than those accused of offenses like drug use and distribution, disobeying an officer or burglary. 

Annually, hundreds of soldiers face trial in military courts for offenses ranging from murder to failure to report for duty. The military justice system is largely separate from the civilian legal process and unknown to many Americans. Military commanders, who aren’t required to be trained lawyers, wield significant influence and can detain soldiers awaiting trial through a process called pretrial confinement.","After our story was published, Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes one of the nation’s largest Army posts, said the investigation into pretrial confinement was “eye-opening” and called for congressional hearings to examine the issue. Escobar, who is vice chair of the House Subcommittee on Military Personnel, said she plans to explore ways to ensure all cases across the military are held to the same standard. The Army also said its pretrial confinement rules are “currently under revision” in a statement to Military Times, which is partnering with ProPublica and The Texas Tribune to report on military justice. One former military lawyer who spoke with the news organizations told us our exploration of pretrial confinement hit on an important issue that had previously gone unexamined by the services. 

The investigation was republished in more than a dozen local and military publications across the state. The Gray TV network created an entire broadcast package based on our reporting as well.","The newsrooms obtained the Army’s Court-Martial Information System (ACMIS) through a Freedom of Information Request. The database took months to clean before it was ready for analysis. It was initially provided in 11 separate tables, but the Army redacted the soldiers’ Social Security numbers, which served as unique identifiers that would allow the newsrooms to properly account for soldiers who had multiple court cases. Data reporter Ren Larson built a strong working relationship with the clerk of the court, the database administrator and the public affairs officer, who agreed to generate and provide a list of identifiers for soldiers with names that appeared multiple times in the database. 

The database also contained offense codes, but those have changed over time, requiring Larson to spend months researching and updating the information with the military’s current charge identifications. For example, the military’s criminal laws used to group certain consensual and nonconsensual sexual acts under the same article when charging soldiers. We aligned these rape and sexual assault charges with the most recent edition of the manual and did not count charges related to consensual acts. 

Reporters relied on military law experts and individuals familiar with the way Army records are maintained to inform our analysis and review our findings. Experts provided guidance on the accuracy of data fields, informed our approach to standardize charges and helped to vet our findings.","After decades of resistance from military leaders and lawmakers, Congress reached a deal in December 2021 on a broad overhaul of the military justice system, stripping commanders of most of their authority to prosecute sexual assaults and several other types of criminal cases. 

While lawmakers celebrated the narrowly crafted reforms, reporters Vianna Davila, Lexi Churchill and Ren Larson methodically unraveled major gaps in the compromise legislation, highlighted commanders’ continued outsized influence over the military justice system, and brought transparency and accountability to a military justice system that largely operates out of the public eye. 

The newsrooms ran into significant obstacles and severe delays when trying to obtain Army records necessary to report on this system Unlike in the civilian system, the military requires people to submit a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain court records. These requests are often submitted to an Army office with a hefty, ongoing backlog. For example, it took nearly a year for the military to release basic court records for pretrial confinement cases. 

Reporters negotiated for up to a year for records. In some cases, they are still waiting for documents. In instances in which documents were eventually released, records were often incomplete. 

Davila, Churchill and Larson built relationships with attorneys and soldiers’ families to obtain additional documentation. With a combination of the Army database, documents from families and soldiers’ attorneys and records obtained through FOIA, reporters pieced together gripping narratives that exposed untackled flaws in the military justice system.","The military justice system has far-reaching implications for service members, their families and the communities where they live. It took decades of scandals and political uproar before Congress substantially addressed the epidemic of sexual assaults in the military. Surveys have found an increasing lack of trust in the military, and only a small percentage of Americans currently serve in the armed forces. All of these factors speak to the need for reporting like ours that pushes back against the system’s opaqueness and calls for continued scrutiny. 

Most journalists likely have little experience navigating entities like the Army and the Department of Defense. Our project provides a framework for how to deal with these agencies, reveals the existence of available courts martial data (which one military expert told us they had no idea was even accessible to the public) and, through the data methodology explainer written by data reporter Ren Larson, provides strategies for how to work with this data. Larson’s breakdown of pretrial confinement rates at Army posts across the country was a highly useful tool that other news organizations could use to localize their own stories about the issue. We also opened a door on a military justice topic – pretrial confinement – that has gotten almost no media attention.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/army-sexual-assault-alvarado-pretrial-confinement,https://www.propublica.org/article/pretrial-confinement-detention-rates-army-posts,https://www.propublica.org/article/military-army-alvarado-ochoa-pretrial-confinement,https://www.propublica.org/article/army-sexual-assault-pretrial-confinement-rates,https://www.propublica.org/article/congresswoman-calls-for-examination-of-military-pretrial-confinement,,,"Vianna Davila, Lexi Churchill, Ren Larson","Vianna Davila is a reporter with the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.

United States,"Grist, CoastAlaska, and Earthrise Media.",Small,Participant,,Road to Ruin,2022-03-28,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Open data, Satellite images, Environment","QGIS, Adobe Creative Suite, Python, Mapbox, HTML/CSS/JavaScript (including JuxtaposeJS)","“Road to Ruin” upends the expectations that federal laws such as the Roadless Rule, literally passed to protect our nation’s forests, are working. This nearly year-long investigation reveals a shell game in which Congress approves land transfers between the National Forest Service and private entities, in some cases trading tracts of old-growth forest for land that had already been clear-cut in order to buoy the region’s dying timber industry and degrade one of the world’s largest carbon sinks.","Road to Ruin was a truly collaborative project, published in partnership with Grist, CoastAlaska (a collection of public radio stations), and Earthrise Media. It was also later republished by the Anchorage Daily News and Alaska Public Media. The story attracted readers across the United States, from lawmakers in Washington, D.C., to communities in Alaska. It also won the 2022 Online News Association award for Feature, Small Newsroom.","Once Tongass land is transferred out of Forest Service jurisdiction through land swaps, the logging that follows theoretically occurs on private land, so much of the data we were interested in wasn’t FOIAable. Instead, we conducted most of our analysis from above. By overlaying land-transfer boundaries with the evolving boundaries of Roadless Rule protections — and a remote sensing dataset of forest loss from the past two decades — we were able to estimate the proportion of clear-cuts that occurred on transferred land. We also leveraged an Alaska state dataset of fish-bearing streams to understand in practice how federal versus private loggers behaved near these waterways. (Short answer: Private loggers are allowed to cut closer to water, and they do).

While Grist’s Clayton Aldern worked with Ed Boyda, managing partner at Earthrise Media, to translate these analyses into graphic assets, Grist Senior Editor Katherine Lanpher recruited journalists on the ground in southeast Alaska. Jacob Resneck, then-editor of the non-profit radio network CoastAlaska, began wading through state forestry reports and getting public officials (including Senator Lisa Murkowski) on the record. He also pulled in Eric Stone, news director for Ketchikan’s KRBD station, who was well positioned — geographically and editorially — to bring ground truth to our data reporting. Stone hopped on a ferry to Prince of Wales Island to talk to the people living in the path of the cuts.

By combining Stone’s reporting and photography with drone photography from a local pilot, Resneck’s public-records reporting, Boyda’s satellite analysis, and Grist’s editing, design, and visualization chops, our team was able to assemble a collaborative feature that pulled back the curtains on an otherwise innocuous policy mechanism with dire ramifications.","You could see the destruction from space. Ed Boyda, a managing partner at Earthrise Media, was scoping satellite images for another project when he saw the clearcuts of old growth trees in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest — huge ravaged holes in the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest.

He knew cuts that large had to be legal — how else would you get away with it? — but he couldn’t square it with protections like the Roadless Rule, which the Biden administration had recently reinstated. He also knew it was a story, so he turned to Grist. And a collaboration that stretched from Alaska to Norway, where Boyda is located, was born.

If you’re not familiar with the Tongass, imagine vast swathes of Sitka spruce, western hemlock, and red and yellow cedar, some towering as high as 200 feet. Two million people visit each year. The Tongass is also known as a vital source for sequestering carbon; it holds 44 percent of all the carbon stored in American forests. And because wildfire is rare in this part of the world, the Tongass isn’t just a carbon sink, it’s a steady one, vital to the fight against climate change.

Grist senior data reporter Clayton Aldern worked with Earthrise’s raw imagery and analysis, transforming them into charts, annotated maps, and scrollytelling graphics, Senior editor Katherine Lanpher recruited journalists on the ground in Alaska, netting public radio reporters Jacob Resneck and Eric Stone.

Resneck, the editor of CoastAlaska, a non-profit servicing public radio stations in Southeast Alaska, had logged nearly five years reporting there. He knew how to pester officials in Juneau, wade through state forestry data reports, and which Indigenous leaders would talk for the record. Stone, the news director for KRBD in Ketchikan, traveled to Prince of Wales Island and talked to the people affected most immediately by the cuts: the people who rely on Tongass to provide their food, such as deer and salmon. Destroy the forest, you destroy the habitat and the way residents in rural Alaska put food on the table.

The folks Stone talked to aren’t anti-logging; they just want responsible logging. As one told Stone, “You think about what a victory everybody was celebrating about the Roadless Rule coming back. But it really means nothing if there’s a back door.”

Exposing that “back door” took a village of nearly a dozen staffers from Grist, Boyda from Earthrise, and the journalists from CoastAlaska, to package a 4,000-word story with data analysis, maps, interactives, drone and still photography. It took, in other words, a true collaboration.","The Tongass story offers a tangible example of a data story hidden in plain sight. Were it not for a close look at pre-existing satellite imagery, we wouldn’t have ever seen the initial clear-cuts that ultimately formed the basis of the piece. Similarly, even with visual evidence of clear-cut logging in hand, establishing any flavor of causality required merging a series of spatiotemporal datasets describing land-transfer boundaries, conservation policies, and forest loss — and then analyzing the resulting data. Again, though, the datasets in question all stemmed from public sources. We think the piece functions as a reminder that evidence of policy loopholes doesn’t always require records requests and/or proprietary datasets.

We also believe the collaboration — between a national outlet, a radio coalition, a local outlet, a drone photographer, and a geospatial design firm — exemplifies the possibilities of bringing together diverse (and global) talents in journalism. No single party to the collaboration could have produced this investigation on its own.",English,https://grist.org/project/accountability/tongass-national-forest-roadless-rule-loophole/,,,,,,,"Jacob Resneck, Eric Stone, Edward Boyda, and Clayton Aldern","Jacob Resneck is the former regional news director at CoastAlaska based in Juneau, Alaska.

* Figma","Consumers across the US pledge the titles to their vehicles in order to obtain quick cash through title loans. Many end up trapped in debt, and if they default they can lose their car.

The industry has thrived in Georgia, home to the nation’s largest title lender, TitleMax. A loophole in state law exempts the industry from usury laws and oversight that other lenders operate under.

Our investigation — based on an analysis of storefront locations and vehicle lien records, among others — offered for the first time a window into the scale of the industry, and the impact on their customers.","The reporting was republished across Georgia, in the state’s largest newspaper The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, as well as by public broadcaster Georgia Public Radio. 

The [opening story](https://www.propublica.org/article/title-lenders-trap-georgia-residents-in-debt) was read on Apple News and ProPublica’s website by a typically sized audience, compared to similar investigations. The follow-up service journalism piece, “[How Title Lending Works,” had a much wider reach. It was read by about three times as many people as the main story. ](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-title-loans-work)

Within days of publication, seven legislators reached out to Margaret Coker asking for more information about the issue. Members of the Georgia Black Legislative Caucus from the state House of Representatives told Coker they would seek to introduce reform legislation during the 2023 legislative session, as did Sen. Chuck Hufstetler, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.","Our biggest challenge in this project was the lack of readily available data, since title lenders in Georgia are very loosely regulated. As a result, our project ended up combining a variety of different data sources using manual and programmatic techniques.

We compiled a list of title lenders in Georgia using information from Google Maps and corporate websites. This involved a combination of manual searches as well as using the Google Maps API and using Python to scrape company websites. We also called hundreds of stores to verify that locations were in business and offered title pawns, coordinating our findings within the reporting team using Google Sheets.

Using Python, we joined our list of title lenders with census data to analyze the geographic distribution of title lenders. We found that title lenders were disproportionately located in ZIP codes with lower incomes and higher proportions of people of color. We visualized these disparities using Datawrapper.

In addition, we filed a public records request with the Georgia Department of Revenue for all vehicle title liens issued since July 2019. Using Google Sheets and a BigQuery database, we then cross-referenced the lienholders in that data with our list of title lenders to identify and analyze the liens associated with title pawns.","From a data perspective, title lending in Georgia is a black box, even to policymakers. Title lenders are not licensed by the state, and, as a result, simply compiling a list of title lenders in Georgia was a significant undertaking.

We found one list compiled by an advocacy group. However, it was outdated and was missing some stores and included others that did not actually offer title pawns.

As we produced our own list, we had to be conscious of keeping our definitions and data consistent. For example, title lenders in Georgia operate under pawnshop statutes, but there are many pawnshops that don’t offer title pawns — we identified and excluded those, typically by calling and confirming that they didn’t offer such products. We wanted the product of this hard work to be available to Georgians - we put the full list of store locations on ProPublica’s Data Store.

When it came to getting information on actual title pawn transactions, we had to get creative. Title lenders don’t report any data on their business volume to the state, so we needed another data source. We discovered that there was one record that made its way up to the state level when a title pawn was issued — the lien on the vehicle title, which gives the lender the right to repossess the car if the money is not paid back.

Every lien is ultimately registered with the state’s Department of Revenue. However, as far as we knew, nobody else had used title lien data in order to size up the title-lending industry, so we were in uncharted territory.

It was challenging just to find out whether the department had the lien data in a format we could use. Acquiring and analyzing the data ultimately took months, including multiple public records requests with a total cost of more than $1,400. We also had repeated phone calls and email exchanges with the department’s IT team to ensure that we received the appropriate data and were interpreting it correctly.","Just because data isn’t readily available on a topic, don’t be immediately discouraged. There may be a potential database you can create yourself — such as our compiled list of title lenders. Or there could be an alternative data source that doesn’t track the exact thing you’re looking for, but still allows you to reach meaningful conclusions — such as how we used vehicle liens as a proxy for counting title pawns. The process may be more tedious than finding the perfect dataset, but the product can be just as valuable or even more so, since it shines a light on what isn’t being tracked.

In addition, it’s important to remember that the data aspect of a story doesn’t exist in a vacuum, but works in tandem with other avenues of reporting. When we hit a wall on how to get numbers on the volume of title pawns statewide, we learned about the lien filing process from a source who had worked within the title-lending industry, which led us to a new data source that ultimately allowed us to evaluate the scale of the industry.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/title-lenders-trap-georgia-residents-in-debt,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-title-loans-work,https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/georgia-title-lenders,,,,,"Margaret Coker, Joel Jacobs, Mollie Simon, Anna Donlan","Margaret Coker is the co-founder and editor-in-chief of The Current.

- ""Google Maps"" was used during field visits to the farms to find the Latitude and Longitude of the sites where the samples of crops were collected.
- Map developer was used to measure the boarder distance between Syria and Lebanon (north frontier) this was important because the most suspected site for smuggled pesticides was located on the northern boarders.","It was a hard mission to collect samples from different farms in the governorates and to find the farms that have the crops included in the data analysis. No public data is available about the agricultural lands in Lebanon, so it was very difficult to find the sites in a way that helps to collect the samples needed.
While working on the investigation, Lebanon suffered a fuel crisis, so moving from one governorate to another was a very difficult task.

This project was one of the more heavily data-driven stories the team has done. We got to experiment a lot more (especially for chart designs) using different types of charts, maps, writing good and clear annotations. This would be helpful for future data-driven analysis and upcoming elections stories.","""Due to the relatively quick turnaround rate of this project given the nature of the topic, we used simple tools like datawrapper and svg for most of the charts. For the map scrolly, we had a template that we used for [another project](https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/10/malaysia-ge2022-government/index.html) we did prior to the Malaysia elections, so we repurposed that component and updated the data.

For the scrolly, we chose maps because it provides spatial context and would allow readers to visualise the areas which were won by each party. The bar graph at the top of the map was also added to provided more context. Each square represents one parliamentary seat, and is colored according to the winning party for that seat. Maps alone can be quite tricky because a large area doesn't necessarily mean more seats in Parliament. For example, Sabah and Sarawak combined are larger than Peninsular Malaysia in area but have less seats in parliament. So the bar graph helps to add more context.""","The hardest part of the project was ensuring that we were carefully wording what our data was repesenting. Age was one of the factors that contributed to the divided polls in Malaysia's latest election. While we had data broken down by age for each constituency, this data was based on all registered voters. In Malaysia, everyone who is eligible to vote will be considered part of the electoral roll under the automatic voter registration system. But in reality, not all registered voters actually turned up to vote. We did not have data for the turnout rate, as this would usually be only made available a couple of months later, and they are not usually available to the public. Hence, when doing our analysis, we had to make it clear in our charts and text that our analysis was based on registered voters' profiles at the constituency level. We also spoke to several analysts to ensure that we were accurately presenting our findings.","I think journalists can learn that even though we might not have the ideal dataset (in this case, the voter profiles of those who turned up to vote) we would have wanted, it does not mean that our dataset would be entirely useless. We were still able to get meaningful insights, trends and indications with the registered profiles dataset.

We also started this project wanting to focus on age alone, but then down the road we realised that the dividing factors weren't clear cut and that there were several reasons, beyond age, as to why voters chose to vote for Perikatan Nasional (PN). Another factor was race, which is more contentious but important, and would not have been entirely balanced to leave it out in our story. It was helpful to speak to experts on the matter.

We discovered the extent of the Sahara Desert’s encroachment by visiting communities swallowed by the shifting sand dunes and speaking to locals about how this has affected their livelihoods. We also established patterns in herders’ migration that lead to a struggle for resources and exacerbated armed violence in the communities they move to as a result of harsh environmental conditions. The report also exposed systemic governmental failures.","The report was republished by many platforms, including ZAM Magazine, The AfricaBrief, MNN Centre for Investigative Journalism, TheCable, and Circle of Blue. It has been referenced by other media groups as well, including the Global Investigative Journalism Network (GIJN), the Reuters Institute, Earth Today, The Daily Climate, and Climate Change Resources. 

The project received one of the inaugural Visual Journalism Awards from the Institute for Nonprofit News and was selected to be presented at the continent-wide African Investigative Journalism Conference in Johannesburg, South Africa. We also received and accepted an invitation to give a virtual masterclass by the JamLab in South Africa.","The softwares we used include: Arcgis 2.7 professional (licensed) for AI and ML land cover satellite analysis; Quantum GIS or QGIS 3.14 (Pie version) to organise data for GIS visualizations; Google Earth Pro to identify and visualise the disappearing communities; Microsoft Excel (Office 2019); Google Sheets; Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis. Antv G6 Geo visualisation tool (https://g6.antv.antgroup.com/); Visual Studio Code; Adobe Illustrator for data visualization.

Metaverse tools: A virtual space was designed and built on the Web3 voxels platform Voxels.com. The venue consists of multiple rooms with different functions: immersion in a reconstructed environment from the reportage, exploration of the Data and focus on the pictures and videos. Voxels models and architectural environments were created to fit the virtual storytelling. Software used: Magicavoxel, Adobe Photoshop, Voxels.com building engine. 

We used the following websites to source data: United State Geological Survey Agency - NASA Landsat Project (https://www.Earthexplorer.usgs.gov), the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (https://acleddata.com), Office of the Surveyor-General Of The Federation OSGOF - Administrative district location shapefile data (https://osgof.gov.ng), and OpenStreetMap Project (https://www.openstreetmap.org/).","The reporting environment was harsh for several reasons. The reporters had to travel to Nigeria’s northern states of Yobe and Adamawa. There was still the presence of Boko Haram terrorists in parts of the region. Geidam and Yunusari, which were critical to the report, could not be visited, for example, because of the activities of insurgents. The environmental conditions were harsh, especially the desert area that needed a special vehicle to penetrate. Another challenge encountered was hostility from Fulani pastoralists, who were not as accessible as the farming communities. This made it difficult to balance the sides to the report about clashes between the parties. Additionally, accessing some of the data about migratory patterns of herders and government budgetary approvals and expenses was difficult.

The reporters had to build their capacity for photography and videography before traveling because it would be unwise to move with an additional person as well as heavy equipment. They worked with a fixer who spoke multiple languages and understood the environment. We timed the trip to a period that was relatively safer and were deliberate about the mode of transportation. Precautionary measures were also taken in the event that the field reporting did not go smoothly. These included documenting emergency contacts, agreeing on a regular progress reporting arrangement, and constant sharing of GPS coordinates.

On the data side, we encountered a few difficulties, starting with the satellite assessments. Satellite data are not absolute and may be affected by cloud and other interferences especially without a corroborated field measurement but these satellites and methods were designed to give the researcher the essential big picture of environmental issues including obvious large scale changes to land surfaces. However, we sifted through numerous satellite images until we found the ones appropriate to run the analysis. This process took almost as long as the analysis itself. 

Another challenge is regarding the use of ACLED data. When we were trying to approach the logic to which we would summarize pastorialist attacks from the data. We needed to decide whether we looked for the attacks specific to “Fulani” pastoralist or those carried out by all pastorialists. The ACLED database also doesn’t code farmers, only pastoralists so we couldn’t get the exact numbers of farmer-herder conflicts. We emailed Leif Brottem, an expert in the area who had also used the same data source to analyse farmer-herder conflicts. He confirmed that when the data were coded as involving ""militias"", they usually consisted of an inter-communal farmer-herder conflict. In the end, we following Leif’s practice in his report and used the title of “Conflicts involving pastoralists as perpetrators and victims in Nigeria from Feb. 2019 to Feb. 2022” in order for the graph to be accurate.","The best works of journalism are often products of collaborations between people with diverse skill sets or different newsrooms. They also take time and need heavy investments in research. The success of the reporting was determined by contributions from many people from the reporters to the researchers, data scientists, open source intelligence experts, visual editors, copeditors, fact-checkers, and so on.

On CCIJ’s side, this work came from an internal pitching process in which our data fellow from China wrote the strongest pitch and brokered the initial connection with HumAngle after exploring their work. In addition to working on the data analysis and visualization elements, she then helped present the work to a continent-wide audience at the African Investigative Journalism Conference. We’re proud of her role in the project and would suggest that other news organizations consider providing similar opportunities for their fellows, interns, and other non-staff members.

India,shijith.com (personal blog),Small,Participant,,What's the best streaming service in India for western music?,2022-09-09,"Investigation, Long-form, Arts, Culture","Scraping, Python","This is an analysis of how well streaming services in India cover western music.

To do this, I compiled lists of albums across several genres (Pop, Rock etc.) and found how many albums from these lists are on each service in India.

The lists cover albums considered the best of all time in a genre, and also acclaimed albums from the past 10 years. Based on how many albums were available, each service was rated out of 10.

Global services — Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music and Amazon Music — took the top spots. Of the Indian services, only JioSaavn performed decently.","Not much to be honest. So this was a piece that combined consumer journalism with data journalism, and was first published on my personal blog, so it didn't get much attention. 

A modified version of the blog post was [later published](https://www.livemint.com/technology/tech-news/for-western-music-lovers-india-s-homegrown-apps-are-a-let-down-here-s-why-11665156172157.html) (paywall) in the Indian business newspaper _Mint_, but that didn't get much attention either. Of the eight companies whose music streaming services I covered in the blog post, only one actually engaged with me and participated in the newspaper article.

The thing is there is a strong tradition of accountability journalism in India when it comes to elected officials and government decisions, but not when it comes to companies offering goods/services to consumers. So companies aren't really that responsive to pieces of this nature, and mostly just ignore them.

What I'm trying to say is that it's tough for such work to make an impact and encourage music streaming services to improve their coverage. 

The fact is most companies operate in a pressure-free environment. They don't really have that institutional drive to want to improve themselves by engaging with public criticism. It's safer for them to let stories die away by not reacting and drawing attention to them. That's pretty much what happens most of the time now.","I wrote in python for the project, the code is available at this [github repo]((https://github.com/shijithpk/music-streaming-india)). I've tried to make the results as reproducible as possible, but because of the number of manual interventions I had to make, running the code may not deliver the results in my blog post, but should give something close to them.

So there were eight music streaming services being compared, including Spotify and Apple Music. 

I first compiled lists of albums for each genre (Pop, Rock etc.) The lists cover albums considered the best of all time in a genre, and also acclaimed albums from the past 10 years. I perused various music guides and publications to come up with the lists. For example, for heavy metal, I used publications like _Metal Hammer_ and _Rolling Stone_. 

These albums were then searched for, programatically and manually, on each service. Some services like Spotify make it easy for developers to interact with it by offering an external API you can sign up for and query for free. 

For other services like Apple and Amazon, however, I had to mimic cURL requests to their internal APIs and scrape data from the json responses. This meant that for a cumulative list of over 3,000 albums, the code would have to run 2-3 days to scrape all the data in a way that's considerate to their servers.

Having to programatically extract data from 8 different services with their varying APIs, request tolerances etc. was technically complex and gruelling, felt happy once I got it all figured out. 

The code was run multiple times and parameters tweaked in different ways to make sure I found as many albums as possible.

Once the data's scraped, it's just a matter of running various calculations and computing the overall and genre-wise ratings.","I'd mentioned this in my previous response, but I'll get into it more here, the biggest problem I faced was access to data. The project was made needlessly more complex because the various music services didn't offer APIs I could programatically query for free.

Spotify was the only music service that was developer friendly in that respect, with an easy sign-up and a very simple API. 

Apple Music has an API, but you can only access it after enrolling in their developer program for $99 a year, which would've been prohibitively expensive for me. Other services don't even bother to offer external-facing APIs.

I guess by mimicking browser requests to the internal API of a service and scraping data that way, my work might be in a legally gray area. But since I was scraping data in the consumer interest, I feel it is morally justifiable and have no issues defending it.","I guess if there's anything I'd want consumer journalists to learn from this project, it is to go beyond the surface details and dig deeper. 

This isn't the first comparison of music services in India. There have been others, but they have been restricted to comparing external specs like stream quality (eg. lossless or not), subscription costs (student discounts available?) and mobile app features.

This might be the first such work that programatically looks at the _content_ offered by these services and comparing them on that basis. 

Such work could've been done earlier, but publications/websites in India don't give people the time to code all this up. All the python code I've written is in the [public domain](https://github.com/shijithpk/music-streaming-india), so hopefully that makes it easier for others to do their own content comparisons. 

For example, I've just focused on _western_ music here, but someone can easily use my code to compare music streaming services based on how well they cover music in different _Indian languages_ and make the work more India-relevant.

So in terms of learnings, hope consumer journalists get motivated by this work to take the time and compare products properly, and not just cobble something together based on external specs for a quick turnaround. 

And I also hope they get inspired to use more code in their work. Manually searching on each service for over 3,000 different albums would've been a pain. Doing this with code is hard too, not going to deny that. But it makes the whole task a lot easier to replicate the next time I or someone else wants to attempt such a comparison.",English,https://shijith.com/blog/music-streaming-india/,https://github.com/shijithpk/music-streaming-india,https://twitter.com/shijith/status/1569227541189390336,,,,,Shijith Kunhitty,"Shijith Kunhitty is an independent data journalist based in Kerala, India.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Sounds of the stadium: The anatomy of a World Cup chant,2022-12-01,"Explainer, Audio, Sports","AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Json, CSV, Python","Sounds of the stadium: Anatomy of a World Cup chant combined data visualisation and analysis with audio to look at the linguistic and musical traits of spectator chants from countries in the World Cup. The interactive provided the means to explore individual chants, and compare one country’s chant to another.","The project allowed our team to combine data visualisations and audio for the first time, while experimenting with text analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning to reveal insights into the linguistic and musical relationships between spectator chants. It formed part of a package of World Cup interactives that were focused on encouraging adaquate engagement and exploration opportunities to get readers to return multiple times. 

The interactive took a simple question, """"What makes a good fan chant?"""" and used the features of each chant to explore this topic in an engaging and visual way.","The project can be thought of in terms of two processes: data analysis and data visualisation.

1. Data processing and analysis: Most of the heavy lifting occurred in the data analysis stage of the project. The music for each chant was transcribed manually, while the text for the lyrics was already available. When processing text, several natural language processing tools were used, all of which were implemented in Python. These included text cleaning, a process for which we used Python's Natural Language Toolkit and regex to remove punctuation, unicode characters, and stopwords—words that occur at high frequencies and don't contribute to the overall meaning, and to reduce words to their base forms. The cleaned text was then transformed into vectors using word embeddings, in this case TF-IDF. The dimensionality of these vectors was reduced using UMAP and the results were passed to a clustering algorithm (HDBSCAN) to find chants that could be grouped together. Several metrics, including Hapax scores—a measure how unique the language in a chant is—as well as parts of speech density were used to get a general sense of complexity. When processing the musical data, after the chants were transcribed and converted to MIDI, pitch and rhythmic data was extracted in Python. Lyrics were then associated with each note, and the rhythm was normalised by the longest note duration for each chant.

2. Data visualisation: The interactive was built using our in-house Vue.js template, along with D3. With regards to the data visualisation, we wanted to encode music in a way that didn't require readers to know how to read musical notation. These visualisations are less accurate than traditional notation, but are designed to provide a view of the essence of each chant.","The project required a substantial amount of data processing, which took up the majority of the production time. To create a large enough corpus of text for the clustering algorithm to be effective we collected, cleaned, and analysed many more chants than were included in the story. This gave the algorithm more training data on which to generate clusters. Also, the algorithm doesn't provide the reason why chants were grouped together, so we had to go through each chant, and map the word embeddings to important words in each cluster to identify the reasons chants were grouped into different clusters. These were then used to explain the similarities between chants in the story.

In addition, we experimented with various complexity metrics for each of the chants, calculating the hapax legomenon and parts of speech density, among others. Eventually, we went with a complexity metric that combined the length of a chant with the number of unique words, which we thought would result in an index that would be easier for readers to understand.

In addition to processing the linguistic features, the audio data also needed to be processed. Each chant has its associated audio, and the music from the audio was manually transcribed, converted to MIDI, and then numerical data was extracted from MIDI so we could create a visual representation of the chant. The transcription process was one of the most time consuming parts of the development of this piece. We did try to automate the process using deep learning to convert audio directly to MIDI, but this process failed due to low fidelity and background noise in the audio files, even after the recording had the majority of the noise removed.","We tried to approach this project from a point of view of using fun animations and anecdotes in order to draw readers into more serious data visualisations. We took the story of the famous ""Ole ole ole"" chant and animated it to pique interest, only then going on to looking at the data. Before finalising this way of tackling the story we had experimented with data-first approaches to the introduction of the piece, none of which really worked. Given the non-serious nature of the piece, leading into the data story seemed to work.

Additionally, there is a lot of data that can be extracted from audio if you know how to process it. One valuable lesson we learnt from the process of developing this interactive is that experimentation is key, and with a little effort, the processes that occur when implementing things like machine learning can be understood and verified. Even if the results of your initial experiments aren't accurate, they provide a base from which to think about similar problems in future.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/11/fifa-world-cup-football-chants/index.html,,,,,,,"Bhavya Rawat - Data Journalism intern

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Living inside with Dementia,2022-09-21,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Documentary, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Health","3D modeling, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite","This project follows a loving son who built a dementia-friendly home for his father, and investigates the real-life experiences of people with dementia and any shortcomings of government-coordinated initiatives like carer support groups. 

It is one part of two interactive projects which aims to change narratives about dementia, highlight the positive and negative sides of the illness and was published on World Alzheimer's Day in 2022.","Although the main goal of this project was to change narratives about dementia, these two projects also set a benchmark for how to tell impactful stories about key issues in our communities.

The project was well-viewed and was among our top 8 most viewed interactives for the year. It was well-shared among the dementia-friendly community. It has also helped further the dialogue about how dementia is not all doom and gloom but can also be filled with positive experiences if communities are set up to help people understand about the illness. LinkedIn also picked it as one of the top stories on 27 Sept, the week it was published.

As a result of the dementia package, the contributions of the two dementia advocates we interviewed for the project - Ms Alison Lim and Mr Anjang Rosli - were made known to the public, and they were nominated for the ST Singaporean of the Year 2022 Award.

The stories were also widely shared on social media, including the Asian Development Bank's Social Development Thematic Group, who does a lot of research into and provides financial support for ageing and age-related policies in Asia.","We explored the use of photogrammetry to explore inside the home, and how its setup can help a person with dementia live longer with the illness. Our team has been experimenting with 3D storytelling techniques like photgrammetry for a while now, but it has never been done on a large scale and on a physical space. As we had quite a long timeframe for this project, and the subject matter was a fit for photogrammetry, we decided to experiment with the technique.

We also used a tilegram visualisation of Singapore to effectively communicate age data nuances across different neighbourhoods. Through the tilegrams, readers can identify which neighbourhoods have a higher percentage of elderly citizens than average. This was also the first time the team has used this type of visualisation. As it was a visualisation our readers may not be familiar with, we decided to introduce a map of Singapore first to set the context before transitioning into the tilegrams.","The entire duration of the project took about 9 months. We started ideating in January and the project was only published in Sept on World Alzheimer's Day. Due to the changing nature of the disease, we had to remain flexible with our plans, especially for our profiles. We initially had another profile in mind but his condition deteriorated over the months and he was not in the right condition for filming. The photogrammetry also required at least 2 hours for us to take the photos from multiple angles, and we needed an empty space for the shoot, meaning we couldn't have Daniel and his father in the living room. This had to be carefully planned out because we needed to make sure that we were not disrupting them and their routines as routines are incredibly important for persons with dementia.","I think the biggest takeaway would be that it is possible to change narratives about key issues in our communities.

It is one part of two interactive projects which aims to change narratives about dementia, highlight the positive and negative sides of the illness and was published on World Alzheimer's Day in 2022.","Although the main goal of this project was to change narratives about dementia, these two projects also set a benchmark for how to tell impactful stories about key issues in our communities.

The project was well-viewed and was among our top 8 most viewed interactives for the year. It was well-shared among the dementia-friendly community. It has also helped further the dialogue about how dementia is not all doom and gloom but can also be filled with positive experiences if communities are set up to help people understand about the illness. LinkedIn also picked it as one of the top stories on 27 Sept, the week it was published.

As a result of the dementia package, the contributions of the two dementia advocates we interviewed for the project - Ms Alison Lim and Mr Anjang Rosli - were made known to the public, and they were nominated for the ST Singaporean of the Year 2022 Award.

The stories were also widely shared on social media, including the Asian Development Bank's Social Development Thematic Group, who does a lot of research into and provides financial support for ageing and age-related policies in Asia.","We created a seamless real-life to 3D transition for exploring Singapore’s first dementia-friendly neighbourhood. This particular alley in Yishun was interesting for us to reconstruct in 3D because it's where many of the demenita friendly facilities are featured - the barricades, the large block signages, the different color coded buildings and icons. It is also not on Google Earth, so we were creating something from scratch which readers could not find online.

We also used a tilegram visualisation of Singapore to effectively communicate age data nuances across different neighbourhoods. Through the tilegrams, readers can identify which neighbourhoods have a higher percentage of elderly citizens than average. This was also the first time the team has used this type of visualisation. As it was a visualisation our readers may not be familiar with, we decided to introduce a map of Singapore first to set the context before transitioning into the tilegrams.","The entire duration of the project took about 9 months.

For the walk in to 3D shot, we initially had another profile in mind but his condition deteriorated over the months and he was not in the right condition for filming. We also had to be sensitive when filming as they might not be comfortable with cameras following them. So our filming schedules had to be carefully planned out because we needed to make sure that we were not disrupting them and their routines as routines are incredibly important for persons with dementia. Moreover, we were not only filming for our interactive. As this was a cross-media project, the video teams were also doing two documentaries, and we had to make sure that our filming schedule allowed time for that.","I think the biggest takeaway would be that it is possible to change narratives about key issues in our communities.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Earth Overshoot Day: We're living like we have 1.75 Earths,2022-07-28,"Explainer, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Environment, Economy","Animation, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","July 28, 2022 was the day when humanity has used up its allowance of natural resources such as water, soil and clean air for all of 2022, also known as Earth Overshoot Day.
Every year, Earth Overshoot Day has been coming sooner and sooner. It has moved up more than four months in the past 51 years. And if we don't curb emissions, the earth will go further into ecological deficit, and ecosystems will degrade and possibly collapse. This story provides a visual explainer of what this means and dives into the data behind it.","Earth Overshoot day can be a complicated concept to understand. Terms such as biological capacity and ecological deficit is often thrown around but the average reader may not understand what that means. Through simple visuals in a scrollytelling format, we break down what biological capacity means in the simplest way possible - land needed to support humanity's needs such as to consume food, drive cars and build buildings. This productive land is, however, limited and we keep on consuming more than what we can replenish, due to high carbon emissions. Using simple graphics and explaining jargons in simple terms, readers are able to relate more to what ecological deficit means and the urgency of climate action. This story was one of our top viewed graphics in 2022, receiving over 76,000 views despite being behind the paywall.","We obtained the data for this piece from the Global Footprint Network (footprintnetwork.org). After downloading the data for the countries we want to look into, we used Google sheets to perform basic transformations and analysis of the data. Graphics were created using illustrator and exported to SVG files. For the scrollytelling portion, we used our team's scrolly template. The animations were added in CSS. Some of the charts graphics were also created using datawrapper.","Many visualisations have been done to visualize how we are living like we have 1.7 earths. But some of these charts aren't so intuitive for the reader to understand. So instead of following the charts that's already been done, we wanted to go a different way and break it down first into the simplest way possible. It was a challenge to think of how to make the data relatable to the reader, instead of jumping directly to the more complex charts. After lots of sketching and mockups, we came up with the version that is published now.","Just because a concept is so familiar to us, who deal with a particular topic every day, doesn't mean the reader sees it the same way. In order to make data relatable to readers, we need to think about how to present it to someone who is not so familiar with the topic. But we also need to be careful to balance simplifying things and still explaining it accurately.

This data combined with a gamified goal (cut 75 % out of average Finn's climate emissions) provides the readers with new point of view to a much discussed topic.",The interactive part was created using Vanilla JS.,"This story was published when IPCC's international climate report came out. The report once again put pressure on politicians to act: reduce humanity's climate emissions and thus curb the increase in the average global temperature to 1.5 degrees.

If the same goal is shared with the people of the earth, our own lives should produce emissions 2.5 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

For Finns, this is a tough goal, because the average Finn now causes climate emissions of around 10 tons per year.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Are you living in a dengue cluster?,2022-07-11,"Explainer, Infographics, Map, Health","Json, Google Sheets, Node.js","Dengue is a big problem in Singapore around the summer months. This project used public data to track the spread of Dengue around the city, and show where the Dengue clusters were located. The piece combined aspects of a tracker and an explainer to clarify how and why the virus was spreading.","The piece provides information that allows the public to make better informed decisions, and, in doing so, keep themselves safe. It is an example of public service journalism in the way that it provides pertinent information to Straits Time's general readership. The data is presented in an accessible way and the premise of the piece is simple: Are you living in a dengue cluster and what can you do to protect yourself from the disease?

The article amassed a significant amount of readers, with a good portion of them coming back to check for updates.","Given that there is a tracker component to this interactive, we decided it would be best to automated the data collection. We wrote scripts in Node.js to scrape the National Environment Agency's website to get weekly infection counts. We also automated the collection of spatial data that showed the locations of clusters, the severity of infection in that cluster, and the number of people infected by making API calls. These scripts run on a weekly basis to automatically collect new data once it is published by official sources.

Once scraped, data is pushed to a Google Sheet to store the figures. This data is linked to a Datawrapper chart and incorporated into the project itself. The page is built in Vue.js and all figures on the page are dynamic, updating whenever the new data comes in. This allows us to quickly add new data to the page whenever it comes out.

The map showing clusters on the page was built using Vue.js and Mapbox. It uses geocoding to convert a reader's address into a location to show them how close they are to a Dengue cluster. The data from this comes from OneMap, whose API we called whenever we updated the graphic.

Other graphics on the page are created in Datawrapper using the data we scraped.","The biggest challenge in this project came in the data acquisition stage. The scraping process was more challenging than usual as the data was embedded in the page as Javascript code. As a result, we need to find a way to not only target the data, but extract it from the page. This required using a substantial amount of regex to get the figures out of the code, and multiple custom functions to then convert data is the form of a string into something that could be executed in the script.

Additionally, some of the pre-existing Vue components for Mapbox were broken when we incorporated them into our Vue template, so they needed some re-engineering.","Our objective was to marry the idea of an explainer and a tracker so we didn't only provide information on how dengue was spreading th Singapore, but also how people could protect themselves. A lot of trackers we've seen over the past few years only present the situation, rather than providing an educational tool that allows people to make better informed decisions about how they protect themselves.

With the aim of making this an explainer/tracker, we also only made the top part of the page dynamic so updates would be quick. This meant that the explainer section, which required very few changes over time, largely stayed the same, while the tracker was updated on a weekly basis. This approach made the project manageable and maintainable over time, requiring only a few minutes to check the updates every week before redeploying the interactive.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/06/singapore-dengue-cases/index.html,,,,,,,"Anton Dzeviatau - Data Visualisaton Developer

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Changes to P1 registration: Are you likely to face balloting at the school of your choice?,2022-06-29,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart","AI/Machine learning, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV","In Singapore, the application for a spot in your preferred primary school is a competitve one. It depends on how popular your selected school is and how many spots there are available in that year. This process is refered to as the p1 registration system. 

This project is a visual explainer of the recent changes to the p1 registration system. It aims to help readers understand how that might affect their chances of ballotting, and to simulate what are the chances of the selected primary school going to a ballot in that year.","The P1 registration system is not only competitve, but it is also complex. With the new changes to the system, another layer of complexity is added. Using a scrollytelling format, we break down the process step-by-step, to help readers understand how the changes affect their chances of ballotting. This information would be useful for parents to decide which school to pick for their child.","We used a scrolly format as it was suitable to explain the changes in the p1 registration system in a progressive, step by step, manner. To highlight certain points, we added simple transitions such as highlights and animations to make it more dynamic. We also inserted mini bar charts to show the number of applicants versus number of vacancies in the scrolly cards, to aid our visual explanation of how the system works.","The hardest part was structuring the scrolly, to explain how a particular school would have been oversubscribed in the old system versus the new system. We also needed to find a way to condense the infomation as much as possible in order not to make the scrolly too long. 

Another part we had to look into was making sure the simulation segment was up to date with the new rules to the system. For the simulation, we repurposed the code from a similar project we did the previous year, where we built a machine learning model that predicts the number of applicants by school and by phase, given the number of vacancies in that phase. 

However, this model was based off data from 16 years of P1 registration exercises in the past, which were all using rules of the old system. We had a discussion amongst ourselves on whether to keep the segment, and decided that it still provides value to the readers, and having the historical numbers were also helpful. Hence, instead of giving precise numbers like """"There is a 68% chance it will go into balloting."""", we re-worded it to something more generic like """"There is slight/high chance it will go into balloting.","The P1 registration exercise is usually covered quite a bit in a typical text/print story, but I think we really added value for readers with our interactive. With our scrolly explainer and simulation model, we were able to go beyond what could be told, shown, and experienced with just a text story. I think we should continue exploring more ways of storytelling especially for topics like these.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/06/primary-1-registration-school-ballot/index.html,,,,,,,"Charlene Chua (Digital graphics journalist)

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,How Lion City Sailors are outspending other Singapore Premier League clubs,2022-06-26,"Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Sports","D3.js, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, Node.js","A data-driven profile of Singapore's first private football club, the Lion City Sailors. In the interactive, we look at what makes the team different, how they hope to reach the top of the league, and how much the players on the team are worth.","The interactive was well-received by local supporters and clubs alike. In addition, the article was a finalist for the """"Story of the year"""" award by the Football Association of Singapore.

The project was also one of the first times Singapore's Premier League was being looked at in a data-driven way, providing insights into how some of the teams are structured and the ratio between local and foreign players.","For the introductory scrolly, we sourced photos of all players' faces and processed the images. These were then incorporated into the beeswarm chart, which was built using D3 and our in-house Vue.js template, like all the other graphics in the page.

The data for the project was sourced by scraping information for teams from Singapore, Asia, and the rest of the world.

For the last illustrated section, we created the images in SVG and used Javascript to handle the animations.","One of the major challenges when finalising this piece had to do with the final illustrated section. We had issues with some of the SVGs and animations crashing the page. We eventually had to take layers out of each of the illustrations one by one to find the problem and sort it out. The process was time consuming but gave some insights into making sure the SVGs we use are structured well when they are created.

Another challenge came in the form of availability of data, and the nature of football in Singapore. We set out to base the project on the transfer fees of players in Singapore, only to realise that this metric did not relate to the majority of players in the league. We eventually had to decide on a proxy: the value of the player at that particular time, which meant we had to rethink some of the visual elements on the page.","Sports provide wonderful opportunities for data and graphics stories, sometimes in ways that are not initially very obvious. The idea from the story came from a question one of our team at the Straits Times had—what makes the Lion City Sailors different and just how much is the team worth? If you are thinking about a question, it's likely that other people are too, and a story built on that enquiry is likely to resonate with readers.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/06/singapore-premier-league-lion-city-sailors/index.html,,,,,,,"Alyssa Karla Mariano Mungcal - UI/UX Designer

Philippines,Rappler,Small,Participant,,From fringe to mainstream: Tracing the myth of the Marcos gold online,2022-04-09,"Investigation, Fact-checking, Elections, Politics, Terrorism","Scraping, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","A data-driven investigation on how the myth of the “Marcos gold” proliferated on social media over the years, how it influenced Filipino voters before the 2022 Philippine elections, and how propaganda networks that amplified the lies dwarfed the reach of legitimate news organizations and fact-checkers in the online space over time.

The investigation illustrated the disinformation networks in the Philippines, highlighted the dangers of leaving myths and conspiracy theories unchecked, and showed the opportunity to learn from past mistakes by showcasing the power of collective action in fact-checking.

The piece was published a month before the elections.","The project proved that leaving falsehoods unchecked, no matter how absurd they may sound, only causes more harm. It showed that when nations and societies allow fabrications to proliferate and remain unchallenged, their people suffer the consequences of having their own history and narratives reversed.

It was a wake-up call for experts, journalists, and educators to step up in fighting disinformation online, especially in a political climate where lies thrive – such as in the Philippines.

This groundbreaking project showed that fighting disinformation should always be a collective action. As part of the #FactsFirstPH initiative, this project exemplified how content can intersect with warm bodies to produce action. Once this project was published, it was distributed by #FactsFirstPH’s diverse network of partners working together to counter efforts to undermine democracy.

FactsFirstPH is a coalition of more than 120 groups from the media, civil society, business, research, legal sectors, and the Church, that seek to combat disinformation. The coalition studied and tackled disinformation online to equip voters with verified information ahead of the upcoming national and local 2022 elections.","The team scraped Facebook for posts mentioning “Marcos gold.” These posts were then analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively.

The major findings of the story surfaced using a community detection algorithm. This algorithm was used to determine different networks of accounts that posted about the topic. This allowed us to identify which communities propagated the lies, which communities tried to fight them, and how they evolved over the years.

The researchers also did a time series analysis of the posts, to illustrate when exactly these falsehoods surged and when the pushback started happening.","This story proved that history can not only be reversed – its reversal can also be brought to the ballot box.

Previous disinformation studies have shown that the Marcos family has been using social media to reclaim power. Their supporters have also been found to attack members of the media for reporting critically about them, making it hard for the independent press to put out reports without being targeted.

In terms of innovative technologies, there are no other newsgroups in the Philippines that have the capacity to perform community detection on social media. The algorithm created by Rappler is the first of its kind.","This project showed that with the way platforms are designed, even fringe conspiracies can be brought into the mainstream when the lies are ignored, and when social media platforms allow communities of malignant actors to exist and thrive.

The story also stressed how fact-checking alone can be lacking, when we fail to consider how lies are distributed online. This project showed that even legitimate media organizations can be isolated from online discussions that are of public concern.

This project aims to remind journalists and fact-checkers that collaboration is key in fighting disinformation.","English, Filipino",https://www.rappler.com/nation/elections/tracing-myth-marcos-gold-online/,,,,,,,"Pauline Macaraeg (author), Bingbong Recto (data scientist), Gemma Mendoza (editor), Don Kevin Hapal (editor)","Pauline Macaraeg is a digital forensics researcher for Rappler.

This story helps readers to explain that context in a visual way. The visuals show that China's trade foothold in Southeast Asia is quite deep, but that US investments in the region dwarfs China's. The story then continues to some more deeper analysis by our foreign correspondents that attracts readers who are interested in the topic. The project is among the most-read stories on May 23, the day it was published.","We used a scrolly map to compare the amount of investments between US and China in the Asean region. The subtle relief map was optimized using QGIS. The peak charts were created using Datawrapper which then further refined using Illustrator.

The styles uses visual cues between US and China. We used blue and an eagle to represent the US while we used red and dragon to symbolize China. The colors and icons are symbolic between these two countries. The eagle and the dragon are known to be powerful and dominant creatures as well.","Gathering and crunching the numbers and making sure the figures we collected are consistent was a long process.

It is challenging to visually tell a story and dissect or simplify terminologies about international relations and global powers.","Collaboration is essential on producing these type of stories. Visuals helped to enhance the text and made it engaging for readers. But as data journalists, we also need the help of foreign correspondents to verify our findings and make sure our charts are accurate.

Following the report’s publication, Sangkay Janjan had also [taken down 167 of his videos](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/youtube-vlogger-sangkay-janjan-takes-down-videos-following-rappler-investigation/), which violated YouTube’s policies on harassment and COVID-19 disinformation.","The researchers scraped all of Sangkay Janjan’s YouTube videos – posted from December 2, 2017, until June 14, 2022 – through the YouTube API. Researchers then ran the raw data through a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm, which allowed them to categorize Sangkay Janjan’s videos based on their titles. The author also categorized his videos based on the actual video content as well as the target/s of the vlogger’s attacks, if applicable.

In the published report, embedded visualizations include a time series analysis of the key categories of Sangkay Janjan’s vlogs, as well as a bar graph of the most popular categories based on view count.","Part of what made the Marcos family popular post-Martial Law – after the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos was toppled following his bloody regime marked by killings and plunder – was the plethora of pro-Marcos vloggers who helped amplify lies and propaganda surrounding their legacy. A distinct tactic of Marcos propagandists is to promote vloggers who spread conspiracy theories and to belittle and degrade trained professional journalists, even going as far as to lobby for vloggers’ access to cover official presidential events. Even Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself – the current Philippine President and the son and namesake of the late dictator – had focused on vlogging prior to his 2022 presidential campaign.

At the time the report was published, Sangkay Janjan was on the road to a million YouTube subscribers. He was also vice president for internal affairs of a new group called the United Vloggers and Influencers of the Philippines (UVIP), formed to call for vlogger access to Malacañang. Sangkay Janjan had the highest subscriber count among UVIP’s members, making him the most influential of pro-Marcos vloggers in the country.","Journalism helps hold power to account, which includes reporting on popular online figures who spread falsehoods and conspiracy theories to their large audiences. This project aims to serve as an example of how journalists can also report on ordinary citizens with a tendency to take advantage of their platforms, even if they aren’t in government, from a notable family, etc.","English, Filipino",https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/investigative/youtube-vlogger-sangkay-janjan-gets-away-lies-hate/,,,,,,,"Gaby Baizas (author), Dylan Salcedo (data scientist), Gemma Mendoza (editor), Don Kevin Hapal (editor)","Gaby Baizas is a digital forensics researcher at Rappler, investigating information operations, online propaganda, and lies spreading on social media.

Singapore,"Kontinentalist, Immigration Detention and Vulnerable Migrants in Hong Kong Research Team",Small,Participant,,Stuck in the system: Immigration detention in Hong Kong,2022-08-04,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Map, Politics, Immigration, Employment, Human rights",Mapbox,"Every year, thousands of migrants enter Hong Kong’s immigration detention system. What exactly goes on behind the scenes isn’t clear, but repeated accounts from detainees and civil society have raised serious concerns of poor conditions within, and underscored the urgent need for the Hong Kong government to consider reforms to their immigration detention system.

This story aims to shed a light on the immigration detention system in Hong Kong. We worked with a team of researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, who had dedicated much effort to collecting as much information about the system as possible.","This project’s main aim was to bring attention to an overlooked topic in the region. This story was created in collaboration with our partner, the Immigration Detention and Vulnerable Migrants in Hong Kong research team, who wanted to shed light on this important issue from Hong Kong. Previously, they had consolidated all the gathered data into a single website, which, unfortunately, did not garner much attention from the general public, as it might have been too data-heavy and inaccessible for the average reader. As such, this story aimed to convert the important the data they had and into an accessible, concise story for readers. The research team also plans to use the story for future presentations and talks that they might have on the topic.

The story received 665 unique page views with an average reading time of 3 minutes and 35 seconds. It also reached 1,777 accounts, being shared 45 times and garnering 89 likes. 

On Twitter, the story was shared by IDC Asia Pacific, an outlet working on issues of immigration detention, asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants.","We wanted to create a story that was both immersive and interactive so that readers can easily be brought into the complex and jarring world of immigration detention. We used data visualisation programmes like Mapbox to create an interactive scrolling map which locates the detention centres, as well as bar graphs to understand the average length of detention and records of physical confrontations. We also used illustrative elements to visualise the dismal conditions at these facilities.","Immigration detention in Hong Kong was an extremely sensitive topic to write about. During the process of creating the story, every detail was carefully observed, all the way down to the way individual sentences were structured. Despite the story being an issue of high urgency, our partner and the writers had to ensure that the tone didn’t come off too accusatory to avoid political repercussions.

Data for the issue was also difficult to collect. The research team did all they could to gather the information that they have today, but even so, gaps in knowledge are still apparent and were also highlighted in the story. Due to the lack of transparency, it is difficult to bring this issue to the authorities. However, with the data they’ve managed to find together with first-hand accounts from people who had gone through the system itself, it is evident that the immigration detention system treats many migrants in Hong Kong in an unfair way. Many times, these communities are at the receiving end of serious human rights violations, making it an urgent issue that the government needs to address.","As journalists, it is important to keep an open mind and look out for groups and potential partners who are passionate and aligned with specific causes. Before the research team reached out to us, we did not know much about the topic nor this team that has been working on this issue for a long time. Even though they might not represent a large well-known organisation, it was important for us to draw on their invaluable knowledge and research to tell this story — which served to be a huge learning opportunity as well.",English,https://kontinentalist.com/stories/detainees-held-at-immigration-detention-centres-in-hong-kong,https://immigrationdetentionhk.net/en/,https://www.psychotherapyhealingspace.com/2022/09/08/cic-workshop/,https://buttondown.email/puntofisso/archive/482-quantum-of-sollazzo/,https://twitter.com/IDCAsiaPacific/status/1562284302439591936?s=20&t=Y0pcM2w2564Eg89G4lKWPg,,,"Authors / The Immigration Detention and Vulnerable Migrants in Hong Kong Research Team

We found that the average tweet per day and reaction per tweet can help explain a politician's electability in the poll for the presidential election. Politicians who were more active tended to be more popular in the poll.

We also found that most politicians had not tweeted more between March and July 2022.

We collected the data from Twitter and leading polling agency Indikator Politik. We collected the tweet data through Twitter's API using R.","The story has gained 428 views as of Jan. 19, 2023","We used R for the data collection, analysis and visualization. To collect the tweet data, we used the rtweet package to request tweet data through Twitter's API.

We also perform a linear regression in R to predict electability based on Twitter activity, after controlling the engagement or reaction.

Then we use the ggplot2 package to visualize the analysis result.","This is arguably a novelty data-driven story.

Philippines,Rappler,Small,Participant,,Faith factor: Spiritual groups on Facebook as effective tools for disinformation,2022-09-04,"Investigation, Culture","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","This project analyzed faith and spirituality groups on Facebook in the Philippines – a predominantly Catholic country that has the highest number of Catholics in Asia.

The researchers looked at how faith groups are being effectively used as boundary-spanning channels to spread different types of disinformation, and unpacked why members of such groups were vulnerable to disinformation/. It also explored the role of spirituality/religion in spreading false information.

This project took a look at the kind of disinformation narratives in these groups, and how the “faith factor” plus the use of spiritual language make it harder to fact-check.",The project is the first known investigative report that explored and mapped religious Facebook groups containing disinformation. It can be used by other journalists and researchers interested in faith groups on Facebook for further studies.,"The researchers did a search of public Facebook posts containing keywords related to global conspiracy theories. From the total dataset, we then extracted posts from religious/spirituality groups only. This was done through community clustering of the entities found in the dataset, to determine which groups belong to the community cluster that often shares religious/spirituality content.

After this, we then did a qualitative content analysis on the posts found in the scan and identified which posts contained disinformation or misleading content. Natural language processing of the posts was used to aid us in this step.

We then mapped the shared audiences of the Facebook groups that were found to have shared disinformation/misleading content – based on the type of disinformation they shared (i.e. political, health, online scams). This is to show how closely knitted these groups are, and how likely their members tend to share similar types of content.

Finally, we consulted an expert on the sociology of religion in the Philippines to help us contextualize our findings.","The Philippines is an extremely religious country. Statistics show that there are 8 out of 10 Filipinos are Roman Catholics. Aside from Catholicism, there are a number of other Christian denominations present in the country, including Evangelical, Iglesia ni Cristo, Aglipayan, Protestant, Baptist, Pentecostal, Anglican, Orthodox, Methodist, and Seventh-Day Adventist.

Filipinos are also known to be susceptible to disinformation – with 51% of Filipinos finding it difficult to spot “fake news.” Couple this with a high internet penetration rate (68% as of 2022), these factors make it easy for information operations to thrive online.

In terms of innovative technologies, there are no other newsgroups in the Philippines that have the capacity to perform community detection or shared audience mapping on social media. The algorithm created by Rappler is the first of its kind.",This story showed that disinformation is not limited to political spaces.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,Can you spot a scam? A guide to avoiding the top scams in Singapore,2022-03-06,"Explainer, Solutions journalism, Quiz/game, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Crime","Animation, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Node.js","Scams have skyrocketed in Singapore. Millions of dollars are lost to conmen, and many of these scams start with a text, or a message on social media. To combat that, The Straits Times launched Stop Scams, an initiative to identify the different types of scams that have preyed on thousands of victims. As part of this initiative, we designed an interactive that dives into the modus operandi of the scammers and how to avoid getting scammed. It features quizzes mimicking real-life scenarios allowing the public to understand and detect scams.","The interactive educated readers on how to spot red flags in messages to detect a scam. Today, scammers can steal money in a matter of seconds, if we aren't keeping ourselves safe online. The simple act of clicking a link, as harmless as it sounds, can cause people to lose millions of dollars. This interactive features quizzes that mimick real, online scenarios, using real messages as examples to stop users from being scammed. The project gained over 100K views since it was published in March and is one of our top-viewed graphics this year. ST also hosted a Stop Scams exhibition at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre in May. The interactive, along with other projects in the initiative were showcased here to educate people, particularly seniors, who are more vulnerable to scams, on how to be vigilant online. The exhibition was attended by 30,000 people. We also received messages of gratitude from participants because our efforts have opened their eyes to scams, and offered solutions and solace to those who were scammed.","To build the quiz, we built the interactive format using JavaScript and Vue.js. We also visualised data in datawrapper. Some animations were added in CSS. In addition, the graphics for the intro data visualisation and the text message simulation were created using Adobe Illustrator and exported to SVG.","The hardest part of this project was figuring out how to keep it simple and not overwhelm the user with too much information, but also still make it informative enough that they walk away learning something from this. To ensure this, our graphics were designed to look like real messages. These messages are then annotated to spot the red flags. Simple animations such as jumping notification icons also helped the readers to relate to this quiz better.","Journalists play an important role in public service. The consequences for someone who is a victim of scams are long-lasting, both the financial and psychological impacts. However, our role is not just to explain the potential repercussions of not being digitally safe, but we also have a part to play in providing solutions. The purpose of this piece is to educate and prevent more from being scammed. This project was also an example of a great collaboration between the interactive graphics team and the rest of the newsroom.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Participant,,How the Russia-Ukraine war is making your plate of orh luak more expensive,2022-05-08,"Investigation, Explainer, Infographics, Chart, Video, Business, Economy","Adobe Creative Suite, Node.js","This project explored the effects of the Russian-Ukraine war on the price one of Singapore's local dishes, the orh luak, or fried Oyster omelette. The interactive investigates which ingredient is causing the price hike, and explains how else the war is disrupting supply chains.","This project won best cross media project of the quarter, in ST's quarterly newscomm awards that seeks to recognise projects that have done well during that period. It was also well received by the public for its innovative way of breaking down supply chain issues caused by the Russia-Ukraine war, in a way that was relateable for our average reader.","For the introduction, we used a scrolly to introduce the ingredients individually, while inviting readers to take a guess on which ingredient is driving up the prices of the dish. We took inspiration from cooking videos and came up with a storyboard of different types of shots - top down angle, wide shot, close ups. Then we edited them in Adobe Premiere Pro to add in some graphical elements such as the mini bar charts on screen, and the split screen to show the different types of shots side by side.","The hardest part would be to decide on the sequence which the ingredients would be introduced. For the visuals, we had wanted it to be in the order of what the cooking process would be in real life: Oil > Eggs > Green Onion > Oysters, as this would allow the cooking process to be revealed in a sequential way. However, for the narrative, we needed eggs to be introduced last because it is the main ingredient driving cost up, and it would make the flow of the narrative better by using eggs to lead into the rest of the story.

Eventually, we decided to prioritise the narrative while finding an alternative way for the visuals, which was to use close up shots of the ingredients in between, so that it didn't feel like the overall cooking process was not sequential.","We were able to explain an otherwise mundane (yet important) topic about how supply chains were being impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war, through a local dish like the fried oyster omelette. Through our choice of words and narrative device (the scrolly), we were able to make an event that was spatially far away from Singapore, relevant and relatable for our average reader. 

Apart from the interactive, the video team also did a short video explainer for this story. It was a collaborative effort working across desks, and was interesting to see how different teams could have different takes/angles on the same subject.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/05/russia-ukraine-war-singapore-hawker-prices-orh-luak/index.html,,,,,,,"Alyssa Karla Mariano Mungcal (Digital graphics designer)

Following the production journey of a simple t-shirt and its contribution to the carbon footprint.,"The project received praise and shares from the sustainability and fashion space that it was well-researched and a creative way of educating consumers about where their clothes come from. 

Internally, this was the first time we used stop-motion animation in our interactive graphics, and it challenged us to think of how to summarise a complicated process into a tight stop-motion animation. The story went through multiple rounds of sketches and mockups, which allowed us to learn how to collaborate better and incorporate multiple team members' creative ideas. We also had a lot of fun with the project. In order to do the first part of the story with the green hangtags, we did our own data collection process of surveying fashion stores in a Singapore shopping mall.","""t was an entirely new project collaboration with our Digital Graphics and Art team that uses stop-motion animation and the outcome was a totally unique project. 

The process of doing stop motion was a tedious process. It took a lot of preparation from the Art and Digi graphics team in terms of materials procurement and storyboarding. We made refinements using After Effects and exported the charts between Observable and Illustrator.

On the stop motion side, we had to plan out the storyboards based on the limitations of our photography light box, deciding which elements we will need to acquire. Some elements need to be planned out, animated, printed out and painstakingly cut out piece by piece to be photographed. After which, each frame of the animation has to be photographed frame by frame and finally composited together to form the animation.

This story used a lot of visual metaphors too. One of which was, the styles and theme exhibiting a transition from a sustainable looking store into a greyish industrialized theme which projects a sky full of carbon emissions. Another is we used fuzzy/blurry graphics to show a transparency metaphor on brand transparency on their supply chain processes.","The initial idea was entirely different from the what ended up being published. We went through multiple rounds of brainstorming and sketching. The topic was also quite complex, since there's not exactly one way to produce a shirt. For example, the wet processes that a garment goes through can happen at multiple points of the process. It was a challenge to summarise the process without oversimplifying it. In order to explain the process accurately, we sat through multiple interviews with experts and those who are familiar with the process over several weeks.","Journalists can learn that the creative process to creating an interactive page is not always the most straightforward. The best ideas don't always come at the beginning of the process. In this case, we had many eureka moments that helped us make this interactive better, but that meant we had to make changes to our original idea. Ideas can evolve and get better overtime.

In addition, we also learned the importance of checking with experts and those working on the ground, to ensure the information and data we're showing is accurate. This is also not always the most straightforward process, as we needed to strike a balance between what's engaging and pretty design-wise, and how to be accurate.",English,https://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/graphics/2022/11/fast-fashion-greenwashing-environmental-impact/index.html,,,,,,,"Stephanie Adeline (Project lead & data journalist)

Last year, Tara Air crashed in Nepal in which 22 people lost their lives. The story used graphics and charts combined to reflect ongoing investigations in Tara Air plane crash. It also looks at the historical data of fatalities and aircraft hull occurences in Nepal and previous Tara Air accidents to provide context. It also looks at the phase-wise aviation accidents data in Nepal and compares it to Beoing report data.","Nepal ranks 33 out of the 207 countries ordered based on the number of plane crashes between 1990 and 2023. In our analysis of the data we came up with these conclusions:
1. Between 2010 and 2022, Tara Air aeroplanes met with six accidents resulting in 67 fatalities. The maximum number of fatalities (23) were reported in 2016 by a Tara Air Twin Otter plane flying the same route as 9N-AET.
2. In the last two decades, most of the aeroplane accidents in Nepal occurred during the landing phase followed by the en route and approach phase. The least number of accidents occurred in the initial climb phase. 
3. In the last 12 years (2010-2022), 64 airplane accidents have occurred in Nepal which has resulted in 530 deaths. 

This story was published by BBC Nepali- and reached tens of thousands of readers. We published the story after a month of the accident to update the audience and at the same time inform them about the historical data of aviation accidents in Nepal.","We used Excel for data analysis and Google Sheets, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Flourish for charts and infographics.

After observing a pattern of what looked like increasing number of properties being put up for sale to recover loans, the Daily Monitor [Newspaper] team coded and analysed foreclosure notices in the Daily Monitor for January-June 2022 and compared it with data for similar pre-Covid data (January – June 2019).","The process of crafting the story involved analysing and sorting data in the foreclosure notices in the Daily Monitor Newspaper for January-June 2022 and compared it with data for similar pre-Covid data (January – June 2019).
Doing this took a period of six months as we had to carefully capture all the nitty-gritty details of the auctions. 
Some of the discoveries [while doing the story] were interesting. For instance, we discovered that the 2022 statistics translated to 346 properties being placed for sale a month, or 12 of them a day, that year. The imminent forfeitures, based on our analysis, showed individual borrowers losing big and small assets, among them family homes, usually an acquisition using life-time savings.
This was a cry for help after some of the borrowers shared heart-breaking stories on how the cost of living crisis brought about by the Covid-19 adverse effects had pushed them to the wall to have their properties auctioned so that they could make ends meet. 
Some of the borrowers had even spoken of mental distress including slipping into depression as a result of this setback. 
As a result, we decided to do a follow-up story from psychologists and banks to advise borrowers on how to deal with loan stress. A number of readers afterwards reached out to Daily Monitor applauding us for writing the stories and since then, the number of foreclosure notices in the Daily Monitor for properties being auctioned has greatly reduced.","We worked with Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to analyse and decode the data for simplicity. These spreadsheets helps us easily organize and re-arrange the data fast. 

Afterwards, we incorporated the findings from the Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, into bar line graphs so as to get capture the trend of the auctions.","At some point, while analysing and decoding the data, we [the team doing the story] we got stuck after failing to draw appropiate bar line graphs from auctions. We kept messing up from time to time, and having to re-do the work again.

All of it pursuing one goal: offer a service to citizens about how macroeconomic data is having direct consequences in their personal finances and lives.","Our inflation coverage includes a price tracker of two hundred products and services that compose the shopping cart (link 1), which is updated every month, that helped us to prove inflation moved from energy bills to basic food products like milk. This tracker also helped our readers to make better informed decisions about their purchases.

We also updated a gas station map that shows the evolution of the fuel price in each gas station of Spain (link 4), that allowed every reader to know where it was cheaper to refuel, and a calculator about how the rise of the interest rates could alter mortgages, updated every time the Euribor changes (link 3).

We were the first media in Spain that published a daily tracker of gas station prices, so readers could check the daily evolution of the gas prices in their nearby gas stations. 

Apart from trackers and periodic updates, we explain the complex operation of the marginal electricity market in Spain and why green energies are bought at gas prices (link 2), and how basic food products are climbing month by month and this is especially damaging to humble families (link 6).

Some pieces appear as published in 2023, this is due to their continuous update, but they were originally published in 2022.","For data compilation, cleaning and analysis we use R programming language, with the R Studio software. In other cases we use Excel and also Google Spreadsheets, when we need to work collaboratively.
Regarding visualizations, we have frequently used Datawrapper. For those pieces which required the biggest effort in the process of extracting and analyzing the data, the visualizations were done with D3 with JavaScript.
The project also includes some visual narrative, as in piece number 2. The development of a scroll narrative allows us to present a big amount of complex information in an easy and explicatively way. For some other details, such those in piece 1, (emojis and little images) we used HTML and Adobe Illustrator. HTML was also used for tooltips in interactive graphics.
The combination of these techniques and technologies allow us to have very automatized processes. This means a great advantage and allows us to update data and visualizations in a few minutes.","Over the past year, elDiario.es monitored the rise of prices in an inflation tracker. Readers could check how each one of the 200 products and services that compose the shopping cart change their prices, and compare the current price with every month since the beginning of the pandemic. This piece has been in continuous update since then, month by month. We were able to demonstrate that prices of basic and healthy foodstuffs were suffering the highests rises, and we narrated how the gap between humble and rich families got bigger due to these rises. 

At the beginning of the year, elDiario.es elaborated an interactive map to show, day by day, the price of petrol and diesel oil in each one of the gas stations of the country, and its variation regarding the last week. Thanks to this analysis, we could prove that 60% of the gas stations were raising their prices to internalize the bonification that the Government had conceived to soften the price rise of fuel.

At the same time, the price of electricity beated historical records also in March 2022. In order to explain what was behind such exorbitant prices, elDiario.es analyzed more than eight million registries in the electricity market over 2021. The investigation explained how the marginal electricity market works in an educational way and proved that green energies are bought at gas prices.

By the end of the year, the European Central Bank raised interest rates significantly. This fact meant another concern for Spanish homes after a tough year. elDiario.es elaborated a calculator where readers could check how the rise of the interest rates would affect their mortgages. Once more, elDiario.es attempted to provide reliable and personalized information in a friendly and clear format.

Many of these pieces allow the readers to have very specific and personalized information, which is essential for reaching our goal of public service. The pieces composing this project reached more than 300.000 views.","The inflation series of articles proves the importance of data journalism in contributing to the public service. Thanks to techniques and softwares of analysis and visualization, it is possible to “translate” vast amounts of economic data into nice explicative charts. Behind this complex macroeconomic data there are daily tangible concerns, and it is our labor to make this essential data accessible to everyone. For this goal, teamwork is key. The Data team of elDiario.es works side by side with the rest of the colleagues, traditional journalists specialized in -in this case- Economics, who provide their knowledge and background to the data analysis, resulting in contextualized and complete information.

This project can also be a good example of transforming “boring” and heavy economic data into interactive, intuitive and customized pieces of news. The piece about inflation, for example, shows how it is possible to use official open data to develop more elaborated analysis. Through visualizations and visual narratives, elDiario.es Data team always tries to explain complex issues in an explicative and attractive way.

Also, it proves that sometimes classic simple visualizations, such as bars chart, line chart and tables, far from becoming boring or not original, can be really convenient. And that they can combine perfectly with other visualizations far more complex.",Spanish,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/sube-super-han-encarecido-precios-producto-ultimo-ano-alimentos-luz-transporte-diciembre_1_8901588.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/agua-sol-viento-precio-gas-funciona-mercado-electrico-espana_1_8854576.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/calculadora-subira-hipoteca-interes-variable-cuota-alza-euribor_1_9619101.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/precio-gasolinera-consulta-gasolina-barata-zona-jueves_1_8867633.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/60-gasolineras-subido-precios-diluyen-bonificacion-gobierno_1_8972431.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/subida-alimentos-redobla-dano-inflacion-pobres-frente-ricos_1_9698821.html,https://www.eldiario.es/economia/inflacion-come-paga-sueldo-bce-decidido-hipoteca-coma_1_9797792.html,"Raúl Sánchez, Victòria Oliveres, Ana Ordaz, Daniel Yebra, Rodrigo Ponce de León","Raúl Sánchez: data journalist covering stories of inequality, gender, health, taxes and urbanism at elDiario.es.

Telegram Messanger is widly used as a source of news for many Ukrainians. At the beginning of March 2022, right after the full-scale invasion, Russian information troops targeted regional centers of Ukraine by creating dedicated Telegram channels for each township or community. We managed to identify 120 such channels and analyzed the dynamics of content publishing, imposing it on the timeline of the development of the war. Text analysis helps us to set content originality index and identify networks of channels.","In November, we looked into Russia’s use of Telegram channels in various regions of Ukraine and why their attempt to push propaganda through these channels has failed. 

Since the onset of the full-scale invasion, Russian info warfare forces targeted various regions of Ukraine through local Telegram channels. This strategy was confirmed by the captured Russian lieutenant colonel. He named 10 such channels. We managed to identify 120. 

68 of these channels were created during the first 2 weeks of the war. Considering identical visual cues & the synchronization of updates, we can safely assume that at least half of the 120 channels have been created as part of a coordinated effort of the Russian information warfare troops. The channels were managed from the same location. 

As the Russian army retreated from Kyiv and slowed down its advance, new Telegram channels only appeared in the South of Ukraine. Later on, some of the channels got abandoned altogether. 

Our investigation results are the another proof of aggressive plans of Russia with the aim to occupy Ukraine, despite they do state publicly. Project havs lots of retweets and shares in other social media. First of all it aroused interest among the media experts, disinfo researches and local activists. 

Russia has been building a network of (pro-)Russian information propagandist outlets, which pretend to be operated from Ukraine, for many years. Unlike the official mouthpieces of the Kremlin, these outlets are primarily tasked with showing support of Russia and expressing “domestic” criticism of the Ukrainian government. 

Eventually, Telegram became one of the most prominent instruments of Russian propaganda, and today this messenger is considered the most popular social network in Ukraine and one of the most dangerous sources of Russian influence.","The data was downloaded from Telegram with a scraper. All channels are open, so we could take any scraper. 
First 10 such channels were named by the captured Russian lieutenant colonel, chief of information countermeasures and operational camouflage division of the 58th Army of Southern Military District of the Russian Armed Forces, during the interrogation. Then with snow-ball method we managed to find 120 channels.
Then everything analysed in Python.

Network visualisation was built in Gephi with further processing in visual editor.","The idea of the project was born as a followup of regular monitorings of telegram-channels in occupied territorries, which TEXTY were preparing for the Ukrainian Center for stragic communicationa and countering disinformation (as a part of the Ministry). Our cooperation actively strenghened after Russian invasion on February 24. TEXTY provided monitoring and analysis of media-sphere on different platforms from mainstream media, including Russin-based and state-owned, to social media and messangers. The Center used results of our monitoring for their communication activities with a focus on countering disinformation and also for decision-making process within governmental institutions.","The strategy of creating local sources of propaganda was considered to be quite effective — at least hypothetically. The idea was that local resources would have more chances winning readers’ trust than central channels of Russian propaganda by offering a mix of propagandist narratives and local news which may be of some use for the readers.

We noticed that reposts are vitally important for most channels. On average, every third post which appears in occupation channels is a repost. This fact helped us to find networks and furthermore tomake sure that such inforamtion invasion is a part of a well-planned Russia's full-scale intervention into Ukraine.","Ukrainian, English",https://texty.org.ua/projects/108161/telegram-occupation-how-russia-wanted-breed-media-monster-ended-paper-tiger/,https://texty.org.ua/projects/108016/telehram-okupaciya-yak-rosiya-vybudovuvala-mediamerezhu-vyjshlo-potomkinske-selo/,,,,,,"Yevhenia Drozdova, Yuliia Dukach, Nadia Kelm","**Yevheniia Drozdova**: data journalist at Texty.org.ua, Kyiv, Ukraine.

Private schools provide educational services for families seeking better education quality in the country. These schools may refuse to accept the child in the absence of a judicial ruling that grants the mother “educational custody”. The Investigation documents 12 cases of divorced women whose children's natural right to education has been curtailed by the “educational custody” provision .This custody refers to the law administering the children's educational affairs, it is automatically given to fathers in the absence of marital disputes.","After publishing the investigation, several members of the Egyptian parliament submitted a request to change the law so mothers would be granted the right of educational custody of their children. They also demanded to put penalties on schools that refuse to implement the law and denying divorced women the right to exercise their children's educational rights.
The Investigation encouraged more women to speak up; the Egyptian Ministry of Education received many complaints from divorced mothers supported by a number of civil society organisations, demanding to get the educational custody of their children to apply for private schools.
The Investigation “Egypt: No voices for Moms ,Educational Custody’s Rules Ban Children from Private Schools “ was granted special mention at the ARIJ Award 2022, for which 133 investigations from 23 countries competed.

As suicide cases spiked the government's lone mental health helpline, could only be reached three of the over 40 times it was called over a period of five days. Further, non-governmental helplines also faced roadblocks: shortage of funds, lack of volunteers, bad telecommunication network and burnout among other issues.","Once this news story was published, we received an overwhelming response from professionals working in the mental health area for highlighting the the concerns faced by helplines. Many of them shared the same roadblocks and concerns the interviewees in the story faced. Some helplines who had just begun operating requested us to put up their numbers on our website for anyone who needed it. We even received emails from readers who were up untill reading the story, unaware of the helpline numbers and the suicide statistics of the country. Since lack of funds is one of the main roadblocks in running suicide helplines smoothly, non-governmental suicide helplines across the country have reached out to us in helping them raise funds. Hence, in the coming months we plan to launch a service that would connect helplines with organisations and persons willing to help fund them.",This story only needed basic resources like a mobile phone and good internet network.,"Suicide prevention helplines are useful and necessary but can only help so much. Until now, we have largely relied on volunteer and NGO efforts which are poorly funded. There is a need to properly fund these suicide prevention helplines. In the absense of a national fund to fund helplines in different states, it will be extremely challenging for existing mental health professionals and helplines to function daily. 

Given the huge geographical variations in the number as well as profile of suicide deaths in different parts of the country, experts advised that state governments should draft and implement state suicide prevention strategies.

The **confinement** due to the Covid-19 pandemic caused a **35.9% increase in actions against rats and cockroaches** in Malaga (Andalusia, Spain).
Thanks to the Open Data laws, the City of Malaga offers **detailed data on pest control in the city**: day by day, street by street, species by species.
To simplify the information, I focused on rats and cockroaches and in the **pre, during and post confinement years**. 
This visual piece is composed of **maps**, static **infographics**, a **scrollstory** with map and **charts** with **Mapbox, Illustrator, JS and Datawrapper**.","This visual report was first published in its entirety, as submitted to this contest.

The success of **the map with the street search engine** (more than **2,000 loads in a week**, a lot for a small newspaper like SUR) led us to publish **two additional pieces** only with the maps, so that the user could search if the 'Bugbusters' had acted near his home.

Some citizens of Malaga had denounced the proliferation of rats and cockroaches in the city after the confinement.

The Open Data Service of the City Council of Malaga does a commendable job offering a large amount of data on different aspects about the city and in great detail. However, as Malaga is a small city, not many media outlets are able to take advantage of it. As a visual journalist at SUR, I am allowed to dedicate time to this data work and, therefore, the citizens of Malaga and our readers benefit from a simpler, more direct and attractive communication of this large set of data.

By mapping the data we confirm not only the hypothesis, but identify the 'hot spots'. We also consulted official sources who also confirmed the hypothesis and clarified that the proliferation of actions was also a confirmation of the good work of the city's Pest Control Team.","Working in a small city (and newsroom) doesn't mean you can do big data-driven journalism.

This was almost impossible to do amidst the European sanctions without manipulations with commodity codes. We discovered the sactions-busting scheme after what it was shut down by authorities.,Shortly after our investigation Estonia announced that it would introduce additional sanctions on Belarus in the form of suspending the transit of coal-based oil by customs code 2707. https://www.intellinews.com/the-belarus-baltics-trade-war-234335/,"We have used data from Eurostat after examining which we have found out an “export miracle”.

Using available correspondence the author managed to reconstruct the whole process of ""healing"" and in depth explain methods used by quacker to manipluate victims. The story started public debate about quackery in BiH, being republished 40 times and having numerous reports and TV shows done by other media.","The story started first public debate about quackery in BiH, being republished 40 times and having numerous reports and TV shows done by other media as a follow up. Author received comments and messages from people who met the same or similar persons, who were offering “healing” services without adequate medical training and who were taking money for it. Author gave dozens of statements for other media, and the story resonated regionally as well. TV stations in Croatia and Serbia took research as a base and started discussion on quackery in their own countries, having many people in similar situation coming forward. Various prosecutor's offices in the country told BIRN BiH that there are basis of criminal offense, currently determining jurisdiction. Persons mentioned in the research deleted their social media profiles, as well as public photos on WhatsApp and Viber applications.","During the research author went through correspondence of the victim with the quacks (mobile messages, social media) provided by the victim’s family, sent Freedom of Information requests to the courts and prosecutors, used Google maps for finding addresses of the people involved while Excel and Google sheet were used to document collected data (collected evidences, FoI requests). BIRN BiH IT team developed special code for BIRN signature website www.detektor.ba in order to present all relevant messages in evidently and clear way, simulating mobile messages interface.","During the work on the research, which lasted for almost a year, the biggest challenge was getting information and the data about people who were involved in quackery - getting to them personally, since they don’t use social networks to a large extent and many data about them was not available. For every document that would confirm their identity and that they were doing business somewhere, ie that they have something registered in their name, we had to get permission from the local courts to view the documents, which we could not copy or photograph, but only transcribe within a limited time frame, which massively reduced the possibility of having real insight into all documents related to their business. On the other hand, we also had a problem with the courts and prosecutions, from whom we did not receive data for months regarding the previous punishment of the persons we were investigating, or they did not want to provide us with the number of the court cases, which we did not even know if existed at that moment. In the attempt to publish the story, we tried to present the story as objectively as possible with all the relevant messages for the story we were working on. This presented a technical challenge, especially regarding the realization of the display of the page that our IT support specifically created for this investigation and the article, even though we had never published content in that form before. All this hard work paid off since this way of presenting messages, correspondences we received from the family, allowed end users to get the deep insight of the characteristics of quack approaches and methodologies using to deceive victims themselves.","This project shows that for the investigations of this scope journalists have to dedicate special time and effort in order to collect all relevant information both from persons who are involved as well as from relevant institution. Extra work on developing a proper new interface on the website article, which would show all collected evidence and data in user friendly manner is effort worthy, since it maximize the impact of the story and shows that massive data, as months long correspondence is, can be shown in a way which would attract readers to stay with the long story. Showing messages of the victims with quakes allowed readers to be more personally involved in the story which, at the end, resulted with a massive number of reactions in the public, both by other media (in country and in neighboring Serbia and Croatia) as well as on many private social media accounts.","Bosnian, English",https://detektor.ba/2022/03/10/bosnian-leukaemia-patient-dies-after-anti-medical-advice-from-healer/?lang=en,https://www.facebook.com/Detektor.ba/videos/692188858587581,https://docs.google.com/document/d/12EdGHV3m5aRkIL7q-s51M_eAemX_k8d9xOnQjEw5rf4/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,Azra Husarić Omerović,"Azra Husaric Omerovic joined BIRN BiH team in October 2019 as a journalist and worked as a court reporter.

Spain,"Maldita.es, Planta Baixa",Big,Participant,,Los bebés españoles nacidos en el extranjero por gestación subrogada,2022-11-21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Chart","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, FOIA","Maldita.es y Planta Baixa realizaron una investigación colaborativa este 2022 sobre los bebés españoles nacidos en el extranjero por gestación subrogada.

Tras pedir información con varias solicitudes de transparencia a los registros de los consulados españoles en el extranjero conseguimos crear nuestra propia base de datos con la información se las inscripciones de estos bebés año a año y en los distintos consulados.

Así, pudimos comprobar que desde 2010 se ha solicitado inscribir en los consulados españoles a más de 3.000 bebés nacidos por gestación subrogada o que el 62% de las solicitudes las realizaban parejas heterosexuales, entre otras cosas.","El impacto del proyecto fue importante a nivel de sociedad. Por primera vez se pudo conocer una cifra del número de bebés españoles nacidos por gestación subrogada en el extranjero e inscritos como españoles, ya que en nuestro país este tipo de gestación es ilegal. Los mecanismos legales sí permiten, eso sí, que en muchos casos se puedan tener hijos por esta vía en el extranjero y traerlos a España.

Aún así, los datos son sólo la punta del iceberg, ya que la investigación constató que sólo se tiene registro de los niños nacidos por esta vía que son inscritos en los registros de los consulados españoles antes de traerlos a nuestro país, pero no de los que se inscriben luego directamente ya en territorio español. Los datos, eso sí, se revelaron por primera vez y a un gran nivel de detalle. Pudimos, por ejemplo, aclarar que la mayoría de bebés por gestación subrogada los inscriben parejas heterosexuales y desmentir el mantra tan repetido en España de que normalmente son hijos de parejas de hombres homosexuales.

Además, funcionó muy bien el tema en la web de Maldita.es y también en la emisión de Planta Baixa y la web de TV3. También tuvo una buena acogida en las redes sociales de ambos medios.

También pudimos revelar que a pesar de la guerra de Ucrania incluso en 2022 hubo solicitudes para inscribir a bebés nacidos por gestación subrogada en el consulado de España en Ucrania. El Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, eso sí, no quiso aclarar en qué meses y, por lo tanto, ha ocultado si fue antes del inicio de la guerra o con esta ya en marcha.","Para conseguir toda la información tuvimos que hacer distintas solicitudes de acceso a la información al Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores utilizando la ley de transparencia. Después creamos nuestra propia base de datos, tarea que no fue tan sencilla porque cada consulado almacenaba la información de una forma distinta y, además, había datos para periodos y diferentes y de solicitudes pero también de inscripciones finales. Siempre que se solicita la inscripción en un consulado no tiene por qué acabar dándose, se puede denegar, cosa que ocurre sobre todo en los últimos años, pero en esos casos normalmente la inscripción se acaba aprobando ya en el registro en suelo español, de lo que no se tiene datos. Una vez construida toda la base de datos y homologados los datos de los diferentes periodos y consulados la analizamos con hojas de cálculo.

Después, utilizamos diferentes tipos de gráficos que permitían visualizar la información de forma más clara y comprensible, ya que era un tema bastante complicado, incluso a nivel legislativo. Intentamos hacerlo así lo más sencillo y fácil para los lectores de Maldita.es y los espectadores de Planta Baixa.

En el caso de la publicación en la web de Maldita.es, además, incluimos scrollytelling. Para ello se utilizó la propia librería desarrollada por Flourish en Javascript. Flourish es la herramienta que utilizamos principalmente para la visualización y los gráficos.","Una de las limitaciones fue la cerrazón del Gobierno de España a entregar datos de este tipo. De hecho, llevábamos años solicitando este tipo de información a los consulados españoles y no la habíamos conseguido. En el pasado algunos aseguraban no tener los datos y otros tenerlos incompletos para no entregarlos. Tras muchos intentos y perseverar en el tiempo en 2022 conseguimos por fin la información del número de solicitudes e inscripciones de bebés nacidos por gestación subrogada en los consulados españoles. Además, conseguimos saber qué tipos de familias los solicitaban.

No nos quedamos sólo ahí. También investigamos las tendencias por países. Pudimos ver en estos doce años los destinos que más escogen los españoles para un 'vientre de alquiler' han sido Estados Unidos y Ucrania, pero desde 2018 ha surgido como nuevo destino para esta práctica Georgia, cuyos casos se registran en el consulado español en Turquía. Del mismo modo, también comprobamos que antes del auge de Ucrania como destino para esta práctica, los bebés españoles nacidos por esta vía se registraban especialmente en la India. Pero una vez se prohibió la gestación subrogada para extranjeros en este país, fue cuando Ucrania empezó a concentrar la mayoría de casos. Una de las conclusiones de la investigación es que cuando una frontera se cierra a la gestación subrogada, otra se abre, surge otro país que empieza a concentrar esos casos. De hecho, la tendencia es de un aumento de bebés nacidos por gestación subrogada, aunque en los últimos años los datos si muestren un descenso. Esto pudimos corroborar que sucedió por un cambio legislativo en España que hace que en muchos casos los niños ya no se tengan que registrar en los consulados, sino ya una vez llegados a suelo español.","Creemos que el proyecto puede ser un ejemplo en cuanto a la importancia de la colaboración entre dos redacciones para conseguir información complicada y pode revelar temas desconocidos hasta entonces por el público. La colaboración no sólo nos permitió conseguir la información y hacer una investigación más completa, sino que también nos permite alcanzar un público mayor y targets distintos, que si publicara sólo uno de los dos medios no obtendríamos.

Además, evidencia que lejos de lo que se pueda creer el periodismo de datos y la investigación basada en este no pueda tener cabida en programas de televisión. Cada medio adaptó la investigación a sus formatos y soportes, pero ambos trabajamos de forma conjunta y coordinada en una investigación que tuvo su base básicamente en el periodismo de datos.

Además, no nos quedamos sólo en los datos, investigamos los cambios legislativos, hablamos con fuentes expertas para poder explicar cómo funciona todo el proceso de registrar a los bebés nacidos por gestación subrogada, explicamos el marco normativo e investigamos cómo en España, a pesar de estar prohibida, se anuncia la posibilidad de tener hijos por esta vía en otros países y después registrarlos en nuestro país.",Spanish,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221121/bebes-vientres-alquiler-gestacion-heterosexuales/,https://www.ccma.cat/tv3/planta-baixa/mes-de-3000-sollicituds-per-registrar-nadons-de-gestacio-subrogada/noticia/3197414/,,,,,,"Yuly Jara Guarnizo, Andreu Merino Vives, Sergio Sangiao Pérez, Dani Sánchez Ugart","Por parte de la fundación Maldita.es el equipo encargado de la investigación fue Maldito Dato, la sección especializada en periodismo de datos, investigación y transparencia dentro del medio.

* Datawrapper","> The map of forest fires in Andalusia

Since records have been kept until today, **2,671 forest fires** have burned the mountains of **Andalusia (Spain)**, 402 within the territory of Malaga.

This makes **Malaga the second most affected province** in the region. A conclusion that could only be reached by **mapping the large official database** on forest fires in Andalusia.","This is a **investigation work using geolocation data** on all forest fires (large and small) that have occurred in Andalusia (Spain) since records have been kept.

The result is a **unique map**, as there is no other visualization that represents the burned area of the region from 1975 to 2022.

This personal project was very well considered by the newspaper managers and they decided to make the theme the **opening of the Sunday paper** (most important day) both on paper and on the web. A situation that **is not usual with visual narrative themes**.","The dataviz elements are:
* 1 3d map: representing the orography of the terrain (mountains), with municipality finder to see the fires close to the reader and with filter by years (Mapbox and JavaScript).
* 1 column chart with filter: evolution of totals in number and area burned (Datawrapper).
* 1 bar chart with filter: totals by provinces in number and area burned (Datawrapper).
* 1 line chart with filter: to compare the evolution between the first and second most affected province in number and area burned (Datawrapper).
* 1 scrollstory with map: the 10 largest fires in the region (Mapbox and JavaScript).
* 2 animations: to compare the largest fire in the region with the largest fire in Malaga (Illustrator + GIF).
* 1 3d map: representing the orography of the terrain (mountains) with the 10 largest fires in Malaga and the location of 3 protected mountains (Mapbox and JavaScript).

In addition, a paper version of these visualizations was produced (link 4).","**Hypothesis:**
The 2022 fire season is the worst of the present century in Spain according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), but is it so in our region (Andalusia) and in our province (Malaga)?

**Valuable unused data:**
There was no official report compiling all forest fires from 1975 (first records) to 2022. But the Environmental Information Network of Andalusia did offer a dataset with the perimeter and basic data of all forest fires in Andalusia from 1975 to 2021 in GeoJSON format.
I did a data journalism work to edit and transform this dataset in order to have the conclusions of the report. In addition, I had to paint myself by hand in GeoJSON the perimeters of the Andalusian forest fires of the year 2022 using several official sources.

**Confirmation of the hypothesis?**
No, in Andalusia 2022 was not the worst year. But we do confirm the headline that, according to the data since records have been kept, Malaga is the second province of Andalusia most affected by forest fires.","Working in a small region (and newsroom) doesn't mean you can do big data-driven journalism.

The stories use government data to depict the continuous problem of high undertrial incarceration in India and the reasons for it.,"Both stories were republished by online new outlets in India and reached over 2,000 accounts on social media. The World Prison Brief maintained by Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research reposted one of the stories. By shining light on the the issue of incarceration of marginalised and oppressed communities the story exposes the issues that plague criminal justice in India.","The stories tried to visualize and show government and non governmental data on incarceration in India. We used Tabula, excel and Google sheets. The tools used were supplementary to the nuance that we brought through our reporting. Tabula was used to convert the tables from the Prison Statistics India report PDF file into excel format for analysis. The reports from previous years were used to compare the share of inmates who are undertrial, and the trend in demography and duration of incarceration of undertrials over the years. Further, data on undertrials which was retrieved from a legal clinic functioning in few prisons, was used to show the progress made in jails where the clinic functions.","Data on prisons are made available by the union government only once, in the end of the calendar year, as data are to be retrieved from state authorities. India does not have a dashboard for prison data. This leads to gaps in analysis and problems of transparency and accountability in the prison system. Often, organisations whose work specifically focuses on prisons and issues faced by incarcerated populations also suffer due to the delay. Reporting had to depend on data available, and primary data shared by organisations that were working with prisoners. But these were limited in geographical scope unlike government data, and may not necessarily be comparable. IndiaSpend is presently working on creating a database of undertrials across states.","The stories can help fellow journalist comprehend the context and circumstances that have created a large incarcerated population. The charts and visualisation make it easier to absorb the reality. It underscores the need for reforms in the criminal justice system. While the release of data by the government is delayed, the data is sufficient to show inequity in justice and barriers faced by poor communities in accessing a fair trial, receiving bail, and indefinite jail time.

United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Participant,,The Ransomware Game,2022-09-21,"Explainer, Quiz/game, Crime",Node.js,"Based on interviews with ransomware negotiators and websites hosted by hacking groups, the ransomware game puts readers in the middle of a cyber-attack and challenges them to minimise the impact on their business and avoid a crippling payout.","The game proved a hit with readers and 60% of people who started playing the game have made it to the end since its launch in September 2022.

It was popular on social media as well, with a Twitter moment used to amplify the story and the thread/moment combination receiving a lot more engagement than a typical FT post. Organically, many people shared their experiences or suggested tactics for dealing with a ransomware attack. The game was accompanied by an “FT Big Page” which appeared in the paper a few days after the game. 

Kurtis Minder, a prominent ransomware specialist interviewed for the project, is now using the game as part of his training to highlight the real-world implications of negotiating with hackers.","The ransomware simulation was built using React, made up of individual components that were shown and hidden based on their state. For the state management we used Redux — a way of storing the state in a centralised container that all components can refer back to.

The user choices, including whether to ultimately pay the ransomware attackings or not and asking for more time, were stored in a database via a POST request to a separate node API. This enabled us to have a customised final screen indicating what percentage of readers performed better or worse than you.

To ensure that the simulation was accessible, we worked with The Digital Accessibility Centre to ensure that screen readers were able to navigate through the simulation.","Ransomware attacks are not only booming, they are now big business. The number of ransomware attacks globally has more than tripled since 2019 and increasingly slick and professional groups focus on large-scale organisations as well as small companies. 

According to a report from cybersecurity firm Bitdefender, ransomware attacks increased by 485% in 2020 alone. It's estimated that around half of businesses end up paying. The Colonial oil pipeline network in the US, Apple, the NBA, hospitals, universities and even police forces have been attacked.

Ransomware attacks have been reported at length in the FT and given they target companies both big and small it is a topic our core readers — many of whom are business owners — will have an inherent interest in. 

How they work is less well known, with the companies targeted unwilling to admit they’ve paid a ransom and hackers keeping discussions private. Placing subscribers at the heart of the negotiations should prove engaging and enlightening.

Gamifying an attack also allowed us to teach readers what it would be like to experience an attack — and help them protect their business if they were evert unfortunate enough to have to deal with one in real life. 

One challenge we faced was on the design for the game: we wanted it to look and feel extremely similar to a real-life attack, but we were also aware of making it too realistic and potentially scaring readers. 

This led to one of the more interesting conversations we’ve had with our legal counsel, and what we ended up with was a mixture of the two — a realistic simulation that sits within the traditional Financial Times website furniture to subtly make clear that it is a game.","We spent a lot of time user testing the game – something that is always important when you are pushing the envelope and trying new formats for reporting.

It is also important to be thorough with your research before coming up with a finished product. This was a game that was built and based on conversations and leaked images, and it meant speaking to a broad range of people to understand how hackers communicate.

A more in-depth evaluation of projects that were financed throughout this process is needed in order to really show whether public interest was fulfilled or not. And this is actually the challenge because sometimes institutions are not willing to provide these projects according to which the media received funding to be evaluated. And finally, sustainability of the project is another challenge as this project needs to receive funding every year in order for data to be regularly updated. For the time being the donors recognize the value of this project and we hope it will continue in the future as well. More information about the project can be found at the following link for the publication that was published in May 2022 that refers to data until December 2021:https://www.osce.org/files/f/documents/a/4/476872_1.pdf","That using digital tools can be very helpful and that transparency and openess of not only data but of entire work can improve the web application we created on one side and initiate collaboration and ideas for the future on the other.

United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Participant,,All the Emperor’s men: How Xi Jinping became China's unrivalled leader,2022-10-18,"Explainer, Long-form, Infographics, Politics",Animation,"In October, ahead of his unprecedented appointment for a third team as leader, we produced a visual story explaining how Xi Jinping manipulates China’s political networks to cement his status as the country’s most powerful premier since Mao.

All the Emperor’s Men visualised the changing people in Xi’s orbit to outline the sway he has over Chinese politics, in the process revealing how Xi has centralised decision-making in his own hands, bulldozed opposing factions and stacked key positions with loyalists.","The project proved hugely engaging, with more than 65% of readers who started the story making it 100% of the way through the piece.

Readers comments were effusive, and one of the most recommended summed up exactly what we had hoped to achieve with the project:

_“This is such terrific reporting with helpful and compelling visuals. Thank you FT. Explaining the nuances of the CCP’s (Chinese Communist Party) system of governance is no easy feat, but I feel like I have an understanding now”._","This piece was built using React, made up of individual components for the various sections. The introduction to the piece was something that we tinkered with a lot; we knew we wanted a visual representation of Xi’s centrality to Chinese politics, and planets orbiting felt like the right visual metaphor.

This animation was achieved by using css keyframes. There were two animations needed: one to orbit the circles themselves and then another to “invert” the face within the circle so that it was always facing forwards.

The other technical challenge for the piece was how we would explain the Chinese Communist Party system and animate the circles to highlight different people for each slide. 

We used JavaScript to iterate through a data file and draw circles for each person. We then had a config file which explained, for each slide, which position that circle needed to be moved to and used CSS animations to transition the circles smoothly.","The FT wanted to explain the complex world of Chinese politics to a wider audience and dive into how Xi has effectively secured the position of premier for life.

Our Hong Kong-based Data Reporter Andy Lin utilised the [CCP elite biographical database](https://chinadatalab.ucsd.edu/resources/ccp-elites-database/) to help construct the political network of party members and the various factions that exist within it. 

Our greatest challenge was how we would explain how the 200+ central committee works as well as showcasing how the factions within the upper echelons of the party have evolved over time.

The combination of simple, informative text with clear visuals helped us explain the complex nature of the CCP in a simple way.","China continues to be a superpower on the world stage and explaining and covering the political landscape of the country is of the utmost importance. However, the opaque nature of the party system means that explaining how China chooses its leaders – and Xi’s role within that – is very difficult. 

But this story shows that visuals can be used to bring clarity to the subject, and it is a reminder that data-driven visual stories can be found in unusual places.For this we had a database of CCP members over time and a hundred headshots. But with the right editorial and visual approach, it was enough for us to create an informative project.

The fact that over two thirds of readers reached the end, which compares favourably to the average completion rate for an FT long-read, highlights how impactful data-driven and visually rich political reporting can be.",English,https://ig.ft.com/xi-jinping-emperors-men/,,,,,,,"Andy Lin, Edward White, Dan Clark, Caroline Nevitt and Sam Joiner.","Andy Lin reports Asia news stories using data analysis, graphics and statistics on the FT's visual and data journalism team.

Google Forms","WHRO Public Media, supported by the Pulitzer on Crisis Reporting, explored a common concern: Why is housing so expensive, and why can’t people access it?

WHRO used data from myriad sources on rent, home prices, mortgages, income and other indicators going back more than 60 years. 

Reporters gave the audience historical context by showing how the market ebbs and flows, and how it’s notably different now.

Reporters gave a face to the numbers with stories from residents looking for housing. The interviews confirmed what the numbers showed: It’s expensive to live here.","We made the data available to reporters around the state (https://bit.ly/cost-burdened) to investigate affordability and affordability factors in their own metro areas. We also invited other media outlets to republish our articles. For example, VPM, the public radio station in Richmond, shared the WHRO stories with its audience:

https://vpm.org/news/articles/37066/housing-in-hampton-roads-is-less-affordable-than-northern-virginia-other-pricey

Locally, we’ve been approached by some former municipal officials and advocacy groups interested in planning community events around the information we’ve found and the topic of housing affordability. 

The inaugural story had the highest Instagram engagement in October 2022 on WHRO’s account (5,666 reach and 436 reactions). Instagram is where we reach younger members of our audience, engaging irregular news consumers with local content that resonates with them

In the last three months of 2022, several of our data-driven articles about housing were among our top-read stories online. For instance, the introductory story (“Housing in Hampton Roads is less affordable than Northern Virginia” – https://whro.org/news/local-news/33139-housing-in-hampton-roads-is-less-affordable-than-northern-virginia-and-many-other-pricey-areas) logged 1,892 unique pageviews, with readers spending an average of 5:34 minutes on the page.

And using locality and pricing data, we published “In a small Eastern Shore community descended from slavery, a grassroots affordable housing model expands” – https://whro.org/news/local-news/33770-in-a-small-eastern-shore-community-descended-from-slavery-a-grassroots-affordable-housing-model-expands. It had 2,749 unique pageviews, with an average of 4:34 minutes spent on the page).","We compiled housing-related data from multiple sources (such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Zillow and Clear Capital) for multiple years (1960 through 2021) at multiple geographic levels (nationwide, states, metro areas, counties and cities). The statistics included housing prices, rents, mortgage payments, income and the proportion of residents who spent 30% or more of their income on housing (the definition of “cost-burdened,” according to the Census Bureau and other researchers).

In some cases, we were able to download and easily import the data; in other cases, we had to scrape it from websites or PDFs. We used OpenRefine to clean the data and Microsoft Access to join datasets for different years so that we could examine longitudinal trends. Most of our analysis was done with Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel.

We shared the data with all members of our reporting team with Google Sheets (https://bit.ly/cost-burdened). We also used Datawrapper to create visualizations (https://bit.ly/housing-vizes) that guided the reporting. We embedded many of these charts and maps in our published reports.

The WHRO newsroom used a Google Form to solicit first-person experiences of housing to gauge what issues people face and ensure diversity of sources, especially geographically. This feature was also open to people with questions or suggestions. The reporters relied on strong knowledge of the local community to source first-person stories as well.","From a data standpoint, we faced several challenges. For one thing, each year (and each geographic level) is a separate dataset. We needed data from seven decennial censuses (1960 through 2020) and from recent American Community Surveys. (The initial reporting was based on analysis of the 2020 ACS. But we timed the launch of our series with the release of the 2021 ACS so that it would reflect the most recent statistics available. After the Census Bureau released the 2021 ACS on Sept. 15, 2022, we updated all of our data analyses, visualizations and story drafts.)

Wrangling the census data alone required downloading more than 30 different datasets. The Census Bureau’s downloadable data bank contains the decennial censuses only since 2000. Older data is available from the bureau’s FTP site and from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan. The historical datasets were stored in various formats, including CSV files, ASCII Summary Tape Files and PDF books. Parsing the datasets required a range of strategies.

Joining data could be complicated because during the decades we examined, changes occurred in certain FIPS codes (the numerical designation the U.S. government assigns to each geographic unit), metro area definitions and boundaries, and even metro area names. (Hampton Roads is synonymous with the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA. However, the area previously was called the Norfolk-Virginia Beach-Newport News MSA – and before then, the Norfolk-Portsmouth MSA.)

In addition, we had to adjust historical information to current conditions, like record-setting inflation. Using the Consumer Price Index from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we presented all median household income values and median home values as 2022 dollars [https://bit.ly/cpi-adjusted-whro].

Another technological challenge involved WHRO’s website, which is in the early stages of a redesign and is currently not optimal for data and other multimedia presentations. Using third-party programs like Datawrapper allowed us to work around those limitations.

While reporting, we did run into some sources who felt concerned that speaking about their housing challenges would endanger their access to housing. This was especially noticeable when writing about cities that were displacing and destroying affordable units while approving large-scale market and luxury developments. That story required us to talk with people who lived in transient and temporary housing, so it was important to explain our process to those sources to make them more comfortable sharing their story.","Although data provided a foundation for our reporting, it’s crucial to keep the focus on people. That is especially true in radio because numbers are hard to convey over the air. We put human voices and faces to our data by finding people struggling to afford housing. And we showed how Hampton Roads compares to similar metro areas. That was validating for our readers, and it drove notable engagement, especially among audiences we don’t typically interact with.

Housing affordability is tricky to measure because it involves two factors: not only the cost of housing but also the level of income. In the Washington, D.C., metro area, for example, home prices and rents are high – but so are salaries; as a result, about 31% of the households there spend 30% or more of their income on housing (the definition of “cost-burdened”). In Hampton Roads, home prices and rents are lower than in the D.C. area – but salaries are, too. And so 34% of the households in Hampton Roads spend 30% or more of their income on housing.

We used comparisons readers can easily relate to – such as the ratio between median salaries and median housing prices over time. The story “First-Time Homebuyers In Virginia Face Rising Prices And Fierce Competition” [https://vcij.org/stories/scrimp-scroll-square-off-first-time-homebuyers-in-virginia-face-rising-prices-and-fierce-competition] noted:

It’s not just a gut feeling from first-time home buyers that it’s harder than ever to buy a house — in many ways, it’s much tougher than their parents and grandparents had it. 

Consider the relation of home prices and household income over three generations. In 1960, the median home value in Virginia was roughly twice a household’s annual income. Today, home prices are more than four times what a family earns in a year.",English,https://whro.org/news/local-news/33139-housing-in-hampton-roads-is-less-affordable-than-northern-virginia-and-many-other-pricey-areas,https://whro.org/news/local-news/33171-analyzing-hampton-roads-affordability-a-conversation-with-journalist-jeff-south,https://vcij.org/stories/scrimp-scroll-square-off-first-time-homebuyers-in-virginia-face-rising-prices-and-fierce-competition,https://whro.org/news/local-news/33370-hotline,https://whro.org/news/local-news/33770-in-a-small-eastern-shore-community-descended-from-slavery-a-grassroots-affordable-housing-model-expands,https://whro.org/news/local-news/33367-most-of-us-in-hampton-roads-rent-our-homes-but-we-still-want-the-american-dream-of-owning,https://whro.org/news/local-news/34799-how-williamsburg-plans-to-get-more-affordable-housing,"Ryan Murphy, Louis Hansen, Mechelle Hankerson, Katherine Hafner, Jeff South, Cameron Houck, Chris Tyree","WHRO Journalism is a three-year-old newsroom at WHRO Public Media, an NPR member station in Hampton Roads, Virginia.

A reportagem cruza dados obtidos por Lei de Acesso à Informação e extraídos de plataforma aberta do Ministério da Saúde e revela que o índice de mortes evitáveis na infância entre os Yanomami é 13 vezes maior do que a média nacional. Além disso, são destrinchados os motivos por trás dessa realidade.","O levantamento traz dados exclusivos que mostram a extensão da crise na saúde no território Yanomami. Por isso, a reportagem foi repercutida por organizações como Survival International e o Centro de Trabalho Indigenista, e por outros veículos brasileiros, como Hora do Povo, Diário do Pará e Carta Campinas. A reportagem também foi republicada por 18 sites, como Revista Galileu, Jornal do Brasil, Carta Capital e Roraima1.","Utilizamos o TabNet, plataforma do Ministério da Saúde que permite extração de dados públicos de saúde, e o Google Sheets. No TabNet, foram extraídos dados de mortes por causas evitáveis (categorização feita pelo Ministério da Saúde) de crianças de 0 a 4 anos, entre 2019 e 2020, a nível nacional. Paralelamente a isso, trabalhou-se a lista total de óbitos de crianças yanomami nessa faixa etária entre 2019 e 2021. Na planilha obtida via Lei de Acesso à Informação, cada linha representava um óbito e havia dados sobre ano e causa (código CID-10) da morte. Utilizando a tabela dinâmica, foram selecionados todos os óbitos que se enquadravam como causas evitáveis pelo código CID-10. Posteriormente, foram comparados as taxas por 100 mil habitantes a nível nacional e no território Yanomami, além de comparadas taxas específicas para causas de óbito recorrentes na Terra Indígena, como malária, desnutrição, pneumonia e diarreia.
Além disso, a reportagem também obteve dados sobre casos de desnutrição no território indígena, que foram igualmente trabalhados no Google Sheets.
Para formulação do mapa foi utilizado o QGIs e ferramentas de edição de imagem, que também foram usadas na formulação do infográfico produzido para visualização dos dados levantados pela reportagem.","A Terra Indígena Yanomami vive uma tragédia humanitária sem precedentes, com disseminação generalizada de malária (há mais casos da doença do que habitantes no território) e taxas de desnutrição e de óbitos por causas evitáveis em níveis somente comparáveis aos da África Subsaariana. Os motivos para esse cenário trágico são essencialmente dois: o garimpo e a ausência, a corrupção e a omissão estatal, especialmente durante o governo Bolsonaro.

Há cerca de 20 mil garimpeiros ilegais invadindo o território Yanomami. Além de destruir a floresta, contaminar rios com mercúrio e afugentar caças, a presença garimpeira também é responsável pela desestruturação do modo de vida do povo Yanomami e da disseminação de doenças infectocontagiosas para as quais os indígenas não têm anticorpos.

Simultaneamente, o gigantesco território Yanomami, boa parte dele acessível apenas por via área, é atendido por uma quantidade irrisória de postos e profissionais de saúde, com muitos indígenas passando anos sem receber assistência médica. Há falta e desvio de medicamentos, ausência de saneamento básico e de condições sanitárias mínimas, além de péssimas condições educacionais e de desenvolvimento socioeconômico. 

Para além disso, não há nenhuma divulgação pública de dados sobre a saúde Yanomami, que só foram obtidos e divulgados de maneira inédita pela reportagem graças ao uso da Lei de Acesso à Informação.","A reportagem utiliza-se do conceito de “mortes por causas evitáveis”, que raríssimas vezes aparece na imprensa nacional e que pode ser utilizado como parâmetro relevante na comparação entre diferentes cenários no âmbito da saúde.

Segundo apuração da reportagem, a destruição está concentrada no entorno de importantes rodovias federais, em especial a BR-163. Além de revelar quais são as UCs mais visadas e os motivos para ela estarem no foco dos grandes desmatadores, a matéria também revela quem são os maiores multados pelo órgão ambiental.","A reportagem traz informações concretas sobre um assunto geralmente tratado de forma abstrata: as pessoas e empresas diretamente envolvidas na destruição de áreas destinadas à proteção da Amazônia, entre elas políticos regionais e aliados, infratores com vasta ficha de acusações criminais, além de grandes empresas. O levantamento revela quais são as Unidades de Conservação mais afetadas e os tipos de infrações ambientais mais frequentes, importantes dados para guiar políticas públicas que busquem coibir esses crimes, além de outras investigações jornalísticas.

A reportagem foi republicada por 19 veículos brasileiros, como UOL, Revista Galileu e EcoDebate. Ela também foi repercutida pelo boletim do Instituto ClimaInfo, organização especializada no debate sobre mudanças climáticas, e pelo boletim do Instituto Socioambiental. O trabalho foi citado, ainda, em uma série de reportagens do The Intercept Brasil sobre como grileiros o estado para se apropriar de terras públicas na Amazônia.","Os dados que fundamentam a reportagem foram obtidos pela agência Fiquem Sabendo após longa batalha junto aos órgãos brasileiros que promovem o acesso à informação. A reportagem da Agência Pública foi a primeira a utilizar de maneira profunda o material obtido. Baixamos as bases de dados sobre multas aplicadas pelo ICMBio entre 2009 e 2021, obtidas pela agência Fiquem Sabendo por meio da Lei de Acesso à Informação. Padronizamos as bases de autuações eletrônicas e em papel disponibilizadas pelo ICMBio e selecionamos as variáveis de interesse para análise no software RStudio. Após juntarmos as bases, partimos para a elaboração dos chamados resumos agrupados - buscamos agrupar informações a partir de uma variável de interesse. Hierarquizamos, por exemplo, os infratores com maior número de autuações no período coberto pela base de dados. Verificamos também quais infratores possuíam o maior valor de multas no período, já que o valor das multas é um indicativo da gravidade da infração ambiental. Também fizemos um ranking das Unidades de Conservação com maior concentração de multas no período coberto pela base e nos anos do governo Bolsonaro. Com esses resumos agrupados em mãos, partimos para a busca de processos judiciais e registros dos históricos dos infratores, procuramos os citados para darem suas versões e formulamos um quadro interessante sobre os maiores infratores nas UCs da Amazônia. A reportagem também utiliza-se de infográficos interativos para apresentar alguns dos principais dados obtidos.","O desmatamento e a destruição dos biomas brasileiros, em especial da Amazônia, esteve presente em todos os governos, antes e depois da redemocratização do Brasil. Em nenhum deles, porém, houve um incentivo tão descarado e institucionalizado para que todo tipo de criminoso ambiental atuasse à revelia da lei como durante o governo de Jair Bolsonaro. No mesmo sentido, nunca houve tantos esforços concentrados para enfraquecer e minar a atuação de órgãos públicos de fiscalização, como o ICMBio. No governo Bolsonaro, pautar a destruição da Amazônia é assunto obrigatório, e a reportagem “Quem está destruindo as unidades de conservação da Amazônia” cumpre esse papel, revelando não só onde estão os focos da destruição, mas também dando nome aos bois, a partir de dados inéditos.

A reportagem gerou duas suítes, uma delas, publicada conjuntamente, mostra quais são as empresas mais multadas pelo ICMBio (link número 2); outra, publicada meses depois, revela quem está por trás da destruição das Unidades de Conservação do Cerrado (link número 3), um dos biomas mais ameaçados do Brasil, mas que geralmente recebe menos cobertura que a Amazônia.","Investigar as unidades de conservação, sua administração, as infrações e os infratores ambientais que avançam sobre elas abre várias possibilidades de pautas, que ainda não são propriamente exploradas pelo jornalismo. A série de reportagens feitas pela Agência Pública com base nos dados obtidos pela Fiquem Sabendo também mostram a relevância do uso da Lei de Acesso à Informação e do monitoramento sistemático de bases de dados abertas por projetos como o Fiquem Sabendo. As reportagens também mostram a importância de ir além dos dados, já que são baseadas não só nos números da destruição, mas na investigação dos CNPJs, CPFs e nomes por trás das infrações ambientais, assim como o contexto em que elas ocorrem.",Portuguese,https://apublica.org/2022/03/quem-esta-destruindo-as-unidades-de-conservacao-da-amazonia/,https://apublica.org/2022/03/as-empresas-mais-multadas-nas-unidades-de-conservacao-da-amazonia/,https://apublica.org/2022/08/quem-esta-destruindo-as-unidades-de-conservacao-do-cerrado/,,,,,"Rafael Oliveira, Ciro Barros, Bianca Muniz, Thiago Domenici","Fundada em 2011 por repórteres mulheres, a Pública é a primeira agência de jornalismo investigativo sem fins lucrativos do Brasil.

A partir da extração e análise de dados geográficos, a reportagem revela quais são os territórios e povos indígenas mais afetados pela medida. A reportagem é uma atualização de matéria publicada em 2020 e que venceu o “All Eyes on the Amazon” Data Journalism Contest em 2021.","Esse trabalho mostra as consequências de uma medida implementada no início governo de Jair Bolsonaro nos territórios indígenas e os impactos para os povos que ali habitam, acompanhando a evolução da situação ao longo do mandato. Os dados da reportagem foram usados no relatório ""Violência Contra os Povos Indígenas no Brasil - Dados de 2021"", realizado pelo Conselho Indigenista Missionário (Cimi), denunciando a grave situação vivenciada pelos povos indígenas no Brasil. A reportagem também foi citada em artigo publicado no Le Monde Diplomatique Brasil por coordenadores do Cimi sobre o lançamento deste mesmo relatório e repercutida no site da Articulação dos Povos Indígenas do Brasil. O levantamento foi republicado por 27 sites de notícia brasileiros, como Jornal do Brasil, Brasil de Fato e Revista Galileu. Também foi citado em um artigo de checagem de fatos da Deutsche Welle.","Utilizamos ferramentas de mapeamento geográfico para localizar todas as áreas de fazendas certificadas e de terras indígenas, a partir de bancos de dados públicos da Fundação Nacional dos Povos Indígenas (Funai) e do Instituto Nacional de Colonização e Reforma Agrária (Incra). A partir daí, cruzamos as áreas para identificar sobreposições, utilizando o software QGIS. O resultado foi analisado e tratado com o Google Sheets para conferir as sobreposições, calcular áreas e identificar datas das certificações.","O governo de Jair Bolsonaro, terminado em 31 de dezembro de 2022, foi um governo essencialmente anti-indígena e antiambiental. Na mesma época em que a Instrução Normativa Nº 9 foi publicada, o então ministro do Meio Ambiente, Ricardo Salles, falou em uma reunião ministerial que a pandemia de Covid-19 era uma oportunidade de o Governo Federal “passar a boiada”, aprovando medidas diversas infralegais que flexibilizassem a legislação socioambiental do país. 
A medida da Funai surge dentro desse contexto de enfraquecimento das leis, de ataques políticos e de violência física e territorial contra os territórios indígenas do país. O governo de Bolsonaro paralisou completamente a demarcação de terras indígenas e passou a desconsiderar as centenas de territórios que não tiveram seus processos demarcatórios concluídos pelo Estado brasileiro, expondo milhares de indígenas aos interesses e à violência de fazendeiros, madeireiros, garimpeiros e outras categorias que historicamente disputam áreas com os povos indígenas. 
A reportagem permite ter uma dimensão do impacto prático que a Instrução Normativa em questão teve nos povos indígenas, sob um aspecto discursivo, no diálogo com os afetados, mas especialmente num aspecto territorial, a partir do cruzamento de dados e da apresentação quantitativa de áreas afetadas.","A reportagem combina o acompanhamento de atos infralegais do governo com a extração e análise criteriosa de dados geográficos e com a escuta de povos indígenas diretamente afetados por medidas estatais. Nesse sentido, pode servir de inspiração para análises de dados semelhantes e também serve para ressaltar a relevância de dar dimensão humana às reportagens guiadas por dados, que não podem se limitar aos números e mapas.",Portuguese,https://apublica.org/2022/07/governo-bolsonaro-certificou-239-mil-hectares-de-fazendas-dentro-de-areas-indigenas/,https://cimi.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/relatorio-violencia-povos-indigenas-2021-cimi.pdf,https://diplomatique.org.br/sob-bolsonaro-a-violencia-contra-os-povos-indigenas-foi-naturalizada/,,https://www.dw.com/de/faktencheck-was-tut-pr%C3%A4sident-bolsonaro-f%C3%BCr-brasiliens-indigene/a-62984264,,,"Bruno Fonseca, Caio de Freitas Paes, Rafael Oliveira, Paula Bianchi","Fundada em 2011 por repórteres mulheres, a Agência Pública é a primeira agência de jornalismo investigativo sem fins lucrativos do Brasil.

United States,Bloomberg News,Big,Participant,,Twitter’s Fact-Checking System Has a Major Blind Spot: Anything Divisive,2022-12-19,"Investigation, Fact-checking, Chart","Animation, AI/Machine learning, D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Python, Node.js, JavaScript
Svelte","This in-depth investigation is of Twitter’s fact-checking system called Community Notes (formerly known as Birdwatch). Musk claimed it to be “a game changer for improving accuracy on Twitter.” By analyzing more than 40,000 notes, parsing the algorithm itself, and talking to current and former Twitter engineers, Bloomberg found major limitations and fundamental flaws in the system. Twitter’s algorithm looks for broad consensus from “both sides” of the ideology spectrum. As a result, the algorithm tosses out 96% of all fact-checking notes and leaves the vast majority of inaccurate tweets—especially on the most divisive topics such as abortion, Covid-19 and elections—unaddressed.","This timely piece following Elon's controversial takeover of Twitter and the Community Notes program’s public launch provided crucial context for a new fact-checking technology that could potentially impact millions of Twitter users around the world. It reached a wide audience and was included in many influential newsletters, including the Nieman Lab.","We conducted data cleaning and analysis in Python with knowledge in statistics and machine learning, especially on matrix factorization. 

The Community Notes algorithm places users along an opinion spectrum, which generally aligns with the political left and right, based on their voting history. However, Twitter does not publish these measurements. We extracted these hidden metrics by running the public data through Twitter’s algorithm, which has been made public on GitHub.

Community Notes’ public data also does not include any information about the tweets themselves and tweet authors (handles) associated with each note. We obtained such additional data through the publicly available Twitter API and matched them back to the Community Notes.

We validated our results with current and former Twitter engineers, as well as results in Twitter's own research paper.

Because many readers would not be familiar with how Community Notes work, we framed the story’s narrative around examples that illustrated our findings. The first interactive scrolling example of Musk’s tweet stepped readers through how Community Notes work. A simple, stacked histogram shows the breakdown of data. In our graphics presentation we repeated chart forms to help readers understand the topic without having to learn new visual forms all the time. After showing more findings through examples, we included a second, more in-depth scrolling section to explain the larger dataset and findings. The visuals aid readers in understanding how the algorithm works and its limitations.

The graphics were developed using JavaScript and specifically Svelte, supported by front-end development and design work. Sketches were initially made in Adobe Illustrator, to plan out the flow of the graphics. Svelte was used to build scrolling interactive sections, with D3.js used for the charts. CSS animations make the transitions and animations flow easier.","●Since taking over the company in late October, Elon has revoked Twitter’s policy about fact-checking Covid misinformation, dissolved the company’s Trust and Safety council, and fired thousands of employees, including staff responsible for tracking dangerous or inaccurate posts.
●Research has found misinformation spiked after Elon took over & traditional fact-checkers were fired.
●Leaders from the EU and other parts of the world have issued warnings about misinformation on Twitter following Musk’s takeover. 
●Elon Musk has repeatedly touted Community Notes as “a game changer” that would make Twitter “the most accurate source of information about the world.”
●Twitter is rapidly expanding the Community Notes program around the world.","1.Augment/match public data with additional API data and make connections

United States,Bloomberg News,Big,Participant,,Hidden Fentanyl Is Driving a Fatal New Phase in US Opioid Epidemic,2022-12-13,"Investigation, Database, Crowdsourcing, Illustration, Infographics, Map, Health","Animation, Scraping, D3.js, Canvas, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Node.js, Svelte","This data-driven investigation sheds light on the devastating consequences that the rise of the synthetic opioid fentanyl has caused for US society. Since 2000, more than half a million Americans have died from opioid overdose. The majority of these deaths have occurred relatively recently, as the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to circumstances that led fentanyl use to spiral out of control. Through an analysis of 20 years of CDC data and interviews with local officials and advocates in Volusia, Florida, this article illustrates how the pandemic and fentanyl were twin forces that transformed the opioid epidemic into a nationwide fentanyl crisis.","Extensive reporting, data analysis and visual storytelling shed light into the rise of fentanyl in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Shortly after publication, Florida senator Rick Scott held a roundtable discussion about fentanyl in Volusia County that included representatives from the Volusia Recovery Alliance as well as the sheriff’s office who were highlighted in our story. The Volusia sheriff’s department was also featured in a TV segment on NewsNation to talk about the issue because of our story. 

In addition to illustrating the temporal and geographical distribution of deaths caused by fentanyl, the story highlighted new alarming trends such as the recent demographic shifts in who opioids kill. Historically, opioid overdoses were killing mostly White Americans, but now Black Americans are dying from opioids at much higher rates than other races. Death rates among other minority groups also grew disproportionately during the pandemic.","We did an extensive study into the CDC’s epidemiologic research data portal, CDC WONDER, and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) standards to understand how causes of death are identified, categorized and reported. Using Python, we sliced opioid overdose-involved deaths by demographic and geographic variables and landed on a precise ICD code combination, spelled out in our methodology section, to analyze opioid overdose death trends and the relative lethality of the drugs within this class.

The entire reporting process was guided by the findings from our data analysis. Volusia County, Florida, a semi-urban coastal region that wouldn’t be a traditional place of choice for a drug overdose story, was a standout when we compared changes in US counties’ fentanyl death rates. 

We combined cutting-edge technologies and data visualization techniques to develop a series of engaging interactive graphics using Svelte and D3.js. 

An important objective was to prompt the reader with a strong sense of urgency about the human and societal tolls of fentanyl. We sought to accurately represent the scale and somber nature of the problem, while at the same time humanizing each data-point. For example, the stacked time-series of “Deepening Crisis of Opioid Deaths in the US” is meant to evoke a sense of mortality – the rows of reddish-hued dots drip down the page like blood dripping from a wound. In stacking thousands of circles on top of one another and allowing the graphic to overflow outside of the screen’s lower boundary, the graphic strives to represent the actual people that died of fentanyl overdose in a more tangible way than a bar or line could accomplish. This task required the visualizing large amounts of data in the browser by leveraging technologies not traditionally used for data-visualization, such as the use of html canvas elements to render graphics.","Throughout the reporting process, we ran into many issues involving data accuracy, which is an inherent challenge when journalists work on illicit drug-related subjects, but this particular one showed that there’s a lack of accountability in the government system in tackling drug overdose as a national crisis.

The data request for hospitalization data placed to Florida’s governmental health agency went on for more than three months. We were redirected a couple times but remained in active correspondence for weeks. However, the first versions of data provided by the government were completely wrong. We had to persistently follow up and guide the agency to pull accurate data. During the process, we also learned that fentanyl wasn't tracked as a cause for emergency room visits in Florida until after 2020. This discovery confirmed our assumption that fentanyl’s impact had been overlooked at the local level and policy makers were reacting with a delay.

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency within the US Department of Health & Human Services, is tasked with surveying and tracking the number of people using opioids in the US and reports annual data. Yet, when we were interviewing the agency, a spokesman informed us that their publicly disclosed data for recent years was inaccurate and shouldn't be used for analysis. This makes us question the agency's effort to carry out its mandate. We also pressed the administration to provide spending data on overdose prevention, but such data were said to be non-existent – making it apparent that there is much to be done to improve accountability around efforts to reverse the trend.","Often the data that makes it into the final version of a story is only the tip of the iceberg of data that was collected, considered, and sifted through in order to contextualize the landscape surrounding an issue. The CDC WONDER data used extensively in the story proved the most complete and reliable data source available, though countless versions of the data with temporal, geographic, demographic and ICD-subset splits were considered in the process of understanding the opioid epidemic from a data perspective. 

Many other pieces of data – federal, state and local – were examined in an effort to piece together the social, economic and law enforcement consequences of the opioid epidemic in Florida and beyond. Some of this data was readily available but most of it required elaborate data requests and correspondence. 

In some cases we learned there was no data available to answer questions we’d hoped to consider. Both policy makers and civilian advocates are operating without a full understanding of this deadly epidemic’s landscape. Sometimes there are insights to be gleaned from what data isn’t available as compared to what is reliably collected.

We came to realize that persistently asking and pursuing data-related questions is how journalists could help the government and industry players to better improve their data efforts. Data issues at government agencies may surface; sometimes there is an underlying issue but other times it may not be intentional. We learned to expect that mistakes in data collection and reporting could happen, and many problems and errors could be resolved through communication and education. We are also contributing by pointing out the mistakes and helping the government further improve data accuracy and transparency.",English,https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-us-fentanyl-opioid-deaths/,,,,,,,"Reporting by Emma Court

United States,Bloomberg News,Big,Participant,,How Xi Rewrote China’s Rulebook to Build the Party Around Himself,2022-10-11,"Investigation, Explainer, Database, Infographics","Animation, D3.js, Three.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, R, Python, Svelte
Javascript
WebGL
GSAP","A Bloomberg News analysis of appointments to the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee since 1992 — almost 1,300 in total — shows how President Xi Jinping has consolidated his own power while stacking the body with loyalists.","The analysis and findings are some of the most comprehensive reporting done in illuminating the efforts Xi Jinping has undertaken to restructure the Communist Party and augment his own authority. The project was published ahead of the twice-a-decade National Party Congress, generating conversations and discussions amongst China watchers and on social media.","To build this database of top Chinese politicians, Bloomberg reporters combined, cross checked and fact checked data across multiple databases, state-run media reports, and other sources.

With this exclusive database, we used R and Python to analyze the data and to detect pattern changes. To explain our findings to readers, we produced interactive graphics to show how different Xi compared to his predecessors and how he has promoted loyalists to key positions and built the party around himself. 

To help readers who don’t know much about Chinese politics better understand the most important group of politicians in the country, we built an animated visualization of the “party universe” — starting with Xi Jinping in its center. It then transitions into a layered structure, illustrating the hierarchy of China’s Central Committee. We used Svelte, JavaScript, its WebGL library Three.js, and the animation library GSAP to build this scrolling interaction..

To show how the composition of this elite group has changed, we used Svelte Scroller and Svelte’s reactive canvas rendering capability in another scrolling section to walk readers through the history. These techniques allow us to show hundreds of animated dots smoothly even when readers scroll fast.

The story also explores the career paths of the party’s political superstars. We used the visual metaphor of the career ladder to show how they climb the ranks. After preprocessing data with R, we uploaded it to Observable notebook to generate the skeleton of the ladder charts with D3.js. We then downloaded charts as SVGs and styled them in Illustrator. This workflow allows us to quickly create diagrams when new appointments are added to our database, while also allowing flexibility to accommodate individual annotations showing their unique ties with Xi.","With China’s Party Congress approaching and China Watchers talking about Xi Jinping’s potential third term, Bloomberg reporters wanted to explain, through data and hard evidence, how Xi has been rewriting the Party’s rulebook and rebuilding this party universe with his loyalists during his 10 years in power.

But there was no single database that gave us complete career milestones and personal information for all members of the Center Committee of the Chinese Communist Party since 1992. So Bloomberg News compiled its own exclusive database with ages and career information for the party’s top leaders.

Xi is known for not shying away from promoting his longtime friends and ex-colleagues to important roles. So we cross-checked multiple sources and compiled a spreadsheet detailing how Xi and his loyalists’ paths overlapped in each year since 1969. We present this information in the ladder charts to help readers contextualize top politicians’ career progressions.","The key to this project’s success is simple: it is the dedication to factual reporting. It’s not about scripting data or getting information in creative ways. It is a group of reporters going through databases, documents and media reports manually, collecting information in a spreadsheet and fact checking. It is the patient legwork of investigative journalism.

For journalists who cover countries that don’t have great data transparency, building your own database from various sources, akin to what we did in this project, creates lots of opportunities and leads to various stories. Bloomberg reporters generated multiple story ideas from the same database. It allowed us to extract historical context faster than other newsrooms when new members of the Central Committee were appointed.

United Kingdom,The New Statesman,Big,Participant,,Mapping Putin's war on civilians,2022-03-16,"Long-form, OSINT, Map, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, OpenStreetMap",Ordinary Ukrainians have borne the brunt of Russia's invasion. We mapped out every Russian attack on civilians in the early months of the war. Each dot represents an attack on civilians or civilian infrastructure verified by the Centre for Information Resilience.,"Working with investigators from the Centre of Information Resilience and Bellingcat, we used their verified data on incidents and developments in Ukraine to map out attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure and track potential war crime incidents in the first month of the war. Ours was one of the first data journalism pieces to visualise, in a multimedia piece, Russia’s indiscriminate attacks on civilians.

We spoke to Ukrainians dealing with the consequences on the ground, risking their lives to document these atrocities, and to OSINT analysts about how gathering information on attacks can help war crimes investigations. As a result, the piece was also a very early contribution to the debate around whether Putin can be held legally accountable.","The data from this visualisation comes from the Centre for Information Resilience’s Eyes on Russia Project. Using their database of verified Russian attacks, we examined all incidents involving civilian casualties. We also categorised these attacks ourselves, finding that the database included 22 attacks on nurseries, schools and universities; 11 on malls and markets; 10 on medical facilities; and 8 on religious institutions. After identifying which attacks to highlight to tell the story, we used StoryMapJS to make an interactive, scrollable map.","The Eyes on Russia database consists of verified open-source information, which means there could be multiple verified sources for the same attack. To identify individual incidents, we manually reviewed each of the sources. At the same time, we also had to decide which images and videos we could not include in the visualisation due to the graphic content.

We decided to include a selection of images and videos in the visualisation to show readers the devastation these attacks cause and the impact of the war on ordinary civilians. We blurred several of the images ourselves when we judged that the contents were too graphic.","Because we worked together with OSINT analysts and organisations, we were able to provide accurate, verified information at a time of rampant misinformation around the war. It also allowed us to create and publish the project within a short time frame while including the latest developments and changes. It also highlights how social media and OSINT analysis can play a role in war crime investigations.",English,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/ukraine/2022/03/mapping-putins-war-on-civilians,,,,,,,"Ben van der Merwe, Isabeau van Halm","Ben van der Merwe is a data journalist at Sky News, formerly the New Statesman.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Participant,,"Gender stereotypes in children's fashion: Hot pants for girls, shorts for boys",2022-07-22,"Infographics, Chart, Culture, Women","Scraping, CSV, R, RStudio, Python","How gendered is the clothing offer for children and what does this mean for the kids? For our data analysis, we examined 20,000 shirts and shorts from 
H&M, Zalando and About You that they offer online for children under 10. The results show: Current children's fashion cements gender images. According to prints, boys should surf and girls should dream. And on average, a pair of 30cm-wide shorts for girls is six cm shorter than boys' trousers. This data journalism project is about more than colours and cuts, it's about whole worlds that are withheld from some and imposed on others.","The reactions were overwhelming. The piece is behind the paywall and led to an unusually high number of subscriptions. In the social networks, where we published the key findings including data visualizations in threads also in English, the analysis was strongly received, liked, shared and discussed. One of the English Twitter threads now has over 8,000 likes. Domestic and foreign media interviewed our analysis team and podcasts picked up our findings. We also know of at least three adaptations by french, norwegian and swiss journalists. Excitingly, analysts from Zalando contacted us and asked about our methods because they wanted to evaluate how gender stereotypical their site is.","For the analyses and charts, the team programmed in R and used machine learning models from Google Cloud Vision. 

Trouser length: Since the dimensions of the pants on offer were not specified across the board, we calculated the length-to-width ratio from the product images. To do this, these were first converted into silhouettes, from which outlines could then be extracted. The sample consists of 1700 pants for girls and 2106 pants for boys. For the graphical representation, the outlines were set to the same width and the trouser cuffs were superimposed. The middle pair of pants highlighted in the graphs is the one with the median length-to-width ratio. All steps were done in R.

Colors: To find out how the colors of shirts offered for girls and boys differ, we evaluated more than 17,000 product images for their dominant colors using machine learning models from Google Cloud Vision. The ten colors most dominating the product image were then mapped with R to a color palette of 139 colors of the main colors. For the treemaps, the occurrence of colors was summed by gender: If a color occurs more frequently as a dominant color, it occupies a larger area on the visualization.

It was difficult to collect the patterns and details on shirts. For an overview, we used a pattern recognition algorithm from the Google Cloud Vision API. But because this is quite unspecific, for example only outputs ""vertebrate"" and not ""dog"" or ""cat"", we rely more on the information provided by the retailers for details and motifs.

Slogans: In order to find out which terms distinguish boys' and girls' clothing, the word clouds focus on so-called distinctive terms we calculated in R: terms that occur particularly frequently in one gender and (almost) not at all in the other gender.","The topic of stereotypes in children's clothing - especially with regard to color selection - is basically not a new one, but one that is always current. Those of us who have children have had the feeling: the gender division in clothing brands like H&M is stronger than ever, despite the gender debate, although we actually know better and role thinking should no longer be as strongly anchored in society as it was 50 years ago. This summer, we were also particularly struck by the fact that shorts are worn much more short by young girls than by boys of the same age. And this at a time when the LGTBQ movement is being accused of early sexualization of children. With our methods, we data journalists can reflect or prove a perceived truth with data. We wanted to verify our impression with data journalistic methods and feed the debate with numbers. We wanted to know: Is it not just individual taste, but are parents of and very young children already being purposefully steered into stereotypes by the pre-sorted offer according to gender? And what does that do to the children? 
This has never been analyzed so systematically, there are no databases on cuts and colors of children's fashion. That's why we collected the data ourselves. One particular aspect of the analysis was the comparison of short lengths, for which we worked with product images and outline analysis techniques.",The project and its audience success show what an important part data journalists play in verifying perceived truths and providing facts to ongoing debates.,German,https://www.sueddeutsche.de/projekte/artikel/gesellschaft/gegenderte-kindermode-rosa-hotpants-blaue-shorts-e701993/,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fjqn2nCuGXwqbxu3evTcDMqdRAfq3-l4/view?usp=sharing,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edbTRJf1fcZpvzPdkHya5oi-t5c70ME9/view?usp=sharing,https://twitter.com/datentaeterin/status/1561663581694922753,https://www.instagram.com/p/CmbYvfhNQZ9/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=,,,"Berit Kruse, Natalie Sablowski, Marie-Louise Timcke, Barbara Vorsamer",The data journalism team at Süddeutsche Zeitung consists of programming journalists who work together with editors from other departments and colleagues from the visual desk for their research and projects.

Around the world, people are suffering as a result. Millions risk starvation. Yet many governments, having borrowed heavily during the pandemic and with interest rates rising, appear unwilling or unable to cushion the blow. What does this portend for political violence and unrest? Can statistical modelling help us understand what to expect - and where?","Shortly after the articles in which the project was featured were published we were asked to share our methods and approach with the United Nations, which we did, in what Sondre Ulvund Solstad (the data journalist) was instructed to call “a high-level discussion at UNHQ”. The discussion centred on how the UN, which had been inspired by the journalist work, could use these methods to better understand and predict unrest, and how they could set up their own system to do so. Sondre also gave subsequent talks in response to requests and wide interest from academia and industry. Beyond this enthusiastic response, the main article featuring this project reached a wide audience by our standards (and was featured as a “fly” on the cover of our world-wide print edition). The project was also the basis for an editorial article (or ""leader"" - link 2 below), calling for and specifying policies to help more food and money reach those who need it.","The data journalism project consisted of three parts. First, original data collection and number crunching to contextualize the problem effectively in our journalism. Second, the construction of a vast dataset, with information including factors such as daily brent crude prices, inflation, unemployment, economic forecasts, government debt levels and revenues, countries' demographic profiles, expected food prices and imports, and a corresponding set of data on unrest in different countries around the world based on data from ACLED. Third, careful modelling work. This involved attempting to understand precisely what we can - and cannot - learn from such data, and then, having established it was possible, using a machine learning method (gradient boosted trees) to build a model to estimate expected increases or decreases in unrest in countries around the world in the coming year.","Just one thing: We were unfortunately was unable to share source and data used in the project due to data rights issues.

Beyond that, the hardest part of this project was figuring out what we could and could not learn from the data. To be concrete: in a situation with a lot of unrest data, it might for instance be tempting to try to predict where there will be most or least unrest.

United Kingdom,Unearthed,Small,Participant,,England’s protected peatlands burned for sport,2022-05-30,"Investigation, Video, Map, Satellite images, Politics, Environment","Drone, Microsoft Excel","In 2021, with the UK set to host the landmark Glasgow climate summit, we started investigating the burning of England’s peatlands, a rare habitat of international importance and the country’s biggest natural carbon store. Rich landowners set the fires to encourage growth of fresh heather to feed grouse, birds that are hunted for sport. The government introduced a partial ban in the run-up to the summit, but it was criticised for being weak, unscientific and hard to enforce. We created a groundbreaking investigative methodology, combining spatial analysis, remote sensing, and eyewitness reports to document the continued burning of protected moorlands.","As well as on our news site, the investigation was published on BBC News: on radio bulletins throughout the day (including three times on their flagship news programme Today and on Farming Today), online, on their app and on TV – on segments on the 1pm and 6pm news, including an interview with Unearthed’s lead reporter on the story. This led to a raft of stories in print newspapers – including a page lead in the Times as well as in the Telegraph, the i and the Mail. Online, it was covered by The Mail, the Independent and the Evening Standard. The New York Times promoted the Unearthed story in their Climate Forward newsletter and the Global Investigative Journalism network also published an article on it. 

We submitted our evidence to the government agency Natural England, prompting them to launch an investigation, which is still ongoing. 

There was a lot of interest in the mapping platform itself. The BBC showcased the platform on the national news and interviewed our reporter about it. Campaigners, journalists and scientists noted that the publicity of the technology itself would act as a deterrent to landowners thinking of burning on their land. 

Scientists of international renown reviewed and commented on our methodology. 

Richard Lindsay, a peat specialist based at the University of East London, who has been studying the UK’s peatlands for decades, said: “I think you have pushed the scientific method forward significantly in bringing together a number of techniques. In terms of scientific robustness, it’s very impressive.”

_(Unfortunately the BBC does not keep its news programmes online after broadcast and it doesn't seem possible to attach a video in this application but do contact us if you would like to see the original broadcast)_","Satellite technologies and a purpose built mapping platform were at the heart of our data gathering process.

We worked with experts at Greenpeace’s Global Mapping Hub to build a platform that uploaded daily satellite data to identify fires. We then overlaid this with several data layers to identify whether fires were covered by the new legislation – a challenge given the number of loopholes it contains. The layers included: government maps of peat depth, three sets of conservation zones, and a land gradient map. Finally, we added the database from the national Land Registry, to help us identify land ownership. 

We used three remote sensing techniques. First, we used NASA satellites that show hotspots: thermal anomalies that are very likely to be a fire. Second, we used satellites from the European Space Agency and private provider Planet which show images of flames and smoke plumes. 

Third, we used these satellites to identify scarring on the ground, so that by adding a sliding function to the tool we could review images from the days before and after a suspected burn to spot new burn scars. 

A team of journalists and researchers used the tool to create a database, each data point a different fire.

We worked with the RSPB and campaign group Wild Moors to cross reference our results against their datasets of eyewitness reports. The satellite images enabled us to identify the exact coordinates of a fire, data which we used to make site visits to test peat depth in key locations.

We used drones to find fires and burn scars, recording them to show the scale of some fires. This worked as a powerful storytelling technique in our video and on social media. The BBC also used this footage and the satellite imagery from our mapping platform on national news.","_(Please do not publish this section for legal and security reasons)_

Investigating these fires is challenging and risky for a number of reasons, which have prevented journalists and campaigners in the past from monitoring and publishing details of the fires and landowners involved. 

The fires occur in remote locations, meaning that they are difficult to gather evidence of on the ground. While local volunteers have long reported fires, it is very difficult for them to pinpoint the exact locations. Meanwhile the government’s environmental regulators have been stripped of resource and power in recent years, meaning that landowners have been able to set fires without much concern that they will face consequences.

The new piece of legislation contains many loopholes, making it challenging to identify potential breaches. The ban only prohibits burning on peat if it’s unlicenced, and if the peat is more than 40cm deep, and is in a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), and is protected by one of two other formal conservation regimes, and is on ground that is not too steep and rocky to mow. This is why we had to use so many data layers in our mapping platform. 

The landowners concerned include some very rich people, with the resources to access the libel courts. 

The grouse shooting industry has vocal lobby groups that represent its interests to government, and push back against efforts to expose the issue and bring about change. Many landowners are not only rich, but well connected – including among them politicians, Conservative party donors and a head of state. Therefore any story will be met with significant scrutiny and resistance on publication. 

We knew therefore that the data we produced had to be of very high quality; hence the use of satellite technology was essential. One type of satellite evidence alone was inadequate but combining three different techniques enabled us to reach an evidence bar significantly higher than any other attempt to monitor peat burning in the UK. 

Many landowners are opaque about their connection to an estate so beneficial ownership can be challenging to prove. For example, in order to identify the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates as the beneficial owner of one estate - owned by an offshore company - we had to find documents on Companies House, obtain title deeds from the Land Registry, find news cuttings, academic papers and use Orbis, a database of private company ownership. 

This also means it can be difficult to contact estates to offer them the chance to respond to the investigation, an essential journalistic practice. In some cases, it was impossible to find an email address or phone number so we had to post letters, and even hand-delivered a couple. 

Gamekeepers have been confrontational and aggressive to observers on their land before, even though most of the land concerned falls within the country’s national parks. Therefore we had to take precautions when conducting our ground surveys, which we decided upon through a risk assessment.","We have been transparent about our methodology for this project: we published an explanation of it as part of our story, and made a video (embedded in our story), meaning that anybody else wishing to do similar work can benefit from what we have learned. This includes local communities, the other NGOs we worked with, public bodies, scientists and other journalists. 

Other journalists can learn about the different kinds of satellite technology available and how it can be used to monitor environmentally damaging practices and environmental crime. 

They can also learn that by combining multiple different technologies and techniques, it is possible to conduct investigative work and gather evidence in the public interest that can add value to the work of scientists and public bodies. 

This story also serves as an example of how collaboration can produce journalism that would otherwise not be possible.

The available data on NHS dentistry was limited, so BBC journalists sought to ask every UK dental practice with an NHS contract if they were taking on new patients.

We telephoned nearly 7,000 practices in what the British Dental Association called ""the most comprehensive and granular assessment of patient access in the history of the service"".

We discovered nine in 10 NHS practices were not accepting new adult patients for treatment and 8 in 10 were not taking on children.","It was the lead story throughout the day on BBC News on 8 August, spanning digital, TV and radio. It was also turned into a 30-minute documentary for BBC iPlayer and appeared on the “5 minutes on” podcast.

It was picked up widely by other newspapers and broadcasters in the UK, and was also reported on by some overseas media.

Following our report more than 60 cross-party members of parliament called on the Government to act with “urgency and ambition” to tackle the problems facing NHS dentistry.

The research has been brought up in in Parliament several times and the Health and Social Care Committee in December cited our research as they launched an inquiry into NHS dentistry provision.","We gathered lists of practices that had NHS contracts from health providers in each of the UK’s four nations.

Reporters collected years of investigative reports by Michigan’s child care licensing bureau, testimonials from hundreds of parents and providers and analyzed new state child care data provided as part of pandemic federal relief programs. The data and documents show the problem is even worse than policymakers thought.","The publication of the new data led to almost immediate change in Michigan.

After seeing the new data, Michigan’s Early Childhood Investment Corp. a public organization that contracts with the state to help run the child care system, said that it didn’t know the original child care desert figure was flawed. It said the original numbers were calculated using the best available data at that time.

Based on the new, larger numbers, “it’s clear that families do not have access to child care to meet their needs,” the ECIC said in a statement.

In September, Michigan’s child care licensing bureau started a new initiative, Our Strong Start, which pairs child care entrepreneurs with a staffer from the state licensing agency who helps with paperwork and obtaining inspections. The program sought to address problems raised in our reporting. Hundreds of new day care providers are now enrolled in the program.

And a few months later, Michigan changed how it determines what constitutes a “child care desert,” employing our new data analysis on their state dashboard.","After months of FOIAs — and wrangling data from three recalcitrant state agencies — we obtained data documenting multiple rounds of Michigan’s Child Care Stabilization Grants. The data showed how Michigan used $1.4 billion in federal COVID-19 relief aid for the one-time grants. And they detailed, down to the dollar, the overhead, expenses and losses incurred by the state’s thousands of underwater day care providers.

In total, the data gave us two, never-before-seen glimpses into roughly 5,900 child care providers out of a total pool of roughly 7,900 across the state. To our knowledge, this is the first statewide analysis of billions of dollars of federal funds provided through the American Rescue Plan Act, or APRA.

To get federal funds, providers told the state about their current enrollments, as well as about their waiting lists, staffing needs and expenses. MuckRock, the Detroit Free Press and Chalkbeat Detroit then used those enrollments to help calculate daycare deserts, which previously had only been calculated with licensed capacity – or the maximum number of children that facilities can legally enroll. Interviews with providers indicated that enrollment numbers offered a more accurate picture of a county’s needs. This is often because facilities are short-staffed, but also because parents can’t afford the service. 

To calculate so-called “childcare deserts,” we stitched enrollments from the 5,900 grant recipients with the licensed capacity of the 2,000 non-applicants. In this way, we assumed an enrolled-to-capacity scenario for centers for which we had no information. 

What we found: the number of day care deserts in Michigan was nearly double previous estimates. A total of 20 counties have so few child care options that they qualify as deserts, the data shows. Another 23 Michigan counties, including Detroit’s Wayne and Macomb counties, are rounding errors away from qualifying as deserts as well.","Luca Powell spent his Report for America year at Michigan’s Traverse City Record-Eagle, looking for data stories. And time and time again, Luca heard from parents that one of the biggest service gaps in Grand Traverse County was finding childcare there and in other rural swaths of the state. So he followed up with state agencies, asking them for numbers on the number of available child care slots, along with how federal COVID relief funds were being used to prop up daycare providers during the pandemic.

We found that the agencies would give us the data but only in raw form, without a data dictionary to guide us or categories for us to help piece it together. And we would have to request the data every three months, to ensure we were gathering the most updated information. So we worked with four newsrooms, a team of day care industry experts and more than 170 providers and parents to figure out what the data meant, and how best to explain it.

What we found was a lot worse than what policy experts, lawmakers, parents or providers expected. (Here’s our GitHub data repository of all of our findings and an accompanying video produced by the Detroit Free-Press.)

We also found that statewide capacity estimates of 373,000 day care “slots” for Michigan’s children were an illusion. The real figure for 0 to 5-year-olds is closer to 264,000, a gap of more than 100,000 slots that reflects staffing shortages, high costs and temporary closures caused by COVID-19, as well as the exclusion of more than 70,000 children over the age of 5 who are eligible for kindergarten programs. 

And we found that crucial state aid missed nearly 2,400 day care providers, a reflection of disinterest in government help, even as the child care business model becomes increasingly untenable. Providers cited concerns around government intrusion into their curriculum and mistrust that the grants would really be tax-free.","We produced a statewide callout for parents and providers to tell us what they were seeing and propose policy solutions. We received more than 170 responses, many of which included detailed budget documents of the facility operations along with one-time state and federal funding. We spoke with dozens of stakeholders and published eight of those ideas, along with accompanying analysis from experts, lawmakers and state agencies about their potential feasibility.

This country’s system for tracking how people die has been chronically underfunded and inconsistent from state to state since long before the pandemic; COVID-19 has only led to more death certificate errors and faulty data.","We attempted to contact the listed next of kin in many of the deaths in Minnesota, and in speaking with three families, were able to find more details on how and why deaths were certified as either Long COVID or post-COVID.

What we found went beyond the CDC report on the 3,500 official Long COVID deaths, which was released in mid-December: the stories of several people for whom Long COVID contributed to death, context from experts who study the condition and recommendations for public agencies and research groups who will further tackle this topic.

Our story and data analysis resulted in a small change to the CDC’s tabulation of Long COVID deaths — a downward revision from upwards of 4,000 to 3,500.

But, more importantly, we also revealed new details about a National Institutes of Health-funded effort to study Long COVID through autopsies, which is part of the agency’s billion-dollar RECOVER initiative. The study had only enrolled about 85 patients — out of a planned 700 — as of mid-December, we found, due to challenges with collecting samples in the 24 hours after patients died. National registries and collaborations with patient groups could lead to more efficient research, experts told us.

The coverage was republished across the country, from The New York Times to Minnesota Public Radio and the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. And researchers are making use of the data in their own analyses of excess deaths to the virus.","In late 2022, we published two major stories in this project. The first explores how death certificate inaccuracies are more likely for Americans who are Black, Hispanic, Asian or Native — suggesting that the pandemic’s true toll on people of color is worse than previously known. We dug into mortality patterns in three communities that serve as examples for demographic disparity: Navajo and Apache counties in Arizona, Portland, Oregon and rural counties in Texas.

Our coverage was republished by our local partners in Arizona, Oregon and Texas, as well as other local publications. 

Also in late 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first attempted to tabulate how many Long COVID deaths have been recorded on death certificates over the past 2 ½ years. What they found: A little more than 3,500 out of 1 million official COVID-19 deaths. That 3,500 figure is likely a significant undercount, experts told us, for a public health crisis that has impacted almost 15% of all U.S. adults according to CDC estimates.

Building on our past expertise with death certificates, we replicated the CDC's work with our own analysis in the states of New Mexico and Minnesota, California's Bay Area, Los Angeles and San Diego, and Chicago's Cook Cook County. We obtained detailed and exhaustive death certificate records from New Mexico and Minnesota through public records requests, allowing journalists to search for words associated with Long COVID. We also reviewed a more limited number of COVID-19-related deaths in California and Illinois counties.","It’s not always easy to identify a COVID-19 death. If someone dies at home, if they have symptoms not typically associated with the disease or if they die when local health systems are overwhelmed, their death certificate might say “heart disease” or “natural causes” when COVID-19 is, in fact, at fault.

This problem is at the heart of “Uncounted,” MuckRock’s investigation into thousands of potentially-missed COVID-19 deaths in partnership with USA TODAY and a host of local newsroom partners. This country’s system for tracking how people die has been chronically underfunded and inconsistent from state to state since long before the pandemic; COVID-19 has only led to more death certificate errors and faulty data.","There are a few easy programmatic lessons to take away.

In order to identify potential Long COVID deaths in the death data files, we programmatically searched through the text in the contributing and underlying ""cause of death"" fields for each death in all geographic locations. This script for this can be found in the notebook find_long_covid_key_terms.R. This regular expression was written to replicate the methodology described in the CDC report, ""Identification of Deaths With Post-acute Sequelae of COVID-19 From Death Certificate Literal Text: United States, January 1,2020-June 30, 2022,"" in which the CDC says that these terms were identified in consultation with subject matter experts and CDC clinical guidance.

We relied on words and phrases identified by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics to find cases where Long COVID caused or contributed to the death, including terms like “post COVID syndrome,” “post acute” COVID and “Long COVID.” In 2020, 2021, and parts of 2022, we found 62 deaths associated with Long COVID in Minnesota, nine in Santa Clara County and one in Los Angeles. In New Mexico, from 2020 through 2021, we identified 13 deaths.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/health/2022/12/28/uncounted-covid-deaths-disparities/10590932002/,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2022/dec/14/long-covid-cdc-muckrock-analysis/,https://github.com/MuckRock/long-covid-death-certificates,https://airtable.com/shrGEDpG5vecWhxNl,https://www.azmirror.com/2023/01/06/community-response-helped-reverse-covids-devastating-toll-on-indigenous-communities-in-arizona/,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/health/long-covid-deaths.html,https://www.muckrock.com/covid-uncounted/,"Dillon Bergin, Betsy Ladyzhets, Karen Wang and Derek Kravitz of MuckRock and the Brown Institute for Media Innovation's Documenting COVID-19 project at MuckRock; Shaena Montanari, Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting; and Rachel Monahan, Willamette Week, provided reporting.

Our data-driven visual story walks readers through the challenges faced by the European electricity network, explaining how many countries rely on sharing electricity across their borders through thick copper cables called interconnectors.","This piece visually reveals to the audience a lesser-known subject but one that has enormous relevance and impact. 

It is a rich, immersive experience that grabs the reader’s attention from the first scroll, helping guide them through a topic that is difficult to understand. 

The impact of the project was reflected in the comments section, where readers praised both the content and presentation:

“Brilliant and really important, well done FT!”

“Congratulations for this piece. A complete revelation to me, very engaging structure and presentation. Nice work FTeam.”

“Excellent, clear and informative article. Kudos to the team for making this so simple to understand.”

“What an amazing piece. I love the format and learnt a great deal.”

The piece was highly engaging, with over 40% of the audience who started the story motivated to continue to the end, making it one of our most engaging visual stories of the year.

Despite being published behind the FT paywall, the project received considerable attention and plaudits across a variety of social platforms.

One of our missions is to produce visual journalism which serves all audiences and for this project the team was eager to push for better accessibility. 

As well as creating meaningful alternative text for screen readers and a high-contrast colour palette for graphics, we offered readers who struggle with dark text on light backgrounds an alternative reading experience via a toggle on the landing page.","Online collaboration tool Figjam allowed members of the team to brainstorm and storyboard. Figma was used for wireframing and the production of high-fidelity designs.

We carefully selected a high-contrast palette of blues with a bright yellow accent colour. This reflected the electric undertones crackling through the content and also allowed us to guide the reader through key elements as they scrolled through the story. 

Critical to our workflow was the APCA Contrast Calculator, a new method for calculating and predicting readability contrast which we used throughout the project. 

The page was built using React and we used the Mapbox gl JavaScript library for the map. The underlying geo-data for Europe’s electricity network is not publicly available. However, Entso-e publish a PDF of the grid which allowed us to use as a source.

This meant extracting the lines as vectors from the PDF and manually identifying the interconnectors and border points. Then the entire vector file was geo-referenced and converted to a geojson to load into MapBox. 

Perhaps the most challenging part of the story was visualising electricity ‘pulsing’ across the network. With help from the turf library, we created a function that took start and end coordinates, as well as a value between 1 and 10 for the size of the circle, and then returned an animated view of the pulsing circles between those two coordinates.

Much of the other energy data was open source and available online, but not always in the most accessible format. The geo-data for Norway’s hydropower dam was in Norwegian and needed to be translated. We built an R scraper to check the latest status of the French reactors. And we plotted months of hourly electricity data to help decide which day was most representative of a typical 24 hours of UK usage.","Europe's energy security has been a pressing concern since tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated in late 2021. The region's gas dependence has dominated the news, with the names of pipelines such as Nord Stream becoming well known.

However, in recent months another pivotal system has come under threat: Europe's vast electricity transmission grid and the network of interconnectors that facilitate the cross-border sharing of power.

By visualising this complex network and showing how years of cooperation have ensured European nations have electricity when they need it, we aimed to highlight how energy nationalism and recent power generation issues were converging to threaten access to energy during the time of the year when it is needed the most. 

There is much high-frequency open-source data on energy but it is often buried within specific organisation's websites. Speaking with experts in the sector was essential to our data gathering, which included accessing FTP servers for hourly cross-border electricity flows, translating Norwegian language hydrodam data portals and trawling sites of astronaut photography for night photos of cities taken from the International Space Station.","Design with accessibility in mind from the beginning. We felt that by taking an accessibility perspective and carefully considering the expectations of our readers we created an enhanced experience. As news teams increasingly produce visual stories using new technologies it is essential to prioritise UX best practices to ensure journalism can reach its broadest audience possible.

A visual storytelling approach was the key driver of our journalism and enabled us to achieve a level of explanation that could not have been achieved with words alone. 

By guiding the reader around the region’s transmission grid, and showing additional evidence to illustrate the system's current constraints and challenges, we were able to add pertinence to what could otherwise have been a somewhat abstract notion of energy sharing.

Our readers’ positive response to learning about this essential yet largely unknown and unseen system that has an enormous impact on everyday life reinforced that visual storytelling is a fantastic way to enlighten and delight subscribers.",English,https://ig.ft.com/electricity-sharing/,,,,,,,"Leslie Hook, Nathalie Thomas

The result has been the first neighborhood-level map of air pollution across Chicago, along with a collection of audio and print stories examining the reasons behind spikes in particulate matter 2.5 and why pollution coalesces in largely Hispanic and Black enclaves of the city.","In response to the findings on Fourth of July air pollution, the Chicago Department of Public Health said that the data highlights not just the illegal use of fireworks, but how pollution from fireworks ""can affect the health of vulnerable populations"" on the city's South and West Sides. After the second story, the department said that it is only in the beginning stages of ingesting, analyzing and using air sensor data, but will be using data like this in a forthcoming impact study.

In 2023, we'll continue work on this project by honing in on one of the root causes of air pollution in Chicago's hot spots: freight hubs and last-mile distribution warehouses. We'll continue to use data from air quality sensors and combine the data with public records like 311 complaints, inspection violations and environmental impact statements. 

Microsoft has also indicated that they may expand their air quality network to cities beyond Chicago. If their network does expand, we plan on providing training and editorial support as well as code and analysis to reporters in those cities so that they can make use of the data quicker and investigate the issues that matter to residents on the ground.","Because of the massive amount of data, and the details in each reading, MuckRock and Columbia University’s Brown Institute for Media Innovation, WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times initially sought not to answer all questions at once, but one critical question first:

In each month since the sensors have been installed, what areas of Chicago have been PM2.5 pollution hotspots?

To do this, we stored the dataset in our own database, and then averaged sensor readings by hour, day and month. At each aggregation step, a so-called “data completion criteria” was applied to match the data quality standards laid out by the EPA for Hotspot Identification and Characterization. Any sensor’s aggregated reading which had a sampling rate of less than 75% in the defined aggregation period was excluded.

At this point, the collected readings still only showed the amount of PM2.5 recorded at each individual sensor, which is largely meaningless without being calibrated for context.

To estimate how the reading of an individual sensor might explain pollution in specific neighborhoods, census tracts or community areas, we used a mathematical formula called Inverse Distance Weighting, or IDW. This is a popular interpolation technique, which makes use of the readings from all sensors at a given time, and uses those readings, based on the sensor’s distance, to estimate the level of PM2.5 pollution in regions between sensors. We then used this technique to estimate air quality levels at more than 50,000 uniformly distributed geocoordinates in the entire Chicago region and then generated tract level aggregated estimates. These estimates were then normalized based on the average estimated air quality in Chicago.","Chicago’s air quality is among the worst in the U.S., and the city has several local hotspots for particulate matter 2.5 — the tiny particles that come from diesel trucks and industry and enter people’s lungs and blood, causing significant health problems.

Between April and July 2021, the tech company Microsoft installed 115 new air quality sensors it built across Chicago. Microsoft’s “mesh network” represented one of this country’s first large-scale air quality projects — a novel way to explore neighborhood-by-neighborhood differences in pollution. 

For the past 18 months, journalists and data scientists at MuckRock and Columbia University’s Brown Institute for Media Innovation, along with partner newsrooms throughout Chicago, have used Microsoft’s Application Programming Interface, or API, to analyze this data for a series of stories on the city’s comparatively poor air quality. The API acts as a pipeline to the 115 sensors around Chicago and the information those sensors have recorded for more than a year — every five minutes, every hour of the day.

We then went a step further, installing our own air quality sensors in Chicago neighborhoods that lacked coverage in the Microsoft network — and looked for trends and spikes in pollution.

The sensors, both our PurpleAir devices and the Microsoft models, can be used to fill in gaps where there aren’t higher quality regulatory sensors, to identify spikes and hotspots, and to empower people with concerns about the air pollution in their neighborhoods, experts told us. Microsoft said it is also working to make its data easier to navigate for the general public.

But the Microsoft API was, and remains, inaccessible to most users. And the data work to accurately calibrate, plot and visualize the data is particularly daunting: If three months’ worth of data were placed into one spreadsheet, it would contain more than 8 million rows.","With our interpolated data in hand, we were able to plot the estimated air quality readings, by month, across the entire city. We quickly found that predominantly Hispanic and Black portions of Little Village, Austin, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Irving Park and Avondale, which are near heavy traffic and industrial areas, recorded the highest PM2.5 readings. But these estimates only tell part of the story. We then needed to connect with Chicagoans who live in the most impacted neighborhoods.

With WBEZ and the Sun-Times, we asked the public for help, to allow us to install our own air quality sensors to compare our readings with the Microsoft network and other sensors, such as EPA regulatory stations and other PurpleAir sensors. That callout resulted in more than 200 volunteers from across Chicago writing to us, asking for a sensor to be installed outside their home. We had to choose just two families — one on Chicago’s Far Southeast Side, near several intermodal freight hubs and the other on the Northwest Side, just across from one of the city's most congested highways.

Both families had long struggled with the health effects of poor air quality near their homes, including asthma attacks and scarring on lung tissue. We interviewed them repeatedly over the next several months, relying on their experiences with poor air quality around the Fourth of July and summertime pollution spikes to make sense of the data we were seeing.

This resulted in two follow-up stories: One looking at the spike in air pollution on the Fourth of July and the other looking at an unexplained jump in pollution in the city's East Side neighborhood during late July, which likely led to the sensor becoming clogged and decommissioned entirely.",English,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/5/16/23069860/dangerous-air-we-breathe-mapping-chicago-air-pollution-hotspots-pm2-5-particulate-matter,https://www.wbez.org/stories/what-is-particulate-matter/2b1f45f5-ca5d-40ba-ae68-737202e7c7e0,https://www.wbez.org/stories/chicagoans-breathe-in-extra-air-pollution-on-july-4/9a4c432f-cdd1-4f52-b98a-d01e638636f4,https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2022/nov/30/chicago-air-pollution-data-release/,,,,"Smarth Gupta of Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation; Dillon Bergin of MuckRock; María Inés Zamudio, Charmaine Runes and Maggie Sivit of WBEZ and Brett Chase of the Chicago Sun-Times provided reporting.

Yet it is mostly Western countries that are responsible for climate change with high CO2 emissions. That was the motivation to look at the largest heated oil pipeline of the world, that is being build in Uganda. Our journalistic coverage of the EACOP pipeline is not just about local consequences for human rights and the environment. It is about those responsible behind it – mainly foreign companies that profit from the project – while Ugandan people are laregly left empty-handed.","The publication of the project succeeded in drawing attention to the climate crisis, but especially to the actors accelerating it. All three parts received praise and great feedback especially on social media and were used as arguments by activists and politicians. After our publication, the EU commented on EACOP and criticized human rights violations and environmental risks in pipeline construction.","For visual design we used technologies like Mapbox, Qgis, Blender, D3, HTML5 Canvas. Most of the elements are completely self-built. Despite very many data points, the animations run well. Some simple webscrappig helped collect some of the data. In addition, we used classic OSINT methods for research. We checked trade registers and company registers in Germany, Great Britain and Uganda for research. We used satelite images as well as construction plans.","Access to the protagonists in Uganda as well as to most of the documents proved to be extremely difficult. It was both difficult to be allowed into the country as a journalist and to obtain the necessary accreditation. Meetings with those affected were mostly only possible by using surreptitious routes and bypassing security posts. Dozens of languages are spoken in Uganda, which made time-consuming translations necessary, government offices and companies on the ground were sometimes difficult to reach, and many people there do not dare to speak to the press. Access to satellite imagery and planning documents in this region of the world is also far more difficult than when researching wealthier countries.","The EACOP pipeline project shows how visual storytelling can be used for environmental issues as well as for economic actors and ownership structures.

Además, en una segunda parte explicamos cómo las emergencias por violencia de género y agresión sexual se multiplican en verano y por las noches.

Para llegar ahí analizamos los datos de 954.476 registros: las llamadas que los ciudadanos realizaron a los números de urgencias entre 2019 y 2022, una información que nos permitía saber a qué hora llamaron, para qué y a qué hora llegó la ambulancia.","No sólo descubrimos esos principales hallazgos. Pudimos ver muchas más cosas. Gracias a la información obtenida vía ley de transparencia pudimos comprobar esos datos, pero también contábamos con otras variables, como la fecha de la llamada, la hora de la llegada de la ambulancia a atender el caso si este precisaba de esa atención, el municipio desde donde se llamó y a donde acudió la ambulancia, el tipo de ambulancia y caso atendido y a qué hospital se traslado el paciente. Eso permitió que nuestro análisis mostrara los retrasos que se daban en las ambulancias subcontratadas, pero también en las ambulancias gestionadas directamente por la Comunidad de Madrid. El impacto fue importante en ese sentido debido a la fiscalización que se hizo de cómo actúa la Administración privatizando estos servicios y a las quejas posteriores de los sindicatos hiciéndose eco de los hallazgos de la investigación. Además, la investigación también funcionó correctamente en la web y redes sociales de Maldita.es.

También pudimos analizar y revelar los retrasos por tipo de casos atendidos y por municipios de la comunidad y demostrar así que en los casos más graves también había importantes retrasos y que las zonas más afectados por estos eran las zonas de la sierra de Madrid, las más rurales, aunque la situación también es de una especial gravedad en la capital, Madrid ciudad. Ha habido quejas a raíz de la investigación por ambos motivos.","La información que dio pie a la investigación se obtuvo mediante solicitudes de acceso a la información pública en base a la ley de transparencia ante la Consejería de Sanidad de la Comunidad de Madrid. Sin embargo, el organismo autonómico aportó el listado de miles de registros en formato PDF y en un CD. No en formato reutilizable como habíamos solicitado desde Maldita.es. Por lo tanto, tras ir a recoger el CD, para extraer los datos se utilizó el programa de extracción de tablas Tabula y el lenguaje de programación Python con la librería Pandas.

A partir de estos registros, se construyó una base de datos en formato SQL para así poder analizar la información y, además, conseguir calcular cuál es el tiempo real que han tardado en llegar las ambulancias a los casos atendidos. También se extrajeron todos los motivos de llamadas (más de 400) y se unificaron en categorías. Por ejemplo, para llamadas por 'ansiedad' o 'depresión' ambos términos se acabaron unificando en una categoría general de 'salud mental'. Además, de los registros se han eliminado aquellos en los que la hora de llegada es aparentemente anterior a la hora de llamada, ya que según los expertos consultados, serían errores que suceden en casos en los que las ambulancias llegaron antes de que la llamada quedara registrada.

Finalmente, los datos fueron extraídos mediante consultas a tablas en formato .csv, consiguiendo así tablas más pequeñas para trabajar también en hojas de cálculo. 

Para unificar los lugares de origen y destino y los motivos de llamada se ha utilizado el programa de limpieza de datos OpenRefine con el algoritmo de clustering. 

Para los gráficos interactivos de la investigación se utilizó Flourish.","Esta investigación permite confirmar con datos reales la frase de “las ambulancias llegan tarde”.

Y que, además, la gravedad aumenta para las ambulancias que pertenecen al propio Gobierno y que se encargan de los casos más críticos. Aquí, llegan tarde en 4 de cada 10 ocasiones. Hasta ahora no se había conocido estos datos que permiten fiscalizar la labor del Gobierno regional y su gestión de la sanidad, en este caso de las ambulancias.

La segunda pieza de esta investigación permite conocer que las llamadas pidiendo una ambulancia por casos de violencia de género y agresiones sexuales se multiplican por las noches y en verano. Los datos sobre la hora y fecha de llamada fueron fundamental para saber y conocer cuándo se producen este tipo de agresiones y permitir así que las administraciones puedan actuar con sus políticas públicas. Para poder comprobar este tipo de patrones considerábamos fundamental no saber sólo la hora para poder ver cuánto tardaban las ambulancias, sino también para poder ver esas tendencias y qué tipos de casos aumentaban en determinadas horas del día o determinados momentos del año.

La investigación no se quedó en los datos y tras hablar con expertos y fuentes involucradas pudimos contextualizar que este crecimiento de las llamadas se debe al aumento del ocio, las fiestas y, en los casos de violencia de género, a que la víctima y el agresor pasan más tiempo juntos, tanto en verano como por las noches. 

De hecho, las Administraciones Públicas al saber que los casos se evidencian más en época de verano y en tiempo de fiestas y festivales, por ejemplo, aumentan sus esfuerzos de vigilancia y de presencia de puntos sanitarios y violeta, entre otras cosas que pudimos comprobar. También pudimos comprobar que las emergencias sanitarias notificadas a estos números de teléfono de la Administración por posibles casos de sumisión química también se concentraban en esos momentos (por la noche y en verano).

La investigación, además, no se limitó a analizar cómo crecían estas llamadas y lo que se tardaba en atender algunos casos. Para poder saber que estaban excediendo lo permitido y lo pactado por contrato en el caso de las subcontratadas tuvimos que investigar los contratos públicos sobre esta materia, hacer trabajo de fuentes para conseguir documentación a este respecto y hablar con los sindicatos para poder consultar sus protcolos y normativa internos. Todo ese trabajo de fuentes y de campo fue fundamental para elevar nuestra investigación y poder conocer a qué tiempos estaban obligadas las empresas subcontratadas para llevar ambulancias y así poder corroborar que 3 de cada 10 casos gestionados por ellas no cumplían con el máximo que se les exigía por ley para llegar a los domicilios.","El gran valor que ha tenido este proyecto es que los datos permiten poner bajo la lupa cómo funciona el sistema sanitario de ambulancias en Madrid. Permite también confirmar que el retraso de las ambulancias no es algo anecdótico, sino sistemático y un problema de falta de recursos.

Es más, permiten confirmar que tras todas esas llamadas pidiendo ayuda, hay personas. Desde Maldita.es hemos cotejado algunos de los casos públicos de los últimos tiempos para confirmar que han existido realmente. Es el caso de la pieza publicada “Muere tras confundirla el Summa con una enferma terminal y no enviarle ayuda a tiempo: 'Tenemos muchas llamadas, ¿vale?' de El Mundo: https://www.elmundo.es/papel/historias/2021/11/25/619e730721efa0ea2c8b460d.html . 

Filtrando en nuestro base de datos con casi un millón de registros pudimos confirmar que, efectivamente, este caso había ocurrido en aquel dia. En el registro constaba una llamada con el motivo de una paciente diciendo que no podía respirar y a su vez otra en el mismo periodo de tiempo.

Esta investigación nos permitió unir en un mismo trabajo la transparencia, la investigación, la tecnología de análisis y limpieza de datos y las herramientas de visualización. Este trabajo aúna diferentes ramas del periodismo que hoy en día cobran más fuerza que nunca y con el principal protagonismo en el periodismo de datos. 

Esta investigación creemos que es ejemplo de que se puede contar a los ciudadanos lo que les pasa, pasando de lo anecdótico a un problema sistemático, y demostrando cómo actúan (o no) las administraciones. De hecho, a día de hoy poco se sabe sobre las supuestas sanciones que realiza la administración a las ambulancias que llegan tarde, ya que la Comunidad de Madrid se ha negado a entregar esa información.

Mas entendemos os efeitos acumulados das atividades humanas em rios, lagos e várzeas? Quais as maiores ameaças à dinâmica da água na maior bacia hidrográfica do planeta? Com base nos melhores dados científicos disponíveis, o inédito Índice de Impacto nas Águas da Amazônia reúne dados de monitoramento e pesquisa para identificar as áreas mais vulneráveis. Os resultados do índice são acompanhados por reportagens realizadas em campo ou remotamente (em casos em que a pandemia inviabilizou viagens). O time do projeto envolveu jornalistas, cientistas, desenvolvedores, fotógrafos e designers.","Conseguimos gerar uma manchete de alcance internacional e com grande destaque em alguns dos principais veículos de imprensa do Brasil focada na degradação dos ecossistemas aquáticos. Trata-se do principal resultado do nosso índice, que foi o ponto de destaque na manchete da Folha, o principal jornal brasileiro: ""Na Amazônia, 20% das bacias sofrem alto impacto de atividades humanas"". Gerar uma manchete que, sem o Aquazônia, não existiria, é bastante positivo. Da mesma forma, conseguimos apontar as localidades mais impactadas pela degradação aquática. Essa consistência permitiu que jornalistas pudessem explorar os resultados secundários do Aquazônia, que são aqueles surgidos dos cruzamentos entre as camadas de dados do índice com outras (como bacias hidrográficas, Terras Indígenas, etc). Ou seja, abastecemos o jornalismo local amazônico de informações baseadas em ciência. O projeto, enfim, foi repercutido pelos principais veículos de notícias do Brasil, incluindo Folha de S. Paulo, Globo TV, G1, Poder 360 e National Geographic Brasil, além de veículos locais, somando mais de 40 aparições na mídia. Ele fez sucesso internacionalmente e foi republicado pela Mongabay (em inglês) e pela Cambio 16 na Venezuela (em espanhol). A Agência Nacional de Águas (órgão federal brasileiro) entrou em contato conosco buscando insights. Por fim, Aquazônia venceu quatro prêmios de jornalismo em 2022: melhor visualização de dados no jornalismo da América Latina no ano, segundo o júri da Associação Mundial de Publishers de Notícias (WAN-IFRA), ficando em primeiro lugar nas categorias Geral e Redações Médias ou Pequenas. Por causa desses resultados, Aquazônia concorreu com os vencedores de outras partes do mundo e acabou em terceiro lugar na categoria Visualização de Dados na etapa mundial da premiação da WAN-IFRA. A reportagem também foi eleita a melhor visualização de dados do Brasil no mais importante prêmio de jornalismo de dados do país, o Cláudio Weber Abramo.","Nas visualizações, as principais ferramentas utilizadas foram Qgis e MapBox. Consideramos a Bacia Hidrográfica Amazônica em território brasileiro, que corresponde a 55% da área total da bacia ou 5 milhões de km2. Para elaborar o Índice de Impacto nas Águas da Amazônia (IIAA) levantamos dados espaciais representativos das principais ameaças aos ecossistemas aquáticos da Amazônia: mudanças no uso e cobertura do solo, infraestrutura, degradação florestal e mudanças climáticas. Outras ameaças relevantes, como pesca e contaminação por agrotóxicos, não foram incluídas devido à ausência de dados disponíveis. Os dados de ocorrência e distribuição das ameaças foram obtidos em bases de dados públicas e gratuitas como Projeto Mapbiomas (2021), Rede Amazônica de Informação Socioambiental (RAISG, 2021), Agência Nacional de Águas (ANA, 2021), Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS, 2021) e a partir de artigos científicos (Funk et al.; 2015; Matricardi et al., 2020; Souza et al.; 2020). Selecionamos nove camadas de dados de ameaças para compor o IIAA: agricultura e pecuária (AGP), área urbanizada (URB), garimpo ilegal (GAR), mineração industrial (MIN), hidrelétricas (HDL), cruzamento de estrada (EST), hidrovia (HID), degradação florestal (DEG) e diferença de precipitação (PRE). A definição da escala espacial para o cálculo do IIAA baseou-se na classificação de bacias hidrográficas da Amazônia proposta por Venticinque et al. (2016), ‘Amazon GIS-Based River Basin Framework’. Assim, para a bacia do rio Amazonas no Brasil, calculamos o IIAA para 11216 microbacias com área média de 479,6 km2. Em seguida calculamos os valores de cada variável de ameaça para cada microbacia. A metodologia completa está em https://aquazonia.ambiental.media/metodologia.","A Ambiental tem frequentemente noticiado questões ambientais que afetam a floresta amazônica. Em 2020, publicamos outra investigação, chamada Cortina de Fumaça (https://cortinadefumaca.ambiental.media), que refuta diretamente a narrativa criminosa do governo do ex-presidente Jair Bolsonaro sobre a relevância dos incêndios florestais na Amazônia. O projeto Aquazônia continua nosso trabalho em comunicação científica e cartografia interativa. Esse projeto foi motivado por uma crescente conscientização sobre a importância da bacia de água doce da Amazônia. A pesquisa da cientista Cecília Gontiho Leal, e seu artigo intitulado ""Repensando as prioridades no planejamento da conservação para enfrentar a crise da biodiversidade"" em particular, nos motivou a aprofundar o tópico. A reportagem foi inovadora ao colocar o elemento água como prioridade na aferição dos impactos de atividades humanas na conservação da Floresta Amazônica. No debate internacional, predomina há décadas um padrão de levantamento e análise de dados sobre a degradação da cobertura vegetal: as queimadas, o desmatamento, os garimpeiros, a pecuária e as monoculturas de soja. Os ecossistemas aquáticos também sofrem com todas as mazelas das atividades humanas predatórias – entre outros fatores, a perda da floresta afeta o ciclo hidrológico -, mas os danos são mais difíceis de serem identificados e entendidos, seja em monitoramento remoto ou em dados de pesquisas científicas. Importante destacar que enxergamos a falta de priorização do tema água na Amazônia como erro estratégico de grande proporção, que poderá resultar em consequências graves de natureza abrangente. Qualquer política de mitigação dos efeitos da emergência climática deverá invariavelmente passar pela preservação de rios, lagos e igarapés na Amazônia, e o descaso do poder público trará (já traz, a bem da verdade) prejuízos para a produção de alimentos, o abastecimento de populações humanas, a geração de energia, entre outros. Não há combate global à crise climática viável sem um olhar extremamente cuidadoso para a maior bacia hidrográfica do planeta. O mérito do Aquazônia foi redirecionar a discussão para os recursos hídricos por meio da criação do Índice de Impacto nas Águas da Amazônia (IIAA), um recurso claro e didático, que nos propciou criar o primeiro mapa jornalístico baseado em ciência com o retrato da degradação aquática na Amazônia Brasileira. “Mesmo que a maioria dos impactos aferidos no índice esteja acontecendo na terra, o nosso olhar voltou-se para a localização, a intensidade e a escala da pressão que exercem sobre os corpos hídricos, em cada microbacia”, explica Leal, bióloga brasileira vinculada à Universidade de Lancaster, no Reino Unido, consultora científica do projeto e principal autora do índice. Entrevistamos duas dezenas de pesquisadores especializados no tema e levantamos as principais bases de dados e estudos científicos existentes. A partir desse levantamento, enxergamos que seria necessário criar um índice capaz de avaliar o efeito combinado de diversas atividades humanas sobre rios, lagos, florestas alagadas e igarapés amazônicos. Antes da publicação, submetemos os resultados do índice à uma banca avaliadora externa, composta por dois jornalistas de dados nível sênior e um biólogo especializado em água na Amazônia, vinculado à Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (podemos compartilhar os nomes).","O projeto Aquazônia foi fruto de um trabalho em equipe multidisciplinar, que contou com profissionais de diferentes especialidades. Acreditamos que esse é um aprendizado importante para jornalistas e redações, pois unindo esforços, é possível realizar trabalhos mais aprofundados e relevantes. Entendemos também que o uso de jornalismo de dados, com uma cartografia interativa e visualização atraente e acessível, é fundamental para explorar temáticas complexas, por vezes pouco cobertas pela mídia, e potencialmente gerar conhecimentos novos (como foi o caso do índice, que é inédito). Esperamos que as informações apresentadas por este projeto sobre as regiões mais vulneráveis da bacia hidrográfica da Amazônia sirvam de inspiração para novos estudos científicos capazes de preencher as imensas lacunas de dados que ainda existem. Esperamos também que inspire novas reportagens jornalísticas, debates nas redes sociais e novas legislações que possam garantir um futuro saudável para as águas da Amazônia, das quais todos dependemos. Há muito espaço para projetos relevantes no jornalismo de dados a partir de bases de dados científicas, que podem ser exploradas em parceria com pesquisadores ou não, dependendo da complexidade do tema e das habilidades do time, sem comprometer a independência necessária ao jornalismo. Nossa missão é encorajar jornalistas e profissionais de mídia no Brasil a apostarem em um jornalismo científico que valorize a qualidade estética e de conteúdo, combinando o trabalho baseado em dados com reportagens de campo. Por fim, nossa próxima busca passa por ampliar o impacto e o alcance dos nossos projetos com tomadores de decisão. Para tanto, estamos costurando parcerias com organizações focadas em advocacy na área socioambiental.","Portuguese, English",https://aquazonia.ambiental.media/,https://aquazonia.ambiental.media/en,https://news.mongabay.com/2022/05/a-new-index-measures-the-human-impacts-on-amazon-waters/,https://g1.globo.com/jornal-hoje/noticia/2022/05/05/20percent-da-bacia-amazonica-esta-impactada-por-atividades-como-mineracao-diz-estudo.ghtml,https://www.nationalgeographicbrasil.com/meio-ambiente/2021/11/serra-pelada-fluvial-corrida-do-ouro-expoe-ameacas-ao-rio-madeira,https://g1.globo.com/ro/rondonia/noticia/2022/05/05/bacia-do-rio-madeira-e-uma-das-mais-impactadas-da-amazonia-brasileira-aponta-indice.ghtml,https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2022/05/na-amazonia-20-das-bacias-sofrem-alto-impacto-de-atividades-humanas.shtml,"Thiago Medaglia, Laura Kurtzberg, Cecília Gontijo Leal, Ronaldo Ribeiro, Letícia Klein, Kevin Damasio, Victor Papaleo, André Dib.","Thiago Medaglia, Coordenador.

To get around this, and understand how this energy war was being waged, we conducted a detailed analysis of NASA satellite data on night-time light levels. This was combined with expert interviews and OSINT analysis. 

Together, these elements allowed us to piece together a story about Russian strategy (the deliberate targeting of transformers), Ukraine's response and the current balance of forces.","The project was published online and in the form of a television package, giving it a broad reach. It was shared widely on social media, including by the prominent Ukraine-focused Euromaidan Press account, receiving hundreds of thousands of views. The YouTube upload of the television package currently has 129,000 views. We received positive feedback from both our audience and our interviewees, including the NASA employee in charge of the data that we used.","1. To understand the impact of Russian strikes on Ukraine's grid, in the absence of official data on energy output and transmission, we used nighttime satellite data from NASA. Following discussions with NASA, we decided to do further post-processing on the data, which required the use of QGIS and R. This allowed us to reformat the data as a rolling average, remove poor-quality data and fill in the missing data. This was then visualised both as line charts (in Flourish) and as maps (in QGIS).

2. We also wanted to the tell the story of particular strikes, and connect them to the effects seen in the satellite data. That meant collating and verifying (or re-verifying) videos of attacks using OSINT techniques, and obtaining high-resolution satellite images of the aftermath.

3. We wanted to present the story as a scrolly, containing map sequences. Various constraints made it impossible for us to use Mapbox or similar software. As an alternative, we used Shorthand, adding in a scroll-responsive video sequence via Javascript.

4. Another aspect that was new to us was the use of Open Street Map's API to gather shapefiles for Ukraine's energy infrastructure. This highly detailed data allowed us to think through the logic of Russia's attacks, and to illustrate it to our audience. The data included power lines of various voltages, power plants, substations and transformers.","Due to holiday commitments and the necessity of releasing the story before Christmas, the timetable for producing it was extremely tight. The story was conceived in October, but we weren't able to start work in earnest until late November. This included work on the satellite data. We had never worked with data of that format, and had had very limited exposure to QGIS.

As mentioned, we were unable to use Mapbox for the mapping sequences due to various constraints.","This project demonstrates the potential usefulness of satellite imagery as a source of data, rather than simply imagery. Our analysis would not have had the force it did had we not transformed the imagery into numeric data and analysed it as such. Night-time light analyses could be useful for future news stories about civil unrest, war, economic collapse or natural disaster.

This project also demonstrates the potential for combining data with OSINT techniques, and the importance of traditional journalism techniques such as expert interviews. Without these two aspects, we would not have been able to present a convincing account of Russian strategy, and therefore would not have shown quite as clearly how deliberate the targeting of Ukraine's civilian energy infrastructure is.",English,https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-how-much-the-lights-have-gone-out-in-kyiv-revealed-for-the-first-time-by-nasa-satellites-12773049,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u11qkHC0jLM,,,,,,"Kieran Devine

This investigation analysed financial and trade data to reveal how financial speculators exacerbated the price peak by flooding the commodity markets in attempts to make a huge profit. 

This speculation came at the expense of millions of ordinary people who were struggling to feed themselves and their families. 

Based on FOI requests we also revealed how this speculation was made possible as a result of financial regulators bowing to pressure from powerful lobby groups and weakening curbs on excessive speculation that were proposed after the 2008 food crisis.","Following publication our investigation received ample secondary coverage, quoted and referenced in The New York Times, Financial Times, Rai 3, and numerous other news outlets and cited in academic research. It basically created a new beat. 

The consumer organisation FoodWatch launched a campaign based on our findings aiming for reform of financial regulations. A coalition of Members of the EU parliament announced they will include food speculation when they review rules for the financial markets (MiFID II).

A dozen international aid agencies and advocacy groups approached us to discuss our findings and methodology and ways to include and implement them into their own campaigns and policy briefs to decision makers. 

We were invited to brief the German government as well as a UK shadow minister on our findings and how policy should be changed to prevent this from happening again.","Using data obtained from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and proprietary databases, we recorded the daily money flows into the two top Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) buying wheat futures. In the first four months of 2022, they had taken in $1.2 billion – compared to just $197 million for the whole of 2021: by April they owned wheat futures equivalent to half the U.K’s annual flour consumption. On March 7th, as both funds achieved record investment flows, Chicago wheat futures hit their highest price - and the markets closed for the day.

We obtained and analysed a decade’s worth of data on food speculation from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and the European Securities and Markets Authority. It showed that speculators were buying agricultural futures contracts at record levels. In Europe, speculators’ share of buy-side wheat futures contracts has increased from 23% of open interest in May 2018 to 72% in April 2022. In the U.S, “index speculation” - widely seen as a cause of the food price crisis of 2008, was at levels not seen since 2014.

Interviews and obtained documents showed that bankers and asset managers, like JP Morgan’s wealth management team, had encouraged investors to park their money in commodities. 

We used freedom of information laws to obtain documents showing how the International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA), whose members include the likes of Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, Blackrock and Citibank, successfully lobbied the EU regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), to weaken curbs on excessive speculation that were proposed after the last food crisis in 2008.","One of the reasons why so many organisations approached us for briefings was the dearth of reportage on this issue. It was generally seen as too technical, too complex and perhaps too difficult to translate how the workings of commodity markets and governance failures affect the day-to-day lives of consumers around the world. We bridged that gap by combing original data analysis with comments from scholars and ordinary people. On it's own, both of them wouldn't work. But combining the two was led to a powerful story. 

Resource constraints in reporting on this story included access to data (from both exchanges and the EU officials on MiFIID data). Just a few experts were able to speak fluently on the inner workings of European exchange.","Many journalists shy away from the topic for good reasons: the topic is contested, complex and original data hard to find. There is a lack of public data available in real time to track investor and speculator activity, and a large influence of lobbyists to push back against regulations and against what our findings reveal - that excessive speculation feeds into the food price crisis. 

We got a team together with domain experts and financial investigators to figure out whether we could find hard data on food speculation. And we build a network of experts to help us interpret this data. It was the diversity in the team that made this investigation possible. 

At the end of June as the Fed raised interest rates, the price of wheat fell to pre-war levels. The movement has generally been seen as another indication that the four month bubble was indeed caused by excessive speculation. 

We are working with this collaboration on a follow-up investigation unearthing who the actual beneficiaries of food speculations are.","English, Dutch, German, Italian",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1huofikFssgifn9ZBShQrdquXGbIen6QD/view?usp=sharing,https://www.lighthousereports.nl/investigation/the-hunger-profiteers/,https://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/nahrungsmittel-wie-spekulanten-von-der-krise-profitieren-a-566ff49f-81e6-4327-a235-b23fa4616dc0,https://thewire.in/economy/speculation-is-contributing-to-global-food-insecurity-significantly,https://www.thecontinent.org/_files/ugd/287178_e326d8a32d65453b93a501a38b92cb86.pdf,,,"Ludo Hekman, Margot Gibbs, Thin Lei Win, Kabir Agarwal, Lise Witteman, Beatriz Ramalho da Silva, Lionel Faull, Nils Klawitter, Sipho Kings","Ludo Hekman, director at Lighthouse Reports

Shortly before the 2022 elections, Pennsylvania's Supreme Court instructed counties not to count ballots without dates or with incorrect dates. This led to some counties publishing lists online of who had submitted improperly dated ballots. We wanted to know who this policy impacts, so we collected the data from various counties and analyzed the demographics of those voters using a variety of tools. What we discovered is that rejecting these ballots disproportionately impacts voters of color.","This story was republished by news organizations around the state as well as by outlets focusing on multicultural issues. Pittsburgh's NPR station also invited Carter on air to discuss the story. It was also featured as the front page story on Election Line, a news service focusing on election issue s. 

Pennsylvania's Department of State also said this data went a long way toward ""confirming with empirical evidence what we understood to be the case anecdotally,” the agency wrote in a statement after viewing the findings. “This minor voter error appears to impact specific communities of voters more than others, including older voters, low-income voters and voters in communities of color.”","The data for this story was released by county governments in an effort to have voters fix their errors and have their votes counted. Votebeat wanted to know who was impacted by the rejected improperly dated mail ballots. We collected the data from the county governments and standardized it so it could be viewed in one file. One county file had been taken down by the time we went to retrieve it and had to be sourced via the Wayback Machine. Voters were then grouped by zip code, and the dataset was combined with racial and poverty demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This new combined dataset was used to determine if a voter submitting a flawed ballot was more likely to come from communities with higher than average non-white populations/poverty rates as compared to the voting population as a whole in the county. A more detailed explanation of the methodology used for this analysis can be found at the bottom of the story.

Pennsylvania's voter roll does not contain racial information for voters, so knowing the exact number of minority voters impacted by this policy is not possible. This is why we used the Census data method. However, John Curiel of Ohio Northern University was able to use an R program to run a Bayesian Inference analysis on the voter's names to estimate their races. This analysis provided further confirmation of our findings. 

Votebeat/SpotlightPA maintains a collaborative relationship with the Philadelphia Inquirer. Reporter Aseem Shukla had run an age analysis on the data and kindly shared his results. This revealed an age disparity, as well.

Thomas Wilburn, of Votebeat's sister publication Chalkbeat, turned our findings into user-friendly graphics with Datawrapper.","Ever since Pennsylvania's mail-in ballot law passed in 2019, it has been highly contentious. Several lawsuits have stemmed from how the statute was implemented, including over whether a date should be required for a ballot to be counted. This issue was ruled on by the state Supreme Court just days before the election, though they did not voice an opinion on whether the requirement violated the Civil Rights Act.

Peru,Salud con lupa,Small,Participant,,Estereotipos de género y criminalización de mujeres en el sistema de justicia en Perú: Investigaciones “Justicia Machista” y “Perseguidas por abortar”,2022-11-07,"Investigation, Long-form, Database, Open data, Women, Health","Scraping, D3.js, Json, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","El proyecto analiza 291 sentencias emitidas por magistrados de Perú para conocer cómo resolvieron -entre 2018 y 2022- los casos investigados por feminicidio (acabado y tentado) y aborto. A partir de ello, realizamos una primera investigación (“Justicia Machista”) que muestra que los agresores son sentenciados por lesiones u homicidios cuando en realidad se trata de delitos de feminicidio debido a los razonamientos estereotipados de los magistrados. La segunda investigación (“Perseguidas por abortar”) revela cómo las mujeres son criminalizadas desde los servicios de salud hasta los juzgados por abortar y que son los médicos quienes las reportan a la policía.","Tras el análisis de sentencias, elaboramos una primera investigación titulada “Justicia Machista”, que evidencia que los magistrados no sentencian a los agresores de mujeres por los delitos de feminicidio o intento de feminicidio, pese a que debería ser así, porque basan sus razonamientos en prejuicios -es decir, consideran que los delitos se cometieron por celos o supuestas infidelidades- o porque los agresores no tuvieron la intención de matar a sus víctimas dado que las heridas no se produjeron en órganos vitales. Sin embargo, en muchos de los casos no se lesionó un órgano vital porque la víctima se defendió o porque una tercera persona intervino. En el caso de las sentencias analizadas por el delito de aborto y que derivaron en la investigación “Perseguidas por abortar” mostramos cómo se criminaliza a las mujeres que deciden abortar en Perú y los criterios de los jueces que las sentencian.

Como consecuencia de ambas investigaciones que forman parte de un mismo proyecto, tuvimos estos impactos: 1. La Comisión de Género del Poder Judicial reconoció que los estereotipos de género son un problema de acceso a la justicia para las mujeres en Perú. 2. La Asociación de Mujeres para la Justicia y la Democracia y otras organizaciones civiles que trabajan en género usan los resultados de las investigaciones como herramienta de capacitación a administradores de justicia. 3. Salud con lupa y el Capítulo de Mujeres Juezas de la Asociación de Jueces para la Justicia y la Democracia harán capacitaciones en febrero de 2023 tras el desarrollo de un repositorio digital para liberar todas las resoluciones conseguidas a través del proyecto. Este repositorio permitirá hacer la búsqueda de las resoluciones por delitos, por ubicación (región, provincia, distrito), fecha del delito y fecha de la sentencia, el tipo de sentencia (condenatoria o absolutoria), entre otros datos.","El proyecto tuvo como técnica principal de reportería el uso de la Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública para conseguir sentencias, emitidas en primera y segunda instancia judicial entre el 2018 y 2022, de los casos que fueron llevados a juicio por los delitos de feminicidio (acabado y tentado) y aborto. Se solicitaron estas sentencias a las 34 Cortes Superiores de Justicia del Perú y logramos que 9 entregaran sentencias de casos investigados por feminicidios, y 11, de casos investigados por el delito de aborto.
Luego de obtener un total de 291 sentencias, se construyó una base de datos con las 160 sentencias de feminicidios que incluyó 64 columnas en Google Sheets para procesar la información. 

Conforme las periodistas del equipo leían los documentos, extraían los datos más importantes y los colocaban en la matriz, previo contraste de la información para identificar si los jueces no se ajustan al Código Penal, le hacían interpretaciones por sesgos de género y otros usos cuestionables. Por ejemplo, había magistrados que consideraban que un condenado por feminicidio no debía cumplir cadena perpetua, pese a que la merecía, porque esa pena no le permitiría en el futuro reinsertarse a la sociedad; sin embargo, no existe un sustento legal para tal afirmación.

Al finalizar la construcción de la matriz grande, se limpiaron algunos errores de tipeo con Open Refine, y se elaboró una matriz pequeña que se transformó en una visualización interactiva de los 129 hombres acusados por feminicidio o intento de feminicidio, con los resúmenes de los casos y las penas impuestas. 
Con las sentencias que partieron de investigaciones fiscales por el delito de aborto no se construyó una base de datos. Para leer estas sentencias se utilizó la herramienta Pinpoint para ubicar términos clave dentro de los documentos.","El desafío del proyecto no solo implicó construir una base de datos a partir de sentencias a las que accedimos a través de la Ley de Acceso a la Información Pública, sino también el diseño de criterios de análisis al momento de leer los fallos para extraer la información que permita detectar estereotipos de género en la argumentación y definición de los casos por parte de los jueces. 

Esto permitió construir una base de datos de 129 acusados de feminicidio e intento de feminicidio. En total, revisamos 160 sentencias tomando en cuenta el contexto de los hechos y las frases relacionadas a prejuicios o estereotipos. 
Las sentencias contenían términos técnicos que debían interpretarse para una adecuada comprensión de cada caso. Esto fue crucial comprender para procesar los datos más relevantes de las sentencias a una matriz. 

En el caso de las sentencias de aborto, superamos la poca transparencia de las cortes superiores para ofrecer información. Sin embargo, para el análisis de estos fallos, fue necesario comprender cómo funciona la criminalización o persecución de las mujeres que deciden abortar en el Perú, dónde empieza esa persecución, cuáles son las pruebas que valoran los administradores de justicia para acusarlas, y para entender cómo afecta en el ámbito sanitario y judicial a las mujeres la penalización del aborto. 

Es importante mencionar que no existe un sistema unificado para realizar peticiones de acceso a la información pública a las 34 Cortes Superiores de Justicia del país. La mayoría no tiene activo su Portal de Transparencia Estándar que muestra cómo enviar una petición de información. Esto generó que hiciéramos peticiones basadas en la Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública corte por corte hasta reunir los documentos que hicieron viable el proyecto. Lo que implicó orden para el seguimiento de los datos y paciencia para la espera de respuestas de cada una.","Los periodistas pueden aprender a acceder a sentencias en posesión de las Cortes Superiores de Justicia usando la Ley de Transparencia y Acceso a la Información Pública, y también a otras instituciones públicas. 

Los periodistas también pueden replicar la metodología empleada en el proyecto que permitió hacer una lectura crítica de las resoluciones para identificar incongruencias y criterios sexistas de los magistrados al resolver casos de feminicidio e intento de feminicidio.

En el caso de abortos, se trata de la primera vez que se libera un grupo importante de sentencias por este delito. Esto permite a que más reporteros puedan utilizar estos documentos para elaborar nuevos enfoques y artículos sobre el tema. 

Finalmente, pueden tomar como referencia cómo procesamos información que no existía en sets de bases de datos y la visualización que hicimos para el proyecto.",Spanish,https://saludconlupa.com/series/justicia-machista/,https://saludconlupa.com/series/perseguidas-por-abortar/,,,,,,"Fabiola Torres López, Jason Martínez Vera, Rocío Romero Benites, Lucero Ascarza Canales, Rosa Laura Gerónimo, Johana Valer Torres, Héctor Huamán.","Periodista.

Argentina,LA NACION,Big,Participant,,Buenos Aires governor favors state-friendly media in advertising campaign spending,2022-10-09,"Investigation, Database","AI/Machine learning, Scraping","The money that government gives to media in Argentina is largely undisclosed. We analyzed 139 documents in closed PDF format with 23,732 records containing information on the amounts allocated to official publicity in the province of Buenos Aires. For the first time that the public has been able to access details of the amounts disbursed. Between February and August 2022, 8,526 million pesos were disbursed among more than 1,000 media outlets, production companies, marketers and communicators. After manual classification, it was discovered that among those who benefited the most were journalistic companies with editorial guidelines that favored the current government.","Despite this data being of great public interest, it remained hidden from the public. This is unprecedented information; it is the first time in history that a media outlet has had access to this information from the province of Buenos Aires, which had been denied via the press and FOIA requests on previous occasions. The impact of the project stretched beyond the scandalous amounts, which exceeded 8,500 million pesos, and the discretionality in the selection of companies. Other competing print, radio, and television media outlets quickly spread the news, not only republishing the article but also highlighting the findings and meticulous work carried out by the journalists of LA NACION.

Within the newspaper, the article generated a lot of interest: the average reading time of the readers was more than 3 minutes, which far exceeded the average reading time of articles in LA NACION.","Our team used several data structuring, normalization and analysis techniques for the preparation of this research. At the beginning of the process, a scraping of the regulations of the province was carried out with C# — these regulations were found on the site of the Normative and Documentary Information System of Buenos Aires. Each of them was analyzed using regular expressions, and then an optical character recognition (OCR) was applied to transform the PDF tables into an open format. The information was then stored in a SQL database.

The association of each particular outlet to its corresponding media group was done manually in spreadsheets, which was based on the journalist's knowledge and know-how and confirmed by official sources. This allowed us to improve and enrich our database. This information will also serve as raw material for future research.

We utilized a constant workflow that allowed continuous feedback: the information stored in SQL was transferred automatically to spreadsheets, which was then transferred to Looker Studio, allowing us to consult, check and modify the information processed so far in a user-friendly way. At the same time, this flow facilitated the collaboration of the work of different disciplines (journalists + data scientists).

Finally, we created an XMind relationship map to identify the existing relationships between media outlets, their corresponding media groups, their owners and associated companies.","Official publicity is any form of communication, advertisement or institutional campaign by the State that appears in public and private media outlets of the country of any kind: TV, newspapers, radios, internet, cinema and public roads. This issue is very obscure in Argentina and the government often allocates money to outlets in a way that tends to be susceptible to the government's discretion. That is to say, these allocations often benefit the government's ""friends."" According to the latest corruption ranking carried out annually by Transparency International, Argentina is in 96th place out of 180: in the last year it scored only 38 points out of a possible 100 and dropped 18 positions from its previous ranking.

Access to official publicity data has historically been complex, but it is especially difficult in the case of the province of Buenos Aires. Despite having a FOIA request law at the national and provincial level, it is difficult to access disaggregated, reliable and high-quality information. And in most cases, there is usually no response from the ministry in charge.

Why do we care about the investment in official advertising by Buenos Aires? The province of Buenos Aires is one of the most important and populated districts in Argentina and the one with the largest budget. It is home to 38.94% of the country's population, according to the last census. 

The province of Buenos Aires has been historically governed by the Peronist party which, in the last 15 years, played a role in important conflicts with the media. Since 2019 the province has been governed by Axel Kicillof, a Peronist politician. It should be noted, however, that when the opposing political party held power over the province, it still failed to make this information public. 

The information needed to prepare this research was found by scouring documents, regulations and appendices located within numerous isolated links that were published on the official website but difficult to access. From the compilation of each regulation it was possible to reconstruct the whole story: a web of disbursements and payments to the media, where the size of each disbursement correlated not with the size of its audience but with the extent to which a media outlet favored the current government. 

The investigation required abundant work with data in its original, disorganized form: from its transformation, to its structuring, normalization, enrichment and analysis.","On one hand, the main lessons that can be learned from this project involve interdisciplinary teamwork and resilience. After many attempts to acquire the necessary data to produce this article, we didn't give up and finally succeeded.

On the other hand, we believe it is important to have trust in and find new ways in which technology can help journalism investigate and unmask corruption and tell compelling stories. There exists some technological tool that can be applied to data in any stage of what we call the ""Data Life Cycle” — from the raw data to the analysis platform — that enables investigative opportunities. We integrated the work on different platforms of two major data processing technologies: Microsoft (C#, Power BI and SQL Server) and Google (Spreadsheet, Looker Studio).

For this research we managed to create a workflow where everyone had their assigned tasks and we were able to collaborate seamlessly throughout the process. The manual tasks that each member performed triggered other automatic tasks that fed back into the larger investigation.

Above all, we emphasized teamwork: in order to achieve deeper and higher quality productions, it was necessary to abandon individualism and foster collaboration between different roles within the teams (with data, specific knowledge of the topic, and visualizations).",Spanish,https://www.lanacion.com.ar/politica/publicidad-oficial-bonaerense-axel-kicillof-privilegia-a-los-medios-oficialistas-en-el-reparto-de-nid09102022/,,,,,,,"José Crettaz, journalist

There are many economic sectors in Spain that have been affected by the cartels of companies that illegally distributed public contracts among them.

United States,"ProPublica, The Times-Picayune | The Advocate, WWL-TV",Big,Participant,,Disaster After Disaster,2022-12-11,"Investigation, Explainer, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Illustration, Infographics, Chart, Video, Map, Politics, Environment","QGIS, Google Sheets, CSV, OpenStreetMap, Python, Mapbox","“Disaster After Disaster” is a three-newsroom investigation into the tapestry of dysfunction that has characterized how the U.S. aids disaster survivors, told through the lens of failures and inequities in the programs implemented in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina. Through a novel analysis of state and federal data, we showed that homeowners in poorer and less-white portions of Louisiana, particularly New Orleans, received a smaller share of the resources they needed.","The impacts of “Disaster After Disaster” began almost immediately after the first story was published.

The initial story focused on people facing lawsuits after they used post-Katrina aid through the Road Home program to repair damage to their houses, rather than elevate them to prevent future flooding. Many of those homeowners had been reassured by Road Home representatives that such repairs were allowed.

A decade and a half later, about 3,500 grantees — or 1 of every 9 households that received elevation grants — faced lawsuits for spending money to make their homes livable. Confronted with evidence from our reporting showing that collection efforts were accelerating, and that these lawsuits mostly targeted residents of poor and Black neighborhoods, the state paused collections as it sought federal approval to drop the suits altogether.

The final story of our project has shown signs of potential impact as well. An analysis of the Road Home’s main program, which made payments for repairs to 119,000 Louisiana residents, showed that its grant formula resulted in homeowners in poorer and less white parts of the state getting a smaller share of the resources they needed to rebuild. In the course of our reporting, architects of the Road Home program acknowledged that shortcoming, and one suggested the state should seek federal funding to provide more money to those who had been shortchanged.","Most of the analyses for this project were conducted in Python, primarily using the Pandas library for analysis. All portions of “Disaster After Disaster” involved linking state-generated data about the Road Home program to U.S. Census Bureau statistics on income, poverty and race at the census block group or tract level.

For some analyses, we geocoded addresses using Python and the APIs of various public geocoding services.

We used QGIS and GeoPandas for geographic data exploration and to generate preliminary graphics. These tools also were used to generate files for an interactive map produced using Mapbox.

To analyze the Road Home rebuilding grants, we needed to develop a way to compare payments made to homeowners whose houses differed in size and value. To do so, we developed a metric that compared the total cost of repairing or rebuilding a home (as estimated by state agencies) to the total amount of Road Home funding, other disaster assistance and insurance money the homeowner received.

This allowed us to calculate how close the Road Home program came to meeting its goal, which was to cover the gap between the cost of repairs and money received from insurance and FEMA. The total dollar amounts were aggregated over census block groups so income and race data could be used in the analysis. 

Additional analysis was conducted to compare the impacts of various measures that officials had put in place to mitigate inequities. While those steps had an effect, they did not fully solve the problem, our analysis showed.","The Road Home program — the largest home rebuilding project in U.S. history — was hugely consequential in the remaking of New Orleans and the surrounding area after Hurricane Katrina. The $9 billion effort was designed to ensure that residents who wanted to return to their homes after the flood were able to do so. But the program suffered from a fatal flaw: It capped payments at property value rather than the cost of rebuilding. This meant that wealthier areas, which had higher property values, got more of what they needed, while poorer areas got less.

Some neighborhoods rebounded quickly, while others languished. Today, New Orleans has just 80% of its pre-Katrina population, and some of the neighborhoods where homeowners got less of what they needed are still hollowed out.

Though this approach was never used again in other recovery programs, the failure we highlighted stems from the same philosophy that hampers U.S. disaster response to this day. Programs are primarily designed to prevent recipients from getting more than their property was worth beforehand, rather than ensuring they get what they need to recover.

From the outset 16 years ago, people complained that the Road Home program was unfair. But before our reporting, those allegations were never proven, even after a federal lawsuit, news reports and years of advocacy. The key hurdle was a lack of solid data: State officials refused to share a database with detailed information on payments, and there was no other way to get a comprehensive look at the program.

After persistent attempts by our team, the state eventually relented and released portions of the data. Reporters identified problems with that data as they cleaned and analyzed it. Through an iterative process, the state made additional concessions, and reporters eventually obtained nearly the entire dataset.

It was only at that point that a full analysis could be conducted and a full accounting of the Road Home program finally be brought to light. The project revealed that long-held beliefs about the program were well-founded and provided valuable context for the ongoing patterns of displacement and poverty in New Orleans.","The “Disaster After Disaster” project provided several lessons to our team, both in reporting and data analysis.

The initial dataset of records of Road Home recipients we received from the state of Louisiana, aggregated on the Census block level, contained errors and omissions that could have led to misinterpretation. After we shared our initial findings, state officials claimed that our analysis was both incorrect and impossible based on the dataset they provided. They were at first unwilling to give us better data.

We analyzed key variables using Pandas and Python, looking at their distribution and highlighting cases where these variables did not add up or led to logically impossible outcomes. This analysis, plus persistent reporting, eventually convinced the state to send better, cleaner data. In the end we received anonymized, individual-level data with additional variables to address the errors — something the state initially refused to provide.

This would not have been possible if we had taken the dataset at face value. Instead, we worked to understand the dataset and the architecture of the records so we could tell government employees how to properly query their own data.

Additionally, we consulted with a Census expert to make sure we correctly joined race and socioeconomic data to our Road Home dataset. Because we were working with vintage Census data, we had to sift through old documentation and academic papers that explained how to use and aggregate the data at a block level. It was through this process that we realized that we needed to use race data from sampled Census data instead of the main survey data so we could correctly match it up with the socioeconomic data.",English,https://www.propublica.org/article/how-louisiana-road-home-program-shortchanged-poor-residents,https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/investigations/hurricane-katrina-road-home-unequal-rebuilding-pro-publica/289-2491c290-6db7-4c08-9872-044e2fbe9e93,https://www.propublica.org/article/why-half-of-st-bernard-parish-left-after-hurricane-katrina,https://www.propublica.org/article/why-louisiana-road-home-program-based-grants-on-home-values,https://www.propublica.org/article/katrina-survivors-grant-money-lawsuits,https://www.propublica.org/article/hurricane-katrina-lawsuits-recovery-grants,https://www.nola.com/news/business/map-of-hurricane-katrina-damage-covered-by-road-home/article_f3f4f71c-781e-11ed-bd30-f7ed3a8d2133.html,"Jeff Adelson, Sophie Chou, Sophia Germer, Chris Granger, Lena Groeger, David Hammer, Joel Jacobs, Dan Swenson, Nina Tran, Richard Webster","Jeff Adelson is a data reporter at The Times-Picayune | The Advocate.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Participant,,America’s Highest Earners And Their Taxes Revealed,2022-04-13,"Explainer, News application, Economy","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Svelte","Which people and professions rake in the most income year after year? Which are most adept at shielding that money from the taxman? And what does this tell you about America?

Thanks to IRS data obtained by ProPublica, we showed readers the definitive answers in an engaging, graphical way, revealing the incomes and tax rates of the 400 Americans with the highest incomes from 2013 to 2018. The data reveals a system where the very highest earners, on average, pay far lower tax rates than the merely affluent do. And even among the wealthiest, some have it better than others.","“America’s Highest Earners And Their Taxes Revealed” was part of ProPublica’s “Secret IRS Files” series, which began in 2021 and continues today. 

It’s hard to separate out the effect of one article in the series, which now exceeds 30 stories. But as a whole, the series ignited a debate about wealth and inequality, starting from the day the first article was published, when the White House was forced to answer questions about tax inequality and the IRS commissioner was grilled in Congress. At one point, the Biden administration’s proposed Build Back Better legislation would’ve closed a massive IRA loophole identified by ProPublica in another article in the series and included a wealth tax (an idea doomed by the opposition of Sen. Joe Manchin). That legislation stalled. 

Then, in March 2022, the [Biden administration proposed a new minimum tax on the wealthiest](https://wapo.st/3Nw1H5c), [a departure from past federal tax practices](https://bit.ly/3tWy0m6) and one whose philosophy aligned with the analysis. The odds of major changes are always long — tax policy can take decades to materially alter — but it’s clear that ProPublica’s series [changed the national conversation](https://nyti.ms/3DsZVxa) on the subject.","The data was provided in raw form and contains millions of rows. ProPublica reporters spent months processing and analyzing the material to transform it into a SQL database that reflected key aspects of the tax code in plain English. Given the sensitivity of the material, this was done in a way that allowed for the highest level of data security, a challenge that added considerable logistical hurdles, given the size of the reporting team.

For the America’s Highest Earners analysis, we created queries specifically designed to allow us to follow the flow of taxes for thousands of taxpayers, from income through various deductions and credits to their final tax bill. In addition to this, we set out to compare the highest-income Americans to typical Americans. To do that, we constructed the financial profile of a typical American, based on an analysis of public IRS data, and then calculated the taxes of those Americans. 

To transform the income analysis into a visual story, the reporters and the news apps team held brainstorming meetings to sketch out and iterate upon a visual outline. Those sketches were revised into digital mockups using R, Google Sheets, and Adobe Illustrator. Once we finalized the story direction, the interactive charts and tables were created using D3.js and Svelte.","One extraordinary day, ProPublica received a trove of data that disclosed the income taxes paid by thousands of the nation’s wealthiest citizens over more than 15 years. It was the biggest leak of tax information in U.S. history, and it revealed that America’s titans had paid a stunningly small amount of taxes. In some years, billionaires like Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk owed not a penny in federal income tax. 

Tax experts have long understood that the ultrarich don’t pay their fair share. The data brought to light a pattern fully understood only by the ultrarich and their advisers. These billionaires weren’t cheating. They were avoiding the burdens borne by nearly every other wage-earning American using legal strategies far beyond the reach of ordinary wage earners. This series aimed to use the IRS data to reveal that larger story.

We confronted formidable challenges. The source (or sources) of the leak did not identify themselves to ProPublica, so the first question was whether the information was genuine and accurate. Two reporters spent months transforming a largely undifferentiated mass of data, with millions of rows of information scattered across scores of tables, identified only by the IRS' internal jargon, into a searchable database. Four other reporters and researchers combed through everything from SEC filings and lawsuit records to announcements of lottery winnings, to verify numbers attributed to specific taxpayers.

ProPublica understood it was taking risks in publishing the tax information of some of the world’s wealthiest people, several of them ProPublica donors. Many are litigious. Federal law authorizes the government to prosecute anyone who publishes tax data. ProPublica weighed those risks and concluded it was in the public interest to reveal selected taxpayers’ information, a position we explained in an [editor’s note](https://bit.ly/36IaaBG). We believed, but couldn’t be certain, that the courts would view our stories as protected by the First Amendment. The government has pledged to punish our source but has thus far made no move to prosecute ProPublica. (Several subjects have threatened lawsuits against ProPublica but have not filed any to date; one billionaire sued the IRS for allowing the leak.)

We aimed to put the trove in the largest possible context. That meant moving away from the traditional focus on percent of income, or tax rate, that people pay. Warren Buffett once acknowledged that his tax rate was lower than his secretary’s. Our data told a more powerful story: The ultrawealthy could live lavishly without receiving salaries or other income the IRS deems taxable. We calculated that Buffett and the other 25 richest Americans paid a paltry 3.4% of their wealth growth in taxes, far less than ordinary wage earners paid on their incomes. 

In “America’s Highest Earners And Their Taxes Revealed,” we went beyond our initial focus on wealth and examined taxation through the more traditional prism of income. The data and examples revealed profound disparities and showed that, even when assessed by the standard tax measurement, there are vast inequities in the U.S. tax system.","Taxes are often a dull and arcane subject.

Russia,"«Медиазона», Русская служба «Би-би-си»",Big,Participant,,Потери России в войне с Украиной. Расследование «Медиазоны» и «Би-би-си»,2022-05-06,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, OSINT, Crowdsourcing, Infographics","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, D3.js, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","«Медиазона» совместно с Русской службой «Би-би-си» и командой волонтеров ведет поименный список погибших на войне с Украиной российских солдат. 

Чтобы составить этот список, мы изучаем посты в соцсетях, сообщения в региональных СМИ и публикации на сайтах органов государственной власти. Результаты исследования мы публикуем в виде обновляемой интерактивной инфографики.","Наша публикация стала единственным подробным источником информации о том, что происходит с российской армией на войне с Украиной и какие потери она несет. Число потерь на войне — очень спекулятивная тема (особенно пока боевые действия продолжаются), и мы — не единственные, кто называет число погибших. Уникальность нашего метода заключается в том, что мы можем назвать наименьшее достоверное число, которое подтверждается объективно. 

Наши обновляемые сводки стали источником новостей и текстов для десятков коллег и изданий. Наш метод сбора данных по открытым источникам с привлечением волонтеров и читателей (подробнее о методах — ниже) позволил нам сформировать сообщество людей, которые следят за темой, присылают нам информацию и ждут наших публикаций. Кроме того, мы вдохновили на объединение другие волонтерские группы, которые самоорганизовались для сбора информации о погибших в своем регионе — например, они посещают кладбища, ведут телеграм-каналы или присылают информацию нам. 

За время работы проекта с мая 2022 года общий охват (соцсети, ссылки в других изданиях и так далее) превысил 10 млн человек.","Основная часть работы — это сбор данных по открытым источникам. К ним относятся соцсети (в первую очередь «ВКонтакте»), а также сайты региональных СМИ и телеграм-каналы. Это комбинированный процесс, который сочетает в себе и ручной поиск по ключевым словам, и поиск и извлечение информации при помощи скриптов. 

После поиска информации ее первичной обработкой занимаются волонтеры. В тестовом режиме мы стараемся использовать современные подходы к автоматизированной классификации и извлечению информации, в том числе GPT3. 
Мы учитываем только сообщения о смерти конкретного человека, в которых называется его имя, и это сообщение размещено в российском источнике. Все найденные нами посты мы архивируем при помощи сторонних сервисов.

Затем мы обогащаем данные при помощи автоматических запросов к государственным источникам — например, к реестру наследственных дел. Это позволяет узнать дополнительные детали — например, возраст погибшего, дату смерти, место службы. Иногда мы используем технологию распознавания и сравнения лиц, чтобы найти страницу погибшего. 

Команда волонтеров запустила бота в Telegram, при помощи которого читатели могут проверить, есть ли определенный человек в нашем списке без получения доступа к базе, а также прислать нам информацию о погибшем. Через бот мы получили множество данных от региональных волонтеров, которые фотографируют кладбища

Основная БД — это Google таблица с несколькими уровнями доступа, автоматизированными проверками и правилами по заполнению. Мы постоянно поддерживаем в ней порядок, редактируя и уточняя старые записи, удаляя опечатки и дубли. Поиск дублей был оптимизирован при помощи расстояния Левенштейна. 

Журналисты Медиазоны и Би-би-си повторно проверяют каждое сообщение после волонтеров и разбивают погибших по родам войск, используя для этого в том числе косвенные признаки (например, найденные на фотографиях погибших в соцсетях флаги подразделений на могилах, петлицы, нашивки и тд). 

Для визуализации мы генерируем из таблицы несколько json-файлов, которые служат основой для инфографики. Вся инфографика сделана нами на D3.js без использования готовых решений.","С самого начала российской агрессии в Украине один из главных вопросов — это количество российских потерь. Сбор или распространение этой информации запрещены принятыми в России законами о военной цензуре, поэтому мы не упоминаем имена волонтеров и не раскрываем имена всех журналистов, которые работают над этой темой. При этом для самих изданий эта тема не несет больших рисков: «Медиазона» и «Би-би-си» уже заблокированы в России за освещение войны.

 Такие проекты возникают, когда государство пытается обмануть общество и оперирует двумя «правдами». Официальная риторика заключатеся в том, что общество будет помнить погибших вечно — при этом число этих погибших не сообщается. Цифры, которые изредка сообщает Минобороны, не имеют никакого отношения к реальности — и мы можем это доказать, так как даже в нашем поименном списке погибших больше, чем у МО. 

Обновляемая инфографика на сайте — это лишь вершина айсберга и публичная часть нашей работы. За ней стоит команда волонтеров, которые ежедневно просматривают десятки и сотни некрологов, за каждым из которых стоит чья-то судьба. В будущем (вероятно, когда война закончится) мы планируем опубликовать поименный список целиком — как напоминание о том, какую страшную цену платит общество за агрессию. Мы хотим показать, что все эти люди когда-то жили — и могли бы жить дальше вместо участия в преступной войне. Мы считаем, что без усвоения этого урока ситуация может повториться — и мы хотели бы верить, что наша работа поспособствует тому, чтобы этого не произошло. 

Кроме этого, наша база уникальна для исследовательских целей — как сейчас, так и в будущем. Пока что мы сфокусированы на ее заполнении, поддержании и создании сводок, и не успеваем раскрыть весь ее потенциал. Многотысячный поименный список погибших позволяет проанализировать их социально-демографический состав и будет интересен экономистам; данные о датах, месте, обстоятельствах гибели и местах службы — военным исследователям. Кроме того, десятки тысяч постов и сообщений о гибели позволят проанализировать нарратив, который создавался вокруг этой войны как ее участниками, так и СМИ и государственными органами. 


Уже сейчас мы открываем к ней доступ коллегам из других изданий и исследователям из академической среды. Мы уверены в том, что в будущем, когда эта тема перестанет быть такой рискованной с точки зрения российского законодательства, данные будут пользоваться еще большим спросом.","Помимо самих публикаций сводок, на которые ссылаются наши коллеги, мы обмениваемся данными с журналистами из региональных изданий. Это позволяет и нам, и им уточнять число погибших в конкретном городе или области. По запросу мы помогаем коллегам с подготовкой текстов или сюжетов о погибших на войне или о мобилизации. Мы можем подсказать, где искать информацию, рассказать что-то о конкретном погибшем, о каких-то важных событиях на поле боя и так далее. 

Кроме того, мы рады поделиться нашим опытом по сбору и обработке информации и опытом по поддержанию сложного проекта, выступая на семинарах или журналистских конференциях.","Russian, English",https://zona.media/casualties,https://en.zona.media/article/2022/05/11/casualties_eng,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/18/world/europe/russia-death-toll-war.html,https://www.bbc.com/russian/features-64181570,,,,"Максим Литаврин, редактор дата-отдела «Медиазоны»

United States,CNN,Big,Participant,,Exclusive: Millions in Western aid flowed to churches in Ghana despite years of campaigning against LGBTQI+ rights,2022-12-13,"Investigation, Solutions journalism, Long-form, Cross-border",n/a,"This three-months-long investigation followed aid money from international donors, who pledged to support LGBTQI+ rights globally, going to religious groups with history of anti-queer rhetoric in Ghana. We found that millions of US, UK, German and Italian taxpayers' money went to projects run by or benefiting such groups, who are campaigning for a bill in Ghana that could introduce harsh sentences for identifying as LGBTQI+ or any form of advocacy and education about sexual and gender minorities' rights. This story sheds light on the human impact of the backlash against LGBTQI+ people by those groups who benefited from Western aid.","The story had 232,592 unique visitors on web and mobile. The television package that accompanied the digital write was aired on CNN International’s evening news program, Amanpour, with Christiane Amanpour tweeting the story to her 3 million + followers. 

The story was also shared on Twitter by influential international organizations, such as the Center for Feminist Foreign Policy, AWID and high-profile accounts, such as Shailja Patel and Denis Nzioka. 

It was picked up by Attitude magazine, in a column by activist Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, who highlighted how CNN’s story shows “not only the dire experiences of Ghanaian LGBT+ people but also the millions of foreign money that is funding churches that are openly extremely homophobic and transphobic.” 
 
It’s notable that some leaders within the churches mentioned in the story felt the need to speak to local media about the story, despite their refusal to speak to CNN, showing that they were concerned about our reporting. 

Writers Claire Provost and Nana Darkoa Sekyiamah will be speaking about this story at the 2023 International Journalism Festival in Perugia.","This collaboration across London, Accra and beyond combined data analysis, pressing Western government bodies for answers as well as hearing alarming human stories on the ground. 

Through desk and on-the-ground research, we identified Ghanaian churches and church organizations centered around the Christian Council of Ghana – one of the most vocal critics of sexual and gender rights in the country – and found anti-LGBTQI+ statements made by leaders of these organizations. Following a tip-off that Western governments are still donating money to projects linked to them, we trawled through multiple aid data sources in search of any mention of these groups, in the most recent five years for which figures were available (2016 to 2020). 

Aid data is far from transparent or user-friendly. It took scrupulous data cleaning, merging and filtering in Excel and Google Sheets to identify a list of donations to projects run by or benefiting these anti-LBGTQI+ organizations. We went to the relevant authorities and intermediaries in the donor countries to seek confirmations and responses, but we knew the list is likely longer. 

Some donors told us their aid had stopped after beneficiaries made public anti-LGBTQI+ statements but we didn't stop at that. We presented them with evidence of their pledges to protect sexual and gender minorities worldwide, against a list of nearly a decade worth of anti-LGBTQI+ statements and activities in Ghana. This back-and-force communication resulted in additional disclosures and statements. 

Alongside the written piece, a TV package was produced. CNN's investigations team went to Ghana to speak to the victims of discrimination as well as to ask local anti-LGBT leaders questions face-to-face. Most of them declined to comment.","Every year, Western governments spend billions of dollars as international aid – money that is supposed to help poorer countries achieve development goals and respond to humanitarian crises. These funds that flow across borders (and often through chains of intermediaries) deserve far more attention from journalists. There are gaps in transparency around this spending, however, and reporting is difficult. Not all donors disclose the same amount of information about their funded projects and the direct and indirect recipients of their spending; this information isn't always formatted in the same way; and there can be significant time lags between when money is spent and when data becomes available. 

In Ghana, the draconian anti-LGBTQI+ bill – which can still be ratified in Parliament any day ¬– has left those affected in constant fear and uncertainty. While its proposal has drawn sharp international and local criticism, church leaders play a central role in political and social life of the country and few dare to go against them. Interviews by CNN corroborated earlier evidence by human rights groups, such as OutRight Action International, that the anti-LGBTQI+ campaigning and the bill have already contributed to an increasingly hostile climate towards sexual and gender minorities. One of the reporters for this story is based in Ghana – it undoubtedly took courage to question the actions of people who have such a heavy weight in the society.","There are other public interest and accountability stories to be told using these sources of information on international aid spending – combined with other types of reporting. Cross-border collaborations between journalists in donor and recipient countries can help follow the money on the ground and better understand the consequences of this spending. 

This is an example of a data-driven investigation that didn't require advanced programming skills but instead relied on what every good accountability story needs: attention to detail, perseverance and compassion. Data is only a jumping point. 

It is also a data story that comes to life when paired with sensitive human-interest reporting, showing the real-world impact behind the numbers. 
 
The framing of the story is also a lesson in how journalists can go tell stories situated in developing countries but where there is shared culpability or responsibility in the West. Western donors are being held to account here as much as Ghanaian churches.",English,https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/13/africa/us-europe-aid-lgbtqi-ghana-churches-investigation-as-equals-intl-cmd-dg/index.html,,,,,,,"Words by Claire Provost and Nana Darkoa Sekyiamah,

Pregnancy at that age involves significant health risk and are often associated with sexual violence. The article bring attention to this fact, using data visualization and simple illustration.","The article had a great reception among our readers and raised awareness about a sensitive topic, responsively.","R and the tidyverse package were used for data analysis and initial charts. Data was collected used httr package to interact with national healthcare system's API. 

Adobe Illustrator was used for overall design and layout.","Under Brazilian law, abortion is a right guaranteed by law in cases of life-threatening pregnancies, sexual violence or fetal anencephaly. However, in June 2022, a judge from the state of Santa Catarina took initiatives that prevented an 11-year-old girl, victim of rape, from having an abortion.

This fact was neither unique nor isolated: in August 2020, ultraconservatives harassed employees of a hospital where a 10-year-old girl, raped by her stepfather, would have a legal abortion. 

Both cases had great national repercussions and also exposed a concerning reality: 243 thousand girls gave birth in ten years in Brazil.","There are two main lessons. One is how to represent visually sensitive information in a way that the data remember us that behind the numbers are real and vulnerable people. It reflects in the choices we made about colors, illustrations and which visualizations to present.

The other is to, when it is possible, to go to microdata. Our article uses microdata that is only accessible through the national healthcare system's API. With this more granular data, we could expand our analysis beyond the numbers of births per year. One example of that is the chart that presents the age of the masculine progenitor in the cases analysed.

In 72,6% of the births involving girls at 14 or younger, there is no information about that male progenitor. When it is available, 79,3% are older than 18 years.

Запад объявил охоту за активами олигархов, в том числе и за их суперъяхтами. 

К лету 2022 года европейские власти успели арестовать 16 яхт, которые связаны с близкими к Кремлю людьми. 

Авторы проанализировали почти 5 млн километров маршрутов 27 яхт российских олигархов и чиновников за последние 14 лет. Мы выяснили, как они бежали от санкций, где любили проводить время до войны и откуда в маршрутах суперъяхт берутся «белые пятна».","Это исследование позволило увидеть, как влиятельные российские олигархи и чиновники скрывались от санкций после начала полномасштабного вторжения России на территорию Украины. С первых дней войны, желая остаться безнаказанными и сохранить своё дорогостоящее имущество, многие из них попытались избежать наказания и покинуть акватории «недружественных» государств. Исследование раскрыло пути их побега.

Помимо поиска морских путей ухода от санкций, авторы провели масштабный анализ маршрутов круизов, которые совершали суда, связанные с высокопоставленными россиянами. Это позволило составить представление о том, как привыкли отдыхать и путешествовать владельцы суперъяхт, а также показать, как они лишились излюбленных мест отдыха. Помимо этого авторы обнаружили «белые пятна» на карте передвижений судов — места, где они отключали свои транспондеры и пропадали из вида систем наблюдения.","Работа над материалом потребовала обработки большого объема пространственных данных. Для сопоставления локаций и информации о передвижениях яхт, а также поиска закономерностей, команда использовала программные инструменты для анализа геоданных, такие как geopandas. Помимо этого для качественного анализа полезным оказалось построение моделей в QGIS и на платформе Google Earth Pro. Это позволило удобно работать с данными тем членам команды, которые не владеют программированием.

The original population of Brazil was victim of diseases, slavery and deliberate genocide and conquest, but manage to resist up to this day. In 20210, 274 surviving languages were spoken and indigenous peoples numbered around 900,000. In recent years, they faced increasing harassment and violence perpetrated by farmers that want to invade their land and watched a dismantlement of protective institutions. 

The data we received from the researcher, had the etymology of all names of Brazilian municipalities, and there was an effort by Nexo team to filter which information was suitable for publication. 

We thought that a publication regarding the indigenous etymology of municipalities would be a good way to remember the immense impact the indigenous people had on Brazilian society and Brazilian Portuguese. The most impressive influence of indigenous people were on place names (e.g., the capital cities of Curitiba - 'a lof pines' - and Manaus - 'the mother of gods').

It took a week-long work to look at each name to check if they were actually of indigenous origin.",This project is a good example of cooperation between researchers and data journalists to produce great stories.,Portuguese,https://www.nexojornal.com.br/grafico/2022/04/14/A-origem-ind%C3%ADgena-dos-nomes-dos-munic%C3%ADpios-brasileiros,https://www.instagram.com/p/CguC8t-tApB/?igshid=NTdlMDg3MTY%3D,,,,,,"Main authors:

United States,Vox,Big,Participant,,How migration has shaped the World Cup,2022-12-08,"Explainer, Cross-border, Database, Chart, Sports, Immigration","D3.js, Canvas, Json, Adobe Creative Suite, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, OpenStreetMap, Python",The 2022 Qatar World Cup has the highest share of foreign-born players in the event’s history. We collected the data on over 800 foreign players throughout the history of the World Cup from 1930 to 2022 to show that migration has shaped the World Cup since the very beginning. The story also explains how players come to represent countries other than their birthplaces overtime and role of FIFA in the nationalization of the sport.,"The internationalization of soccer is a story that comes up with each World Cup, during which the misalignment of allegiance and representation and racist comments toward players often become topics of discussion. While some might think that there existed an earlier simpler time when each country had its own pure form of soccer without foreign players, our data analysis has found that having foreign players on World Cup teams isn’t a recent phenomenon. In fact, migrant players shaped national soccer teams throughout the history of the World Cup. 

The World Cup isn't just a sport event for soccer fans. Instead, it attracts a global audience, soccer fans or not. The event creates an opportunity — especially when Morocco made history as the first African team to enter the semifinals — for the global audience to rethink who can represent a country and to see that soccer players are in fact another form of labor migrants. We got an overwhelming number of shares and positive responses from social media and emails. One reader wrote to us saying: ""Probably the first time I’ve been interested in a World Cup story."" The story was also well received by the researchers studying international migration, whose work helped explain the data in the story.","We collected the data on foreign-born players at the World Cup between 1930 and 2022 by scrapping data from squad rosters on Wikipedia using R and Python. 

We then cleaned the data by handling national boundary changes, country name changes, and naming inconsistencies and misspellings on a case-by-case basis as explained [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b8ansQNC9kxLJbk6LNYxFqXYOxCjVN40rz74qgM0CkU/edit). 

We then cross-referenced the resulting data with a database on foreign-born players at the World Cup (1930-2018) compiled by Gijs van Campenhout, professor of geography at Utrecht University, which enabled us to identify places where national boundary changes or country name changes justified marking a player as “foreign-born” or not “foreign-born,” to the best of our ability. We also interviewed Gijs and other researchers studying the field to validate our approach and data.

After compiling the database for the project, we analyzed the data in R, tested various chart forms and interactive elements with canvas and SVG in Observable notebooks with mostly d3, and compiled the final project in a Rails app.","The fact that this year's event happened in Qatar, a country with very strict nationalization rules and a bad reputation for its treatment of migrant labors, on which team close to 40 percent of the players were not born in Qatar, creates an interesting tension and an urgent need to understand the connections among them. This story tries to connect the dots. The loosened nationalization rules in reaction to globalization and FIFA's opposition to the denationalization of the sport are two strong forces that have shaped the event. The 2022 World Cup is a window into the complex and intertwined history of that.

The most time consuming part of the project is to make sure we can stand by the data. For one, it's scrapped from Wikipedia; another thing we were cautious about from the very beginning is the definition of foreign-born, and whether that was an inclusive metric to talk about migration in the World Cup. To solve the first issue, we cross referenced our data meticulously with an external database by migration scholars on the same topic with a different methodology. We checked each different case to make sure they were different for justifiable reasons. The second issue isn't solvable but we tried to interview the experts on migration, and noted the limitation of using ""foreign-born"" as a metric for migration in the story (last section.) 

While many newsrooms wrote stories about the large number of foreign-born players at the Qatar 2022 World Cup, the coverage of 2022 alone makes it feel like a recent phenomenon. What we tried to do with the story is to put the 2022 event in context of the entire history of the sport and to show people that it's nothing special to have foreign players on the World Cup stage. Our view on who can represent a country may not live up to the reality.","There are several things worth mentioning about this project: 

1. It is a story published on the topic of the World Cup, but what it really talks about is global migration, identity, and nationality. The international event created an opportunity to talk about these topics, which is a useful technique for journalists who want to cover a specific coverage area. It also makes this story stand out from other World Cup coverage. 
2. The project tried to answer the question: Have there been more foreign players at the World Cup in recent years? If so — or if not — what does it say about globalization, migration, and capitalism? The question prompted us to compile the database, and the database showed us the complex history of migration at the World Cup. The mindset of using datasets to answer a question, and if no database, creating one, is useful for data stories in all coverage areas.
3. Reporting helps data stories go beyond the datasets. Although we started with the database of foreign-born players, what we found out during our reporting process by interviewing experts gave us the story direction and insights of the data that would not have been possible by ourselves.",English,https://www.vox.com/c/world/2022/12/8/23471181/how-migration-has-shaped-the-world-cup,,,,,,,"Authors: Stephen Osserman and Youyou Zhou

United States,CNN,Big,Participant,,Visualizing the inequality of abortion access in a post-Roe America,2022-06-30,"Explainer, Breaking news, Database","Scraping, Mapping","Just days after the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade – leaving abortion laws up to each state – CNN published this in-depth interactive showing who would be most affected by the decision and what abortion access looks like in each state. CNN also analyzed the driving distance from every census tract in the country to the nearest abortion clinic in a possible scenario where abortion became illegal in 26 states, and found a vastly unequal landscape of access to the procedure, with many Americans facing the prospect of driving more than 300 miles to the closest facility.","294,106 views from launch through end of 2022. A final database for our audience to use to see the routes from their area/state to the nearest clinic.","We generated our own database to understand how the Court's decision would impact access in the US and who it would impact. While we had data on where abortion providers were in the US, we could not anticipate — when given the ability — which states would change their laws. So we calculated every possible driving route from every census tract (4 million routes in all) and tied them to available demographic data at that level. This allowed us to analyze and update our database when states would weigh in on the SCOTUS decision","While the leaked draft opinion tipped our team off to the likely SCOTUS decision on this case, many variables remained in getting our audience useful information in a quick manner after the final decision. We therefore ran many scenarios in order to deliver as much of an analysis as we could, as soon as we could.",Anticipation can lead to great outcomes in breaking news. We started on this project when the Supreme Court was slated to take up this landmark case in the fall of 2021.

United States,USA TODAY,Big,Participant,,Dying for Care,2022-03-10,"Investigation, Database, News application, Infographics, Covid 19, Health","Animation, Scraping, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, R, RStudio, Python, Svelte","Dying for Care tapped death reports, resident demographics and ownership records to identify the nursing home chain whose records revealed the highest death rate during COVID-19's worst months, employing statistical regression to control for exacerbating circumstances. The series then dug deeper on an issue highlighted during the first story: short staffing. Using federal timesheet data for each home, reporter Jayme Fraser identified facilities that missed government benchmarks and yet were never cited for it, based on enforcement data. As a whole, through data reporting and shoe leather, the series revealed appalling impunity for abysmal care.","Within 24 hours of the first story publishing, the White House reached out. The Biden administration had a proposal for nursing home reforms in the works, and staffers wanted to incorporate our findings. Real estate investment trusts like the one that owns Trilogy, the focus of our first story, had not been on their radar; our reporting provided insight into the financial drivers behind low staffing levels. The stories also informed the administration’s effort this year to tackle problems at the chainwide level for the first time. 

Congress reacted swiftly to USA TODAY’s investigation as well. U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush called for congressional hearings into the operations of “profiteering, cold-hearted” nursing home companies during the pandemic. In September, Congress held that hearing, digging into complex ownership structures at the nation’s largest operators, some backed by REITs, and highlighting the plight of overworked, low-paid staff.

David Grabowski, a leading nursing home researcher from Harvard and congressional advisor on Medicare, said USA TODAY’s investigation had impact even before it published. Because of our conversations with him, he brought REITs to the attention of the National Academies group studying possible reforms. As a result, REITS were included in the group's final 600-page report.","Reporter Jayme Fraser performed analysis in R and occasionally shared data with the larger reporting team in Excel or Google Sheets. Collaborator Jeff Kelly Lowenstein, a freelancer and professor at Grand Valley State University, did work in SPSS and Microsoft Access. 

The federal government developed a methodology to determine which nursing homes outperformed expectations on COVID-19 infections and deaths, awarding bonuses to top scorers. Reporter Jayme Fraser adapted this methodology, using Poisson regression to control for resident characteristics. The chain with the highest raw death rate based on its own reports, Trilogy Health Services, also was tops using the regression method. (Identifying chain ownership was its own task that included Selenium-scraped, archived versions of chain websites for property lists.)

Outputs of the regression produced numbers for every U.S. nursing home, enabling us to create a unique A-to-F grading system on the stress test brought by COVID-19's peak. Chris Amico of USA TODAY's Storytelling Studio used Svelte and Mapbox to turn the results into a high-utility consumer search tool.

Separately, to identify how many facilities with substandard staffing are punished for it, we drew on the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ""STRIVE"" index for each nursing home. STRIVE indicates the number of caregiver hours expected in each facility based on resident need. By marrying these numbers with timesheet data (the Payroll-Based Journal database from CMS), we were able to identify facilities whose staff fell short of the government's own expectations. Further marrying this dataframe with enforcement data showed which subset received citations. The answer: not many.

Graphics specialists Ramon Padilla and Carlie Procell delivered most of the data results for each story as ""scrollytelling"" features, a frequently used USA TODAY technique. These employed Adobe Illustrator, After Effects and Svelte to animate charts and images as their own narrative.","We presented Trilogy Health Services detailed findings weeks before our planned publication. There was no response until the last minute, when company officials said they'd erroneously over-reported COVID-19 deaths to the federal govenment. We asked them exactly which numbers they had reported incorrectly, at which facilities, and why it happened. They responded with an Excel file of aggregate data and an emailed list of four broad categories of errors Trilogy said it made. Our run date was postponed so we could explore their response.

Company officials declined to give us copies of the data Trilogy planned to resubmit. They also declined to provide anonymized examples of their misreporting. All they offered was a new set of death totals by state and by week, in contrast to our facility-level weekly death counts. That made it extremely hard to verify Trilogy's assertion that 40% of its reported deaths shouldn't count.

Absent documentation for each death or group of deaths Trilogy proposed to eliminate, we decided to see what our results would look like if we took Trilogy’s revised figures at face value. We found Trilogy would remain significantly above the industry average for the 2020-21 winter surge. In the end, we published the numbers Trilogy originally reported, the company's assertions about its own errors and our best estimate of what they would mean if true.

When Trilogy later submitted its new numbers to the government, it was the biggest COVID-19 death revision by any operator during the pandemic. The feds told us they planned to review it, and we requested documentation of that review via FOIA. Months later, we are still awaiting answers.

Developing the project and targeting reporting efforts required stitching together more than a dozen data sources. We had to geocode and match addresses, align myriad time units, keep track of various reporting requirements, untangle differing definitions of COVID cases and staff titles, and consider which data points would be most reliable amid a global pandemic. 

Notably, our dataset on the REITs collecting rent from the nation’s largest nursing home operators required extensive public records digging to build a spreadsheet from scratch. Because it was unique, it enabled us to answer questions regulators couldn't about the pandemic. While the feds focused on individual facilities, we were able to analyze outcomes at the level where decisions are often made: operating company or owner. This work identified the need for greater scrutiny of the real estate landlords involved in the industry. 

Advanced statistical techniques added authority to our reporting and cut off the most common defenses of poor outcomes (resident health, regional pandemic outbreaks). After publication, David Zimmerman, a retired researcher who led the design of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ quality indicators for nursing homes, wrote: “I am so impressed with the work that you folks have done in the two articles that I’ve read and the various supplemental things you had in each of the articles. I haven’t seen anything like this ever, actually, but particularly the methodology.”","One lesson is that government tools can be repurposed. The feds created a formula that could highlight the best performers among nursing homes facing down COVID-19, treating everyone fairly by controlling for local differences. Reporter Letitia Stein recognized that this technique could also highlight the worst players. It was a terrific insight. 

Similarly, reporter Jayme Fraser re-used a federal formula designed to calculate Medicare reimbursements -- an approach used in a study by a Harvard researcher. The formula shows how many employees the government expects to be hired at each nursing home, giving us a number that could be compared with actual staffing. It's a difficult-to-refute benchmark: the government's own expectations. We were able to show that regulators allowed 96% of facilities to miss this benchmark and get away with it.

Whenever possible, a second set of data eyes can help. USA TODAY's Data Team uses a second data reporter to review the lead data reporter's analytical code in each major project. In this case, Aleszu Bajak was able to replicate Jayme Fraser's work independently and run alternative models that gave additional confidence in her results. Data reporter Kevin Crowe reviewed her code on the second major story focused on understaffing.",English,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/03/10/usa-today-investigation-exposes-nursing-home-failures-during-covid/6853718001/,https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/2022/12/01/skilled-nursing-facilities-staffing-problems-biden-reforms/8318780001/,,,,,,"Jayme Fraser (primary data reporter),Letitia Stein,Nick Penzenstadler,Jeff Kelly Lowenstein,Chris Amico,Ramon Padilla, Carlie Procell","Jayme Fraser is an investigative data journalist for USA TODAY based in the Rocky Mountain West but reporting on the nation.

Brazil,Agência Pública,Big,Participant,,"Despacho de presidente do Ibama pode custar ao menos R$ 3,6 bilhões à União",2022-06-27,"Investigation, Explainer, Open data, Chart, Politics, Environment, Human rights","Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Figma, Flourish","Destrinchamos neste projeto o possível impacto do despacho nº 11996516/2022, assinado no início de 2022 pelo então presidente do Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (Ibama) e que invalidava a notificação de infratores ambientais via edital para a apresentação de alegações finais. A reportagem mostrou que a decisão pode custar ao menos R$ 3,6 bilhões à União, já que poderia levar 60% das multas aplicadas entre 2008 e 2019 a prescrever. A apresentação de alegações finais é uma oportunidade não obrigatória de o autuado complementar sua defesa antes da avaliação pela autoridade julgadora.","O trabalho possibilita o entendimento das consequências de uma ação do então presidente do Ibama que, sem a devida publicização e explicação pela imprensa, não seria compreendida, por se tratar de um tema jurídico e específico a quem atua na área. Essa ação, que foi analisada e explicada pela reportagem, pode afetar ao menos 6.297 multas notificadas por edital, de acordo com nossa apuração. Antes da reportagem, não se tinha nenhuma estimativa baseada em dados da quantidade de processos que poderiam ser afetados e do dinheiro que pode ser perdido. 

A partir dessa reportagem, publicamos ainda um segundo levantamento (link número 2) sobre as multas que já haviam sido anuladas até então por consequência dessa ação. Com base em dados obtidos via Lei de acesso à informação, descobrimos que o decreto havia anulado 164 multas, o que significava a perda de, ao menos, R$ 42,8 milhões aos cofres públicos. Esse trabalho revelou ainda que madeireiros estavam entre os principais beneficiários da medida.

Após a publicação, os dados levantados pelas reportagens foram solicitados por organizações que desenvolvem ações na justiça para barrar retrocessos ambientais, como o Instituto de Direito Coletivo, que usou os dados que obtivemos para elaborar uma ação civil pública na Justiça Federal do estado do Amazonas pedindo a declaração de nulidade do decreto.

A reportagem também foi republicada em 21 sites brasileiros, como UOL, Carta Capital e Brasil de Fato.","A metodologia adotada para a extração e análise de dados está descrita em repositório próprio no Github da Agência Pública: https://github.com/apublica/despacho-ibama. Os dados da investigação inicial são de duas fontes diferentes, o Painel do Orçamento Federal e o portal de Dados Abertos do Ibama. A partir do recebimento de um pedido feito via Lei de Acesso à Informação, incorporamos novas fontes de dados, como informações da Receita Federal. Utilizamos nessa reportagem editores de planilhas (como o Google Sheets e Excel) e códigos em Python.","Durante o governo de Jair Bolsonaro, além do incentivo retórico a crimes ambientais em biomas protegidos, como a floresta amazônica, houve também atuação institucional para flexibilizar as leis de proteção ambiental. O despacho do então presidente do Ibama, Eduardo Bim é um importante exemplo dessa atuação na prática.

Outra informação importante de mencionar é que havíamos pedido uma estimativa do total de multas que poderiam ser anuladas por consequência do despacho citado via Lei de Acesso à Informação, mas o Ibama disse que o dado não existia. Entretanto, pouco tempo depois, o órgão respondeu o requerimento de informação feito por um parlamentar e acessado pela Agência Pública: o despacho pode anular 60% de todos os processos entre 2008 e 2019, o que equivale a 42 mil multas. Não seria possível chegar neste número apenas pelos dados abertos pela limitação explicada na metodologia. 

Desde 2008, em casos em que apresentar ou não as alegações finais não afeta a multa do autuado por crimes ambientais, a notificação para essa apresentação é feita via edital, mas esse procedimento foi anulado retroativamente com o despacho 11996516/2022. A prescrição de grande quantidade das multas ocorre porque, com a invalidação da notificação por edital, a última etapa válida do processo sancionatório se torna a etapa anterior à mesma. Como muitos processos tiveram a notificação há mais de três anos ou cinco anos (prazos de prescrição), eles podem prescrever automaticamente.","Acreditamos que o ponto principal a ser aprendido é a importância de ir além da superfície de uma pauta, em especial quando estamos tratando de assuntos tão relevantes como medidas que garantem impunidade para criminosos ambientais. Na época, várias reportagens saíram na imprensa sobre o despacho, mas, na nossa avaliação, elas não conseguiram explicar e trazer dados que mostrassem o tamanho do seu impacto potencial. Publicamos a reportagem depois da maioria dos veículos, mas, em função dos novos dados — que mostraram que o valor a ser perdido poderia financiar o Ministério do Meio Ambiente por um ano — conseguimos pautar novamente a imprensa, dessa vez com uma reportagem mais ampla e aprofundada, que trouxe dados e relatos dos servidores do Ibama. Além disso, acreditamos que a reportagem mostra que vale a pena dedicar tempo e recursos para mergulhar em assuntos de difícil compreensão. Os pormenores jurídicos do despacho foram entendidos por meio de diversas entrevistas e leituras, esforço que foi essencial para entregar um trabalho completo e que causou impacto real — a exemplo do trabalho ter sido usado como base em uma ação civil pública que busca a nulidade da medida. O contato direto com os servidores técnicos do órgão também auxiliou a entregar um trabalho mais certeiro, o que gerou diversos retornos positivos. A pauta mostra a importância de aliar o jornalismo de dados com entrevistas e outros métodos de apuração. Ela surgiu de uma dica de uma fonte, mas só pôde se sustentar pelo trabalho realizado de forma independente.",Portuguese,https://apublica.org/2022/06/despacho-de-presidente-do-ibama-pode-custar-ao-menos-r-36-bilhoes-a-uniao/,https://apublica.org/2022/07/madeireiros-foram-principais-beneficiados-por-canetada-de-bim-no-ibama/,https://direitocoletivo.org.br/idc-ingressa-com-acao-na-justica-federal-contra-atos-do-presidente-do-ibama/,,,,,"Laura Scofield, Bianca Muniz, Paula Bianchi","Fundada em 2011 por repórteres mulheres, a Pública é a primeira agência de jornalismo investigativo sem fins lucrativos do Brasil.

United States,CNN,Big,Participant,,What redistricting looks like across the country,2022-11-08,"Explainer, Long-form, Database","Microsoft Excel, Python, ArcGIS with Spatial Analyst extension

R
HTML/CSS/SVG/Javascript (NextJS)","The 2022 midterms marked the first time candidates ran in redrawn congressional districts after the 2020 census. US law requires that each of the 435 districts in the House of Representatives have the same number of people, which means districts are evaluated and redrawn every 10 years.

CNN’s interactive allowed users to toggle between two national maps to see how redistricting has changed the country after the census, based on how the residents voted for president in 2020. It also allowed the reader to view each state to take a closer look at how each one has/hasn't changed since 2010.","Overall pageviews were 1.3 million across the entire project (combining the lead national page link and all 50 individual state links) for the year. That makes this project the No. 4 interactive on CNN.com for the entire year, and the top interactive for 2022 that was launched within that same year (our other top interactives are ongoing trackers, such as the CNN Storm Tracker).
 
CNN’s project provided critical analysis and information to our audiences about some of the most hotly contested congressional races in the country, highlighted by the top state pages receiving pageviews, which in order are: California, Ohio, Georgia, Virginia and Texas. Redistricting can have a considerable impact on the voting power of political parties and racial/ethnic groups, so we wanted to analyze these changes, focusing on both the political and demographic effects that will be in place for the next decade.","Every 10 years, US states redraw their congressional district boundaries to account for population changes recorded in the decennial census. This process can alter the political landscape. We used ArcGIS to compile the new boundary shapefiles, block-level voting-age population counts from the Census, and 2020 election results from Harvard Dataverse, which were provided at the voting precinct level. To allocate 2020 presidential election results to the new congressional districts, it was necessary to do a “spatial join” of the voting precinct data to the new districts. In cases where precincts were split, a second spatial join was performed to attach block-level voting-age population to the split geographies, which informed how we allocated votes among the split areas.

A similar technique was used to calculate the demographics for the new districts. We used block-level voting-age population, along with block-equivalency files for the new districts, to tabulate the demographic profile for each new district.
After the spatial analyses were complete, it was possible to tabulate 2020 vote totals and race/ethnicity profiles for the new congressional districts, which we wanted to display on maps for a visual comparison to the old districts. For the final presentation, we worked through multiple design iterations on Figma to find the most user-friendly and simple way to make the complicated process of redistricting accessible and helpful for readers, with an eye on making it as mobile-friendly as possible. The design focused on using shapes, text and color to complement the maps and avoided any imagery to keep it as lightweight, quick and accessible as possible. 

We created an automated pipeline to tie the election and demographic data to the old and new shapefiles and output a compressed pre-projected topojson file for each state. This, along with pre-rendered html pages (via NextJS), enabled faster loading and display.","Every 10 years, US states redraw their congressional district boundaries to account for population changes recorded in the decennial census. This process can alter the political landscape for the next 10 years, and we wanted to analyze how the political leanings and demographic attributes of these new districts might change voting power in all 50 states. But historical election data and race/ethnicity data aren’t readily available for these new geographies, so we had to do the analyses and tabulations ourselves. Over the course of several months, we calculated 2020 election data and demographics for the new districts to measure the impacts of these changes. Making the analysis as accurate as possible was in some cases painstaking and tedious work. The smallest geography we had available for 2020 election data was at the precinct level, though in many cases new districts were formed by splitting precincts. In these cases, it was necessary to do another spatial join of voting-age population at the block level to the split precincts so we could estimate the number of votes that should be allocated to each portion of the split precinct. This was often a manual process, inspecting the map for splits that the software may not have identified, or dealing with census blocks that were split by the new lines, which required analysis of satellite imagery to determine how to best allocate that block’s population. This added significant time to our analysis, but was worth the effort to provide the best estimate possible.

Breaking news often pulled us off this project so it took significant time to pull the data together as we juggled other priorities on a small team.","We spent time considering what questions readers would have about the process and what would be helpful context for them to understand the effects, a crucial step in the process that journalists should factor in when deciding which information to show and explain. It was very important for us to add those additional layers of context so that readers could understand not only how the lines changed, but who changed them and who was affected by those changes. To that end, we added who was responsible for selecting the final maps both in 2010 and 2020 and an additional section on demographics for each district for the old and new maps to understand who lives there.",English,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/california-redistricting-map/,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/ohio-redistricting-map/,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/georgia-redistricting-map/,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/virginia-redistricting-map/,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2022/politics/us-redistricting/texas-redistricting-map/,,"Janie Boschma, Renée Rigdon, Byron Manley and Ethan Cohen

trade transactions from 2014 to 2016 - eightfold as was discovered by Sergey Magnitsky.

130 companies across 18 countries, 28 Russian and 11 foreign banks, Russian companies with already tarnished reputations, Russian custom authorities, PEPs and officials were involved in the laundering mechanism. 
 
What distinguishes these trade deals is the subject - injection molding machines, which were not only non-existent but also sold at prices hundred times exceeding market`s
Allegedly laundered money had been stolen from Russian banks, which subsequently had their licences revoked, by participants of the scheme.","Upon publishing this investigation we received a plethora of requests from other journalists. Not only they were genuinely interested in tools and methods we had used, but this investigation raised awareness about TBML in them.
In addition, our Czech colleagues from Transparency International – Czech Rebublic were so impressed by done job that they launched and published their own [investigation](https://www.transparency.cz/publikace-a-analyzy/analytical-report-the-first-czech-russian-laundromat-exposed/) in the wake of the aforementioned one.
Moreover, our work was critically acclaimed by Oliver Bullough and Louise Shelley.","First of all, this investigation required meticulous work with sources. What started as a sole document from a whistleblower morphed into several months of gathering information from various databases, OSINT, thorough qualitative analysis of all found correlations and never-ceasing fact checking. It was necessary to find and verify information about contragents and their beneficiaries which in turn led to a red flag methodology that made identifying suspicious transactions possible. Because this project required the utmost responsibility, much of the analysis work had to be done manually.

Only at early stages, for preliminary analysis, we used software algorithms based on statistical methods for searching for suspicious transactions. However, not all suspicious transactions were verified as money laundering, thus were excluded from the final iteration of the investigation. 

One of the biggest challenges was striking the balance between building a model that is simple enough to explain the money laundering scheme to the casual reader and building a model complete enough not to hide all those involved in criminal acts.","Unlike most investigations this one is not based on the leakage of data. The wistleblower provided us with just one dubious customs declaration and the rest was retrieved via public sources, variuos data bases, in particular Import Genius.

And through selector, readers can choose the legislation they are interested in and see the entire process.","By simplifying the complex legislative data, we not only present the legislative process, but also set indicators such as bills that are important to both parties, bills that are pushed by minor parties but ignored by the major parties, priority bills and controversial bills. 
This allows readers not only to search for specific bills, but also to quickly browse important but frequently blocked bills through the indicators. Through the translation of legislative data, we aim to increase the level of public discussion and accelerate the passage of bills by allowing readers to focus on important legislation.","We use the R language to collect and analyze data, as well as input all of the legislative information into a selector, allowing readers to freely search for legislation of interest, rather than having to read multiple difficult-to-understand PDF files to understand the complete history of the legislation.","Each legislation has its unique characteristics, and finding meaningful indicators is the biggest challenge when reading these data. However, through discussions with experts, we were able to visualize and analyze the data, greatly increasing its readability. 

Whether or not each legislation passes often determines the direction of Taiwan's social progress. By analyzing the process of these legislations, we can infer the reasons for their non-passage.

Em parceria com o pesquisador David Nemer e o Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society da Universidade de Harvard, o projeto traz ao público informações exclusivas e análises que geralmente ficam restritas à academia, lançando luz sobre narrativas inautênticas, seus atores e seu financiamento.","Desde julho de 2022, o projeto Sentinela Eleitoral busca não apenas desmentir informações falsas ou apontar os principais atores da desinformação, mas entender ainda de que forma pessoas e grupos estão se utilizando de mentiras para manipular o debate e a opinão pública. Investigamos, entre outros, o papel das principais redes sociais na disseminação da desinformação eleitoral - e a reação (ou falta dela) das plataformas -, o uso de verbas públicas nas campanhas de manipulação do debate público, e a participação de influenciadores da extrema direita americana na narrativa da suposta fraude nas eleições.

Diversas reportagens do especial Sentinela Eleitoral apontaram as relações entre Bolsonaro e seus filhos e influenciadores da extrema direita americana, e como o bolsonarismo estava seguindo a cartilha de Donald Trump antes e depois dos resultados das eleições, como ficou ainda mais evidente com a invasão e destruição do Congresso, do Supremo Tribunal Federal e do Palácio da presidência em Brasília no dia 8 de janeiro.

Uma investigação recente do Sentinela Eleitoral revelou os códigos usados por bolsonaristas para combinar as últimas etapas de invasão da Praça dos Três Poderes nas redes sociais e aplicativos de mensagem, como o termo ""Festa da Selma"", uma alusão a ""Selva"" — expressão usada por militares brasileiros — e a hashtag #BrazilianSpring, cunhada por Steve Bannon. A reportagem repercutiu dentro e fora do Brasil, sendo citada por diversos veículos internacionais, como New York Times, The Guardian, Chequeado (Argentina), La Republica, (Peru) e Observador (Portugal).

Além de serem republicadas por dezenas de veículos nacionais, algumas reportagens do Sentinela Eleitoral também foram traduzidas para o inglês e o espanhol e republicadas por veículos internacionais como Brazilian Report, NACLA, Coda Story (EUA), elDiário (Espanha), elDiarioAR, Infobae (Argentina), El País (Bolívia), Interferencia (Chile), Pie de Página (México), openDemocracy, Latin America Bureau (Reino Unido), Worldcrunch (França).","Utilizamos a biblioteca snscrape do Python para a coleta de tweets de uma determinada pesquisa no Twitter, usando operadores de busca avançada. O código coleta dados sobre o tweet (data de publicação, conteúdo do tweet, hashtags, engajamento, links externos) e sobre o usuário que publicou (id, username, se é verificado ou não). Com essas informações, é possível ver as hashtags mais frequentes, usuários mais ativos em uma discussão, links compartilhados, cronologia de um determinado assunto no Twitter.
Além disso, monitoramos a circulação de mensagens nos grupos de Telegram.","O projeto caminhou com total restrição de recursos, por sermos uma Agencia Independente. Além disso, ele se deu em um contexto de extrema violência contra jornalistas e de ataques à democracia, sendo um trabalho bastante traumatizante acompanhar essas redes, em especial porque muitos dos líderes investigados por nós são violentos. Nosso repórteres se infiltraram em grupos para acompanhá-los, e nosso editor Thiago Domenici chegou a ser ameaçado, tendo gerado apoios de todas as organizações relevantes do setor. Outros sofreram assédio online, e nossa equipe se tornou alvo não apenas de influenciadores da ultradireita brasileira, mas também da Americana.

Apesar disso, o projeto Sentinela Eleitoral representou um salto qualitativo na cobertura de desinformação no Brasil por aplicar os conceitos desenvolvidos pela academia - nós na Pública usamos a metodologia da equipe do Technology and Social Change project (TaSC) da Universidade de Harvard, descritas no Media Manipulation Casebook. Com isso, foi possível demonstrar os responsáveis e descobrir uso de dinheiro público no financiamento de Fake News. 

Além disso, houve um salto analítico, fruto de pesquisa realizada na Universidade de Harvard. Nesse sentido, o Sentinela Eleitoral representa a união entre jornalismo de dados, conhecimento acadêmico e jornalismo investigativo tradicional. 

Entendemos campanhas de desinformação atendem à estratégia definida pela equipe do TASC como “turvar as águas” (‘muddy the waters’, em inglês).

O termo se refere à criação de um ambiente informático confuso e desorientador, no qual é difícil para um cidadão comum separar o que é verdade do que é mentira. Isso acontece quando há uma proliferação de fontes desinformacionais competindo com fontes que relatam fatos, como jornais, sites independentes, a comunidade acadêmica. 

A tática é mais relevante em momentos de instabilidade política fabricada para ganho pessoal. Um dos maiores exemplos de ‘turvar as águas’ na política recente foi a campanha de Donald Trump para reverter a sua derrota nas eleições americanas de 2020 – alegando ‘fraude’ – o que levou à invasão do Capitólio por uma turba armada em 6 de janeiro de 2021.

É assim que uma campanha de desinformação pode levar a ações concretas, na vida real. Nosso objetivo com o Sentinela é investigar, documentar e denunciar estratégias que pretendem desestabilizar as eleições brasileiras.","É fundamental aos jornalistas aprender a usar tecnologia e dados para investigar como o debate público está sendo manipulado, A política, hoje, se faz numa circularidade: nas redes, nas ruas e dentro das instituições de governo, ad infinitum, e a manipulação do discurso se dá em qualquer uma dessas etapas. Criam-se fatos políticos a partir de um punhado de seguidores fanatizados, mas através do uso cuidadoso de redes bem arquitetadas, pode-se gerar movimentos sociais temerários. Há hoje poucos jornalistas especializados em investigar a desinformação e responsabilizar seus principais atores. Para o futuro próximo, não haverá como cobrir política sem cobrir desinformação. O futuro da cobertura política está aí. 

Através de ferramentas de monitoramento de grupos de WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook e Twitter, é possível chegar aos principais “nós de rede”, influenciadores médios, que atuam cotidianamente para ampliar mensagens importantes no dia a dia. É possível, ainda, determinar como funcionam, quem começa, por onde se espalham, quantas contas robotizadas ou inautênticas interagem e propagam cada uma das ondas de desinformação. Dá para entender seu timing e seu objetivo. E, emprestando metodologias da academia, podemos ainda entender as táticas usadas para propagar fake news. É isso o que outros jornalistas podem aprender com esse projeto.","Portuguese, English, Spanish",https://apublica.org/sentinela/,https://apublica.org/sentinela/2022/09/analise-de-hashtag-bolsonarista-revela-coordenacao-para-apoiar-golpe-nos-eua/,https://apublica.org/sentinela/2022/10/matar-e-quebrar-urnas-evangelico-lider-de-motociata-incentiva-crimes-no-telegram/,https://apublica.org/sentinela/2022/11/bloqueio-de-estradas-foi-articulado-nas-redes-semanas-antes-da-votacao/,https://apublica.org/sentinela/2022/11/a-invencao-da-primavera-brasileira-por-steve-bannon/,https://apublica.org/sentinela/2022/12/15-taticas-golpistas-de-trump-que-bolsonaro-ja-adotou-e-as-que-ainda-vai-usar/,https://apublica.org/sentinela/2023/01/bolsonaristas-usam-codigo-festa-da-selma-para-coordenar-invasao-em-brasilia/,"Natalia Viana, David Nemer, Bruno Fonseca, Mariama Correia, Paula Bianchi, Laura Scofield, Matheus Santino, Alice Maciel, Nathallia Fonseca, Bianca Muniz, José Cicero da Silva, Thiago Domenici, Alexandre Aragão, Amanda Ribeiro, Ana Rita Cunha, Bianca Bortolon, Ethel Rudnitzki, João Barbosa, Julianna Granjeia, Laís Martins, Luís Felipe dos Santos, Luiz Fernando Menezes, Marco Faustino, Milena Mangabeira, Sergio Spagnuolo, Tai Nalon, Geane Carvalho Alzamora, Christina Xiao, Guilherme Felitti e Flávio Nakasato, Bruna Bastos, Nina Santos, Nina da Hora, Yasmin Curzi, Bruna Batista","Fundada em 2011 por repórteres mulheres, a Pública é a primeira agência de jornalismo investigativo sem fins lucrativos do Brasil.

India,The Quint,Big,Participant,,"Age Gap No Bar: From Salman Khan to Akshay Kumar, Bollywood Heroes Are 'Forever Young'",2022-06-03,"Explainer, Long-form, Infographics, Chart, Arts, Culture, Women","Google Sheets, Infogram","How stark is the problem of the age gap in Bollywood?

There’s so much that is said and written about the age gap woes of the Hindi film industry, especially when it comes to the age difference between male and female leads. But is that based on a cherry-picking of examples, and does data tell a different story?

To find out, we dug deep and wide into the numbers, spanning films released across several decades - and after a comprehensive analysis, had enough and more data points to show that Bollywood does have a significant age gap problem.","The article was received very well and shared widely by our readers, many of whom appreciated the comprehensive nature of the data collection, analysis and visualisations.

Though the discourse about the large age gap between Bollywood’s heroes and leading ladies is not a new one, our story helped bring in a significant amount of original data collection and analysis. As a result, arguments made by readers and commentators about the age gap with respect to certain superstars, or even regarding the trends as they had played out over the decades, could now be made with a greater statistical backing.","First up, we looked at all the films in which Bollywood hero Akshay Kumar had featured in a leading role in his four decades in the industry. We calculated Kumar’s age on the date of release of each of the movies, as well as the corresponding age of the female lead opposite Kumar in the movie.

We then broke all his films down into four groups - those released when Kumar was in his 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s.

Next, we plotted and compared the average age of Kumar for his films during a particular decade, and the average age of the leading ladies opposite him. While for Kumar, the average age per decade increased from 27 to 34 to 44 and then to 52, the age of his female co-stars increased only from 22 to 26 to 27 to 31.

Similarly, we studied all films since 2010 which have featured Salman Khan opposite a female lead with a romantic angle to him. Then, we looked at films which had won the Filmfare Best Feature Film award over the decades, from the 1950s to the 2010s, and found that large age gaps between the male and female leads of Hindi movies were not a new or recent phenomenon.

Though our story largely focused on Bollywood, we also wished to demonstrate that this was not an issue solely restricted to India’s Hindi film industry. A data analysis of all of Rajinikanth’s movies (in the Tamil film industry) since 2000 showed the staggering age disparity between him and his female leads over the past two decades.

We used Google Sheets to calculate the ages of the stars at the time of film releases and process all the data. And using Infogram, a data visualisation tool, we created all the interactive visualisations and infographics.","Akshay Kumar's recent film Samrat Prithviraj has him opposite Miss World 2017 Manushi Chillar, and the age difference between the leading hero and the heroine in this case is 29 years – the widest so far in Akshay's filmography.

Also, remember it was 1994 when we first heard the tunes of Tip Tip Barsa Paani, where a 27-year-old Akshay was seen romancing a 20-year-old Raveena Tandon. It’s now 2022. Akshay is 54 now. While the actress dancing with him has been replaced with a younger one, he stays mighty strong in the spot of the hero, 27 years on.

This provides a perfect example of how stark the problem of ageism in Bollywood is. With a body of work as vast and diverse as that of Akshay Kumar, it becomes clearer how time and Bollywood have failed his female contemporaries.

It's not Akshay Kumar alone, the question of ageism in Bollywood is as old as time and as big as the disparity between the treatment of men and women in the business. It is most heavily reflected in the leading pairs of films and the often-ridiculous age difference between them. With time, the gap has only widened, and we’re afraid, been normalised.

What is also worth mentioning is that while the article was driven by data, we made sure that the piece also reflected certain nuances which must not be overlooked while analysing what the numbers had to say. For example, that there are certain stories with sensible and sensitive scripts which have been able to do justice to narratives that feature wide age gaps between the leading pair, be it Amitabh Bachchan and Jiah Khan in Nishabd, or Victor Banerjee and Perizaad Zorabian in Joggers' Park.","There are often think pieces and op-eds written about issues such as the one this story is tackling without enough effort put into crunching the numbers and backing up statements with actual data. However, when journalists do put in that extra effort to collect, process and visualise the data to illustrate a certain point, not only is the argument more watertight but the story itself becomes a more compelling read. Our story on Bollywood’s age gap problem is a perfect example of this, and I hope that other journalists and editors see this as a constructive takeaway from the project.",English,https://www.thequint.com/entertainment/salman-khan-to-akshay-kumar-only-bollywood-heroes-are-forever-young,https://www.instagram.com/reel/CeWRaM_o8Vu/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=,https://infogram.com/akshay-kumar-or-bollywoods-age-gap-problem-or-the-quint-1h7z2l80wmrvg6o?live,https://infogram.com/hindi-films-or-bollywoods-age-gap-problem-or-the-quint-1hnq410pdj91p23?live,https://infogram.com/salman-khan-or-bollywoods-age-gap-problem-or-the-quint-1ho16vo1j8rgx4n?live,https://infogram.com/rajinikanth-or-indian-cinemas-age-gap-problem-or-the-quint-1h1749vqy0p0l6z?live,,"Aishwarya Bodke - Research and Writing

Australia,ABC News,Big,Participant,,Mapping Australia’s childcare blackspots,2022-03-21,"Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Map, Women, Economy, Employment","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, CSV","Childcare was a key battleground in the 2022 federal election, with both major parties promising to slash the cost for parents. 

This story exposed the massive divide in access to early education in Australia by bringing to life exclusive data from the first-ever project to map childcare availability in 57,400 Australian neighbourhoods -- virtually every neighbourhood in the country.","This story sparked significant public debate, and helped to shape national childcare policy in the lead up to the May 2022 federal election. It also had a strong impact at the local level, with specific communities benefiting from an injection of funding for childcare in their neighbourhoods. 

Specific outcomes included:

**On the day of publication...**

* The federal government sought a briefing on the report from lead researcher Peter Hurley
* The federal opposition party (at the time, the Australian Labor Party) committed to including childcare access and cost in its proposed productivity commission review
* Nationals Party MP Adam Marshall discussed the report in detail in the Legislative Assembly, recounting a personal story of a staffer force to quit and calling for the New South Wales (NSW) government to take control of the sector

**Within two months of publication...**

* NSW Treasurer Matt Kean announced his government was shaping its childcare policy around the Mitchell Institute’s research
* The federal government announced funding for a childcare centre in Kingston, South Australia, identified in our report as having no childcare provision. (Following the ABC story, this had received widespread state-wide media coverage)
* Mitchell Institute met with the South Australian state government advisors about addressing the absence of childcare provision in parts of regional South Australia 
* The Federal Senate Estimates Committee for Education and Skills in April dedicated significant time to discussing the issues raised in the report with department chiefs and Minister for Government Services Linda Reynolds 
* The Australian Labor Party’s Early Childhood Education spokesperson Amanda Rishworth cited the Mitchell Institute research several times on the election campaign trail
* Multiple organisations sought data or project partnerships with the Mitchell Institute, including the NT Chamber of Commerce, Child Development Atlas WA, Rural Councils of Victoria, and Contact Inc.","This project aimed to show users why the research mattered, not just tell them. 

Rather than simply reporting the key findings, we combined Mitchell Institute data with ABS census data to create a series of maps and graphics that illustrated, through striking visuals, the stark link between access to childcare and broader disadvantage. 

We combined these data-driven storytelling techniques with powerful case studies to bring home the impact on Australian families and show the reality of the story told by the data.

One of the risks of working with such a detailed dataset is that the audience becomes overwhelmed with information. To avoid this, we highlighted each state capital city and provided a short analysis of how that city's unique demographic profile interacted with economic characteristics to affect access to childcare in different neighbouhoods within that city. 

To make full use of the richness of the data, we also built an unprecedented database allowing users to look up any postcode or suburb in the country and explore statistics.

We deliberately placed this interactive towards the end of the story. Our intention was to demonstrate, through the static map series, the different ways the audience could use their own local knowledge to think about how the demographic profile of their neighbourhood influences childcare access, and vice versa. 

Tools and technologies used included: 
- Excel, Tableau Prep and Tableau for data cleaning, dataset blending, data analysis, mapping and scatterplot charts
- Datawrapper for basic charts
- Figma and Adobe Illustrator for UI + dataviz design
- Procreate and Adobe Photoshop for the header illustration
- HTML, CSS + JS and Illustrator for the comparative maps and smaller static charts
- HTML, CSS, JS with Deck.gl and custom Vector tiles for Australian geographical areas for interactive map.","We completed this project in a far shorter timeframe than would usually be expected, so that we could publish it in the lead up to the March 2022 federal budget. This highly anticipated budget contained a number of promises related to childcare from both political parties. 

The timing of this story helped to inject much-needed detail into the public debate. It also provided a resource for ordinary Australians to see the data for their own neighbourhood -- something that had never been available before. This project continued to be referenced in policy debates and election promises right up to the May federal election.","Academia is often criticised for failing to connect with the real world; academics themselves often lament that their research doesn't reach enough people or trigger change as frequently as they would like. 

On the other hand, the media is criticised for making claims that rest upon flimsy research (or worse, of making baseless claims with no foundation in research whatsoever). 

This project shows the impact that can be achieved by combining the particular strengths of each of these instituations -- specifically, the subject-matter expertise of academia and the storytelling expertise of the media.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-22/mapping-australia-s-childcare-blackspots/100894808,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-03-22/charting-australia%E2%80%99s-childcare-blackspots/13807582,,,,,,"Inga Ting, Alex Palmer and Katia Shatoba","Inga Ting is a data journalist, Alex Palmer is a designer and Katia Shatoba is a developer.

Therefore, we break up the news content into a database that can be updated at any time, and make various possible situations into a query device through the program, so that each user can see the news content they need according to their own situation through the Q&A method.","This query-style report has been used a lot since it published, and many users have left positive feedback, saying that this query format allows them to get sufficient information after they are diagnosed, or when they suspect that they may be diagnosed. And then know how to deal with it in the future, so as not to panic. The government policy continued to undergo rolling revisions after this story published. For these amendments, as a database-supported query engine, we also continue to update it, so that users are not afraid of getting unupdated information. This part also allows users to share this query engine with their friends to expand its influence power, and to avoid the panic of the general public.","The report uses PostgresSQL for data storage, Node.js contains the query itself and related logic, and uses React.js as the front-end page generation tool.","The first difficulty is that we must update the latest policy status in real time. This difficulty arises because we must grasp various conditions and related combinations. Taking ""PCR positive"" as an example, the elderly, young people, and babies need different responses. How to list the permutations and combinations of different identities and different situations is difficult, let alone keep updating them. Therefore, we have designed a set of logic that allows reporters to update the conditions at any time without an engineer. At most, more than 200 combinations can be generated.","As conveying correct information has always been an important part of news, but how to convey it correctly and appropriately seems to have always had a fix frame, so a report full of words can be regarded as a report for most reporters. However, with the development of digital methods, there are actually more possibilities for the interaction between news and readers.

Taiwan,READr,Small,Participant,,Virtual City: A news game of national plan. Stable or flooded ? how government arrange city development in national plan.,2022-06-06,"Explainer, Quiz/game, Politics, Environment",Canvas,We developed a game that allows readers to understand the problems that their hometown is facing during the process of playing. The game includes thinking about land planning and how cities will change in the next 20 years. We present serious issues to readers in an interesting way.,"Over the past five years, Taiwan's land planning has ushered in major reforms. Land planning is an important foundation for Taiwan's land development, but the planning of each region is complex and profound, which makes it difficult for ordinary people to understand it, and therefore it is impossible to discuss or monitor the government's plans. Therefore, READr tries to use games to allow readers to understand the national land plan from a simple direction, and know the future state of their own area, and then monitor relevant policies. After the general public understands the national land plan, they can also understand the potential advantages and problems of each place, including location issues, population issues, resource capacity issues, and individual issues.","It uses pixi.js, an engine that uses Javascript to write games, and uses pixi-sound with game music, and the foundation is through Canvas. The game page is completed with vue.js and node.js.","It is the most difficult to integrate the land planning content of all counties and cities and designing four small games. We had to find out the differences in the problems of each county and city, analyze the policies and integrate their contents. We all know that journalism often does ""translation"" work, so journalists often need to translate policies, issues, or interviewees' arguments into words. But in this report, after translating into text, the reporter hopes that readers can understand the policy in a more intimate way, so another translation is performed, translating the text into the design script of the game. Although this is not the first news game, it is still worth choosing to integrate the policy explanations of 20 counties and cities through four mini-games.","The ""translates"" job from journalists, besides describing it in words, it is very important to be aware of what form can allow readers to understand the meaning of the issue and the views of all parties in a more understandable way. Especially in the current era of digital news reporting, what reporters can learn is that they must think about what kind of content can be matched with what kind of report format. The media that can be carried by digital news is very diverse, and various media and forms of expression have their significance.

Nikkei showed how Moscow created and spread misleading claims through social media networks. We focused on Russia’s activities on Telegram, a messaging app widely used in former Soviet Union countries.

Nikkei analyzed what methods were used to create false information. We identified relevant accounts and visualized the flow of data using a network diagram. We also analyzed Russia’s widespread use of artificial intelligence to generate false images.","We published the visual story both in English and in Japanese. It was widely read. 

The Japanese version notched more than 91,000 page views and was one of Nikkei's most read stories in 2022. We acquired more than 20 paid subscribers through this content as of December 2022.

The English version on Nikkei Asia’s website won a gold award at The World Association of News Publishers’ Asian Digital Media Awards 2022 - Nikkei Asia's first international prize for visually-rich content.","To analyze the spread of disinformation, we focused on 15 posts of misinformation by Russian government-affiliated Telegram accounts. 

We used Telegram's analytical tool TGStat. It has an API option and it enabled us to search Telegram posts and related database information. 

We tracked the information's spread by collecting data on which accounts forwarded or quoted these posts. Through these investigations, we identified the accounts of experts who were close to Russian government. We also exposed channels thought to have been created to disinform.

To illustrate these relationships between Telegram accounts as a network diagram, we used the Python library NetworkX. This helped our audience to understand the disinformation activities visually. We used JavaScript library p5.js to publish the graphics interactively online.","We published this project in early April when Russia's massive disinformation campaign was still active. 

The analysis of ongoing social network activities was difficult to do. We carefully identified the original posts that spread disinformation widely. 

Some posts were taken down during our analysis.","Russia has made heavy use of disinformation to attempt to justify territory grabs since the days of the former Soviet Union. Notably, in 2014, Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine on the pretext that the government in Kiev was oppressing the region.

A ferramenta foi desenvolvida pelo Núcleo Jornalismo, em parceria com a Novelo Data, para jornalistas, checadores e pesquisadores utilizarem durante as eleições de 2022. Nosso robozinho acompanha diariamente a transcrição de todos os vídeos publicados por diversos canais do YouTube para encontrar palavras-chave que podem indicar conteúdo potencialmente desinformativo sobre política e eleições. O BotPonto gera um link para o ponto exato no vídeo em que os termos foram ditos, facilitando o processo de checagem e economizando tempo de trabalho.","O BotPonto foi utilizado por jornalistas e pesquisadores durante o processo eleitoral brasileiro de 2022, evitando que horas de trabalho fossem gastas desnecessariamente assistindo vídeos do YouTube em busca de potencial desinformação. Além disso, o monitoramento do projeto mostrou tendências das campanhas de desinformação eleitoral na plataforma, com análises automatizadas no painel público do BotPonto e newsletter semanal de curadoria dos principais assuntos em alta. Um dos achados do monitoramento foi o foco de campanhas de fake news no YouTube direcionadas ao STF e ao ministro Alexandre de Moraes, por exemplo. 

O projeto foi citado mais de 30 vezes na imprensa e utilizado pelo próprio Núcleo Jornalismo para a apuração de oito reportagens. Além disso, o BotPonto ganhou o prêmio Cláudio Weber Abramo de Jornalismo de Dados na categoria de Inovação e Experimentação em 2022. 

Após o fim do período eleitoral brasileiro, o projeto começa a tomar nova forma e já conseguiu financiamento para ser utilizado no monitoramento de desinformação ambiental e climática no YouTube. A ferramenta é inovadora e tem o potencial de mudar a relação do jornalismo com a checagem de vídeos, que é hoje um dos formatos mais difíceis de serem analisados com agilidade pelos jornalistas, devido ao volume de novos conteúdos publicados diariamente na plataforma, o tempo de duração de cada peça e a sutileza muitas vezes utilizada como estratégia para desinformar o público em vídeos.","A ferramenta foi construída a partir de outros projetos, o que facilitou a implementação do código. A maior parte do projeto é desenvolvida em Python e dividida em duas grandes etapas: captura das legendas e análise do conteúdo. A captura é realizada por um código adaptado do projeto do Novelo Data, a parte de análise adaptado de um código do nosso colaborador Lucas Lago. Ambos são em Python, e o do Lucas usa o banco Postgres do Núcleo. Os painéis de visualização foram construídos usando o Metabase.","Vídeos no YouTube são alguns dos conteúdos mais difíceis de checar em busca de desinformação. Muitos vídeos têm horas e horas de duração e é impossível que checadores e jornalistas consigam acompanhar tudo. Nosso bot soluciona esse problema, identificando palavras-chaves em diversos canais previamente estabelecidos e enviando o ponto certo em que essas palavras são ditas nos vídeos para facilitar sua checagem. 

Sabemos que parte significativa da desinformação hoje vai além de afirmações abertamente falsas e muitas vezes envolvem dados tirados de contexto, detalhes ocultos ou informações modificadas para direcionar o discurso para uma narrativa específica. Esse tipo de desinformação pode passar despercebido por soluções automatizadas de análise de discurso e, pensando nisso, o BotPonto direciona os conteúdos para jornalistas especializados fazerem uma análise manual desses vídeos. Ao estabelecer os temas e palavras-chave monitorados, é possível filtrar os vídeos e trechos que tratam de assuntos que merecem checagem direcionada. Ainda, o característica colaborativa do projeto, com a possibilidade de envio de sugestões de canais e termos a serem monitorados pelo robô, torna a ferramenta ainda mais potente para o uso na cobertura jornalística. 

Por fim, o BotPonto também ameniza o desgaste psicológico e emocional de jornalistas que muitas vezes precisam assistir horas de vídeos desinformativos e de teorias da conspiração para realizar o trabalho de checagem. Ao ir direto ao ponto em que palavras-chave são ditas, direcionando a análise para momentos específicos do vídeo que merecem atenção, os profissionais se desgastam menos no processo de apuração jornalística.","Essa é uma ferramenta inédita e inovadora. Não encontramos no mercado nenhum tipo de ferramenta que se proponha a fazer o trabalho que o BotPonto desenvolve, principalmente com foco no mercado jornalístico. É um projeto totalmente inovador e que mostra o potencial de ferramentas automatizadas como aliadas do processo manual de pesquisa e análise jornalística. Cada vez mais a imprensa precisa lidar com um volume imenso de dados e informações compartilhadas online, então, criar soluções que pulem uma etapa desgastante e demorada do trabalho possibilita que a cobertura jornalística alcance outro patamar. Sem uma automatização como essa, que encontre e aponte o minuto exato em que palavras-chave específicas são ditas, poucos vídeos do YouTube são analisados pela imprensa e agências de checagem.

In addition to the military actions, we also found that there were many suspicious accounts on Facebook and Twitter spreading pro-China and anti-U.S. sentiments in an attempt to influence the Taiwanese public. However, through analyzing the number of shares and likes, it could be seen that pro-Taiwan and pro-U.S. sentiments were gaining more support and had a higher level of community engagement.","China often uses information warfare to divide the Taiwanese public, and during Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, China has launched another wave of information attacks. We have collected 830000 posts from Facebook and Twitter and analyzed which categories these posts belong to, such as support for China, support for Taiwan, support for the United States, etc. 
After classifying these posts, we can see that some suspicious accounts are spreading the same message in many communities, which are suspected to be operated by China. By analyzing the behavior of these suspicious accounts, readers can be alerted when they see related information, so as not to be easily divided.","We used Crowdtangle and Twitter API to collect 830000 posts related to Perlozzi, and then performed topic modeling analysis.

OCCRP Wiki","Switzerland's draconian banking secrecy laws have made it nearly impossible to hold the industry to account. Until the Suisse Secrets project. The investigative team at Süddeutsche Zeitung - led by Frederik Obermaier and Bastian Obermayer - brought leaked records to OCCRP containing 18,000+ Credit Suisse accounts, the largest leak ever from a major Swiss bank. We found dozens of dubious characters in the data, including an Algerian general accused of torture and a Serbian drug lord. More than 160 journalists from 48 media partners on 5 continents collaborated for a year and co-published on the same day.","Suisse Secrets was one of OCCRP’s most read stories for 2022, garnering almost 650,000 unique page views.

The project caused a national debate about banking secrecy. The European People's Party, the conservative group which holds the biggest number of seats in the European Parliament, suggested including Switzerland on the EU’s blacklist of high risk money-laundering countries.

The country came under intense international pressure to repeal the Swiss banking law. Switzerland’s Green Party said that parliament is not doing enough to prevent financial and tax crime and called for revisions to the country’s Banking Act that will protect “media professionals and whistleblowers from criminal prosecution” as a result of their investigations into the country’s banking practices.

In May, despite earlier criticism from a United Nations expert and campaign groups, a Swiss parliamentary committee blocked an attempt to overhaul strict Swiss banking secrecy rules. However, in November, the Swiss government set forth a motion to amend the Banking Act.

There were many reactions and responses in countries where the investigation was published. A few highlights:

In response to revelations that he at some point kept millions in Credit Suisse accounts, a Tajikistan politician and alleged mafia kingpin claimed that he was not fully conscious when his account was originally opened by an unidentified businessman.

High profile Taiwanese politician James Soong went on television to categorically deny the existence of his Credit Suisses accounts and his alleged link to corruption scandals after the findings were republished in dozens of local media outlets. Some lawmakers called for a full investigation by local authorities. 

We are still doing stories using the data and published an investigation in December about Kosovo’s former ambassador to the U.S. failing to report millions in a Credit Suisse account. Weeks later, the state prosecutor initiated a case against the ambassador.","The data work was built around an extract/transform/load pipeline, sending the results to a dedicated SQLite frontend for analysis. The data was programmatically enriched with historic exchange rates and inflation-adjusted equivalent values. It was also automatically checked for inconsistent dates and these were flagged. The source material was in a format that was extraordinarily hard to work with. Due to concerns about source protection we cannot describe the process in detail.","The reporting strategy required converting the leak into a dataset that journalists could use, which was complicated and time consuming and took about two months. The leak was mainly bank accounts — an amount and an account holder. The scale was enormous and we had lists of names across so many countries. Figuring out who these people were and whether knowing their bank balance was possibly a story meant pulling together local journalists in each country to often research literally hundreds of people.

Typically we have other documents to help build stories — contracts, emails — but for Suisse Secrets, the team had to pull stories from bank account data on an Excel spreadsheet. Reporters combed through thousands of bank records, interviewed insiders, regulators, and criminal prosecutors, and dug into court records and financial disclosures to corroborate their findings. 

One of the main obstacles we encountered was a legal one. Possession, sharing, and publication of this data is a criminal offense in Switzerland and we were always mindful that we could be prosecuted by Swiss authorities. And we couldn't have any Swiss reporting partners.

Then there was the difficulty of verifying the data. It was very sensitive information and we had to be absolutely sure that it was legitimate. A process of verifying these accounts was launched: see if they were mentioned in any legal case and interview judges and prosecutors in case they had knowledge.
 
Security was a challenge. We had to protect the whistleblower, whom we did not know. We had to make sure the information presented across the project would not be traceable back to a certain person in a certain position. (The whistleblower said in a statement: ""I believe that Swiss banking secrecy laws are immoral. The pretext of protecting financial privacy is merely a fig leaf covering the shameful role of Swiss banks as collaborators of tax evaders. This situation enables corruption and starves developing countries of much-needed tax revenue.”)

We also had to make sure that no information about the project was released for most of the year and that all of the partners published at the same time on the same day. One mistake could endanger the whole project. We had 72 profiles in the interactive component and every one of those people had to be contacted for comment. But even with more than 160 journalists around the world, we were able to keep this information safe because of the trust and collaboration between partners. 

As we were dealing with one of the biggest banks in the world with plenty of resources to sue us, we couldn’t make a single misstep in our reporting.

However, after the school was closed, students and teachers were left aside, and the right to education and labor rights were affected. We look back at history, visually present how private schools that closed down in the past dealt with personnel issues, and use data to take inventory of schools that are now on the verge of danger.","The issue of private school closures has been discussed for a long time in Taiwan. But most of them only see the school's own statement, and there are few objective data as evidence to judge the actual operation status of the school. The survival of schools actually affects not only students' right to education, but also teachers' right to work. Therefore, how to judge the operation status of the school is an important follow-up task. This time READr evaluates the school’s annual financial status, the number of students and teachers, etc., and points out several private universities with poor operating conditions. In addition to making the teachers and students of these schools vigilant, it also made the society pay more attention to the seriousness of this problem.","Use selenium to capture relevant information of each school, and use R to conduct financial analysis of each school and statistics on the increase and decrease of the number of teachers and students after obtaining the information.","Since disclosing the business status may lead to poor enrollment and affect the reputation of the school, the disclosure of these materials has been limited in the past. Through the public information of the Ministry of Education, together with expert advice, we have found a set of methods to evaluate poorly managed private schools.

United States,"Texas Tribune, ProPublica, The Marshall Project, The Military Times",Big,Participant,,Operation Lone Star,2022-03-21,"Investigation, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Illustration, Chart, Map, Politics, Crime","D3.js, QGIS, Json, Google Sheets, CSV, Python, Observable notebooks","In March 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott launched a multibillion-dollar border crackdown that quickly became central to his reelection campaign. The governor repeatedly proclaimed the success of the initiative, dubbed Operation Lone Star. Operation Lone Star, he said, had made 11,000 criminal arrests and caught millions of lethal doses of drugs.

But this was not true, an investigation by The Texas Tribune, in collaboration with ProPublica, The Marshall Project and The Military Times, found.","Through dogged reporting, Perla Trevizo, Lomi Kriel, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón and Keri Blakinger exposed that the state’s claim of success was based on shifting metrics that included crimes with no connection to the border and drug seizures and arrests from counties that received no additional funding or resources from the operation. They uncovered that the state was bolstering its numbers by including cases such as that of Thomas King-Randall, a Black man who lived 250 miles from the border and was arrested on a family violence assault charge. 

Reporter Jolie McCullough’s work showed, for the first time, how misdemeanor trespassing charges against migrants entering the country quickly became the largest share of the operation’s arrests despite the governor’s claims that it was capturing dangerous criminals. 

After months of questioning from reporters, the state Department of Public Safety (DPS) acknowledged that it had incorporated arrests with no connection to the border in its metrics of success, promoting inflated numbers of criminals the operation claimed to have nabbed. The agency stopped counting more than 2,000 charges, including some for cockfighting, sexual assault and stalking. Of those, about 270 charges were for violent crimes, which are defined by the FBI as murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.

The state’s largest newspapers, including The Dallas Morning News and The Austin American-Statesman, published editorials calling for accountability. 

In July, The Texas Tribune, through its joint investigative unit with ProPublica, broke news that the Department of Justice had launched an investigation into allegations of civil rights abuses that had come to light through Operation Lone Star reporting.","Public records requests were the primary engine of data acquisition. 

Python — with help from the Pandas library — was used as the primary language for cleaning and processing the data, with orchestration provided by GNU Make and Amazon Web Services for cloud storage.

We used a Javascript environment for visualization and analysis. Our toolchain includes Arquero for data analysis, SVGs generated with D3 for mapping and charting, and Observable notebooks for sharing with collaborators.","The two biggest challenges with the data were the fact that with every request, it was clear that the guidelines for data collection were changing and that charges were not standardized nor input in a consistent way. 

This made cleaning the data an exercise in disentangling monthly records and then reconciling them to create a coherent picture of Operation Lone Star’s evolution. What’s more, when we asked DPS to clarify the inconsistencies in the data, officials often didn’t help us better understand why changes were being made. At one point, they told us that the data was inscrutable and unanalyzable even as the agency published monthly reports using the very same data.

We overcame this issue in part by using anti-joins to compare data sets over time to make sure that we understood how the data was changing from one month to the next. We also put together a manual protocol with all reporters to inspect the data, row by row, to make sure that our code was parsing the charges in accurate, consistent ways. The combination of experience, subject matter expertise and additional reporting along with automation ensured that we could explain our methodology and decision-making at every point in the data processing pipeline.","People in the data journalism community can learn from our analytical techniques and how they drove our reporting. 

We started with a classic journalistic question. The state government says Operation Lone Star has been a success, do they have the evidence to back it up? 

However, the evidence itself changed as the reporting unfolded. We decided, then, to analyze how each dataset provided by the state was different from the last. This approach, described above, gave us a way to contend with an agency that was changing its definitions as we reported the story.

Before publication, we shared our findings with DPS and asked for a response. Agency officials said we needed to account for the fact that “each spreadsheet represents an extract from a live database, and information is subject to change.” They challenged our characterization of records being added or removed, saying we assumed “that any row that does not appear exactly the same in each spreadsheet can be described as either ‘added’ or ‘removed.’”

We went back through our analysis and verified its accuracy and again shared our findings with DPS, explaining how we reached our conclusions and asking the agency to point specifically to any inaccuracies. It did not.

We wrote a detailed methods box, included with the story, that explained our process and quoted the department’s criticisms. DPS did not challenge our findings after publication.",English,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/03/21/texas-says-its-multi-billion-dollar-border-operation-is-working-the-evidence-tells-a-different-story,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/04/04/texas-border-operation-s-largest-share-of-arrests-trespassing-on-private-property,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/04/18/texas-border-operations-abbott-taxpayer-history,https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/04/27/reality-check-seven-times-texas-leaders-misled-the-public-about-operation-lone-star,,,,"Perla Trevizo, Lomi Kriel, Andrew Rodriguez Calderón, Jolie McCullough, Keri Blakinger, James Barragán, Davis Winkie, Marilyn Thompson","Perla Trevizo is a reporter with the Texas Tribune/ProPublica Investigative Unit.

Satellite monitoring.,2022-01-01,"OSINT, Illustration, Map, Satellite images, Environment","OpenStreetMap, Python, Google Earth Engine, Leafletjs","This is a visualization that allows you to monitor Russian military equipment around Ukraine (before the invasion on February 24). The monitoring was conducted by analyzing satellite images. 
On the interactive map we showed all the locations of the military equipment known to us from open sources, where changes have taken place recently. And the most interesting thing is at the bottom of the map: we use Sentinel-1 satellite data to estimate how much equipment there is on a particular military base.","In March 2021, Russia began a significant increase in its forces on the borders of Ukraine and in the occupied Crimea and parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. After US involvement and Biden's talks with Putin, the Kremlin withdrew some of its personnel and equipment from the borders, but not all of it. In the autumn of 2021, the second phase of escalation began. Our project helped to fact-check news in media and speaches of politicians about build-up of Russian fores around Ukraine. With the help of indirect tools we created an interactive map and evidence base that prove Russian preparatoryactivities to full-scale invasion to Ukraine.

Our work will be helpfull for journalists/analysts/experts in monitoring of Russian military bases near Ukraine's border and on occupied territory.

Project was presented on several events in Ukraine, lots of publications in Ukrainian and international media, as well on Italian Television, and also at Data Fest Tbilisi (May 2022). We continued to update the project after Russia's invasion, so for the moment we have historical data with satelite images for about 9 months.","We build interactive map to show, with the help of points and polygons, all the locations of the military equipment known to us from open sources. After clicking on the spot on the map, you will see images created by us based on Sentinel-1 data, which can be used to monitor the presence of military equipment. 

The satellite images which you see in this visualization are not actual photos but rather composite images that we create with the help of our computer program based on data from Sentinel-1. Each image under the map is based on data obtained by satellites during their passage of the same orbit.

We used the Python programming language and Google Earth Engine to search and process new satellite images from Sentinel-1 on a daily basis.","The work on the project (from October-November 2021 till the January 2022) helped us to make sure that Russia's military move around Ukraine is not a show or intimidation action, but preparatory work to military actions against Ukraine. This fact gave the TEXTY team a push to prepare to possible war and even reflected on our editorial work, especially on chosing topics for articles.

Brazil,InfoAmazonia,Small,Participant,,Amazônia Minada,2022-02-22,"Database, Open data, Chart, Map, Environment","Scraping, Json, OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, SHP, JavaScript","Amazônia Minada é um dashboard que mostra os processos minerários na Amazônia brasileira que nunca poderiam ter sido registrados. No Brasil, a mineração em terras indígenas e unidades de conservação integral não é permitida. Apesar disso, milhares de requerimentos são mantidos válidos nos sistemas do governo federal. Nossa ferramenta mapeia e atualiza todos os dias quando estes processos se sobrepõem a áreas protegidas. Os dados podem ser filtrados e baixados em formato aberto. Um bot de Twitter alerta sempre que novos pedidos são detectados. Os dados são atualizados diariamente e disponibilizados em formato aberto.","Amazônia Minada já foi utilizado por jornalistas para auxiliar a produção de reportagens sobre mineração em áreas protegidas brasileiras publicadas em diversos meios de comunicação locais e nacionais, como G1, UOL, DW e Nexo. Além disso, seus dados têm sido usados por organizações não governamentais para pressionar grandes mineradoras, como Anglo American, a desistir de pedidos de mineração nestas áreas. Outras empresas também têm anunciado a desistência destas solicitações, na esteira da repercussão negativa. A simples existência destes pedidos pressiona – muitas vezes de forma violenta – as populações e territórios locais, mesmo que a atividade não esteja sendo executada. O impacto é diretamente relacionado à preservação do meio ambiente e dos povos que vivem da floresta.","Por meio de scripts JavaScript executados diariamente no servidor da InfoAmazonia, nossa ferramenta baixa o arquivo shapefile disponibilizado diariamente pela Agência Nacional de Mineração (ANM), autarquia do governo federal brasileiro responsável por autorizar e fiscalizar a atividade. Então, nosso app busca intersecções entre os registros federais e as áreas protegidas.

Quando encontrados, os dados são inseridos em três locais:
1)No dashboard que permite visualizar, filtrar e baixar todas as solicitações de mineração irregulares;
2)Em um mapa produzido no Mapbox que ilustra todos os pedidos existentes ou filtrados no dashboard;
3)Em uma fila de disparo automatizado de tweets através do perfil @amazonia_minada, que alerta diariamente quando uma solicitação de mineração irregular é detectada.","Amazônia Minada analisa sistematicamente os dados da Agência Nacional de Mineração (ANM), autarquia do governo federal brasileiro responsável por autorizar e fiscalizar a atividade. O órgão disponibiliza diariamente uma atualização do seu registro de processos minerários, em formato aberto de dados geográficos. Nossa ferramenta, então, mapeia e alerta quando estes processos se sobrepõem (total ou parcialmente) ou estão contíguos a terras indígenas e unidades de conservação integral da Amazônia Legal.

A legislação brasileira proíbe a mineração nestas áreas protegidas. Nas unidades de conservação integral, a lei federal nº 9.985/2000 determina que, nestes territórios, é “admitido apenas o uso indireto dos seus recursos naturais”. Já nas terras indígenas, a mineração só seria permitida com legislação que regulamentasse a atividade, com autorização do Congresso Nacional e audiência das comunidades atingidas, de acordo com a Constituição Federal. O artigo nunca foi regulamentado e, por isso, nenhum pedido de mineração em áreas indígenas foi autorizado até hoje.

Apesar da proibição, a ANM mantém válidos em seu sistema milhares de requerimentos sobre estas áreas. Mesmo quando um solicitante desista do processo ou peça seu indeferimento, a agência o mantém no sistema por entender que há chance de o “recurso ser provido”, como a autarquia explicou ao InfoAmazonia via Lei de Acesso à Informação. Enquanto o requerimento estiver no sistema, ele é considerado válido e o Amazônia Minada considera esta orientação em seu cruzamento.

A manutenção destas solicitações no sistema da ANM não significa que a mineração esteja efetivamente ocorrendo, mas pressiona – muitas vezes de forma violenta – as populações e territórios locais. Nacionalmente, é útil ao lobby pela liberação que ocorre em Brasília, nos poderes Executivo e Legislativo. A mineração é uma das atividades econômicas com maior impacto socioambiental.","Esta ferramenta é uma fonte de pautas que podem auxiliar jornalistas interessados em publicar sobre o tema a encontrar respostas rapidamente.

United States,"The Dallas Morning News, the Investigative Reporting Program at UC Berkley's Graduate School of Journalism, The Pulitzer Center",Big,Participant,,Peering Into The Black Box: Investigation Into Social Sentinel,2022-09-20,"Investigation, Long-form, Multiple-newsroom collaboration, Database, Open data, Chart, Video, Map, Business","AI/Machine learning, Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV, Python","Our investigation reveals more than three dozen colleges have purchased an AI surveillance technology called Social Sentinel to monitor students’ social media. 

Despite publicly claiming its service was not a surveillance tool, in emails, Social Sentinel repeatedly promoted its ability to “forestall” protests, offered a feature allowing schools to enter keywords related to contentious events and even authored a whitepaper about how it was effective for monitoring demonstrations. Social Sentinel also claimed its AI could help schools prevent suicides and shootings. But in our investigation, we found no evidence that a student's life had been saved because of the service.","Shortly after publishing the first major story, a North Carolina legislator launched an inquiry into state schools’ use of surveillance technology and UNC ended its contract with Social Sentinel. The story also received attention from local, state and national media organizations. Most hearteningly, at least 15 college newspapers wrote about our story, and it was taught in several university courses across the country, fulfilling our goal of raising awareness about school surveillance and inspiring students to pursue investigative reporting on their campuses.","We conducted a computational analysis of nearly 4200 posts flagged by the service, which we obtained either from the documents themselves or through links to PDFs which were located inside of the documents. 

We relied primarily on the Python programming language in order to accomplish this task. In order to parse the PDF files, we first conducted optical character recognition using the command line tool ocrmypdf, performed inside of a Jupyter Notebook. We then wrote code to loop through each document, extract the text of the PDF and separate out each alert, using the PDFPlumber library and Python’s built-in list comprehensions. Once these alert chunks were created, we parsed each chunk with regular expressions to obtain as much data as we could, including the text of the post. These elements were stored as a list of dictionary elements, which were later transformed into a pandas DataFrame, cleaned and ultimately stored as a CSV file and a Google Sheet. We then read this spreadsheet into another Jupyter Notebook for further analysis.

To conduct our analysis, we used the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) library to remove all punctuation and so-called “stop” words (“the”, “but” “and” “or” etc.) from the posts. We then used nltk’s word_tokenize function to get a list of the posts’ remaining words and then counted the number of times a word appeared across all alerts. This was then visualized as a bar chart, first within the Notebook using the Plotly library, then for the final story in DataWrapper. We also experimented with topic modeling with the large language model BERT, specifically the BERTopic package and the HuggingFace’s pre-trained transformers, but did not ultimately present this analysis due to package deprecation and difficulties explaining it to non-technical readers.","This investigation originated when one of the reporters, Ari Sen, was a student at UNC-Chapel Hill. At the time the school was dealing with protests over a Confederate statue on campus, and Sen wanted to know what campus police were doing behind the scenes. He filed a records request and obtained thousands of pages of documents. Buried within them was a contract for Social Sentinel. After writing a story on UNC’s use of the service for NBC News, Sen suspected that other colleges were using the service to monitor campus protests as well, and applied to graduate school with the intention of making that topic his thesis. After being accepted to Berkeley, he soon developed a pitch for the story and was paired up with the other reporter on the story, Dereka Bennett. Together they spent more than a year reporting the story for The Dallas Morning News until the project’s publication in late 2022. All told it took more than three years from conception to publication.

Up until the moment of publication, we faced significant delays in getting the records we requested, astronomical cost estimates for information — one school quoted us $40,000 — and university lawyers who cited obscure and ridiculous objections to providing the material. Some schools also claimed that material did not exist when it was eminently clear that it did — for example, several schools failed to provide the alerts from the service even though they were included in the scope of every records request we filed. We also had issues with universities providing information as non-machine readable PDF files, which did not allow us to click links to obtain more information. We were able to resolve some of these issues by obtaining more funding from the Pulitzer Center and by frequently working with public records officers to craft requests that allowed us to access the information we needed in a more timely and less expensive manner. 

Despite these challenges, this project was, to our knowledge, the first and only comprehensive examination of the use of social media surveillance software on college campuses, the first to identify many of those colleges and also the first to reveal the systemic marketing and use of these tools to monitor campus demonstrations. Though we had many seasoned editors and advisors on this investigation, all of the work was completed by two twenty-somethings while both were still in graduate school, where they had to juggle several other class assignments and projects. For both, it was the first major investigation they had authored themselves. The first story in particular was enormously well-received and shocking to campus, local, regional and national media outlets and to students at affected universities, inspiring many of them to conduct investigations of their own.","I when other journalists read this project they start to become more aware of the spread of surveillance techology, from intelligence agencies to local police down to tiny college campuses. Our digital traces, are increasingly being tracked and used against us in large and small ways. If more reporters are inspired to go after those stories I would judge this project to be a success.
I hope this story also paves a way for more reporting about how algorithms and AI are changing our lives. I've been lucky enough to witness the beginnings of this field of reporting as an inagural fellow in the Pulitzer Center's AI Accountability Network. Whether as part of a formal cohort, with the support of a major newsroom or own your own, we need more projects like these. 
Finally, I hope our success shows student journalists that they can do serious investigative reporting on their campuses, and that their stories and voices can change things. I started this project as a college student at UNC. Three years later, I got them to end their use of the surveillance tool I discovered on their campus.",English,https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2022/social-sentinel/,https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2022/the-black-box-social-sentinel/,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOdF0wv30zE,,,,,Arijit D.

Australia,ABC News,Big,Participant,,Australia’s runaway rents,2022-09-20,"Long-form, Database, Infographics, Chart, Map, Economy","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","This project used two decades of data from property portal Domain to delve into Australia's worst rental crisis in at least a generation. It showed that advertised house rents hit record highs in 2022 in 85 per cent of suburbs with reliable data -- a figure that is itself unprecedented in 20 years of data.

The figures, supplied exclusively to the ABC, track median asking rents in nearly 4,000 Australian suburbs, roughly one-third outside capital cities, from 2002 to 2022. It is the first time rental price data has been published at this level of detail, for this many neighbourhoods.","This project put Australia's rental crisis into historic perspective, combining exlusive data with expert analysis and gripping case studies to explain how the pandemic triggered the worst rental crisis in recent memory. 

It injected much needed facts and figures into a highly emotional public debate, and helped shape public policy debates about the kind of interventions that would have the greatest (and fastest) benefit. 

The story contributed to public debate around tenant rights, housing tax policy, investment in affordable housing and the effectiveness of rental assistance in Australia.

Our audience metrics show it achieved the highest average engagement time of any story in our team's history.","From the outset, our aim was to tell a data-driven story about the human impact of Australia's rental crisis. While many stories had been written (and continue to be written) about Australia's ongoing rental crisis, this project stands apart for the seamless way it combines powerful case studies with a dataset of unrivalled breadth and depth.

A key difference was the project's focus on smaller, regional areas, as well as major cities. Many stories about rental prices tend to aggregate the data into larger areas to simplify both the analysis and the storytelling. However, we felt that the data's granularity revealed a richer, more nuanced, and more accurate picture of the crisis. 

For example, the divide not only between city and country, but also between smaller regions and towns (eg. commuting towns and so-called lifestyle areas) -- was among the critical themes uncovered by the data. This kept this ""front and centre"" of not only our reporting and but also our visualisations, which honed in on smaller towns and regions often left out of national-level analyses.

We also built two interactive databases allowing users to explore ""hyper-local"" rental price data stretching back as far as records were available. 

Tools and technologies used included:
- Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau Prep, Tableau and Datawrapper for data cleaning, data blending, data analysis, mapping and charts
- Figma and Adobe Illustrator for UI + dataviz design
- Adobe Photoshop for the header illustrations
- HTML, CSS + JS and Illustrator for the comparative cap city maps
- HTML, CSS, JS with D3 for interactive line charts.
- HTML, CSS, JS with Deck.gl for interactive maps.
- HTML, CSS, JS with Deck.gl and custom Vector tiles for Australian geographical areas for interactive map.","One unexpected challenge of working with such a long historical period was that neighbourhood names and boundaries had changed sometimes multiple times over the span of the dataset. This meant that the rental price data for a single suburb could be separated across multiple suburb names. Each of these names might match to a different set of geographic boundaries, even though locals of that area would recognise all these names as referring to the same place, even if the boundaries of that place had changed slightly over time). 

On top of this, the regions used in Domain's proprietary dataset did not match the regions used in the Australian Statistical Geography Standard, the mapping standard for geographic data. 

To overcome this data quirk (read: headache), we had to match the rental price data to multiple geographic datasets, and then consolidate each of these datasets into a single ""master"" dataset. This required weeks of extra work, none of which is apparent from the story itself.","This project demonstrates how data can be used to put current events into historical perspective. It also shows the truth behind the idea that ""behind every data point is a person"". Rather than trying to simplify this large, detailed dataset, we saw its granularity as its key attribute, and allowed the data to guide us in telling a compelling, nuanced and people-centred story.",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-21/australia-is-in-the-grip-of-its-worst-rental-crisis/101453246,,,,,,,"Inga Ting, Katia Shatoba, and Alex Palmer","Inga Ting is a data journalist, Katia Shatoba is a developer and Alex Palmer is a designer.

There are examples of specific buildings to look at exactly how destruction occurs during shelling or fire, and which of them are or are not subject to restoration.
The project shows each destroyed building as a real photo and also as a constructive scheme with comments on important parts.","Since the beginning of the large-scale invasion of Russia on February 24 and the related hostilities in Ukraine, almost 121 thousand residential buildings, in which about a million families lived, have already been damaged and destroyed. 
The numbers are terrible. Some of the buildings are completely destroyed and can only be demolished. Others have suffered partial damage and can be rebuilt.
Why is there such a significant difference between the destructions? This question is important. And not only for those who are thinking about the future housing, but also for those who will build these housings.
We spoke with the design engineer Dmytro Makagon. He explains why in some cases the houses were built like ""card locks"" and what is the ""core of rigidity"" in the construction of modern residential buildings. 

The most powerfull thing of our project is unique illustration. We draw constructive schemes for 8 types of buildings and merge it with the images of damaged one. 
The visualization is terrifying and beautiful at the same time","We closely worked with design engineer to make a project: used Adoe Illustrator to draw a constructive schemes of the buildings with a focus on constructive elements damaged by Russian strikes.

It revealed that one million households in Australia already face “extreme” levels of insurance stress and will bear the brunt of future premium hikes driven by climate change.

This research was far more dire than previous estimates.","This story aimed to familiarise a new audience with the world of climate risk and insurance through engaging, easy-to-understand visualisations and an interactive search tool that put complex actuarial data in the hands of a lay audience.

The story distilled a vast, technical dataset into a compelling narrative for the general reader, giving them the tools to “drill down” into the data and find insights tailored to their location.

The impact included:
* Enabling a lay audience to understand and explore the numbers and calculations that drive wider governmental and business decisions about their homes and neighbourhoods
* Injecting a level of transparency and accountability into questions about rising insurance premiums
* Empowering the ""Australian on the street"" to participate in a debate that directly affects them, but is widely seen as being dominated by powerful insurance companies, big banks and ""technocrats"".

The story’s enduring importance has been underscored by readers who have continued to return to the story during Australia’s recent unprecedented floods.","This story combined powerful case studies, compelling visualisations, and an interactive database that allowed users to find data personalised to their location, household income or insurance premium. 

We used multiple visual forms -- ranging from bar charts, dot plots and maps to the central connected scatterplot -- to illustrate the data. By breaking the data into smaller, ""bite-sized"" visual pieces, we aimed to make the entire dataset more digestible, and to allow users to understand the data from multiple angles.

This technique also allowed users to choose the level of detail they wanted to engage with. 

Tools and technologies used included:
- Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau Prep, Tableau and Datawrapper for data cleaning, data blending, analysis, mapping and charts
- Figma and Adobe Illustrator for UI + dataviz design
- HTML, CSS + JS and Illustrator for the national maps and smaller static charts
- HTML, CSS, JS with D3 for interactive charts and Scrollyteller.
- HTML, CSS, JS with D3 (insurance risk, premium and affordability charts) and Deck.gl (map) for interactive search.","A key challenge of such a technical dataset was working out the “headline” measures that would immediately convey the importance of the data to a lay audience. This required going back and forth with the data provider many times, asking for multiple tweaks to the analysis and weeks of discussion with the about what readers would want to know and whether the data could provide meaningful answers. 

In the end, the key visual form chosen to illustrate the data (a connected scatterplot) was very different to any of the visualisations used in the original report. However, our project partners loved it and audience feedback indicated it was highly effective.","As an outstanding example of data-driven storytelling and explanatory business reporting, it showcases skills such as:
* Making large amounts of complex data digestible and explorable, by providing the tools for readers to find “personalised” insights
* Re-framing dry, potentially unappealing calculations and analyses to immediately convey their importance to a lay audience
* Data visualisation that is powerful, accurate and legible
* Creative approaches to handling vast amounts of data, especially readers on mobile phones",English,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-08-17/how-climate-change-is-pushing-insurance-stress-to-new-extremes/101336302#findyourLGA,,,,,,,"By Inga Ting, Katia Shatoba, Alex Palmer, Thomas Brettell, and Bronwyn Herbert","Inga Ting is a data journalist, Katia Shatoba and Thomas Brettell are developers and Alex Palmer is a designer.

At this turning point, we look back at China's changes over the years by collecting reports from foreign media mentioning China in the past decade, analyzing what important events foreign media focuses on, and how their attitudes towards China have changed.
For example, in the early stages of the ""Belt and Road"" policy, foreign media had a positive attitude, but as related scandals emerged, their coverage of the ""Belt and Road"" became more negative.","When Chinese President Xi Jinping first took office, there were expectations that China would move towards more open policies, but as time went on, Xi's authoritarianism became increasingly obvious. In areas such as economy, diplomacy, and human rights, China has become more strict in its control. Therefore, using historical data from foreign media reports, we attempt to present the trajectory of these changes, and become a good reference for observing the ""Xi Jinping era"".","We reference the list of global media from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, and use Crowdtangle to collect reports from that media that mention ""China"" on Facebook, collecting nearly 40,000 foreign media reports. We use ""sentiment analysis"" to observe the attitude changes of foreign media when mentioning China, and compare what issues different countries focus on and which countries are more supportive of China at specific points in time.
At the same time, we also collect news from Chinese official media, People's Daily, as a contrast, and selecting specific keywords, for example, poverty alleviation, anti-corruption, etc. We present the differences in the focus of foreign media and Chinese official media through word clouds.","Data journalism often requires text analysis, which is one of the biggest difficulties we face. Even when using the same keywords, different reports can have completely different contexts. For example, when mentioning covid-19, Western countries often criticize China for deliberately hiding the outbreak and for having inappropriate preventive policies, but some countries agree with China's approach and even appreciate China's provision of vaccine aid. 
Therefore, we put a lot of effort into manually analyzing these reports, not only to see the changes in attitudes towards China by different countries, but also to present the differences in the perspective of foreign media and Chinese official media on specific issues.","We present a complete picture of the trajectory of foreign media's attitude towards China in the past ten years.

People often misunderstand insects, labelling them as disgusting or associating them with diseases.

I collaborated with The Intercept's team producing maps and charts from this data.","In the midst of the 2022 brazilian election, in which former president Jair Bolsonaro, weaponized the state to obtain a leverage in the election results, a piece on the militaristic nature of his ideology striked a nerve whith the readership. The piece was shared by thousands of readers on Twitter and attacked by bolsonaristas online.","Working with the exclusive data obtained by The Intercept Brasil's team, I used R stats to analyze it and obtain insights as to what was noteworthy and could be explored in individual charts. I then brought a bunch of the data points contained in the data to Qgis to generate static locator maps which would better situate the reader on the narrative. These were also the basis for the animated maps, showing the explosion in the number of shoooting clubs over time, as well as its correlation with the deforestation arc in the region.","Brazil's political context has been marked by tension between the military wings of the government and indigenous peoples in recent years, particularly under the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, who has a history of making controversial and derogatory statements about indigenous peoples, has pushed for policies that prioritize economic development over the protection of indigenous rights and the environment.

One of Bolsonaro's key campaign promises was to open up the Amazon rainforest for mining, logging, and agriculture. This policy has put him at odds with many indigenous communities who rely on the forest for their livelihoods and cultures. Bolsonaro has also sought to reduce the size of protected indigenous territories, arguing that they impede economic growth.

The government's actions have been met with resistance from indigenous groups and their allies, who have organized protests and legal challenges. They have also been met with criticism from international organizations and governments, who have expressed concern about the impact of these policies on the environment and human rights.

The military wings of the government have also played a significant role in this debate. Some members of the military have supported Bolsonaro's development policies, while others have spoken out against them, arguing that they could lead to increased violence and human rights abuses against indigenous peoples.

Overall, the relationship between the government and indigenous peoples in Brazil has become increasingly fraught under Bolsonaro's administration, as the president's agenda puts the interests of economic development ahead of the rights and well-being of indigenous communities.","This piece has the potential to aid other journalists in establishing connections between geographical and social data in stories involving human rights and violence in the Amazon. By utilizing mapping techniques and data visualization tools, we were able to uncover patterns and trends in incidents of human rights abuses and violence that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.

Our findings have highlighted the importance of considering the geographical context in which these events occur, as well as the social dynamics at play. For example, we discovered that certain regions within the Amazon have higher rates of violence against indigenous communities and that these incidents are often linked to the presence of illegal logging and mining operations.

This type of investigative journalism is crucial in shedding light on the complex issues facing the Amazon and the people who call it home. It also serves as a powerful tool for holding those responsible for these abuses accountable. I believe that other journalists and media outlets can greatly benefit from incorporating similar methods and techniques in their reporting. This work has the potential to change the way human rights and violence are reported in the Amazon, and ultimately contribute to a better understanding of the issues, and potential solutions.",Portuguese,https://theintercept.com/2022/11/09/sob-bolsonaro-clubes-de-tiro-explodem-em-areas-de-conflito-da-amazonia-legal/,,,,,,,"Caroline Castro (reporting), Rodolfo Almeida (data visualization), Amanda Miranda (illustration), Rodrigo Bento (art direction)","Caroline Castro

Tras muchos años escuchando en España ""Madrid en verano se vacía"" o ""Barcelona en verano se vacía"" decidimos que teníamos que comprobar hasta qué punto eso era cierto y qué sucedía realmente en España en la temporada estival.

Tras crear una base de datos con los datos del INE del movimiento de personas de sus municipios a otros en España durante el verano, que surgen del posicionamiento de móviles, pudimos comprobar que realmente estas ciudades se vacían y hasta qué punto mientras la costa y las islas están más abarrotadas que nunca.","El proyecto funcionó de una forma brutal en Maldita.es, fue de lo más leido durante todo el verano. Además, se hizo viral en redes sociales y tuvo una gran difusión y recomendación.

Es un tema del que se ha hablado mucho en España, pero por primera vez gracias a datos reales podíamos mostrar qué pasaba realmente y cómo las grandes ciudades se vacíaban durante el verano mientras que todas las zonas costeras y las islas de España se llenaban.

Gracias a los novedosos datos del INE que muestran a lo largo del año los movimientos (salidas y llegadas de personas de sus municipios de residencia a otros) de teléfonos móviles, pero con agregación de datos anonimizados pudimos ver qué sucedía realmente.

Así, comprobamos, al analizar lo que había ocurrido en los veranos de 2019 y 2021 (2020 fue muy anómalo debido a la pandemia) en que había grandes ciudades que perdían cuatro veces más población en julio y agosto de la que llegaba a la ciudad. El efecto contrario, en cambio, sucedía en las zonas costeras. Además, pudimos ver de dónde era la gente que llena esas zonas costeras. Pudimos ver las zonas predilectas para el veraneo de madrileños o barceloneses, pero también de los extranjeros de distintos países que acuden a España para la temporada estival. Todo este tipo de información es un tema de habitual conversación en verano en España pero por primera vez pudimos comprobar todo a través del análisis de datos y realizar una información periodística real de lo que sucede en nuestro país en verano en cuanto a desplazamientos.","Utilizamos los datos de la estadística experimental del Instituto Nacional de Estadística de medición de turismo a partir de posicionamiento de teléfonos móviles: https://www.ine.es/experimental/turismo_moviles/experimental_turismo_moviles.htm.

Con esa información seleccionamos los datos municipio a municipio en julio y agosto de 2019 y 2021 y nos fijamos tanto en la emisión de viajeros como en la recepción para poder calcular un saldo turístico veraniego en cada pueblo y ciudad de España. Todo ese análisis lo hicimos en hojas de cálculo y con Python. 

También utilizamos ese lenguaje de programación para preparar nuestro mapeo, pieza fundamental en este reportaje, que acabamos visualizando con Flourish.","Un aspecto importante de este tema es cómo nos tomamos en serio desde Maldito Dato un tema tan veraniego o light aparentemente como este y cómo gracias a la estadística del INE y su explotación y análisis lo elevamos para hacer un interesante reportaje de periodismo de datos, basado en evidencias y con distintos hallazgos. Pudimos cuantificar realmente para cada pueblo y ciudad de España su saldo turístico en verano. También pudimos ver de dónde venían o a donde iban esas personas que se movían de un lugar a otro y se lo contamos a los lectores. Desvelamos un fenómeno, los movimientos de personas en España en verano, que se conocía, pero que nadie había cuantificado hasta entonces ni tenía datos reales y menos a ese nivel de detalle municipio a municipio y conociendo el origen y destino de quienes se desplazan.","Que los temas 'frescos' o 'veraniegos' no tienen por qué no ser rigurosos. Se pueden hacer temas aparentemente más light pero con rigor periodístico y basándose en los datos para saber qué hay de cierto y qué no y cómo suceden los fenómenos exactamente y trasladárselo a los lectores, como hizo Maldito Dato en este caso.

Además, este tipo de temas funciona de maravilla cuando llevan un enfoque tan novedoso com es este caso. Fue un gran dato de audiencia para una publicación en Maldita.es en agosto. Esto se debió a que funcionó de maravilla en redes sociales porque a la gente le interesaba saber qué sucede realmente en verano más allá de los típicos artículos que citan que los destinos favoritos de los españoles son este o el otro sin ninguna fuente, base o datos reales que lo demuestren.",Spanish,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20220805/ciudades-desiertas-abarrotadas-julio-agosto-turistas/,,,,,,,"Jose Molina Gracia, Sergio Sangiao Pérez, Ana Gómez Parra, Pablo Hernández Escayola","Maldita.es es una fundación y medio de comunicación sin ánimo de lucro que lucha contra la desinformación y promueve la transparencia a través del fact-checking y el periodismo de datos.

Not just for the record, but it's also pretty much the only well-organized site for electoral politics that voters can view before the election. We first reviewed whether the political opinions of the current mayors during the election four years ago were fulfilled, as a starting point, and attracted readers to record the political opinions of this election for future supervision.","Taiwan has a large-scale election at least every two years, including the president, legislators, county mayors, etc., but in many cases, voters do not have a good way to clearly understand the political views or ideas of each candidate, and even the candidates Past experience and opinions, etc. Therefore, READr this time uses a large-scale public cooperation database to start a solution to this problem. This will have a great impact on Taiwan's elections, because we encourage the public to seriously study the political opinions of candidates and upload them to others, and these political opinions will also become a tracking platform for the fulfillment of political opinions, so that the people can really supervise politicians, It will also have an impact on politicians.","This project is not just a webpage, but a complete website. We use PostgreSQL as the database for data storage, and Keystone.js is used for the data management system, which is a database management interface written in React.js. In addition, we also used Node.js plus React.js + Redux to complete the entire website. At the same time, Python is also used to regularly generate the data content of mass cooperation for open data use.","The most difficult part of this project is the collection and persistence of data, because it will be a long-term topic, not just used in this election. Instead, READr can use these political opinion data to track the implementation status of political opinions, and it can be used directly in each future election without redevelopment. Therefore, this topic will also be a very important part of the Taiwan political figure database. Or we can say that we can monitor most of the political figures in Taiwan, not only their political opinions, but also their various records and behaviors.","In many cases, these materials related to political opinions, policies, and even political personnel are the materials that reporters need to collect in many reports. But how to integrate the data and maximize the effect. Therefore, we try to integrate various data sources into a single database so that all data can be quickly integrated and searched. This will not only make future reports more comprehensive, but may even become an important reference for investigation and research in future reports.
In addition, although mass collaboration is not a new method, it can still be used as a part of data journalism. Although the energy and time required are usually relatively constant, it may not always be successful. But in fact, the cooperation of the masses can sometimes achieve unexpected results.

We present them through a unified visual constellation that groups them into networks, universes of women writers, allowing to explore their connections.

It is a masculinized canon that led authors such as Mary Ann Evans or Josefina Vicens to use a male pseudonym.

We hope this visualization helps women readers and writers gain visual access to this vast network, constantly invisibilized. 

There is also an invitation for new woman writers to send in their preferred writers to grow this project.","This project has prompted a dozen of contemporary writers to send in their prefered contemporary women writers to be added to the constellation we created, thanks to a form created with open source for that purpose included in the publications, and it has been read in 6 different latin american countries and Spain: Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, Perú, Uruguay and Brazil.","We used data scraping through an API via a Python script for Wikipedia entries, Python programming language for visualization and open source Kobo protocol for new data collection via a form, which is then manually reviewed.

For the Wikipedia entries included, we wanted only fiction, poetry and playwriting authors, so we needed to make a manual hand-curation after automatically scraping data for all Latin American women writers of this century.","Before we decided to face this data collection, analysis, curation, and visualization project, the New York times published an editorial article where H.G. Wells was presented as ""the father"" of science fiction. Us, two women writers and a non-binary one were outraged that the work of Mary Shelley, author of Frankenstein more than 70 years before Wells published was and is continously being rendered invisible by male writers all around the world. 

This context prompted our work to scrape and curate Latin American, women, writers born after 1900, to show the vast number of them readilly available for columnists to select for their writings...","This is a service project and a highly political feminist one, where other journalists can use the methodology to serve specific excluded communities such as women Latin American writers.

二、勾勒公有土地遭濫倒狀況：我們嘗試估計多少公有土地遭廢棄物入侵。過去，台灣國有財產署無法完整說明究竟有多少公有土地被傾倒，報導團隊透過GIS軟體套疊圖資、勾勒案件的量體。

三、揭露事業廢棄物犯罪鏈的生成。此報導引起政府與業界廣泛關注，團隊也受邀到法務部分享，與主調查環境犯罪的檢察官們交流，未來主管單位承諾將積極推動《廢棄物清理法》修法，並加重主管單位的責任。","1. 透過Python抓取衛星變異點資料：資料雖可在官方網站查得，但並非容易下載形式，須由數據記者透過Python抓取各個縣市、完整9個年度的數據資料。由於原始資料還包括新增建物等其他地表變異項目，我們也加以過濾出切合本議題的資料。

2. 清洗資料以完善欄位：營建署資料僅有經緯度，我們以Python介接政府API，回推出該變異點所在的行政區，完善原先的資料集。

3. QGIS進行資料套疊：將變異點資料與公有土地資料套疊，藉此找出重合資料。我們也透過QGIS，找出公路沿線一定距離範圍內的變異點。","1. 資料處理：合併大量公有土地檔案時，官方公布的公有土地資料分為kml和xml資料，皆是以細緻單位做公布，檔案量巨大，但由於有後續QGIS處理需求，我們需要將大量資料先行合併。kml資料部份，我們透過開源工具kml merger整合；xml部分，我們透過Python批量合併上萬筆的檔案，同樣完善各項欄位，並轉化為容易分析的資料表形式。


2. 人力：資料分析及處理，是由1位全職資料記者、1位兼職資料記者進行。

3. 資料查核：團隊明白任何一種方法論都有侷限，數據也有可能產生誤區。因此，記者也仔細、逐一與各地地方政府查證，確認當地實際狀況，避免產生誤會。例如屏東縣多數違規的土石來源是河川砂石場，樣態與其他地區有別。


4. QGIS技術：在套疊地理圖資時，由於公有土地細緻度高，也造成QGIS效能考驗，也可能中途當機，需要耐心等待電腦完成運算。

5. 製圖：地圖是本篇報導重要的製作核心。考量地圖精美度，團隊採用QGIS製作，並逐一蒐集變異點位資料、公路圖資、行政區圖資，而數據記者及設計師都需要具備軟體操作技能，才能完成協作。考量電腦版及手機版差異，我們也仔細安排地圖的資訊量，希望達到理想的閱讀效果。","1. 可根據官方既有、可信的資料，建立方法論：這次使用的資料並非環保部門所有，而是營建署的衛星變異點資料，因有現場查核機制，具一定可信度。未來若遇資料品質不佳情況，其他部門公開資料或有機會成為另一種替代取徑。


2. 衛星點位資料可探討其他地貌改變現象：營建署衛星點位違規項目非常多元，這次我們只使用了和土石、廢棄物堆放有關的類目。倘若其他議題與新增建物違規有關，或為水土保持有關的地貌改變，皆有機會採用同樣的方法論來進行分析。

Apesar da cobertura dos média, dos debates e da propaganda, torna-se impossível para uma grande maioria dos eleitores saber exactamente o que propõem.

Partindo desse pressuposto, a equipa de dados do PÚBLICO transformou todos estes programas eleitorais numa gigante folha de cálculo, onde numa matriz era possível saber se um partido concordava, discordava ou não tinha opinião sobre um tópico.

O resultado? Uma espécie de clone do tinder para responder à pergunta: “Com que programa eleitoral sairia para jantar?”.","Este terá sido o projecto mais viral que a nossa equipa já produziu, superando as nossas expectativas e mostrando que nada como uma boa base de dados e um conceito “fora da caixa” para deixar os cidadãos interessados pelas ideias dos partidos.","O grande desafio neste trabalho foi transformar dados não estruturados - programas eleitorais - em dados estruturados - uma matriz de concordância, indiferença ou discordância face a um tema. Como o desafio era demasiado grande para ser apenas feito por humanos, começamos por usar Natural Language Processing (NLP) usando a linguagem de programação R para identificar os temas mais importantes para cada partido. Para tal usamos tf–idf. Identificados esses temas, sinalizamos nos respectivos programas eleitorais onde é que essas palavras surgiam - indicando que possivelmente seria ali que deveríamos ler para encontrar o posicionamento do partido face à questão.

Mas a noite eleitoral deu-nos uma surpresa, e o partido conseguiu uma maioria absoluta na assembleia, ganhando em 252 de 308 concelhos. Quisemos mapear as vitórias e derrotas eleitorais.","O projecto foi publicado logo após a noite eleitoral e permitiu ir um pouco além do “horse race journalism”, percebendo fenómenos locais de alguns partidos. Uma análise micro quando o foco de grande parte dos jornais estava na análise macro permitiu-nos resumir as grandes conclusões da noite eleitoral num scroller. O artigo foi dos mais lidos no rescaldo da noite eleitoral.","Os dados foram recolhidos usando R através da API oficial. Como o objectivo era conseguir ter a peça publicada logo quando os resultados eleitorais fossem apurados para todos os círculos eleitorais, escrevemos um script em R com base na API que tinha sido disponibilizada nas últimas eleições (esperando que não houvesse grandes mudanças na estrutura de dados). Isto permitiu-nos gerar um relatório com as principais conclusões e algumas visualizações logo no momento em que os resultados fecharam.

O trabalho foi desenvolvido usando o mapbox. Mas não era possível fazer grande preparação antes da noite eleitoral uma vez que não sabíamos qual poderia ser a história destas eleições. Deixámos por isso o máximo possível preparado para que, depois de recolhidos e analisados os dados, fosse apenas necessário escrever a narrativa e guiar o leitor no mapa.","A resposta às eleições é típica: resultados, rescaldo e primeiras ilações. Mas o principal destaque é oferecer um novo olhar sobre como se constroem os resultados eleitorais e como o país (dentro de cada concelho) se divide para definir o parlamento português. A estratégia de visualização de dados, com scrollytelling, também permite oferecer mais do que a resposta típica na análise pós-eleitoral.","Acredito que neste caso é interessante realçar a importância daquilo que às vezes chamo de “data mise en place”.

O número de dias em democracia superava, pela primeira vez, o número de dias que o país viveu debaixo de uma ditadura.

Do analfabetismo aos esgotos, contamos em dados 14 revoluções que o país viveu com a democracia.","O projecto foi muito bem-sucedido e ajudou muitos leitores - principalmente os leitores mais novos, já nascidos em democracia - a perceber a evolução e o progresso vivido pelo país em múltiplos indicadores. A grande vantagem deste projecto foi apresentar séries temporais de quase 100 anos - algo que raramente vemos.","A análise de dados foi feita com recurso à linguagem de programação R.

READr consolidates past Zone expropriation plans and found that 80% of the development plans were primarily for building housing. By comparing the vacancy rate of the development area, it was discovered that the vacancy rate of the Zone expropriation locations was almost always higher than the average.This result shows that the housing supply is greater than the demand, the development plan is obviously overly optimistic, and the necessity is insufficient.","This report is the first one to use data and statistics, such as vacancy rates and transaction data, to prove the long-standing issue of Zone expropriation abuse in Taiwan. Unlike previous reports that only examined individual cases, this report uses comprehensive data analysis to highlight the systemic problems of Zone expropriation, which has received feedback from many domestic land-use scholars.","We collected the locations of Zone expropriation over the years, and through the use of QGIS software, we were able to combine the Zone expropriation locations with the Ministry of the Interior's village empty housing data to obtain the number of empty houses in that area. Additionally, we also utilized a scrolling video with a map of Taiwan's empty housing rate as the main focus, with text explanations and photos to allow readers to understand the overall situation of Zone expropriation.","Data journalism is often limited by the completeness of the data, and the most difficult aspect of this report is the government's lack of transparency in data, such as the vacancy rate within the scope of the plan. We had to rely on multiple sources of data and cross-reference them to obtain the vacancy rate of the expropriation plan. Even the land transaction data of the plan, which should be public government data, was hidden on different websites. However, we were able to overcome the lack of transparency in data through various means, and successfully produced the first data-based expropriation report.","When discussing the issue of Zone expropriation, it is easy to be limited to case-by-case discussions. However, data provides us with a good direction. When we consolidated all Zone expropriation plans, we found that more than 80% were primarily for the development of housing. 
However, this contradicts Taiwan's low birthrate problem. So we further compared the vacancy rate of the Zone expropriation location, which provided a new data perspective to review Zone expropriation.

Spain,Maldita.es,Small,Participant,,Los decretos del Gobierno,2022-11-03,"Investigation, Database, Chart, Politics","Scraping, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, CSV","La investigación sobre los reales decretos de los Gobiernos en España hecha en 2022 en Maldita.es ha mirado al pasado para traer la información al presente.

Hemos creado una base de datos acumulando la información de todos los decretos aprobados por los Gobiernos de nuestra democracia. Así hemos podido descubrir y revelar que este año el actual presidente del Gobierno ha superado al resto en número de decretos aprobados, una herramienta legislativa bastante criticada por su poco control por parte de la oposición.

También hemos podido comprobar y revelar que normalmente los cambios que propone la oposición no se aprueban.","La labor de periodismo de datos de Maldita.es se emplea para fiscalizar a nuestros Gobiernos y representantes públicos. Este 2022 creamos nuestra propia base de datos sobre los decretos leyes aprobados por los Gobiernos de la democracia. Esta herramienta legislativa permite a los Gobiernos estar menos fiscalizados por el Congreso. 

Gracias a esa base de datos y a su análisis pudimos explicar que el actual presidente ya ha utilizado más los decretos que sus predecesores o que la mayoría de veces que el Congreso pide que esos decretos sean modificados para poder introducir algún cambio esto no acaba sucediendo. 

Del abuso de esta figura se ha hablado bastante en España, pero nunca se había hecho un análisis a ese nivel histórico y de detalle. Además, publicamos nuestra base de datos en abierto, como hacemos en multitud de ocasiones. 

El impacto fue importante a nivel de audiencia, pero también a nivel político y social. Publicamos también una información donde detallabamos qué partidos eran los que más habían apoyado esos decretos del Gobierno y cuáles los que menos. Algunos de los que más nos contactaron quejándose de nuestra información, como si los datos pudieran engañar. Su argumento venía a ser: 'hemos apoyado mucho los decretos, pero otras cosas no tanto'.","Para crear la base de datos pudimos scrappear el Boletín Oficial del Estado (BOE) de España y así extraer el histórico de reales decretos leyes aprobados desde el inicio de nuestra democracia y ver qué Gobiernos los habían aprobado y de qué trataban. Después, para poder saber el estado de los decretos del actual Gobierno en el Congreso y qué había votado cada partido en los casos que ya habían llegado al pleno del Congreso tuvimos que revisar distintas páginas webs e informaciones del Congreso para ir complementando nuestra base de datos. Esto nos permitió familiarizarnos con lo que estaba sucediendo y poder explicarno con contexto y background tras analizar nuestra base de datos y encontrar distintos hallazgos.

También pudimos comprobar y revelar que de los 130 reales decretos leyes convalidados por el Congreso desde que el actual presidente Pedro Sánchez está en el cargo, los diputados han votado que 72 se tramiten como proyectos de ley para poder introducir enmiendas, ya que es la forma que tienen de poder hacer modificaciones, pero por ahora sólo 16 de ellos se han acabado convirtiendo en leyes y, por lo tanto, han podido ser modificados. Pedro Sánchez es presidente desde 2018. Ese problema sucede porque la mayoría de veces aunque los partidos aprueben los decretos del Gobierno a cambio de que luego se conviertan en leyes para poder modificarlos, después la mayoría del Gobierno en la mesa del Congreso paraliza la tramitación de los decretos como leyes a las que se les puede realizar enmiendas.","Todo nuestro trabajo de extracción de datos y posterior complemento manual de la información para tener una base de datos completísima con todas las posibles variables sobre los decretos aprobados por el Gobierno no fue únicamente para nuestra publicación. Tras realizar nuestras informaciones y confeccionar y revisar nuestra base de datos, la publicamos en abierto para que cualquiera pueda utilizarla, consultarla, descargarla o lo que desee.

Es algo que hacemos en muchas ocasiones en Maldita.es ya que creemos en la importancia de los datos abiertos, pero en este caso era más necesario que nunca. Esos datos están en distintas fuentes (BOE, web del Congreso, etc.) y es muy difícil para los ciudadanos poder consultar qué ha sucedido exactamente con cada decreto concreto, si ha sido modificado en el Congreso o no, cuántos ha aprobado cada presidente, etcétera. Por eso, considerabamos fundamental que tras la ardúa labor para recopilar toda la información y verificarla esa base de datos quedara disponible para cualquier otra persona que quiera investigar o analizar este tema o cualquier ciudadano que quiera consultar de ofrma rápida y completa qué ha sucedido con un decreto concreto, cosa que no se puede hacer a día de hoy en ninguna web pública, aunque las administraciones deberían cumplir esta función.","La importancia de fijarnos en el pasado para comprender y comparar lo que está sucediendo en el presente, no sólo porque el actual presidente fuera quien ha aprobado más decretos y pudieramos descubrirlo y contarlo. También porque antes de ser presidente Pedro Sánchez criticaba al anterior presidente español, Mariano Rajoy, por excederse utilizando esta figura.

Rajoy aprobó 107 decretos en casi ocho años de presidencia. Sánchez llevaba 132 en el momento de publicación de nuestra investigación, tras poco más de cuatro años como presidente. 

Es un buen ejemplo de lo importante que es recordar lo que decían los políticos en el pasado y revisar si han cumplido con lo que prometían o si han sido coherentes con lo que criticaban. Tener clara la hemeroteca es fundamental en el periodismo y también se puede aplicar a las investigaciones de periodismo de datos, como demuestra este caso.

Estas informaciones de Maldita.es también muestran la importancia de que el periodismo de datos ejerza labores de vigilancia parlamentaria y fiscalización del poder. Habitualmente las han hecho los periodistas tradicionales como cronistas parlamentarios, pero son incluso mejores cuando se abordan desde el periodismo de datos, ya que el trabajo de 'hormiguita' de analizar caso a caso o de forma sistémica con bases de datos permite llegar a muchos más hallazgos y hacer informaciones más relevantes y de mayor servicio público. Este caso es un ejemplo. En España se hablaba de que Sánchez estaba aprobando muchos decretos leyes, pero hasta que hicimos esta investigación basada en datos no se pudo conocer que ya había superado a sus predecesores en número de decretos o que estos decretos no se estaba consiguiendo que se modificaran en el Congreso en la mayoría de casos a pesar de que el Gobierno prometiera que así se haría a sus socios parlamentarios.",Spanish,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221103/decretos-gobierno-sanchez-leyes/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221107/decretos-gobierno-congreso-leyes-no-aprobadas/,https://maldita.es/malditodato/20221111/decretos-gobierno-votaciones-congreso-partidos/,https://maldita.es/tag/decretos-sanchez,,,,"Rubén Díaz Grano de Oro, Sergio Sangiao Pérez","Maldita.es es una fundación y medio de comunicación sin ánimo de lucro que lucha contra la desinformación y promueve la transparencia a través del fact-checking y el periodismo de datos.

The 30-part series explores the costs, benefits, and dangers of life in a democracy helmed by those of advanced age, where issues of profound importance to the nation's youth and future — technology, civil rights, the environment — are in the hands of those whose primes have passed and priorities differ.","Following the release of this package of stories, public conversation about the advancing age of Congress began in earnest. Our first story, about the data underlying our project, received 5 million impressions on social media and 149,000 engagements. Furthermore, our polling and reporting for the first time articulated public tolerance for legislation to address the issue, and was the first to indicate robust, bipartisan and intergenerational dissatisfaction with the current system. 

This project sought to address a new and unexpected shift in American politics, where the representatives in Congress, judges of federal courts, and the presidency itself have come to be uniquely dominated by older generations over the past thirty years. This is abnormal and a significant deviation from the overall trend of the twentieth century. Indeed, we found the percentage of Congress that is a septuagenarian or older has reached 23% of the body, which is substantially higher than the 4% to 10% range seen throughout the twentieth century. Given the zero-sum nature of elected office, this has been catastrophic for representation across age demographics within Congress: while half of Americans are aged 38 or younger, just 4% of Congress is, an abnormally low amount historically. 

This has had reverberations across public life: on issues that pertain to young voters and the possibility for younger generations to become meaningfully involved in Congress. The American people feel very strongly about it: a Morning Consult/Insider poll conducted of 2,200 Americans found bipartisan and intergenerational discontent with the aging of the body. It’s a meaningful issue with a number of systemic causes — partisan redistricting, fundraising, the ascent of small-dollar donors, the value placed on seniority in the system and more — that we were able to report on throughout the series.","Besides traditional journalism, a number of social science research techniques were applied throughout this series. 

First, we combined reams of historical information regarding the birth, death and service dates of American federal judges, Senators, members of Congress and members of the Cabinet into a database that allowed us to draw direct conclusions about the historical age of the American government. We combined this with data taken from the U.S. Census going back to 1820 to see how the American government has reflected the American population. We also used the GovTrack database of historical members of congress, which was instrumental in our findings.

Second, several of our journalists included historians and political scientists directly into their stories. The sophisticated electoral analysis required on some stories, including ones about the impact of age on presidents historically, the prevalence and cost of special elections, and the impact of partisan redistricting were only possible with the advice of social science practitioners. 
Third, we worked with the Center for Responsive Politics to analyze millions of small donor records to determine how retirees were beginning to develop an outsized impact on U.S. political fundraising. 

Fourth, we worked with the blue chip pollster Morning Consult on a massive survey of over 2,200 Americans that put the questions directly to the voters of how the age of the American government affected them. Working closely with the polling experts at Morning Consult, we used a number of techniques in this poll to ensure that the questions were asked in a manner that minimized possible bias. 
We consistently involved experts in our journalism and confirmed with them that the trends we were seeing manifesting in the data and the polling were grounded in ongoing research into how Congress functions and how incentives in government can change outcomes in government.","The genesis of the project stemmed from the observation that the people in Congress, especially congressional leadership, did not appear to share the concerns that a substantial amount of our younger audience did. We saw remarkable interest from readers in stories about student debt and activism about the slow movement of the climate transition and gun violence legislation but did not see the same concern among Congressional leadership. One contributing factor, we deduced, was the lack of exposure to the issue, that congressional and executive leadership born in the 1940s did not have student debt, nor a personal stake in the climate transition, nor had they ever had an active shooter drill in high school. 

From there, we ran the numbers to see if our suspicions about the body as a whole were accurate in the data. When we confirmed that congress and the federal judiciary was older than anyone had even estimated, the project began in earnest. 

“Red, White, and Gray” was a substantial undertaking involving dozens of reporters, editors, graphics designers and researchers. It contained an unprecedented number of ways we were able to convey our journalism, from essential classics like text articles and videos to new journalistic techniques like innovative graphic design, audio, and national polling, and finally even ambitious, rarely-attempted journalistic and commentary mediums such as tabletop roleplaying gaming. The project attempted to tell a comprehensive story about one of the most important issues in American government in an accessible, readable manner that would reach new readers that otherwise would not be aware of the issue at hand and the remedies on the table to fix it.","Insider sought to present “Red, White, and Gray” in a compelling, exhaustive (but not exhausting!) and engaging fashion to better explain the stakes of government by gerontocracy as the nation headed to the polls for the 2022 midterms — and readies for an undoubtedly tumultuous 2024 presidential election season.

To that goal, we produced and published data interactives and visualizations, a quiz, a scientific poll, and several videos and slideshows, such as a mini-documentary featuring the descendants of five U.S. presidents explaining the pros and cons of a youthful commander in chief.",English,https://www.businessinsider.com/gerontocracy-united-states-government-red-white-gray-2022-9,https://www.businessinsider.com/gerontocracy-united-states-congress-red-white-and-gray-data-charts-2022-9,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-a-presidents-brain-can-change-with-age-2022-8,https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-biden-age-poll-term-limits-medical-checks-poll-2022-9,https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-bidens-views-issues-abortion-afghanistan-education-race-police-crime-2022-9,https://www.businessinsider.com/politicians-age-quiz-congress-white-house-united-states-2022-8,https://www.businessinsider.com/dungeons-and-dragons-game-congress-government-2022-10,"Reporters: C.

United States,NPR,Big,Participant,,Those fake active shooter calls to schools? A similar thing happened before,2022-10-24,"Investigation, Infographics, Audio, Crime","D3.js, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets","Using a series of public records requests and expert sourcing in law enforcement and cybersecurity, NPR correspondents were able to track a mysterious hoax caller reporting false bomb threats and shootings at schools across the country. The caller, who appeared to be operating out of Ethiopia, used an internet based calling platform called Voice Over IP–a service that has serious challenges cracking down on fraud and abuse.","NPR’s reporting brought together seemingly disparate data points from schools and local police departments around the country to reveal not only a disturbing trend but a specific pattern of activity that can be traced back to a single person or group of people. As a result, federal law enforcement is more deeply aware of the perpetrator’s activities, and local communities can begin linking up to share information. Local students, teachers, and parents desperately want more information about how an anonymous hoax caller can inspire very real fear and mobilize law enforcement. If we can’t yet answer why, we can begin to answer how. 

Following NPR’s reporting, other journalists began requesting records in their communities, and technical experts have been able to dig more deeply into the caller’s background. 

At least partially as a result of NPR’s reporting, one Voice Over IP service called TextNow decided to permanently ban users in Ethiopia from accessing its platform.","The foundation of this reporting were data and reports obtained from FOIA requests. One responsive document to a FOIA request contained detailed information that a Louisiana sheriff’s department had uncovered in its investigation of a hoax call that appeared to be part of the swatting pattern. The response was sent as a PDF image. It contained several tables, including logs of all calls made and received by the Voice Over IP phone number behind one false bomb threat. NPR used optical character recognition technology to convert these tables into spreadsheets to help discern patterns in the caller’s activity.

With the spreadsheets, we used a number of tools. Pivot tables allowed us to examine peak dates on which this caller made most hoax calls. We joined data in these tables with external tables to find which states were targeted, illustrating the caller’s pattern of focusing on a select few states on each day. We also used Excel formulas to calculate the length of phone calls and time between phone calls, lending evidence that the calls were done by a human, rather than automated.

As for the investigation into problems with Voice Over IP, NPR Cybersecurity Correspondent Jenna McLaughlin shared call detail records with technical experts who were able to explain patterns of behavior, the caller’s potential location, and more. McLaughlin also created her own TextNow account and communicated with a community of so-called “scambaiters” about their efforts to target and locate abusers of the platform.","This investigation began with NPR’s domestic extremism correspondent, Odette Yousef, because in recent years “swatting” schemes have been used by domestic extremist groups and individuals. But as we learned more, it became apparent that these swatting calls to schools are something very different. So far, the caller and his motive for pursuing this sustained and wide-ranging scheme remains unknown.

But in searching for more information, NPR has filed scores of FOIA requests to local government agencies in dozens of states, each with its own unique laws around releasing 911 calls and investigatory reports. On top of this complexity, the FBI has undertaken an investigation of these calls. Because of that, many local agencies have declined to provide documents pending the federal investigation.","NPR’s reporting demonstrates that reading local news closely and following up with additional requests for records can allow national reporters and correspondents to find patterns that are hiding in plain sight. While a large number of local news outlets had reported on the hoax bomb threats and false shooter calls, few had more deeply explored how frequently it was happening elsewhere, and whether or not an individual person or group might be behind it–or why. 

While the records NPR obtained can only reveal so much, it provides a roadmap for journalists looking for meaningful, national or international trends, as well as an example of how correspondents on different beats with different areas of expertise can collaborate. Bringing in journalists with a skill set in data, extremism, and cybersecurity allowed NPR to dig more deeply into each facet of this project, and put the pieces together in a way we wouldn’t otherwise have been able to.",English,https://www.npr.org/2022/10/24/1129919258/swatting-fake-school-shooter-calls-hoax-pattern,https://www.npr.org/2022/10/07/1127242702/false-calls-about-active-shooters-at-schools-are-up-why,,,,,,"Odette Yousef, Jenna McLaughlin, Daniel Wood, Kaitlyn Radde, Andrew Sussman","Odette Yousef is an NPR national security correspondent focusing on extremism.

We received 2022 drop box locations from the Georgia Secretary of State. We then used Geocod.io and ArcGIS geocoder to locate the coordinates for each address. For addresses of each voter, we used Census Batch Geocoder, and then Geocodio and ArcGIS to fill in the blanks.

Isochrones and geospatial analysis: For each drop box location, NPR generated travel time maps, or areas in which a voter can travel to the drop box by driving or public transit within given time frames. NPR used [TravelTime](https://traveltime.com/) to generate transit travel time maps and [here.com](https://www.here.com/?cid=Brand-PureBrand-Google-YT-0-Here-AMER-US&utm_source=Google&utm_medium=ppc&utm_campaign=IOT_Paidsearch_GenericProduct_AlwaysOn&utm_term=here%20technologies&gclid=CjwKCAjwq5-WBhB7EiwAl-HEkjchq7W5gk2RRm1NioQaIbo48_OXQXN0KI_aNhjDFNZ7zjX7HnL9kBoC3nsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) for driving travel time maps. NPR then overlaid the travel time maps with voter addresses to estimate the minimum time frames it would take for each voter to get to a drop box within their county. NPR used the drop box location data and Georgia's voter rolls to calculate travel time intervals to drop boxes available in 2020 and 2022 for nearly every voter.

Demographic and socioeconomic analysis: to understand how travel time to a drop box changed for different voter groups, NPR referenced characteristics of each voter including race and ethnicity from the registered voter list from the Georgia secretary of state, the census-tract-level income and ownership data from American Community Survey, and precinct voting data compiled by [The New York Times](https://github.com/TheUpshot/presidential-precinct-map-2020).","To find the two voters in the story, the two Georgia-based reporters made dozens of cold phone calls to Georgia voters guided by public voting records and also the data analysis run by the DC-based reporter, which indicated neighborhoods most affected by the new law. It is the seamless collaboration between journalists with different skills, access and resources that gives the story depth and color. 

The compilation of drop box usage data in the 2020 election is a continuation of work started from Georgia Public Boradcasting’s collaboration with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, where reporters requested ballot transfer forms from the secretary of state’s office and county election offices. The team [reported](https://www.ajc.com/politics/drop-box-use-soared-in-democratic-areas-before-georgia-voting-law/N4ZTGHLWD5BRBOUKBHTUCFVOEU/) on drop box usage in four metro-Atlanta counties after compiling drop box usage data in those counties. The manual-labor heavy process laid important groundwork for this story, which itself involves much manual data input for the rest of the state. 

We used travel time maps to calculate travel time increments for each voter because we don't have the financial resources to calculate precise travel time to a drop box for each address. Large-scale geospatial analysis requires substantial computational power and processing time, and we’re grateful that we have our newsrooms’ support.

The story was published during a time when drop boxes were the subject of numerous voter fraud conspiracies, and has attracted attacks and criticism online. Some critiques were partisan, others seemingly arising from spurious inferences of causality. The reporters have felt compelled to [respond](https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1552635714206064641) and explain on social media.","Time management juggling short and long term stories: The two Georgia-based reporters found themselves filling daily news one day and trying to meet characters for this long-term project another day, while trying to do data input during the little downtime they had. It was helpful to commit to meeting regularly and keeping good notes to keep the project on track. In our case, reporters met weekly or biweekly with the editor and reporters met at least weekly. 

Collaboration between journalists with different skills: the reporting team benefited from complementary skills and access - the DC-based reporter has data journalism skills and GA-based reporters have local access and knowledge. Even if we focus on different aspects of the story, it was important for us to teach others what we know - from explaining what travel time maps are to inside baseball terms of the Georgia legislature. This helped us make sure everyone was asking the right questions for their reporting and were on the same page when we wrote the story together.

Large scale geocoding: Census Batch Geocoder is a great tool and it’s free, but it consistently fails to geocode about 10% of all the addresses. When triangulating between different geocoding services, it’s important to programmatically keep track of which geocoding service processed which address, so journalists can be sure that all addresses get geocoded and also they aren’t spending excess funds on paid geocoding services.",English,https://www.npr.org/2022/07/27/1112487312/georgia-voting-law-ballot-drop-box-access,https://github.com/NPR-investigations/SB_202_analysis,,,,,,"Huo Jingnan, Koko Nakajima, Daniel Wood, Stephen Fowler/GPB, Sam Gringlas/WABE; Editing by Cheryl W.

We had to rely heavily on satellite data and local journalists on ground, who were not always connected on cell networks due to the power cuts particularly in Sindh and Balochistan.
