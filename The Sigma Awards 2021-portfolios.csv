Nigeria,"The Nation Newspaper, Nigeria",Big,Shortlist,Justina Asishana," I am Justina Asishana, I have been working as a Journalist for the past seven years. I am a graduate of the National Open University of Nigeria and began my Journalism career as a Staff with New Nigerian Newspaper before moving down to Daily Newswatch newspaper and after it went down, I began writing for The Nation Newspaper where I am currently employed.        In 2019, I recieved a training on Data and Investigative Journalism by the Premium Times Center for Investigative Journalism in Nigeria and in 2020, I recieved another training on Data and Solutions Journalism by the Pan Atlantic University in Nigeria. After these trainings, I have tried my best in infusing data and infographics into my reporting.        I  am inspired in infusing data and infographics into my reportage because it makes it easier for the people to understand and due to the limited reading span of an individual, I realize that they relate and understand the infographics more than straight reporting.        During this period, I was contacted by the African Women Journalism Project (AWJP) to write reports regarding COVID-19 and they encouraged the use of data and infographics, this made me embrace the fellowship and used a lot of infographics in my stories with the help of those in the project.        I have realized that although there is limited data in Nigeria but Journalists can either generate data on their own or use the available data and infuse it into their reportage, this, I think would make journalists embrace data journalism and not see it as too cumbersome. I am inspired to using and infusing data into my reportage because it is interesting and fun of making something complex into a simple process where the people in can understand.        I should be considered for this award because it would give me an opportunity to expand my network in data journalism and connect me with other experts who will take me through the new aspects of days journalism. It would also boost my zeal in writing more data oriented stories.        Lastly, it has been on my mind to improve the capacity of journalists who are my colleagues on Data journalism and how they can infuse data into their reportage.  "," In my portfolio, I have various data stories relating to health, finance and women issues; majority of the project was done with a focus on the impact of COVID-19.    In the virus pandemic story, it was difficult in getting data of women affected financially by COVID-19, while a lot of people were confessing to have lost their jobs, the only available data in Nigeria was by the National Bureau of Statistics and the data did not really focus on women. A data analyst in the Africa Women Journalism Project helped in drawing the visualization.    In the family planning story, ""baby boom looms in Niger"", I used data gotten from health centers I visited. I drew up the visualization myself, so also is the deforestation story.    The other story was done in collaboration with a data analyst who designed the visualization with the data I presented.  ",https://thenationonlineng.net/virus-pandemic-as-financial-tsunami-for-women/,https://thenationonlineng.net/covid-19-how-niger-govt-bridged-learning-gap/amp/,https://thenationonlineng.net/agricultural-processors-bemoan-covid-19-losses/,https://thenationonlineng.net/malnutrition-a-silent-pandemic-ravaging-children/,https://thenationonlineng.net/deforestation-worsens-climate-change-ii/,https://thenationonlineng.net/covid-19-baby-boom-looms-in-niger-state/,,,,,,,,,,,,
Spain,Mundo Deportivo,Small,Shortlist,"Ferran Morales, Mundo Deportivo","  I am Ferran Morales, I have been working at Mundo Deportivo for 21 years, currently we mainly do work for the web but we still maintain the commitment to make double pages of paper we continue to maintain, in this complicated 2020 where many competitions were not disputed it was very complicated, but thanks to the bet of the medium we were able to maintain and even exceed the quality of previous years. I am a very restless person and I always try to evolve year after year, I believe that the adaptation of new methodologies to carry out some online jobs (scrolltelling) will help us to do better jobs in the coming years.","The work presented are both digital and printed pieces of work published at El Mundo Deportivo.


Last year I built together with Angel Rigueira (the Tennis Editor at El Mundo Deportivo) a graphic about Rafa Nadal that got a finalist at the Sigma Awards. This year, our goal was to compare the Big Three (Rafa, Federer and Djokovic). 


We first built a printed version, double page (Big Three PDF), visualizing data from each tournament by player, with a closer deep dive on the number of points, Grand Slams, court surface and the classification from the ATP ranking. 


When doing the digital piece, we completely changed the point of view, including a scroll to highlight specific information. 


Leo Messi beat Pele's record as the player with the highest amount of goals scored with the same team. Together with Gabriel Sans (football editor), we gathered data from each goal: from where was this scored, its trajectory, season, journey, amongst other data. 


In order to adapt this to the online version, as we wanted to keep all the data, we had to gather these in a different manner, using the scroll again, so that we could highlight the most important facts or data. 



Lastly, I present the visualization done to celebrate the 700 goals scored by Leo Messi with th FC Barcelona and the Argentina selection. For this one, we filtered by competition and team that received the goal, amongst other data. The main image for this piece was the one about Messi with his thumbs pointing to the sky.

 

Tools used were Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Ai2Html, Java Script, HTML5, CSS3, Jquery and Google Spreadsheet. All data was gathered and saved in a Google spreadsheet.

India,"Mint, IndiaSpend, Medium, Soundcloud and Podcast websites for Podcast",Small,Shortlist,Rukmini S," I am an independent data journalist based in Chennai, India.   I have been a journalist since 2004, and for my first four years, I was a beat reporter with The Times of India, the world's most widely circulated newspaper, in Mumbai. I covered schools and colleges, courts and police stations, slums and high-rises, human rights abuses and resistances, and the government. As a rookie reporter, I was dispatched across the length and breadth of the city and its surroundings, and the experience was invaluable. What it did was to show mw how the levers of democracy actually work.   After taking up the Felix Scholarship to do an MSc in Development Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, I returned to India in 2009 and joined the Times Insight Group, a small team of data journalists, at The Times of India in Delhi. My work focused on politics, gender, inequality and crime. I travelled the length and breadth of the country in addition to my data work - on the trail of the first female candidates for electoral office in India's easternmost state, on the frontlines of village elections in India's westernmost state, in small local courtrooms, in farms and factories.   In 2013, I joined The Hindu, India's third largest English newspaper, as National Data Editor, the first Data Editor in an Indian newsroom. From 2013 to 2016, I led the organisation's data reporting through one keenly contested national election and several state elections, multiple budgets, Censuses, and other key moments. I carved a niche for myself as a journalist with the ground reporting abilities to procure exclusive data, and put it in proper context, as well as the data analytic abilities to draw new insights from the data, and the storytelling abilities to open new windows in the minds of readers. For a readership that was seeking to cut through rhetoric and partisan news reporting, this fresh data-driven approach was welcome, as our numbers began to show.   Two projects I did at The Hindu stood out. One, put data from India's religious Census in context, upturning the prevailing false narrative that fed Islamophbia. The other analysed cases of sexual assault to uncover the range of nuance that police statistics hid.   I left The Hindu after having my first baby in 2016 and later joined HuffPost India as Editor, Data & Innovation. After my second baby was born in 2017, I moved to working independently. I am now a columnist for Mint and IndiaSpend, and an occasional writer for a host of Indian and foreign publications, as well as the host of my own podcast. I believe I have established myself as one of India's foremost data journalists, and a compelling storyteller.   I won the Likho Awards for Excellence in Media in 2019 for data-driven reporting on changing attitudes to homosexuality. In 2020, I received an Honourable Mention for the Chameli Devi Jain Awards for an Outstanding Woman Journalist.   I believe that my body of work in 2020, a particularly challenging year for most and for me certainly, is something to be proud of. I was able to communicate both fact and uncertainty with a country full of questions, and tackle not just questions around health and reporting, but also the ripple effects on society and the economy. I would be honoured to be considered for the Sigma Awards 2021. ","I am an independent data journalist based in Chennai, India. I was the first Data Editor in an Indian newsroom when I was National Data Editor of The Hindu newspaper from 2013-2016, and my first ten years of journalism was exclusively for print (and allied digital) organisations. From 2016 to 2018, I was Editor (Data & Innovations) at HuffPost India, my first digital-only job. I have been an independent journalist since August 2018, and for me, 2020 was the year of exploring data journalism across media and formats. For the Indian media organisation India Today, I tracked covid numbers nearly daily to pick up trends in surges and declines early. I created original datasets using both publicly available data from Indian states and countries across the world, as well as data obtained through my reporting. My reporting identified early insights including on the possible impact on numbers of antigen testing in India, the emergence of high mortality hotspots in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Punjab that warranted closer monitoring, and states where numbers were unusually steady and lacked variation, meriting some scepticism. The articles were frequently the most widely read on India Today's website in,  got the attention of the government, and were widely shared on social media. Officials charged with the pandemic response in Indian states contacted me for further insight from what I was seeing in the numbers to help tackle their outbreaks. For the Indian data journalism IndiaSpend, I wrote deeply researched and reported analytical pieces, often using data never accessed before, on the broader stories of the pandemic - addressing whether India was under-counting covid deaths and how it could fill in the blanks, trying to answer what could explain some of the mysteries of India's numbers, and interviewing experts and doctors from across the country. The articles were well received by the health and policy communities as well as from readers who were seeking proper context over enduring questions over Indian numbers. One reported story that showed how the pandemic had brought routine health services to a crash was brought up by MPs with the Indian government in Parliament. For the Indian newspaper Mint, I wrote data-driven pieces on the socio-economic impact and context of covid - what it meant for women in India's workforce, how India was in danger of missing disease and death among its most marginalised, how healthcare costs and the mode of accessing healthcare was important to understand covid. For international publications including The Guardian and South China Morning Post, I wrote analytical pieces using my insights from the data to explain the situation in the country and assess policy responses. The pieces helped ignite a conversation about whether the ""new normal"" was going to be more or less equal, and what India's existing struggles with state capacity and healthcare delivery meant for our covid response. Since March 2020, I also began a pandemic podcast, The Moving Curve, researched and recorded myself at home. I draw upon my data work and interviews with experts and those on the ground to break down news and insights from the pandemic for listeners who are looking for distillation and synthesis. I was floored by the reception to the podcast, and each new episode is met with praise for people looking for calm and unbiased data analysis and commentary. I am now over 108 episodes in, have built a loyal following, and won an Emergent Ventures Covid-19 India Prize for the podcast. Between them, these projects constitute my portfolio for 2020, and I am proud of my body of work in a challenging",medium.com/@rukminiwrites,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19-indian-exceptionalism-may-not-explain-low-mortality/,https://www.indiaspend.com/health/india-may-be-reversing-decades-of-progress-on-child-nutrition-new-govt-data-show-701363,https://www.indiaspend.com/why-audits-reconciled-death-data-are-still-missing-covid-deaths/,https://www.indiaspend.com/covid-19-disrupted-indias-routine-health-services/,https://www.indiaspend.com/do-we-really-know-why-covid-19-spikes-in-some-places/,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-s-poor-suffer-cough-and-cold-routinely-making-coronavirus-detection-difficult-11585544409496.html,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/why-india-migrants-walked-back-home-11590564390171.html,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/india-s-post-covid-recovery-in-employment-has-not-been-equal-for-men-and-women-11605509801472.html,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/your-caste-and-class-determines-how-you-spend-time-11602657834829.html,,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,"BBC, Local News Partnerships",Big,Shortlist,BBC Shared Data Unit," Dear judges,   I'd like to put forward for consideration the work of the BBC's Shared Data Unit (SDU) during 2020, a unique exercise in collaborative journalism.   During the pandemic, the team has explored and explained the implications of the pandemic to UK audiences through data.  We have brought dozens of datasets into the public domain through our open Github repository, along with accompanying methodology and code.   https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/shared-data-unit     Background    The SDU was set up to support the development of data journalism skills across the local news industry. This was in recognition of the growing importance of these skills in the face of more data being created and made available than ever before in all areas of public life, including local government.  It is a key initiative within the BBC and industry Local News Partnerships (LNP)     The unit delivers: a) The creation of large-scale data investigations in the form of data packs that LNP Partners can access and use to create stories of local interest and relevance b) Training courses for journalists that provide them with the necessary skills and experience to bring back to their home newsrooms.   The SDU aims to bring high quality investigative journalism to its local partner network and the BBC.  Its reporters take the time and space to work on exclusive investigative journalism, using cutting edge digital techniques to tell stories that would otherwise go untold.   One of the unique successes of the SDU has been to bring together journalists from media organisations to work on stories in collaboration.  Secondees bring fresh ideas to the SDU core team, who help work on those ideas and bring them to publication across our public network.     The stories have generated hundreds of local stories for more than 400 partner outlets.   The unit's output also generated content for network BBC programmes including the News Channel, Radio 2, BBC Radio 4 Today, Five Live, and the One, Six and Ten O'Clock news.  It has generated hundreds of news bulletins or leads across BBC local radio stations and regional television programmes.   In addition, the unit's output has been used by BBC Wales, BBC Scotland, Good Morning Ulster and the Sunday Politics show.   The move to home-working brought about by the pandemic necessitated a switch from in-house secondments to remote learning.   From September to October, 2020, the SDU ran a pilot with local news partners offering remote training sessions in four key areas.  Around 70 local journalists benefited from the sessions.    The sessions took delegates through the basics of spreadsheets including how to sort, filter and pivot data using the web-based free application Google Sheets.  The second session included more advanced techniques including how to merge datasets using the VLOOKUP function.  The Freedom of Information masterclass took delegates through how to maximise use of the Act when making requests to local authorities including what to do when your request is denied.  Delegates who took Using Statistics in Journalism learned how to perform descriptive statistics on datasets, as well as learning some of the common pitfalls journalists fall into when using statistics in their work.   Many thanks    Pete Sherlock "," The portfolio we are putting forward for consideration demonstrates how the SDU used data to help explain the implications of the pandemic to a national and regional audience.  We told exclusive stories by bringing inaccessible datasets into the public domain.   Our portfolio also demonstrates a commitment to transparency and open reporting.  All our datasets, code and methodology are published on our Github page and shared across the industry.     These stories made headlines across the BBC's flagship news programmes, as well as across hundreds of local newspapers and regional television and radio outlets.   In April, we reported how hundreds of thousands of key workers considered critical to the UK’s response to the coronavirus crisis were earning below the so-called “real living wage”.   Later that month, we reported experts warning some airports were ""at risk"" of closure because of the loss of business during the coronavirus pandemic.   In May, we reported on fears that the UK's scene would collapse without government support, as the lockdown left 140,000 performers, agents, promoters and technicians without a steady income since the end of March.   Later that month, we told how search interest in online casinos had hit an all-time high in the UK since lockdown began.   In June, the unit told how some of the largest UK councils may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support.   In July, we reported how more than one in six young people are now claiming out-of-work benefits in some parts of the UK.   In August, we reported that flu vaccination rates among the most vulnerable were falling, revealing the scale of the challenge in expanding the vaccination programme.   We also reported how thousands of landlords were trying to avoid renting their properties to benefit claimants, despite a judge ruling a blanket ban was unlawful.   In October 2020, we reported police had wrongly cancelled records of serious crimes, in many cases without informing victims   In November, we reported experts' fears that thousands of smaller charities across the UK could cease to exist in the new year, following a shift in the nature of giving.   In December, we reported millions of people missed out on potentially life-saving scans when non-Covid-19 NHS services almost ground to a halt during the pandemic.

United States,Vox,Small,Shortlist,Vox Covid-19 Data Coverage," To Whom It May Concern—   Wissam Rhayem, is a traveling emergency physician who splits his time between six hospitals in the southwest. Normally, it can take hours to transfer a patient from the small hospitals where he works in the western US to larger facilities with more resources. Now, even those are filling up with coronavirus patients.   Rhayem recently treated a 21-year-old who was on a cross-country family road trip when he got sick with COVID-19. “This kid ...” he trails off. “His heart stopped. We had gotten it pumping again, but he was paralyzed and intubated. I don’t think his Dad thought it was a real thing. I had to tell him that your son is probably not going to make it.”   As a journalist covering Covid-19, reporting on how the news impacts real people has never felt more important. But much of pandemic reporting has involved parsing data and finding visual ways to clearly and concisely communicate critical information. That's why I'm really proud of the Pulitzer-center supported collaboration that You You Zhou, a freelance data journalist, and I published this winter. The third piece in the series is You You Zhou's collaboration with Julia Belluz, a Vox staff writer.    As a freelancer, it's never been harder to place work: Many outlets' budgets have dried up, and quick-moving news cycles make working outside a newsroom even more challenging. That's another reason I'm submitting these pieces now. Despite the odds, they show a close attention to detail, and a commitment to using data to help convey complex topics in a comprehensible manner.   Many thanks in advance for your consideration!   Lois Parshley     "," The first of this series parses how mask use policies have impacted Covid-19 rates in various states. The second expands on that with original research conducted by online survey, finding where the general public was not adequately using masks. The third visually represents different states' approach to Covid-19 vaccinations. Together, they show a commitment to creatively using data to help make the pandemic more understable.  ",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19,https://www.vox.com/2020/12/15/21507630/pfizer-biontech-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-supply-states,https://www.vox.com/21534158/cdc-americans-masks-indoors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hong Kong S.A.R., China",South China Morning Post,Big,Citation,South China Morning Post's Covid-19: our explanatory graphics collection," In the space of 10 years the South China Morning Post’s infographic desk has gone from two designers to the current team of seven visual journalists. The team has grown from researching, writing and designing standalone visual stories for print, to driving the Post’s whirlwind transition from local newspaper to world-class digital news media organisation.    The team’s exuberant, idiosyncratic and distinctive style has proven popular with readers. This might be best reflected by “Coronavirus: the disease Covid-19 explained'', the SCMP’s most-read story of 2020 and “The World of Languages'' from 2015, which remains one of the Post’s all time best-read stories.    Using a combination of traditional illustration and innovative design, the team is always on the lookout for new ways to express themselves and to telegraph ideas to readers. They use each new project as a fresh opportunity to experiment and evolve – their joyful creativity is clear for all to see.    Past and present members of the team form a veritable who’s who in the infographics world. This can be attested to by the revolving door of talent recruited from SCMP for influential positions at such world-leading corporations as National Geographic, Bloomberg and Reuters, as well as the numerous awards ceremonies and  international conferences to which the current team is invited to address. "," The first project in the collection was published on 21 January with the most recent on 28 September, 2020. Our first coronavirus data visualisation alerted the international community to the significance of an obscure disease from faraway Wuhan, China. Published within 24 hours of confirmation that the virus could be transmitted human-to-human we focused on the source of the outbreak and explained why Covid-19 would inevitably become a major worldwide health crisis. As the coronavirus grew from outbreak to epidemic and then to pandemic, we housed our growing library of visual explanatory stories in a single portfolio.   The SCMP was the first major news organisation to take Covid-19 seriously. Uneasy memories of SARS from 2003 were still fresh in the memories of Hongkongers which impelled us to publish ""Wuhan virus: a visual explainer"" before Covid-19 had been named and while the official toll consisted of just 291 infections and two deaths.    With much of the international media playing catch-up, readers turned to the SCMP to unravel the then mysterious coronavirus which propelled ""Covid-19 explained"" into SCMP's most-read story of 2020. <a href=""https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3047038/wuhan-virus/old/21january.html"">https://multimedia.scmp.com/infographics/news/china/article/3047038/wuhan-virus/old/21january.html  We updated the story to ""Coronavirus: the disease Covid-19 explained"" as the coronavirus spread exponentially and included the first real-time tally of global infections and deaths. The code for the toll was used by many international publications on their own sites, gaining SCMP millions of additional clicks.    Adobe illustrator, Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, Sketch, Brackets, Adobe Fresco, Procreate, Java Script, HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, Internal library, Node JS, LoopbackJS, MomentJS, QGIS, Google Spreadsheet, paper and pencil were used.   Data and information from Chinese authorities were collected on a Google Spreadsheet. Data from sources such as Johns Hopkins University, CDC, WHO, was scraped using NodeJs and stored in JSON files in our database before the JSON files were displayed using HTML. We also used vector diagrams, illustrations, video, photos and maps created with QGIS, which were exported as SVGs. Mockup and layouts were done with Adobe XD, Sketch BV; and paper and pencil.   When the coronavirus first broke out there was little consistency in how the international community counted infections and deaths. Many countries failed to include asymptomatic cases and others did not include victims who died from related causes. Some countries simply manipulated the case numbers. Collecting information from Chinese authorities is always difficult, with local and central authorities citing conflicting figures. As Johns Hopkins University emerged as the most reliable source, the 12-hour lag between Asia and America meant it was important for SCMP to independently source the numbers for Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and China to keep the numbers fresh. This made it difficult to create automatic data feeds and meant pivoting on the fly by updating the number manually throughout the day and night.   We have a small team of six visual journalists and one engineer dedicated to visual stories, so in order to keep on top of the constantly changing news we published regular updates and renosed stories so they could evolve as fresh information came to light. The distribution of tasks, such as the production of assets, development of the online site, sketches, ideas, research, writing and editing was shared among the team. This way we were able to meet deadlines and keep developing stories while working across multiple projects and looking for new ways to report the pandemic.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Citation,Manas Sharma portfolio,"The Reuters Graphics team are continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information. Manas Sharma has been instrumental in our progress in 2020, producing a number of striking examples which have pushed the boundaries of data journalism and visual storytelling. From building a COVID-19 epidemiological model from scratch to calculating the damage to the habitats of 1,400 animal species by the Australian bushfires.   This portfolio showcases some his best work, both from a data journalism perspective, such as his research and data scraping of all coronavirus research papers to deliver the ""Speed Science"" project, and also his innovative front end web development and production, like his presentation on the scale of Australia's bushfires, that offered readers a navigable and digestible experience breaking his complex data work into understandable insights for the reader.   Manas, 24, is based in Singapore, working with the graphics team in Asia but collaborating on global stories and data projects. ","   Stopping the spread    Building a herd immunity model    Manas’ role:      Research - key covid data points/parameters and the mathematics of model building  Coding - constructing the model using Javascript  Analysis - batch running thousands of simulations through the model to reveal key findings  Production - front-end web development, allowing the simulations to run in the browser and be placed in the story. An additional, reactive interactive model was added at the bottom of the page for readers to input their own values.    Reuters built an epidemic model to simulate how the coronavirus can spread within a population. We ran the model thousands of times to compare when “herd immunity” would kick in for various reproductive numbers and under a range of scenarios. The model enabled us to show readers what level of immunity would likely be required in order to stop the spread.         Anatomy of Singapore’s outbreak      Manas’ role:      Scraping data - from daily press releases  Handling data - cleaning, formatting, merging  Analysis - to see how clusters were forming and how to visualise  Production - Coding animations in WebGL    Manas transformed printed Covid-19 case data into a slick animation of Singapore's explosive worker dormitory clusters. The piece documents and explains how and where clusters formed. He used WebGL to enable the reader's computer and browser to seamlessly render more than 30,000 nodes.         Assessing Australia’s “ecological disaster”      Manas’ role:      All data research work - Find, collect, clean, format data  Analysis - Used QGIS and Node.js to batch process fire hotspot data, overlay on each habitat, find the intersecting area, and ultimately calculate how much habitat was burned for every individual species.  Production - Finalised data set EXCLUSIVE to Reuters, which could be used by others on the team for the visualisations on the page.    As environmental agencies and other news organisations  estimated  the environmental damage from fires, a Reuters data analysis of more than 1,400 species revealed the true extent of destruction. We processed massive amounts of satellite-derived fire data and habitat information. By calculating the intersection of those datasets we were able to reveal the animals hardest hit by bushfires.         Sizing up Australia’s bushfires     Manas’ role:   Building the interactive graphic and web page and wiring in the data   An innovative explanation of the unprecedented scale of fires burning in Australia. We built a ticker linked to the scroll of the page which counts area as you progress, overlaying small countries and cities to show true scale. This very effective and innovative format has since been replicated in other online fire visualisations.         Speed science: The risks of swiftly spreading coronavirus research      Manas’ role:      Data - collecting and scraping all scientific papers related to the new coronavirus  Analysis - running language analysis to find all papers of interest, authors, locations  Exporting graphics - that could be used in the presentation  Web page build    A Reuters analysis found that at least 153 studies – including epidemiological papers, genetic analyses and clinical reports – examining every aspect of the newly discovered (at the time) COVID-19 - have been posted or published since the start of the outbreak. These involved 675 researchers from around the globe. This was a huge increase compared to MERS and SARS research.   While speedy scientific analysis is highly useful if it's good, flawed or misleading science can sow panic and may make a disease epidemic worse by prompting false policy moves or encouraging risky behaviour.   One scientific post suggests links between the new coronavirus and HIV, a second says it may have passed to people via snakes, while a third claims it is a pathogen from outer space.

France,Agence France-Presse,Big,Shortlist,Covid-19 at Agence France-Presse: local and global datajournalism,"   Agence France-Presse (AFP) is a leading global news agency providing fast, comprehensive and verified coverage of the events shaping our world, drawing from a newsgathering network across 151 countries. AFP publishes stories, videos, photos and graphics in French, English, Arabic, Portuguese, Spanish, and German.      In 2014, AFP's graphics department was joined by a team of data journalists and developers. Their mission was to create new interactive projects, databases and semi-automated content.       The team carried out several large projects, including a visual and interactive project about<a href=""https://interactive.afp.com/graphics/Stray-bullets_254""> victims of violence in Rio’s favelas,  and a data journalism project about<a href=""https://interactive.afp.com/features/Une-femme-tous-les-trois-jours_597/""> femicides in France . It has also created tools for the newsroom. The nine-member team (four data journalists, two web designers, one database designer and two developers) is now joined every year by three students as part of a fellowship program involving young developers and data journalists.       2020 marked a big step forward for the data team as its work has become the centerpiece of our Covid-19 operations. The team set up three databases, including a general Covid-19 database and a more specific Covid Trends database to cover the path of the pandemic, which we are submitting for your consideration.       As other news organizations, the agency launched its most ambitious global data journalism project to cover the Covid-19 crisis. This has created a new data culture within the newsroom.      By submitting this collective effort to the Sigma Awards we hope to encourage our newsroom to further this effort. We do believe data journalism is crucial for the people’s right to know and thrives when it involves the kind of interactions we saw, involving “on the ground journalists” collecting the data and a specialized team able to support them and bring to light new stories.   ","We are submitting for your consideration our database of Covid cases and deaths, a second database created to follow Covid-19 Trends and the automated content they have generated, including our Data-driven videos; We are also presenting our lockdowns database, a portfolio of explicative datavizualisations and our public interactive graphics. The Covid-19 database was created on February 24 as our answer to a pressing question: what sources should we use ? We realized several bureaus were using different sources and databases. We also knwe we would not properly fulfil our mission as a major international news agency if we had to rely on other organizations databases: how would we vet the quality of the data ? How could we avoid missing major thresholds, updates, alerts ? Four data journalists, two web designers and one database specialist were appointed ""guardians"" of the base. They vetted the data and cleaned the base, calling bureaus and correcting mistakes when discrepancies were found. The main problem we face is how labour-intensive the database is to be able to m Our main base only relies on direct official sources, with one exception: for the United States, we use Johns Hopkins University tallies and cross-check them with the data provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Afghanistan, we use WHO data as there is no official data on a daily basis. We have created a second database to cover weekly trends and other long term data. Semi-automated text is generated at least once a day. Automated graphics are also created with a script editor which uses cases and deaths data and creates a ranking of worst-affected countries. Thanks to our Covid-19 databases AFP has been a reliable source for hundreds of media clients. Our tallies, threshold alerts and regional angles have made headlines across the world. We have produced over 16,000 Covid-related graphics delivered via satellite, FTP and our AFP.com platform. The number of downloads, which only reflects part of the metrics, shows high levels of use. 10, 496 graphics were downloaded in Spanish; 8,172 in English; 1,624 in French, 1,077 in German, 1,531 in Arabic and 202 in Portuguese from January 2020 to January 2021. Our AFP Interactive team also designed Data-driven videos (DDV), connected to the Covid database, which could generate 10 to 15 seconds videos featuring the number of cases and deaths for any given country, region or for the world. DDVs can be created by video or social media editors in just three clicks, without motion design or data skills. We built the tool using some of the technology developed with a Google DNI grant. In previous versions of the DDV, we created short videos for tweets and location. Covid-19 data was made available to the public via our AFP Interactive page in five languages (French, Spanish, English, German, Italian). The embeddable version of this interactive graphic has been viewed 96 million times since March 2020. In March and April, our documentation department also maintained a database to count the number of people under lockdown. To measure how the world had come to a halt we used four variables: mandatory lockdowns, curfews, quarantines, and ""people invited to stay at home"". To calculate the percentage of people invited or forced to stay at home, we used UN population projections for 2020. Our lockdown tallies made headlines in many countries. Our media clients could rely on us for timely data updates and therefore spend more time focusing on more specialized issues. We believe no other international news organization provided such a massive amount of Covid data texts, graphics and data-driven videos in six",https://spark.adobe.com/page/dX54j7sAgrnFf/,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JzbN4ZeYwLJmbYGqhIqApkp5UvnFnlJZo9ZT7F4Xtm0/edit?usp=sharing,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JzbN4ZeYwLJmbYGqhIqApkp5UvnFnlJZo9ZT7F4Xtm0/edit?usp=sharing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
United States,FiveThirtyEight,Big,Shortlist,Elena Mejía portfolio," After years working at different newsrooms as a writer, fact-checker and researcher, I always felt something was missing. I loved reporting, finding new sources and connecting the dots for readers, but I craved the challenge of discovering more information that could be buried in numbers.            I studied at The University of Texas at Austin where I amassed clips as I wrote for multiple publications on everything related to Texas politics and public policy. I went to the Texas Capitol almost every day and covered legislative debates that would go on well into the night.  I then took a job as a researcher for Type Investigations, a nonprofit that produces long-form investigative projects. It only took a few Excel tasks with some formulas and pivot tables when I worked on a<a href=""https://theintercept.com/2018/04/18/in-30-years-only-17-women-won-sexual-harassment-claims-before-wall-streets-oversight-body/""> story  about sexual harassment in Wall Street for me to understand the importance of empirical evidence in journalism –– and the unmeasurable opportunity that came with it.            I started reading stories with large methodologies, bespoke graphics and many, many datasets. I learned about The Guardian’s data team after reading their investigation on<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2017/dec/20/bussed-out-america-moves-homeless-people-country-study""> How American Moves Its Homeless . I admired the craft of map-making after following Reuters’<a href=""http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/MYANMAR-ROHINGYA/010051VB46G/index.html""> coverage  of the Rohingya crisis, and I followed FiveThirtyEight’s series<a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/""> The Gerrymandering Project,  a viz-driven analysis that somehow managed to simplify an incredibly complex topic.            After receiving my acceptance letter at Columbia University for the MS in Data Journalism, my original goal was to learn how to analyze data and incorporate that with my journalism experience. Since I never gave myself an opportunity to experiment with visualization or design, I never thought I’d succeed as a visual journalist. I figured I would take the program’s only data visualization class to learn more about it, but otherwise focus mainly on analysis, as I had carefully planned.            It took just one visuals class to completely change the career path I thought I would strictly follow. I spent hours selecting the right colors, the best chart forms and crafting visual cues to better explain what I was trying to say in my writing. I studied data teams from different newsrooms and compared their styles, and tried incorporating some techniques for better design in my own work. The conversations I enjoyed the most with one of my data professors, Jonathan Soma, wasn’t that much about the data behind the story, but how best I could make sure readers would leave with at least one takeaway after looking only at the graphics. I was skeptical about applying to data visualization jobs, but my teachers pushed me because they were convinced my projects were good enough.            They were right. I got hired at FiveThirtyEight as an associate visual journalist. After only one visuals class and virtually no design experience, I became a part of one of the best teams of graphics and interactives. In only six months, I sketched, designed and coded our series on the presidential and vice-presidential debates, another project on how the electoral college has changed, and even contributed to FiveThirtyEight’s 2020 Election Forecast in collaboration with other web developers on my team. I created static graphics for our politics, sports, and science platforms, and even experimented with abstract design to show COVID-19 spread in Thanksgiving.            I intend to continue learning about the art of visualizing data, striving to find new ways to help readers understand important issues, elevating storytelling with thoughtful design, and giving an audience more tools to help make informed decisions. I enjoy the challenge of finding new visual ways to communicate findings in data, and I no longer feel like something is missing. ","     <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-results-timing/"">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-results-timing/   We created a guide to election night to show how initial returns could be misleading. I designed and coded an interactive that would allow readers to navigate through different states and learn more about when polls would close, the potential shift in results, and their timing.       <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-final-debate-poll/"">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-final-debate-poll/   We polled voters before and after debates to look at the potential impact these had upon viewers’ opinions of the candidates. I helped craft the questions for voters, created different chart forms and worked in front-end development. I had to design graphics always thinking about the “before” and “after”, a challenge I addressed by designing histograms with clear outlines, slope charts and a waffle chart form that used legends and change in color for an “after” effect.       <a href=""https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/"">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-swing-states/   I created graphics using a blue-red gradient to enhance the battleground swings year by year and highlight the bigger and smaller changes in margin. The biggest challenge was figuring out how to apply the gradient to the lines in d3.js, and how to implement the arrows for the annotations for better design.       <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-suburbs-have-shifted-blue/   The biggest challenge for this story was coming up with a visual strategy that could best drive readers through a complex analysis with different variables. I opted for a waffle chart map to show diversity in the suburbs while avoiding substantial grey areas in a choropleth map. I also designed callouts in a beeswarm to merge variables without overwhelming the reader and worked with labeling to avoid confusion.        <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roberts-is-the-new-swing-justice-that-doesnt-mean-hes-becoming-more-liberal/   The multiple line chart needed multiple annotations and labels, so I experimented with different colors, opacities and dotted lines to create smart design without overwhelming readers with a packed graphic.           <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-even-a-small-thanksgiving-is-dangerous/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-even-a-small-thanksgiving-is-dangerous/   This is one of the most challenging graphics I’ve done. We wanted to create a transmission scenario that could be applied to virtually any city or state, regardless of specific COVID-19 transmission rates. I overcame this challenge by using Illustrator as my main tool, experimenting with different shapes and color palettes until I landed the final product.       <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-post-office-became-a-political-football/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-post-office-became-a-political-football/   For this story, I opted for bar charts to show both the positive and negative values and easily mark the months affected by COVID-19. I decided to flip both bar charts to help readers better understand the big difference between percent change in both services to the year prior, using color-coding for positive and negative values.        <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-redistricting-is-up-for-grabs-in-2020-here-are-the-races-to-watch/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/control-of-redistricting-is-up-for-grabs-in-2020-here-are-the-races-to-watch/   I created maps where states were sized by the number of congressional districts states would have after the 2020 census. The different-sized states presented challenges when it came to positioning in a way that would not hugely compromise their geographic location.       <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/voter-registrations-are-way-way-down-during-the-pandemic/   I used data to show how voter registration dropped dramatically in some states during the pandemic. I experimented with percent change from the 2016 election and other strategies to maintain the same y-axis across all states, but California and Texas undermined the changes in other states. I overcame this challenge by adjusting each chart to its own axis, effectively showing how voter registration dropped dramatically since 2016, no matter how big or small the state in question is.

Singapore,The Straits Times,Big,Shortlist,Rebecca Pazos," I am the leading journalist for The Straits Times digital graphics team and the newsroom advocate for data storytelling. I have worked with the team for more than five years and dedicate my time to developing new and creative ways to tell news stories.   My goal is to go beyond just using data in my stories, something I have been passionate about for the last eight years. I want to bring back humanity and emotion into my data storytelling.   Covid-19 has forced us to reflect deeply on our data reporting methods. As our audience demanded more real-time data and analysis, it was ever present in my mind the need to humanise the data because every number represents real people who are suffering. Delicately balancing objective data reporting with memorable and emotional visual content is an ongoing dream for me. My mentor and editor, Xaquin Gonzalez Veira has said:   ""This year’s COVID-19 epidemic was a difficult test for data journalists. Early in the pandemic, Rebecca showed impressive reflexes as she quickly established the paper’s data guidelines and sources. She also led the Data and Visual coverage with stories like ""Slowing the spread in Asia ’ or ‘ How the world lost 1 million lives to Covid-19 ’. Besides. pitching, reporting, writing, and conceiving the visuals, she also coordinated the designers and developers —while working remotely, a testament to her abilities.""    I have also crafted the workflow from the pitching process through to post-publication reports for our team which help us analyse what went well and what could have been done better for each project. This has led to an improved feedback loop so we can all learn from past mistakes - and wins too.   Over the past year, I have also taken much joy in mentoring interns. They all remain in contact and have communicated to me their shift towards more data-driven journalism as a direct result of working with our team and under my guidance.   I have conducted data workshops for the newsroom and universities and I am currently undertaking my own Masters in visual tools with the University of Girona to finally take my first steps into coding and sharpen my creative side.   I have not entered my own portfolio before but 2020 was a year filled with big news and was an important one for data storytelling ""with empathy"", something I think I'm acutely aware of.     "," My main skills rely on data reporting and data storytelling. I also used organisational skills to co-ordinate the immense efforts of producing daily-updated graphics for Covid-19, GE2020 and even the US elections.   I practice integrated visual journalism so it is crucial to work with all the visuals and text elements at the same time when constructing the pieces so that the story can seamlessly flow from beginning to end. I focus most of my energy on the top 25 per cent of all my stories, the ""above-the-fold"" for digital pieces, as this is where the majority of readers focus runs out. The rest of the story is usually littered with rewards or 'easter eggs' for the readers who have stuck with it and are more likely to read through to the end.   My portfolio is data-driven with a focus on getting across the 'right' message that is sensitive and empathetic.   These projects are a sign of progressive improvement. Every project I do, I look back on and would change a million things. I hope it can be seen that my work is still in development and, perhaps positively, I'd like to think, always will be. I evolve with each project I do, hoping to further use data to contextualise human stories.    For the last project of 2020 that takes a look back at one year of Covid-19, my hope was to leave a strong message against the many naysayers of movement restriction measures but to also highlight the incredible intricacy of these measures for people who come from a lower socio-economic background. Living in Singapore, we are highly poised to raise the voices of our neighbouring countries who might be doing poorly with stay-at-home or social distancing measures.    Also, for politically difficult topics, we are able to use data in a way that addresses issues, for example the historical boundaries story dealt with gerrymandering in Singapore, in an objective yet beautiful way.

Jordan,"Daraj, Amman Net, Al Ghad, Roya, Maqalat, ARIJ*/]squarespace.com",Small,Shortlist,"Data for Change, Jordan"," Internews’ Data Journalism Certification Program in Jordan was the first in-depth data journalism training program offered in the Middle East and North Africa and produced the country’s first batch of of data literate local public interest journalism published throughout Jordanian media. The training manual produced for the course is now hosted as an open source resource by the Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ) and is being used to train aspiring data journalists across the region.     Throughout the program, journalists learned to harness data to cover critical issues related to socioeconomic reforms, local governance, and human rights by applying an inquiry-based approach to cover education inequality, violence against women, mismanagement of water and renewable energy resources, unsustainable aid to Syrian refugees and more. Participants used the growing amount of available socioeconomic data (open data since the government would not respond to FOIA requests) about Jordan to create news and feature content that more effectively engages audiences on topics important to Jordanians.    Jordan’s media is highly partisan, public trust of media is low and freedom of the press is declining, which is why these stories came at a crucial time. This program sought out young professionals that were passionate about challenges facing their communities and bringing evidence-based explanatory reporting to tackle society’s most pressing issues. Like in much of the region and the world, the pandemic offered the government an opportunity to further restrict press freedom under the guise of its emergency response. Journalists seized the opportunity to instead of tackling corruption straight on, highlight the weak public service systems that existed long before the current crisis and engaged the public in a conversation about solutions.     Media houses were reluctant to publish accountability reporting yet these stories ran across mainstream media and in online media houses targeting younger audiences as well. Journalists showed examples from regional stars including InfoTimes, Inkyfada and Al Jazeera to demonstrate to editors the value of incorporating data-driven content into their digital convergence strategy. Mentors from InfoTimes and 7iber also helped journalists craft powerful storytelling packages.     Even though the program has ended, ARIJ, AmmanNet and Daraj have continued to commission and publish data stories by alumni.   "," Stories published in mainstream media focused on the issue of inequality. The major challenge for all of the stories was the dearth of data. Jordan has extremely weak FOIA laws. Though we requested over a dozen of disaggregated data sets over the course of the year, the most we received were summary tables, if we received a response at all. Editors were also reluctant to publish stories criticizing the government, though they were more willing to do so once they learned that the stories were backed by the limited data that the government had made public. Many media outlets required direct guidance by our team in how to publish embedded visualizations and none were either able or willing to share metrics on story performance. Many stories also ran as a podcast in Arabic.        Gender Inequality       Despite having achieved gender equality at most levels of education, Jordan's women are still laregely absent from the job market and these stories look at the systemic reasons behind Jordan's persistent gender inequality. <a href=""https://ammannet.net/english/jordanian-women-want-tech-more-tech-industry-wants-them"">Jordanian Women Want Tech More than Tech Want them  published by AmmanNet and as a <a href=""https://www.maqalat.me/articles/%D8%AA%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B6%D8%B9%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B1%D8%BA%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%86"">podcast  debunks a belief that women do not work in tech because they do not pursue STEM education, when women in fact match men in STEM degrees. <a href=""https://alghad.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%AE%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%81/"">Education Associated with Less Domestic Violence but Fails to Break Culture of Silence,  published in Al Ghad newspaper, explores how the education level of men and women correlates with incidence and reporting of gender based violence.

United Kingdom,The Times and The Sunday Times,Big,Shortlist,Tom Calver," To whom it may concern   I'd like to submit the attached data journalism portfolio for your consideration. I am proud to have worked on dozens of agenda-setting exclusives in 2020.   I am the Senior Data journalist at The Times and The Sunday Times which I joined in January 2019, having arrived via BBC News and Which?. My job involves everything from building charts and interactives to working on front-page investigations.   My toolkit for the past year has included:     The R programming language and its amazing online community;   A passion for explaining challenging concepts and bringing them to life;   My eye for a story that will get people talking;   Extremely talented colleagues with whom I can bounce ideas off.    Thank you for considering my application,   Tom ","I hope my portfolio shows my full range of data journalism skills with a wide variety of different pieces. I've included some explainers, like my piece on why measuring the Covid death toll was so hard. At the time, in early April amid the novelty and confusion of the lockdown, many of the concepts that are now sadly part of the national vocabulary like excess deaths, were not widely understood. My challenge was to explain these ideas to readers in a visual way, and to show why data cannot often be taken at face value. The piece had the highest engagement of any published that week, suggesting I was successful. I've also included an interactive tool which I led on, came up with the idea, sourced most of the data and oversaw its production. Our ""when will you get the Covid vaccine?"" was one of our most-searched interactives ever, and told our readers when they might expect to get the vaccine based on their age, location, and any underlying health conditions they had. However, the part of my job that gives me the most satisfaction is being able to invoke real change through agenda-setting investigations. I worked on dozens of Covid stories, scrutinising NHS Test and Trace, exposing a tech flaw in the ""world beating"" app that meant it was set at the wrong sensitivity for a whole month, and producing a calculator telling readers where they are in the vaccine queue. I also produced a piece of analysis in June that sh However, I'm particularly proud of my front-page investigation into the national lottery. I revealed how children as young as 16 were able to gamble up to £350 a week on online ""instant-win"" games. With titles like ""Treasure Temple"" and ""Fruity £500s"", they appeared geared towards teenagers. Although 16 year-olds have been allowed to buy lottery tickets since its inception in 1994, the lottery has changed beyond recognition. Through analysing company accounts, I showed how lottery operator Camelot's profit grew drastically from soaring sales of scratchcards and instant-win games. These are more profitable to the operator, and also give less money to charity. I am delighted that since the story was published, the government has confirmed that it will raise the minimum playing age from 16 to 18 as part of its review of the Gambling Act. In another story I'm particularly proud of, I reported how developers were exploiting planning laws to convert empty banks, takeaways and barbers into tiny flats, prompting fears that high streets would turn into ""slum housing"". Permitted development rights, which had until recently been associated with converting offices into flats, had extended to shops and takeaways. New planning reforms would have made this process even easier. Analysing energy performance certificate data which lists the floor size of every new-build home, I noticed that some of the smallest were registered on high streets. One of the tiniest, converted from an electrical store in Southampton, was barely bigger than a jail cell but had more expensive rent per square foot than an average Islington house. Its inhabitant said it felt like she was living in a ""pod"". Using data from planning portals, I found dozens of approved applications to convert shops into flats, many since Britain went into lockdown. Experts suggested Covid had accelerated the residential takeover of the high street. Using floor plans, with the help of the graphics department, I brought the story to life visually One month later, the housing secretary conceded that all permitted development homes must meet the national minimum space standard of 37㎡.

Russia,"Tinkoff Journal, Ria Novosti, The Village, IStories",Big,Citation,Alexey Smagin portfolio," When I was a kid I was a big fan of mobile games. I dreamed to become a programmer and make the best game humanity ever played.    When I was 14 I became the chief editor of the online magazine about mobile games. It called MobiTree and you can read it here: https://issuu.com/mobitree/docs/issue_7.    Since that journalism was everywhere in my life. I was studying Computer Science in university but also was a reporter and then chief editor of the university's newspaper.   When the time came to choose my profession I have known about Data Journalism — the field where I can use both my reporting and programming skills. I made my first data-story when I was as student — in December, 2017. I changed 4 big newsrooms (former RBC, Novaya Gazeta, RIA Novosti Infographics Team and now Tinkoff Journal) and worked as freelancer with The Bell, The Village, IStories and more.    Data jounalism in Russia is on the beginning of it's way. Most of reporters can't even sort data in Excel and media editors doesn't understant why they need a data jountalist in their newsroom. I graduated in 2019 and I'am 24 years old now, but I'm a guest lecturer in Higher School of Economics and help young journalists to make their way in Data journalism and Data visualisation.   It's hard to do Data Journalism in Russia because there is no experienced colleagues and nobody can help you to do your first steps. And there is often no team to grow you with: now I am the only Data journalist in Tinkoff Journal.   But I love this way. I think Data jounalism is cool because it can help you to investigate the things other journalists can't do. I also the big fan of Data visualistion — it can be beautiful and it can evoke many emotions in readers. There is many creation in my work and I can spend hours to invent different forms to present the data. "," At the beginning of 2020 I was a Data Analyst in Ria Novosti Infographics Team. We made a beautiful visual explainer to 'Oscar Bait' phenomenom. We discovered that most of Oscar 'Best Picture' winners since 1990 have the greatest Oscar Bait score. It probably means that Oscar-wiining films doesn't have to be really great. It's simply enough that they satisfy jury tastes.  My part of work: Idea, Text, Data Analysis, Inforgraphic Prototypes  https://ria.ru/20200207/1564342281.html?language=en    Then I moved to Tinkoff Jounal to became first data jounalist in team. There we made an investigation about teachers' and doctors' salaries in russian budget. We discovered that salaries in vacancies are two times lower that in official statistics.   https://journal.tinkoff.ru/pedstat/  https://journal.tinkoff.ru/medstat/    I made a lot of works as author, data analyst and infographics designer. I also made my first steps in D3.js interactive visualisation. For example. I made this maps in our stories about heating and watering in Russia (mobile version graphics are not maps so look at them from desktop):  https://journal.tinkoff.ru/teplo-stat/  https://journal.tinkoff.ru/vodopoy/    I also did some work as freelanser that i love. With IStories data editor Alesya Marohovskaya we did a scrollytilling explainer about falsifications on russian elections. It helped our readers to understand complicated statistics.  https://istories.media/workshops/2020/08/14/skrollitelling-vo-flourish/  That was the first time Flourish used with the scrollytelling in Russia so I did a lesson how to do the same:  https://istories.media/workshops/2020/08/14/skrollitelling-vo-flourish/    The second work I did as freelanser was the collaboration with The Village. I searched the prices of medical masks that profiteers have published in Telegram chats (thousands of messages) and made the visualisation. My little data investigation became a part of the story:  https://www.the-village.ru/city/ustory/379695-spekulanty-1-maski   And the teaching was the big part of my work in 2020. I had two courses in Higher School of Economisc: Data Jounalism and Data Visualisation. I have all the materials — presentations, data and tasks stored at GitHub. Courses' programs and tasks was developed by my own.    https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_datajourn_2020  https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_dataviz_2020 ",https://ria.ru/20200207/1564342281.html?language=en,https://static.istories.media/iframes/f8f44a6c61c24fddb39cd35aa914e9d4/landing/,https://www.the-village.ru/city/ustory/379695-spekulanty-1-maski,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/teplo-stat/,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/series/,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/vodopoy/,https://journal.tinkoff.ru/pedstat/,https://istories.media/workshops/2020/08/14/skrollitelling-vo-flourish/,https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_datajourn_2020,https://github.com/pineappleblack/hse_dataviz_2020,,,,,,,,
Spain,elDiario.es,Big,Shortlist,elDiario.es: Covid-19 coverage," elDiario.es is a digital news site which has become a major reference in current affairs for a new generation of Spanish readers, and also a pioneer in high quality content and innovative business model worldwide.  Launched in the middle of the financial crisis in 2012 with no big investors or corporates backing it - just a bunch of journalists and their savings - elDiario.es has developed a community-based journalism model reaching mainstream audiences with scarce resources. Among the dozens of new digital projects born in the past decade in Spain, elDiario.es stands out.  More than 12M unique users per month (ComScore Mmx) now read eldiario.es and that figure grows every month. And elDiario.es is the most widely read native digital media outlet in Spain, according to the Spanish Sociological Research Center.  The key business innovation is the 'membership program' - more than 60.000 people (""socios"") already give financial support to elDiario.es in order to strengthen our editorial and economic independence. But it is not a paywall: the ""socios"" of elDiario.es do not pay to read the news, they pay for the information to be freely spread and thus gain social impact. They pay to belong to a community of citizens sharing values like equality, democratization, social justice and more importantly, the need for independent journalism.   Our business model has remained the same since our foundation, but when coronavirus crisis hit, the media experienced financial difficulties. In order to handle this situation,  we decided to bearly change our business model and make an evolution of it always keeping our foundational principles: elDiario.es will continue to be free for those who cannot pay but it will be necessary to be a member to read elDiario.es regularly.    In a world where manipulation and propaganda advance, we do not want our journalism to be left behind a wall that excludes people based on their income. This evolution in our business model has brought to our community 18,000 new members and thousands of existing readers stepped in.  Thanks to them elDiario.es is also a profitable company. Nowadays, our community represents more than 50% of our annual income. And in order to be fully transparent with their contribution, we annually publish our financial accounts. This good practice has become an expected date for the audience who perceives us as a trustful and reliable newsroom.  Since its inception, elDiario.es opted for data journalism as a way to create quality content for subscribers and also to reach new audiences in Spain. Since 2015, our data team has always been a small data unit with at least two journalists who have based their work on constant collaboration with the entire newsroom. Now, the data journalism team is formed by 3 journalists.   This year, our Covid-19 coverage proves that this team has had a public service role. First, using data analysis, interactive narrative, and visualization of complex issues to make them understandable, and second, as an early warning of the evolution of the epidemic for our readers. In fact, the 5 most read pieces of news of the year in elDiario.es were created by the data team: our covid trackers. Precisely, our work philosophy has always been to visualize and explain things in the simplest way to the reader and collaborate with all the newsroom to search stories and do better journalism.    "," *Some of our included pieces appear as published in 2021 (our trackers) because we are still updating them but they were originally published in 2020   The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the greatest health, mortality and economic crisis in the last century. For the first time, millions of people in all countries have been watching  numbers and data day after day.  This is the coverage since February 2020 of the data team of elDiario.es (formed by Raúl Sánchez, Ana Ordaz and Victòria Oliveres) of the greatest mortality crisis of the century in Spain and the world. All the pieces that integrate this portfolio have been working from home since March 2020 from 3 different cities, even that challenge the result of the work has been rewarding and useful to the public.   This portfolio started with the data tracker since the first confirmed cases in China, the arrival of the virus in Europe through Italy and Spain continues and finally with the expansion to the rest of the countries of the world.   During these 6 months of pandemic, we have updated and explained day after day the visualizations of the evolution of cases and deaths in Spain and the world prioritazing the understanding and facilitating usability by users.  We have also done great visual reports and in-depth analysis. For example, on how the death toll from the coronavirus crisis is much higher than the death toll according to official records: we compare the mortality figures for 2020 with those of the last 45 years, revealing the excess mortality of more than 68,000 people over the historical average.  Furthermore, the analysis and explanations go beyond the health issue and we have focused on all the thematic axes and consequences of the pandemic: we analyze the destruction of employment, the inequality of contagion between rich and poor and the drama of collapse of nursing homes, which were abandoned in the worst of the pandemic.  This work prioritized the public service to our readers, so we have also made outreach visualizations to explain the effects of social distancing to avoid contagion, an interactive map so that everyone could know how far they could walk according to the rules during the confinement or information to alert of the situation of the epidemic at all times.  We also created a unique database of confirmed cases by municipality (information that we update every week) in Spain, consulting, one by one, the 17 autonomous communities (states) of the country. This map serves the population as an early warning indicator to know how the situation is in their city. Precisely, this database, not published by the Government of Spain, demonstrates the effort of this data team to make up for the absence of a data publication policy by the authorities, thus having to create homogeneous indicators, correct wrong data supplied, errors in the figures and dealing with the lack of coordination to publish the figures of the epidemic.  Our coverage of the coronavirus was not based on creating visually striking graphics but on counting the data explaining its meaning and the limitations it had in the simplest possible way. For example, we visualized how the coronavirus curve was flattening in Spain with interactive explanations, the reasons behind why there were so few deaths in summer even though the cases had skyrocketed or how the Government published the death figures with Covid-19 with long delay.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Shortlist,Ellis Simani," My path to working at ProPublica as a data reporter was kick-started in 2017 when I participated in ProPublica’s Data Institute, a 12-day intensive workshop on how to use data, design and code for journalism. At that point, I had interned at small news sites, and taken a handful of economics and computer sciences courses in college, but hadn’t yet combined the two interests professionally. The data institute gave me a solid foundation in how to report, design and build interactive graphics and data-driven news applications, but more importantly, it instilled the confidence that I could carve out a path for myself in the industry.   After completing the institute, I spent a summer working as an intern with the Seattle Times’ news apps team, building interactive graphics and news applications. Having been born and raised in Seattle, it had always been a goal of mine to work for my hometown paper, and the opportunity solidified my appreciation for hard-hitting local news. I worked on everything from building internal tools for reporters and editors, to working alongside reporters to visualize data for investigative projects. The highlight of my summer was contributing to a front-page story on the widespread use of toxic pesticides in many Seattle parks.   After my internship ended, I moved to Los Angeles, where I joined the L.A. Times as a fellow with the data visualization desk as part of the Minority Editorial Training Program (Metpro). During my year and a half at the paper, I worked on a variety of ambitious and informative projects that pushed my skills as a journalist and visual storyteller, while sharpening my ability to work quickly and creatively in a fast-paced breaking news environment. I covered everything from visualizing sea level rise on the California coast, to scrutinizing the racial and ethnic categories available on the Census. But what I enjoyed most was delving deep into data and taking the time and effort to find investigative stories that impacted our readers and held California leaders accountable. This interest is what encouraged me to return to ProPublica as a fellow in 2019.   My work from last year is a product of the skills that I’ve developed since attending the data institute in 2017, when I was just beginning to take the plunge into this corner of the industry. When I reflect on the work I did in 2020, I’m able to see how my professional experiences prepared me to jump from interrogating messy datasets, to building interactive graphics and news apps, to tackling competitive, fast-moving stories on tight deadlines when the time called for it. But what I’m most proud of is how all of the stories I worked on are rooted in using data as a tool to empower the public with access to knowledge and to hold those in power accountable. "," In January of last year, my colleagues and I published “Credibly Accused,” the first public database of clergy who have been listed as credibly accused of sexual abuse in reports released by Catholic dioceses and religious orders in the United States. We built the tool by collecting data from nearly 180 sources – some were simple lists of names in text documents and others were entire webpages. I led the data reporting efforts on the project; spearheading the compilation, cleaning and standardization of the data, and also assisted in the development of the tool itself. On top of that, I co-reported an investigation into the lists, highlighting the lack of transparency and several inaccuracies in the documents published by church leaders. More than half a million people used our tool in the first week after publication and it would go on to become one of the 25 most-read ProPublica stories in 2020.   Two months later, the coronavirus pandemic quickly began spreading across the United States and unemployment skyrocketed, leaving millions of Americans uncertain how they would make rent payments, or pay credit card bills and their other debts. My colleague, Jeff Ernsthausen, and I understood that evictions would soon become a central issue facing the millions of renters in the country, and we decided to build our own database of court records to report on the topic. This work served as the foundation for several of the stories I worked on.   The first effort focused on landlords violating the CARES Act’s eviction ban by moving to evict renters at federally backed properties. Our reporting found more than a hundred illegal eviction filings at dozens of properties in the first few weeks after the law was passed by Congress. As a result of our reporting, landlords dismissed more than a hundred illegally filed cases, keeping those families in their homes as the pandemic raged.   For our second project, we combined several datasets to build an interactive database to help renters find out if they were protected from eviction. Later, as the CARES Act was set to expire, we published another story exploring the overall efficacy of the legislation in keeping renters in their homes, finding that the law was largely effective, and had caused evictions at covered properties to plummet in the middle of the summer.   But as vital legal and financial protections began to expire, court records showed that some landlords and debt collectors returned to court to squeeze money from those who didn’t pay. I wanted to dive deeper into how this dynamic was unfolding at the local level, and the next two investigations I worked on uncovered how two uniquely punitive practices impacted renters in Arkansas and debtors in Indiana during the pandemic.   Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. that allows landlords to file criminal charges against tenants for falling behind on rent. Our investigation into the practice found that dozens of tenants have been sentenced to jail in recent years under the law, and hundreds of the criminal cases were filed by landlords during the pandemic. A deputy prosecutor quoted in the story told us: ""I hate that law. It's unconstitutional."" In the weeks after our story ran, he was fired.   The final story I worked on uncovered that an Indiana school district had filed nearly 300 lawsuits against parents during the pandemic, many for unpaid textbook fees. After being reached for comment, the district announced that it would forgive the fees of one family mentioned prominently in the story and seek to vacate the small claims judgment filed against her.

Australia,Australian Broadcasting Corporation,Big,Shortlist,The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Digital Story Innovations team," The ABC’s Digital Story Innovations team is a collection of journalists, developers, a designer and social media and video specialists. The team is focussed on data-driven, visual storytelling for Australian audiences.   Since its inception, we’ve used data to investigate and visualise stories on a broad range of issues from internment camps in remote China, devastating bushfires, how the Catholic school system takes from the poor to give to the rich and the wide reaching impact of climate change.    The DSI team’s 2020 portfolio showcases how data-driven techniques can be used across the full spectrum of story creation -- from discovery to research, analysis and presentation -- to either break new terrain or deepen public understanding of familiar topics.   The portfolio demonstrates how innovative storytelling techniques - such as data-driven investigation, graphics and interactive design - can be seamlessly blended with traditional person-centred storytelling to powerful effect.    It includes ground-breaking investigations based on leaked data (Catholic schools), exclusive access to tightly-held datasets (sexual assault, water theft), in-depth analyses of spatial datasets (the Arctic, water theft) as well as innovative use of publicly available datasets (coronavirus stories).   Each project demonstrates a commitment to rigorous, meaningful and transparent use of data while being unique in concept and execution. "," By combining innovative data mining, blending and analysis with compelling visual storytelling, our team is able to deliver investigative and explanatory journalism in a way that breaks down the complex nature of many of the topics.   Using water flow modelling data we revealed to our readers the disappearance of trillions of litres of water from Australia’s most vital network of rivers. We also analysed and visualised decades worth of water level data captured from both satellites and river gauges to show the devastating impact of drought on communities across Australia.   We were able to transport our audience to the remote environment of the Arctic Circle using spatial and climate data, to walk them through the effects climate change is having on the polar sea ice. A key goal was to ensure readers came away with a clear sense of why the stories were important and how they have been affected.   With “Rough justice”, the challenge was two-fold: first, obtaining multiple datasets from different police jurisdictions; and secondly, reconciling these disparate datasets to produce a coherent, accurate and meaningful national picture.   Our reporter negotiated for more than a year to obtain this exclusive data for every jurisdiction. In some instances, it involved informal collaboration with police commanders and police statisticians. In others, we were only able to obtain the requested data after applying pressure through backchannels. We then worked with two independent teams of experts to create a  framework for “mapping” dozens of police investigation outcomes across these crime classification systems.   “How the Catholic school system takes from the poor to give to the rich” combined leaked data from Catholic system insiders with finance figures scraped from the My School website. The My School dataset provides a more detailed picture of school income and expenditure than any publicly available data but is among the most tightly-held datasets in Australian education history.   Combining these datasets allowed us to calculate how the Catholic system’s secret funding formula impacted every school in the system. First, we extracted the secret funding formula by manually measuring the axes and data points in a series of scatterplots presented in the leaked documents. (The data used to create these scatterplots was not contained in the documents.) Next, we used the My School data to recreate the scatterplots as an interactive chart with “live data”. Lastly, we built a database to allow users to search for a school and individual results.   Our team has also led the ABC’s collection and analysis of domestic coronavirus statistics, maintaining a database that tracks key information about Australia’s fight against Covid-19.   Maintaining this database is not a straightforward exercise. The data is separately compiled and held by each of Australia’s eight state and territory health departments, plus the federal health department. Each uses its own definitions, protocols and processes. Combining this data into a national dataset that allows meaningful comparisons across the jurisdictions is a daily battle that requires forensic interrogation of multiple disparate datasets and  intimate understanding of the  methodology behind each one. To ensure the highest standards of data integrity we work closely with each of the nine health departments plus a network of researchers, physicians and public health experts.    With the data collection aspect being so labour intensive, we needed to streamline other parts of the reporting process. This led us to the idea of a semi-automated story, with “custom words” pulled from a central database maintained in Google sheets.    The story is constantly evolving, with visualisations and analysis added, expanded or removed as needed. It remains a vital resource for the public for up-to-date, accurate data about the pandemic.

China,NetEase Datablog,Small,Shortlist,Netease DataBlog," Netease DataBlog is one of the pioneers in data journalism of China. It has been deeply engaged in the data journalism field for nine years which is considered as a media of great influence both in industry and academia. We commit to events sorting in logic and information mining in depth, presenting stories to audience in forms of infographics, H5, interactive charts and data maps by extensive auxiliary information.   Since the establishment of DataBlog, we have been actively working on stories about issues in social, economic, cultural, health, environmental, etc, for which we have received positive responses, including our follow-up stories on COVID-19.   DataBlog covers stories in all fields, and we could always present accurate interpretation from an appropriate and attractive perspective regardless of topic selections.   And for this very reason, data journalism is a niche in China though, the work of DataBlog could always achieve ideal communication effects. And now we are the column with the most followers among all peers in China. The amount of our audience is over 13 million.   Presently, our team consists of two editors and a designer. And we share a strong as well as impressive style no matter in content or in visualization. As a newsroom in small scale, now we applied for the 2nd Sigma Data Journalism Award. And We hope to learn from other workers in competition. "," Serises stories on COVID-19 is packaged into a portfolio for the competition.   Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, DataBlog acted instantly, and we are one of the earliest data journalism columns in China to cover revelant stories. In the early stage of the outbreak, the crowd knows little about coronavirus. By combing the epidemic data published by the government, we collected 129 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with complete or partial patient information including gender, age, infection symptoms and medicial state of the patients to partially present the basic picture of the epidemic to our audience as much as possible.   In addition, we made other tries. 33 days after the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019, the epidemic spreaded across the country. We decided to use SVG data map to inform readers the spread trajectory of the epidemic during the 33 days.   Besides, in another work of ours "" Cases Across   Four Generations  : How 527 Cluster Epidemics Spread "", we conducted statistics on the temporal and spatial span of the spread of cluster epidemics in China, the proportion of cases in three or four generations, the propagation algebra and more to warn the public of the necessity of not clustering during the epidemic period.   Except for COVID-19, medical resource is also within our concerns. At the beginning of the outbreak, we investigated on statistics about the use of beds and the change of bed occupancy rate in designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients in Wuhan, on the one hand; On the other hand, we have worked with a pressure meter for medical care in various cities in Hubei, calling for people to pay attention to the state of medical pressure in other cities in Hubei.   It is worth mentioning that we are getting more diversified in such exploration of topic selection about COVID-19. We not only focus on the coronavirus itself, but also pay more attention to how the people should live that affected by the COVID-19.   On January 23, 2020, Wuhan started lockdown for COVID-19. We found the Weibo hashtag ""Diary of the lockdown"" where plain people would record their dailylife and feelings. We analyzed the content of these diaries and restored the life of everyone with it after the lockdown.   Additionally, in "" Delivery Guy Tells   Secrets Behind the Lockdown in Wuhan "", we cooperated with the takeaway platform to peek into the living conditions of Wuhan people under the lockdown through takeaway orders, and found that the routine of people had alterd though, their taste remained. At the same time, we also found that many orders were sent to hospitals, many of which were from other address entrusting concern for people in Wuhan.   This is the introduction to the COVID-19 serises stories covered by DataBlog. We hope it will be of help for you to understand our work.

Singapore,Reuters,Big,Winner,Reuters portfolio," Reuters tell their most important stories visually. Many pieces follow a narrative driven expressly by visual journalism, whether that is unique data gathering techniques, charting and data walk-throughs, satellite journalism, explainer illustrations or immersive presentations.     Regardless of subject matter, project size, or reporting methods, data journalism plays a major role in delivering stories.      Making data understandable   One of our missions is to make complex or difficult data sets easily digestible to tell stories.  Design is a key component of making difficult data accessible. For example, our project explaining the various strains of Covid-19, combines complicated subject matter and a granular database to clearly explain how the virus has evolved.     Public service   Getting timely information about the spread of the coronavirus and putting the mountain of statistics the pandemic generates in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. Our COVID-19 Global Tracker leverages Reuters’ global reporting power to create one of the timeliest and in-depth coronavirus dashboards available. Readers can see global and regional trends, dig deep into their own country, or read the hundreds of headlines generated by our algorithm, fed by constantly changing data.   Another example is the “Shielded” series of data investigations, which show how an obscure legal doctrine called qualified immunity protects police accused of excessive force.     Innovative reporting techniques   The Reuters Graphics team are continuously thinking of ways to push the boundaries of reporting and gathering information. A number of striking examples of this are evident in our coverage of the Australia and California wildfires.     Innovative storytelling   The team are constantly experimenting with striking ways to deliver our stories too. Take our project on herd immunity for example. A custom-built model simulates the impact of social distancing measures and calculates herd immunity thresholds.     Strong emphasis on project design   Reuters pays careful consideration to the tone and subject matter as expressed through the design of the story.  Reuters strives to forge a visual connection between audience and content before they have read a single word.  The design and feel of each piece often reflects the tone and subject matter. This can be seen in across a range of our work.     Breaking news coverage   When major news breaks, such as natural or unexpected disasters, colleagues from all aspects of the newsroom join forces to work with the graphics desk. Data, deep reporting and powerful presentation create insightful explainers that give the reader everything they need to know about an event in one place.   Our job is to tell stories, and to further understanding of the news. We believe data, design, and narrative need to connect with the reader to bridge this. Reuters strives for this balance in every piece of visual journalism we undertake.     ","Stopping the spread Reuters built an epidemic model to simulate how the coronavirus can spread within a population. We ran the model thousands of times to compare when ""herd immunity"" would kick in for various reproductive numbers and under a range of scenarios. The model enabled us to show readers what level of immunity would likely be required in order to stop the spread. Anatomy of Singapore's outbreak Reuters transformed printed Covid-19 case data into a slick animation of Singapore's explosive worker dormitory clusters. The piece documents and explains how and where clusters formed. We used WebGL to enable the reader's computer and browser to seamlessly render more than 30,000 nodes. How the novel Coronavirus has evolved The coronavirus has mutated into several major groups, or strains. Mapping and understanding those changes is crucial to developing strategies to combat COVID-19. Reuters unraveled and analyzed over 185,000 genome samples to show how the dominance of strains has shifted over time. Reuters Global COVID-19 Tracker Getting timely information about the spread of the coronavirus and putting the mountain of statistics in context for readers is at the core of public service journalism. This tracker gives readers a key tool to filter down the firehose using custom algorithms to anticipate the headlines and mark milestones, progress and resurgence in a global and local context in five languages. Reuters independently collects infection and death data from each country, meaning our data is updated every few hours and often ahead of all other publications and dashboards. Australia's ecological disaster Australia's government called the bushfires crisis of 2020 ""an ecological disaster."" Reuters delivered the first data-driven analysis of fires and habitat data, showing how hundreds of species suffered. Air attack As some of the largest fires in California's history blazed in late summer, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection deployed a fleet of specially equipped firefighting aircraft. Reuters used a combination of flight data records, cartography, illustration to take an in-depth look at the types of aircraft and explain their specific roles. Patient 31 In February 2019, South Korea announced thousands of coronavirus cases in the space of only a few days, an outbreak that initially pushed their tally of cases higher than anywhere else outside of China. Reuters scraped daily press releases to build a data-driven account of the spread and emergence of patient 31, a single super spreader believed to be the source of thousands of infections. The piece went viral far outside Asia, with many on social media in the U.S. sharing it as an example of what can happen if social distancing isn't observed. Shielded Another example of strong public service journalism. This data investigation shows how an obscure legal doctrine called qualified immunity protects police accused of excessive force. This project was produced as police use of force was dominating U.S. headlines. Shifting smoke Reuters visualised and animated millions of atmospheric data points to show how smoke from U.S. wildfires travelled thousands of miles east, turning skies from New York to Washington D.C. hazy and reaching as far as Britain. How Joe Biden Democrat Joe Biden captured the U.S. presidency by expanding his party's appeal among suburban voters, in middle- and upper-income communities and in places where a large share of people graduated from college. On the Republican side, Trump made surprising gains among Latino populations in South Florida and in Texas along the border.

Germany,Süddeutsche Zeitung,Big,Shortlist,Süddeutsche Zeitung," Dear Sigma Awards Team,   we are submitting a portfolio on behalf of the Data Team at Süddeutsche Zeitung. The portfolio consists of major projects we did on the Coronavirus pandemic. As for every journalist, this has been a challenging year for us, but also an exciting one. We feel that we could really make a difference, as we tried to help our readership making sense of what’s going on. The virus is invisible to the naked eye, so looking at the numbers is the best way to figure out where we are and what might come next.   Süddeutsche Zeitung is the leading daily quality newspaper in Germany. Founded 1945 and based in Munich, we offer reporting, analysis and opinion for a national audience. Editorial stuff is 400+ people, with bureaus in Berlin, Frankfurt, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Hamburg and Stuttgart, plus correspondents in major capitals around the world.   The Data Team was established in 2018 to focus on data-driven reporting across all topics, with strong ties to the investigations team. Members of our team worked on the Panama Papers, and we collected several prices for our work. In our understanding, data journalism is foremost journalism – our goal is to tell stories, to explain complex matters, to uncover injustice and corruption. Our means are data, code, web scraping, statistics, numerical language processing, network analysis.   We try to learn constantly. Exchanging ideas, sharing knowledge and teaching each other are important pillars of our philosophy. Towards our readers, we try to be as transparent as we can be – publishing detailed descriptions of our methodology, source code and raw data wherever possible.   One challenge in 2020 was that our team lead, Vanessa Wormer, left the company in summer, and we had to re-organise. Currently, the team consists of Sabrina Ebitsch and Christian Endt (team lead), Martina Schories, Benedict Witzenberger, Sören Müller-Hansen and Berit Kruse. We report to Wolfgang Jaschensky, head of Editorial R&D, who is an important mentor, established the team and hired most of us. We work closely together with graphic designers, developers and science reporters, who also contributed to the submitted stories. "," Our coverage of the Coronavirus started with ""The Force of the Big Number"", an interactive in which we explained the danger of exponential growth and made clear how quickly a pandemic can get out of control. The story was published in mid-March, before any major restrictions there put in place in Germany. The story reached more than 2 million readers and is one of the most successful pieces in the history of Süddeutsche Zeitung.   Soon afterwards, we launched our Coronavirus Dashboard, which has been a part of our homepage <a href=""http://www.sueddeutsche.de"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> www.sueddeutsche.de   ever since, and has also been adapted to a big, daily graphic in the print edition. As first newsroom in Germany, we used the concept of doubling time to report the growth of case numbers in different areas and countries. This concept was soon adapted by other major outlets, our numbers were quoted in the main evening news program on national tv.   At several stages of the pandemic, we wrote long, in-depth pieces on Germany's situation in the pandemic: Where are we right now, where are we heading, what are the scenarios and options? All of these stories were data-driven, based on modelling and extensive interviews with many scientists. These stories rely heavily on animated, interactive visual elements.   ""The Long Road Through the Pandemic"" was published at the beginning of the first wave in Germany. The lockdown light was still new and the impression prevailed that it was only necessary to reduce the number of new infections for a short time in order to end the pandemic. Our research and calculations based on epidemiological models showed that this was a fallacy, that the pandemic could last for a very long time. The article met with great interest among our readership; never before has the Süddeutsche Zeitung been able to attract such a large number of subscribers via a single piece.   In one visual essay, we reflect on the difficulty to make decisions based on imperfect data with lots of limitations, and try to show a way of dealing with that situation of uncertainty.   Other pieces in our portfolio focus on fatality rates, excess mortality, and airborne spreading in indoor environments, and how to have a safe christmas in 2020.   Why we don't provide translations:   Our articles build heavily on visuals and interactive storytelling. Therefore we can`t just put the text into a PDF. What works best is using Google Translate via the add-on in your browser.

United Kingdom,The Economist,Big,Shortlist,"James Tozer, The Economist"," 2020 marked my second full year as a data journalist at The Economist, having started that role in mid-2018. Before then, from 2015-18 I had worked in The Economist's analytics department, where my job was to support the social team and news desk with information about our digital audiences. During that three-year period, I taught myself statistics and coding (mainly in Python), to supplement writing skills that I had developed by studying English at university. So when I was hired as a data journalist in 2018, I already had many of the tools I needed to perform the job. The Economist then paid for me to attend a course in machine learning at the London School of Economics, where I learned how to use R and GitHub. I have been very lucky to work closely with Kenn Cukier and Dan Rosenheck, who have been my bosses at various points during my career, and are extremely knowledgeable about the world of data journalism.       Most of my writing has been for Graphic Detail, a dedicated print section that the newspaper launched in late 2018. Contributing to GD is a great experience: Dan Rosenheck often gives me several weeks to work on ambitious pieces of quantitative research. And I get to collaborate with our fantastic team of designers, including Matt McLean, Ros Pearce and Martín González, to name just a few. This means that I am able to turn my story ideas into striking charts and graphics, including online interactives. To date, I have published more than 30 GD pieces, which is the most of any contributor. I also regularly edit GD when Dan Rosenheck is away, making me one of the youngest staff writers at The Economist to perform this role for a section of the newspaper. (I am currently 27 - I think that would have made me eligible for the Young Talent prize in previous years, though I'm no longer sure if this is the case! If I am eligible, I would like to enter.)       Above all, the thing that I enjoy about data journalism is the diversity of subjects that I get to cover. Among the areas that I reported on in 2020 are politics, economics, business, health, the environment, demography, history, the arts and sports. (I haven't included any of my sports articles in my portfolio, though I write about them often. In my spare time, I work as data analyst for the England men's rugby team, helping them to win two trophies in 2020: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/51745646 .) This means that I constantly get to speak to people who are doing interesting research in their fields, and to learn new things. I think that is the primary reason why I should be considered for this award: I have tried to bring statistical rigour to as wide a range of stories as possible, to tell them in new and interesting ways. "," My main project in 2020 has been The Economist's tracker of excess deaths from covid-19. I decided to create an international comparison of excess mortality in early April, when it became clear that the official death tolls in many countries were undercounting the actual number of people being killed. First I published an article about this problem using numbers from Italy, Spain and France. Then I built an interactive tracking page to display this data, along with my colleague Martín González, who designed the charts. Finally, I published all of the data, sources and code on GitHub. I used this database for several other stories throughout the year, including one in October that found signs of considerable immunity in the hardest-hit villages of Lombardy.       We were the first organisation to produce a resource like this, and it has been cited in more than 120 academic papers, according to Google Scholar (see link: https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22economist.com%22+%22excess+deaths%22+%22covid%22). It has also encouraged several governments to release the necessary data on a regular basis. The Mexican health ministry cited our work in an official bulletin, and reproduced our heatmap design when it created its own report. Overall, the tracking page was the most viewed article on Economist.com in 2020, with more than 2m page views. (We have also submitted it for a Sigma project award.)       Another big project was using a dataset from Trase, a research group, to analyse illegal deforestation in the Amazon. My article explained how Trase matches satellite data on deforestation with export patterns for beef and soybeans. This allows us to estimate which agribusiness firms purchased most products from areas where illegal logging is rife. My colleague Sarah Esther Maslin wrote an accompanying article about the implications for the industry. Subsequently, several of the companies have promised full transparency on their supply chains.       At the start of 2020, for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, I collaborated with Israel's Yad Vashem institute to illustrate the last known address of 736,000 of the camp's Jewish victims. Because of the sensitivity of the subject and the data, I interviewed several archivists at Yad Vashem to make sure that I was interpreting and presenting it appropriately. The final map displayed the extent of the devastation that the Nazis wrought on Europe's Jewish population.       I was the first journalist to publish an analysis of the 8th wave of the World Values Survey, which has been running since 1981 and is the best source of international data on public opinions. I used a machine-learning model to estimate how attitudes towards democracy have changed among particular demographic groups over the last 20 years. I found that there had been a clear swing towards support for autocrats, especially in weak democracies. The trend was strongest among people on the far right of the political spectrum.       For The Economist's Christmas edition, I wrote a 2,200-word essay about how data science is changing the liberal arts. I interviewed several of the leading researchers in the ""digital humanities"". And I combed through dozens of papers to identify those that displayed the most interesting crossovers between algorithms and the arts. My piece included charts from these papers, and an interactive chart that allowed readers to analyse nearly 3,000 19th-century British novels.       I also reported on several academic papers and resources. Included in my portfolio are a write-up of a fascinating study about gang violence and economic harm in El Salvador; and an article about the extent of ""bogus"" academic journals in certain fields.

United States,"Quartz, Substack, Vox, Scientific American",Big,Shortlist,Youyou Zhou," I would like the jury to consider my work in the past turbulent year for a personal portfolio award. The data and visual stories that I will detail below consists of two broad themes: the impact of the pandemic on communities of immigrants and migrants around the world in the first half of the year, and in the second half, the failed effort by the U.S. governments to contain the virus.    2020 was a special year career-wise for me. I accumulated a sizable body of work using data and visual storytelling skills in the subject domain of immigration and migration, which I cared deeply about and had reported out over the years. The stories I produced during the year created real world impact that reinforced my belief in the power of data journalism and visual storytelling.    I am a designer, a developer, and at the core, a journalist. I started working in data visualization and storytelling at a design studio in Washington, D.C. back in 2012. A few years later I switched to journalism, covering oftentimes top breaking news and big set events with data visualizations and interactive features at the Associated Press. But my obsession over data journalism—including mining messy data to identify trends and insights, writing scripts to produce beautiful curious data visualizations—is always about journalism: data and visuals need to be in service of storytelling that’s ultimately in services of the audience. With that in mind, I joined Quartz in 2017, which gave me an abundance of editorial freedom and support to pitch, report, write and produce stories on important global narratives. Instead of being a generalist, I strived to create space and produce data and visual stories around immigration and global migration.   My obsession over the topic is rooted in my personal experience as an immigrant. As reporting went, I found that the diverse immigrant communities and issues around them were significant but underreported. Immigrants are the driving forces of the global economy. Migration is and will continue to be a central topic affecting the changing demographics of the world, the internationalization of companies, the global competition for talents, our increasingly fluid identities in a digital and globalized world. These are topics well suited for data and visual presentations. I tracked down data trends and created visual narratives around topics including visas, immigration policies, citizenship, international students, and skilled labor. Some of that is reflected in my work in 2020.   2020 was also special in that it was the year I lost institutional support and challenged myself to go solo. The layoff in the middle of the year opened new opportunities for collaboration and experiments. The projects in the second half of the year, hopefully, reflect some of it. ","   1. How international students are supposed to deal with coronavirus, according to their US universities    <a href=""https://qz.com/1822530/"">https://qz.com/1822530/     When the U.S. announced the pandemic a national emergency, universities scrambled to close their campuses and dorms. They didn’t have plans for the large number of international students who did not have places to stay off-campus. To show the scope of the problem and the haphazard instructions universities gave to international students, I collected responses related to international students sheltering from the universities that hosted the most international students and displayed them in a full-page bleed of documents. The project shows the varying, often contradicting, responses students have been receiving on whether to leave or stay. The tones some colleges used showed that international students got lower priorities than domestic students, and some were dehumanizing.    The project includes the links for the audience to go to the colleges’ websites to track and check in case the messages were updated later. Some colleges contacted us after the project published about their updates.      2. (1) Those passports lost the most value during a pandemic <a href=""https://qz.com/1838486"">https://qz.com/1838486   & (2) These are the countries Americans can travel to right now without a visa  <a href=""https://qz.com/1893192/"">https://qz.com/1893192/     An American passport became quite useless in 2020. The countries that were most impacted by the pandemic saw the biggest drop in passport rankings. These two projects, one published in April and the other in September, tell the country-specific severity of the pandemic through the lens of passport rankings and how that has shifted from Asian countries in the spring to the U.S. in the fall.    The “snake graph” draws the audience in. The annotations contextualize and explain what’s happening on the screen for readers. I collected and verified the data, did the reporting, and built the charts.     3.  As the data became available, a reverse globalization could be seen around the world.   Foreigners <a href=""https://qz.com/1841999/"" target=""_blank"">have left the US  and <a href=""https://qz.com/1886412/"" target=""_blank"">other western developed countries .      4.  UK prepared to revamp its immigration system as Brexit deadline loomed. One of the proposals is a points-based immigration system to control who gets to work in UK. I built a calculator based on their released policies to answer:   Can you work in the UK under its new points-based immigration system?    <a href=""https://qz.com/1804992/"">https://qz.com/1804992/        5.  In other immigration stories:   (1) I charted the global inequality of mobility by showing that   <a href=""https://qz.com/1814238/"" target=""_blank"">citizens from richer countries had a higher chance of getting their US visas approved ;    (3) I looked into how the severe outbreaks in high-income countries affected low-income countries   <a href=""https://qz.com/1834566/"" target=""_blank"">due to a plunge in remittances .      6.  I was comissioned to visualize   <a href=""https://goldenstatswarrior.substack.com/p/the-working-story-of-chinese-immigration"" target=""_blank"">the history of Chinese immigrants in the Bay Area   on the newsletter  Golden Stats Warriors .      7.  I also worked on a number of data stories explaining Covid-19:   1) One examined   <a href=""https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19"">the effect of mask mandates on containing the spread of the virus  . I did the data analysis and created the graphics. The story was retweeted by the governors of California and New York;   2) The individual decision of wearing a mask is often times a negotiation with the environment. We surveyed the US population on their behaviors of wearing masks in various social settings. I <a href=""https://www.vox.com/21534158/cdc-americans-masks-indoors"">  produced a story that guided people through the decision making process  ;   3) In a story for  Scientific American,  I analyzed the data and detailed  <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-is-now-the-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-u-s1/""> how Covid-19 became the third leading cause of deaths in the US  .  ",https://qz.com/1822530/,https://qz.com/1838486,https://qz.com/1893192/,https://qz.com/1804992/ ,https://qz.com/1814238/,https://qz.com/1834566/,https://goldenstatswarrior.substack.com/p/the-working-story-of-chinese-immigration,www.vox.com/science-and-health/21546014/mask-mandates-coronavirus-covid-19,www.vox.com/21534158/cdc-americans-masks-indoors,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-19-is-now-the-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-the-u-s1/,,,,,,,,
United States,Quartz,Big,Shortlist,Quartz Things team portfolio," From its inception, Quartz has been on the forefront of many types of journalism: data, visual, interactive, sensor, and others. Led by our Things team, which is chiefly responsible for making these “things” that combine reporting with technical skills, our 2020 work continues to reflect that tradition. We’re proud to submit our team’s work for consideration of recognition from the Sigma Awards.   Our work consistently takes the form that is most appropriate for our readers and members to find understanding and insight. That is clear in “The coronavirus epidemic is changing emoji usage on Venmo,” where the data and visualization are the story and the text secondary. It’s also apparent in “Coronavirus antibody tests aren’t as accurate as they seem,” in which a customizable simulator takes center stage. But of course we sometimes let words drive the narrative, as you can see in our “Welcome to Leeside” project.   Our team’s vast array of skills is readily apparent in our work. Compare the abilities expressed with pieces like “emoji usage on Venmo,” “Mexico is illegally destroying protected mangrove trees to build an $8 billion oil refinery,” “antibody tests,” and “The Covid-19 pandemic has made canned foods, shelf-stable milk, and vodka seem better.” They run the gamut from collecting and analyzing massive datasets, to detecting changes in satellite images, to coding probabilistic simulations, to dynamically collecting and displaying reader responses.    We aren’t limited to quantitative methods: We use our numeracy and data skills to augment our qualitative reporting. That’s evident in “This is the year Hong Kong began speaking the Communist Party’s authoritarian language,” where a hunch from a reporter based in the city was borne out through a robust analysis of 165,000 public statements and transcripts we collected. It also showed in “This is the chance your local bank branch will close by July,” where our analysis of the dynamics driving changes in retail banking was localized to the readers in every US zip code.   Our work is beautifully designed and delights. It is built for users on desktop and mobile equally. It takes care to pay attention to accessibility, including making sure visual elements are described appropriately for people using screen readers, and has a dark mode for people who need a low-brightness or different-contrast experience.   Finally, and perhaps most importantly: We don’t take our readers’ knowledge of data or statistics for granted. We regularly produce work that helps them gain a greater appreciation for not just our work but the entire media industry. To help with our members’ understanding of the torrent of pandemic-related data, we published “The data deluge,” a resource of data fundamentals. And when the US government’s initial Paycheck Protection Program loan data was released, we didn’t rush into it to provide commodity coverage about the recipients of the largest loans or the areas with the most financing. We provided context to our readers with “Here’s what we know is wrong with the PPP data.” Without these kinds of resources, many readers would be ill equipped to understand some of the most important stories of the year.   It’s no surprise that on average, work made by or assisted by Things team members in 2020 had more readers than Quartz articles that did not. It’s also no surprise that the team’s work was some of the most successful at converting our readers into paying members who, no doubt, think of our work not as data journalism or visual journalism but simply as journalism—which is just as it should be. ","   Coronavirus antibody tests aren’t as accurate as they seem    By simulating the sensitivity and specificity of antibody tests on a hypothetical population, we left our readers with a greater understanding of how even tests with accuracy figures near 100% can lead to false results.          Welcome to Leeside    While it looks like a traditional high-production news article, it’s designed—from its content to its layout to its interactivity—as a museum exhibit about a not-so-distant future that the world is headed towards. The lens allowed us to merge real-world data and dynamics with simulations and imagined artifacts to create an immersive story of a community dealing with the realities of climate change.         Mexico is illegally destroying protected mangrove trees to build an $8 billion oil refinery    In a classic example of using contemporary techniques to augment traditional reporting, we used satellite imagery to not only show the destruction of mangrove trees visually, but also quantitatively by using software to measure the amount of destroyed vegetation that can be seen in the images.          The Covid-19 pandemic has made canned foods, shelf-stable milk, and vodka seem better    We began collecting responses from our readers on two simple questions: Is a grocery item generally good, bad, or neither, and now that the pandemic has set in is it good, bad, or neither. We charted the results live and were able to show which items had become more and less desirable.         This is the year Hong Kong began speaking the Communist Party’s authoritarian language    We analyzed the language used in 165,000 public statements to show the steep rise in authoritarian language that was showing up in government statements as Beijing started more forcefully inserting itself into Hong Kong’s governance.         This is the chance your local bank branch will close by July    We analyzed the data on just under 100,000 US bank branches from the FDIC and crafted a multivariate model to determine the probability that a branch location closes in a given year. As we explain in our findings and methodology we automatically insert the data about your area and a nearby bank. Alternatively you can manually select almost any bank branch in the US.         The data deluge    This is a field guide to help our members to understand and navigate data and data analysis during the pandemic and beyond. Of particular note are the pieces “The challenge of percent change,” “How to compare data that change over time,” and “Covid-19 is a reminder to beware of seasonality in data”         The main metric economists use to measure inequality is deeply flawed    This was another service to our readers to help them understand a commonly reported metric. Through clear diagrams, the promise and limitations of the Gini coefficient are made apparent with simple, plain language.         Here’s what we know is wrong with the PPP data    Our soup-to-nuts analysis of the original PPP data release’s flaws involved not just the data itself, but comparisons to databases from the US Postal Service, Social Security Administration, and Census Bureau. That allowed us to discover data about applicants that the government had intended to keep private.         The coronavirus epidemic is changing emoji usage on Venmo    We collected data from Venmo, analyzed it, and created a story that treats the data and visualization as primary content.

Brazil,Agência Pública (apublica.org),Small,Shortlist,Bruno Fonseca,"   Bruno Fonseca is an editor and reporter at Agência Pública, the first non-profit investigative news agency in Brazil. A multimedia reporter, he works with infographics, data, videos and animation. His work has received several awards, such as the Petrobras Journalism Award, the Vladimir Herzog Award for Human Rights, the Brazilian Bar Association Journalism Award for Human Rights and the first and second place of the <a href=""https://alleyesontheamazon.org/aea-announces-winners-of-the-data-journalism-contest-all-eyes-on-the-amazon/"">Data Journalism Contest “All Eyes on the Amazon”  in 2020. Fonseca has bachelor and master degrees from the Federal University of Minas Gerais and attended the Thomson Reuters Journalism Course on Multimedia Reporting.      He's been working as a journalist for 10 years, developing data visualization and infographics since the beginning of his career. Throughout his trajectory he has dedicated himself to producing illustration and animation works to create multimedia contents that allow the visualization of large data analysis. He has been working at Agência Pública for seven years conducting investigations on topics such as environment, health, public policies and gender and race-based inequalities using open databases. His professional inspirations range from design professionals like Alberto Cairo, Giorgia Lupi and Mariana Santos, to journalists working with public databases like Amanda Rossi, Carolina Moreno, Cecília Olliveira, Gustavo Faleiro, Sérgio Spagnuolo and Stefano Wrobleski.  ","   In 2020, Bruno Fonseca was part of Agência Pública's coverage of the consequences of the pandemic on the lives of the most vulnerable Brazilians. He also dedicated himself to investigating the Bolsonaro administration policies for the environment in 2020, when the Amazon rainforest deforestation surged to 12-year high under Bolsonaro and fires ravaged the Pantanal region; and he helped cover the Brazilian municipal elections in november. For this application we have selected three data-oriented pieces that represent the work Bruno Fonseca developed at Agência Pública in 2020. He has acted as data editor, reporter and art/infographic editor in all of them.      The first article, entitled ""In Brazil, COVID-19 death rate for black community is higher than for other populations"" and published in may, showed how the pandemic has been affecting the black and white populations differently in Brazil. It revealed that, at that time, one in three black patients had died from complications due to the virus compared to one in 4.4 deaths among white Brazilian patients. The piece also showed the discrepancies in deaths and hospitalizations between rich and mainly white neighbourhoods and poor and predominantly black ones. This article was republished by 54 other media outlets and was translated to <a href=""https://globalvoices.org/2020/06/29/in-brazil-covid-19-death-rate-for-black-community-is-higher-than-for-other-populations/"">english,  <a href=""https://es.globalvoices.org/2020/06/04/en-dos-semanas-el-numero-de-negros-que-han-muerto-por-coronavirus-es-cinco-veces-mayor-en-brasil/"">spanish,  <a href=""https://fr.globalvoices.org/2020/07/09/253451/"">french,  <a href=""https://it.globalvoices.org/2020/07/in-brasile-il-tasso-di-mortalita-da-covid-19-per-la-comunita-nera-e-superiore-a-quello-delle-altre-popolazioni/"">italian,  <a href=""https://ar.globalvoices.org/2020/07/14/66463/"">arabic,  <a href=""https://ru.globalvoices.org/2020/07/14/95353/"">russian  and <a href=""https://el.globalvoices.org/2020/07/56089"">greek .

So far, the piece has been mentioned and/or backlinked in more than 100 publications, including articles by the brazilian newspaper <a href=""https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/gestao-politica-e-sociedade/cpfs-negros-importam-racismo-estrutural-e-politicas-publicas-no-contexto-da-covid-19/"">Estadão,  one of the most prominent in the country, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/enormous-disparities-coronavirus-death-rates-expose-brazils-deep-racial-inequalities"">The Guardian .      The second article, ""Bolsonaro government reduces fines in municipalities where deforestation is growing"", was published in August. It revealed that for every ten municipalities in the Amazon region where there were less fines for environmental crimes in 2019, eight reported an increase in deforestation. Moreover, it showed that the Bolsonaro administration had even reduced the number of fines in 2020, in relation to the previous year. The article was republished by 22 national websites and mentioned in articles by international outlets, such as <a href=""https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxj7q/brazil-is-persecuting-its-own-environmental-protection-workers-whistleblowers-say"">Vice News  (US) and <a href=""https://www.dn.pt/mundo/delirio-negacionismo-bolsonaro-mentiu-10-vezes-na-onu--12753066.html"">Diário de Notícias  (Portugal). This story was also featured in the important french publication <a href=""https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/chiffre-du-jour-amazonie-moins-damendes-pour-crimes-contre-lenvironnement-plus-de"">Courrier International .      The article third article, ""In the Amazon, 118 politicians with environmental fines run for election"", revealed that 118 of the candidates for mayor and deputy mayor in the November local elections had previously been fined for deforestation, illegal burning, exploitation of native forest located in reserves, or providing false information to environmental agencies to cover up illegal activities - and that 28 of them were running for reelection. The piece was republished 19 times, including an english version featured in the conservation and environmental science news platform <a href=""https://news.mongabay.com/2021/01/brazil-elections-boost-environmental-violators-to-high-office-in-amazon/"">Mongabay.       All three pieces were produced using open data, accessible to any citizens and journalists. These works shine light on important social issues, necessary to better understand the current political, environmental and health scenario in Brazil. By doing so, they had repercussions on the national press and served as tools to help civil society organisations orient their actions.      The biggest challenge was finding new and investigative ways to process open databases that could aid the comprehension of the various social and political contexts in today's Brazil. Moreover, working with these open databases without any assistance or answers from the government agencies that produced them was a tough challenge. Different formats and missing information in several databases made the work more complex and added additional layers of research and investigations to be done using other means and sources to fill in the gaps.

Bolivia,Revista Muy Waso,Small,Shortlist,Panel y base de datos COVID-19 en Bolivia," Bolivia is the country with the worst public information system concerning the pandemic in Latin America. The right to information on a collective issue has been suppressed and access to reliable and transparent data is restricted. To fight this violation of an essential human right in this crisis, during 2020 we were the only magazine with the most complete data and graphic repository in Bolivia and we produce notes and research (about it) that the traditional media ignore.     We are one of the fastest growing and best rated native digital media in Bolivia. We are a team of younger, independent and self-managed journalists. We launched as an entertainment, arts and culture magazine in July 2018.Since 2019 we expanded our coverage areas, covering health, society and politics. We currently specialize in narrative journalism, data journalism and investigative journalism. En 2020 nuestro trabajo periodístico fue beneficiario de fondos del Facebook Journalism Project, Google News Initiative e Internews.    In addition to our work as a media outlet, we carry out social projects in different areas. Our most successful project took place in a women's prison in the city of Cochabamba, Bolivia, which included the publication of our first book authored by 15 women convicts. Recently, within the framework of the health emergency, we delivered more than a ton of food and cleaning supplies, which we collected through the monetary contribution of our users in social networks, for the same penitentiary. "," In 2020, during the health emergency caused by COVID-19, the Bolivian government did not provide transparent epidemiological information and did not give the public access to databases on the number of sick people, their sex, their ages or the number of tests, among other relevant information.    This lack of information forced us to manually compile the information we obtained through photographs, PDF documents, epidemiological reports in images (JPG) or video reports. Thanks to this work we were able to put together the most complete database and graphs of the entire Bolivian media ecosystem. Our panel of graphs and data provided detailed and disaggregated information about location, age, sex, hospital capacity, number of deaths and tests.    With this data we followed up, for six months, the information on COVID-19 in Bolivia and verified the official news and discourses that provided incorrect or distorted information.    Due to the economic crisis that affected our newsroom, we could not continue with this work after September 2020, but our work served as inspiration for civil society organizations, data experts and civilians to get involved in the control and monitoring of the epidemiological information provided by the Bolivian authorities.    With that perspective, thanks to our strategic alliances, we opened space for an open data event about the State's purchases during the health emergency called DatActivate.    We are currently working on an episode for our podcast that shows the efforts of citizens and independent journalists to make the epidemiological information on COVID-19 in Bolivia transparent.  ",https://muywaso.com/especial-de-datos-muy-waso-sobre-el-coronavirus-en-bolivia/,https://muywaso.com/datactivate/,https://muywaso.com/bolivia-tiene-el-peor-sistema-de-informacion-covid-19-de-sudamerica/,https://muywaso.com/14-mil-muertes-que-no-se-pueden-ocultar-y-una-tasa-de-subregistro-del-75/,https://muywaso.com/la-salud-de-los-migrantes-venezolanos-en-bolivia-entre-la-solidaridad-y-la-desinformacion/,https://muywaso.com/covid-19-casi-medio-millon-de-abuelitxs-vive-en-zonas-de-alto-riesgo/,https://muywaso.com/bolivia-la-lucha-contra-el-vih-pierde-terreno-frente-a-la-covid-19/,https://muywaso.com/alcaldias-gastan-mas-en-comida-para-policias-y-militares-que-en-civiles/,https://muywaso.com/beni-solo-hizo-48-pruebas-hasta-el-dia-del-estallido-epidemiologico/,https://muywaso.com/son-los-agachaditos-una-alternativa-para-prevenir-el-contagio-de-la-covid-19/,,,,,,,,
United States,"The Texas Tribune, ProPublica",Big,Shortlist,Texas Tribune Data Visuals Team Portfolio," Data journalism is a foundational practice and value at the Texas Tribune. A decade into our existence, data reporting was more important than ever. The coronavirus pandemic made access to accurate information a matter of public safety, and the Tribune’s data visuals team was uniquely prepared to cover the pandemic’s impacts. Our team’s 2020 portfolio shows how we leveraged our expertise in data reporting, analysis, design and presentation to make crucial information clear to Texans in acts of public service and accountability journalism.      The Tribune’s data visuals team in 2020 consisted of an editor, Darla Cameron; three developers, Chris Essig, Carla Astudillo and Mandi Cai; an investigative data reporter, Ren Larson; and fellow Anna Novak. Our work is supported by designer Emily Albracht and the Tribune’s editors, audience team and engineers. We work seamlessly together, and we strive to maintain an environment where the collaboration required to publish our most complex and demanding journalism is possible.    The best example of this collaboration is our coronavirus case tracker, which we take turns updating every day. The tracker is an example of what we do so well — gather complex data, distill it, and present it to readers in a way that they can understand. It’s also a daily accountability story, and the Tribune’s most viewed story of 2020. As Texas rolled back its restrictions and case totals surged multiple times, the tracker was a clear and consistent place for readers to understand how state leaders’ decisions impacted their personal safety.    Coronavirus data was just part of our work in 2020. In the spring, after years of planning and development, we reimagined a core Tribune product — our government salaries database — in a way that is both easier for readers to use and a better tool for accountability reporting. The Tribune launched a new investigative team with ProPublica, which uncovered the story of a company that was suing thousands of low-income Latino immigrants during the pandemic and stopped after we started asking questions. We investigated why Texas’ largest cities spend more on police than anything else in their budgets. The data visuals team built tools to help Texans learn how to cast their ballots safely in a state that opted not to expand voting by mail. We also published the most comprehensive election results in the state.    Our portfolio for the year reflects our organization’s dedication to presenting a full picture for readers, giving them the tools to be more thoughtful, productive and engaged citizens. In 2020, The Tribune’s mission was truly driven by data.   "," The Texas Tribune’s data visuals team submits the following projects in its portfolio:        <a href=""https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2020/texas-coronavirus-cases-map/"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> Texas coronavirus cases: Latest updates   The team’s biggest undertaking this year is our coronavirus case tracker, which we have updated every day starting in April.

Argentina,Data Journalism course (Social Sciences Department - National University of Avellaneda) -UNDAV-,Small,Shortlist,Datos UNDAV,"   Datos UNDAV  is the Data Journalism chair of the National University of Avellaneda -UNDAV- (Argentina), which functions as a space for teaching, learning, laboratory for experimentation and practice of data journalism for students.     Students' data journalism articles are at <a href=""http://datosundav.com.ar/"">datosundav.com.ar  (Link to automatic translation into English of the full site: <a href=""http://bit.ly/3rdWZNw"">http://bit.ly/3rdWZNw )    Since 2015, the UNDAV's Bachelor of Journalism includes within its study plan the subject Data Journalism. In this way, UNDAV became a pioneer in Latin America in the teaching of data journalism in an undergraduate degree and with a specific subject.   The main goal of Datos UNDAV is to provide conceptual frameworks and practical tools that allow thinking about and exercising data journalism.   Throughout the semester, students get the necessary skills for the production of journalistic pieces created from large databases and the creation of  interactive visualizations using digital tools available on the web. They will have the skills required to join the data journalism team of any professional newsroom.   The subject includes theoretical content and the use of digital tools for searching, processing and curating data, as well as for publishing and visualizing information. In addition, cases of good practices in data journalism in national media, the region and the rest of the world are studied. Also, it proposes that students know the process of requesting access to public information both national and local level.     I am Damián Profeta (@damianprofeta)  and the subject is in my charge. I have been practicing journalism for 15 years and I have been teaching at the university level for 10 years. In 2015 I was summoned to create the subject Data Journalism. Since then, 12 cohorts of students had the oportunity of learning the basics of data journalism and putting it into practice in a classroom-workshop-newsroom modality.   The Datos UNDAV experience was presented in the 8th. International Forum of Digital Journalism at the National University of Rosario (UNR) at the end of 2015: <a href=""http://bit.ly/3rk867B"">http://bit.ly/3rk867B    Likewise, the experience was reviewed in an article in the first digital book of the Meeting of Chairs of Investigative Journalism in Argentina ""In search of journalism that inquires into power."" 2016: <a href=""http://bit.ly/2NW2bqY"">http://bit.ly/2NW2bqY    Furthermore, the Datos UNDAV proposal was selected in the first order of merit as a research project to analyze and describe the practice of data journalism in Latin America. The work was a combination of research and journalistic practice with the students and was funded by the National University of Avellaneda - Call ""PIPP 2018"" carried out among 2019 y 2020: <a href=""http://bit.ly/2NZj04h"">http://bit.ly/2NZj04h    In 2019, the experience of the UNDAV in teaching data journalism as a unique case in public universities in Argentina with a specific subject in a university journalism career was highlighted in the investigation of the National University of Lomas de Zamora ( UNLZ) ""Public Universities that teach data journalism in Argentina: which ones, how and why"". Abstract in english: <a href=""https://bit.ly/3axr6sz"">https://bit.ly/3axr6sz    In 2019, also, I defended my master's thesis on teaching data journalism. It was evaluated as Outstanding by the San Andrés University (UdeSA). ","   DatosUNDAV.com.ar  includes   <a href=""http://bit.ly/2MUODLL"">24 articles on data journalism created in 2020  from public databases in Argentina  on issues of gender, The use of public funds, human trafficking, employment, economy, health, education, housing, aboriginal peoples and others. They have their corresponding data analysis with a journalistic perspective, relevant sources consulted, stories with human value and data visualizations.   The articles based in databases created by Datos UNDAV 2020 students have journalistically relevant findings for Argentina, such as:    -Almost 3 out of every ten patients who need a transplant die before they can be included on a waiting list.     -In 2020, public financial aid for children of femicide victims was doubled.     -For the first time in history, more women than men preside over the committees of the National Senate.     -Only one out of every one hundred requests to carry arms is made by a woman.     -Most people with disabilities do not process their disability certificate due to ignorance of how to do the process and its advantages.    It also includes about <a href=""https://4eqsfccwf42hzajhhiescsl3ue--datosundav-com-ar.translate.goog/entrevistas/"">  30 in-depth interviews with data journalists from Latin America  . The interviews were conducted by students of the subject and are part of a research funded by the university to analyze and characterize data journalism in the region. Journalists from La Nación Data y Chequeado, from Argentina; as well as, from Ojo Público, from Peru; El Tiempo and Cuestión Pública, from Colombia, Sudestada, from Uruguay; Post Data Club, from Cuba; Serendipia, from Mexico, among many other data journalists from media across the region share their experiences, work, visions and perspectives on this practice, in invaluable material for students and anyone interested in data journalism in Latin America.   The Data Journalism subject  (Datos UNDAV) became over time one of the most valued by students. The result of this positive assessment is the growth in enrollment semester by semester and a   video  in which some students shared their appreciation of the subject to promote it in the rest of the students of the career:   <a href=""https://youtu.be/5uPm_1l1F4w"">https://youtu.be/5uPm_1l1F4w   (only in Spanish).   Despite having a national law on access to public information and some laws at the provincial level, in 2020, due to the pandemic, the legal deadlines for the delivery of information to citizens (and students, in this case) were suspended and that was an added difficulty.   Likewise, despite the existence of legal frameworks, a gap persists between the laws and their practice: the information is usually provided incomplete, with arbitrary omissions and in closed formats that make it difficult to handle, analyze and process.   Although they are difficulties, all the more in the case of students, they also represent challenges that they undertake with enthusiasm.        Note: each work has the signature of its respective authors, students of Digital Journalism from the National University of Avellaneda. I am the professor and researcher in charge of the subject and coordinating the work of the students and the correction, editing and qualification of the articles.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Shortlist,ProPublica," With a team of more than 100 dedicated journalists, ProPublica covers a range of topics including government and politics, business, criminal justice, the environment, education, health care, immigration and technology. We focus on stories with the potential to<a href=""https://www.propublica.org/impact"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> spur real-world impact  . Among other positive changes, our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws; reversals of harmful policies and practices; and accountability for leaders at local, state and national levels.   One thing core to the work we do is the belief that data journalism is a key way in which we can hold power to account and shine a light into dark places. In 2020, we published a range of stories and interactive pieces that do just that. "," The projects we’re presenting were some of our most ambitious: we uncovered the activities of a secret Chinese propaganda network, exposed landlords who were illegally attempting to evict tenants during the pandemic, published long-secret NYPD disciplinary files, showed how climate change will devastate parts of the country and much more.    These stories, graphics and databases run the gamut from pieces that hold governments accountable to those that probe systemic harms brought by private companies and even the Catholic church.    Among them are some of our most popular projects, racking up millions of readers and some impact: companies stopped filing evictions, New York City is considering new NYPD reforms and senators wrote to debt collectors like Capital One asking them to stop seizing workers’ paychecks.

United States,McClatchy Washington Bureau,Small,Shortlist,Shirsho Dasgupta,"   I think my first proper encounter with data journalism was with the publication of the Panama Papers in 2016. Back then I had just started a Master’s degree in English and was still undecided between wanting to become a reporter or an academic. Eventually I settled on the former and while I wanted to work on investigations in general, it was in journalism school that I properly discovered my love for data reporting (I like to think I was always good at Math, so that wasn’t a mental block that I had to overcome), especially while working as a student-reporter for Crosstown LA, a hyperlocal data-driven news outlet based in the campus.       After graduating, I joined the McClatchy Washington Bureau where I work almost exclusively with one of McClatchy’s papers, the Miami Herald. I have worked on projects based on data sets as varied as cancer treatment billings, police shootings, hospital ownership and leaked information involving thousands of documents or emails. My work last year has involved covering the COVID crisis in Florida, especially its toll on the state’s prison system and nursing homes; the impact the Black Lives Matter protests had on policing protocols; uncovering the influence private prison giants Geo Group has on both Washington, DC and Tallahassee; a $4 billion cryptocurrency scheme spanning the Americas and Europe; and the alleged role of U.S. administration officials in an attempted coup in Venezuela.        As someone who’s been in the field of data journalism for roughly two years, I am of course indebted to my professors and mentors at the journalism school of the University of Southern California. I’m also very grateful that my editors and colleagues trusted a 26-year-old newcomer to the field with important investigations.    I personally view data as not just numbers but more broadly as “information” ⁠— a dump of emails has the same value for me as a spreadsheet with loads of numbers. I think in this sense, it is important for data reporters to also learn and become adept at using research tools like LexisAdvance, PACER, the various OSINT tools available online. I also think ⁠— and this is something I try to do with the stories I work on as well ⁠— that it is very important to have a good narrative and human voices to support the data analysis. Corruption, violence or governmental failures is not just a matter of numbers ⁠— they leave behind victims and at the end of the day it is their story that we as journalists are trying to tell.       I also try to inform myself and unlearn prior assumptions and misconceptions about societal issues as much as possible. The information that a data reporter works with is not generated in vacuums and it is very important to be aware of how factors like gender, race, caste, class, sexuality or even nationality work and influence our daily lives and the events around us.       In my opinion, newsrooms in general should do as much as they can to promote some amount of data literacy among non-data journalists as well. The COVID-19 pandemic, if anything, has shown how important it is for reporters from all beats to have some basic understanding of data. My advice for journalism students interested in data reporting would be to take at least one class in accounting, statistics or financial reporting.       Thank you for considering my portfolio for the Young Talent award.   ","   My portfolio is built upon the work I produced at the Washington bureau of McClatchy newspapers in 2020. As a data reporter in an investigative unit that closely works with the Miami Herald (one of McClatchy’s papers), I produce data-driven stories both by myself and in collaboration with others.      Like most journalists last year, I was tasked with covering the COVID pandemic in Florida. Data analysis-based stories that I reported and produced included articles on the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241576496.html"">plight of the uninsured in the midst of a health crisis,  the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241691226.html"">fears and anxieties of the loved ones of those in the state’s prison system,  the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article242338421.html"">enormous political influence wielded by a private prison contractor with the worst COVID-safety record  and how <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article247430840.html"">COVID infections surged after Florida’s governor eased visitation restrictions . Besides interviewing sources and writing the narratives for these stories, I analyzed and created visualizations from data as varied as the number of people insured per county, prison inmate populations, demographics and budgets, federal and state lobbying records and campaign contributions, and nursing home infection rates.       A few weeks after protests erupted across the United States after police officers killed George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, I created a survey, collected responses and produced a story on <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article243980492.html"">how the protests had managed to change police use-of-force policies in many of the country’s biggest cities . I also worked with a colleague to report a story on the <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article243760662.html"">hundreds of surplus military-grade weapons and tactical gear that are handed out to local police departments by the U.S. Defense Department  and how the number of transferred weapons correlates to the number of people killed by officers of those departments.       Besides reporting investigative stories on a breaking news cycle, I also worked on enterprise projects. I sifted through a massive cache of emails, financial records and other documents found in a leak of data from a bank in the Cayman Islands and uncovered <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article244763002.html"">how a Russian oligarch concealed from the IRS hundreds of millions in taxes . As one of the lead reporters in the Miami Herald/McClatchy collaboration with ICIJ and BuzzFeed News for the FinCEN Files, I scoured through the Suspicious Activity Reports and produced a story on <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article245623470.html"">a $4 billion cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme spanning Florida, the British Virgin Islands and Europe . Later in 2020, I also went through 40 GB worth of text messages, photos, videos and documents and together with my colleagues reported a story on <a href=""https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article246819562.html"">the involvement of Trump administration officials in a failed coup attempt in Venezuela to depose Nicolás Maduro .       Combining data analysis, public records and testimonies from individuals, my stories on the Florida prison system and offshore shell companies shone some light into the workings of institutions that generally operate under a shroud of secrecy and opacity. The stories I reported on the workings of law enforcement brought fresh attention to the issue of transferring military-grade weapons to local police departments and also quantified something that is generally spoken of in abstract terms — the impact of protests on policy. Besides being published in the papers owned by the McClatchy chain, many of the stories were also later republished in other outlets and referred to in newsletters.       I believe my portfolio and the varied subjects I’ve covered in my reporting speaks to my skills as someone who is just about two years into their career.   ",https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241576496.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article241691226.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article242338421.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/coronavirus/article247430840.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/national-security/article243760662.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article243980492.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article244763002.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article245623470.html,https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/investigations/article246819562.html,,,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,Financial Times,Big,Winner,John Burn-Murdoch," I suspect I speak for many data and visualisation journalists when I say that for most of my career, regardless of any praise it has garnered, my work has felt relatively trivial. Charts of tennis players, polls and election results are all very well, but they rarely feel essential to anybody. Perhaps a colourful graphic sparks joy in someone, or a polling chart makes someone happy thet ""their team"" is winning, but I’ve rarely felt that any of my work has really changed anyone’s life. 2020 has been ... a little different.   The last twelve months have been by far the busiest of my life, frequently clocking off after midnight and almost always juggling half a dozen stories simultaneously, but they’ve also been the most worthwhile months of my life by some distance, and I’ve never felt more like I’m making an actual difference to people’s lives. I never thought a chart could save a life, but anecdotally at least, this year it <a href=""https://twitter.com/triweasel/status/1347531140035440641"">may have happened .   I’ve been in data journalism to some or other degree for almost 10 years now, but I suspect I will look back on my career in two halves, separated by the onset of the pandemic. Up until twelve months ago I would sniff around the corridoors of the FT to see if I could find a way to get a story of my own published. We data journalists weren’t often considered to be ""words journalists"". ""Could you do some charts for this piece?"" was often how the day went, and the days rolled into weeks.   But now it’s different. I’ve written more words and more stories over the last twelve months than I had done in several years previously. Not only are my story pitches routinely greenlit, editors come to me for advice on whether other stories should run at all, and if so how they should be done. For a period last spring, civil servants from multiple countries would cold-call me to ask for advice on how they should present data to their publics. Over the last year, my stories, videos and tweets have been seen by several hundred million people in countries all over the world, and they’ve helped people navigate an incredibly difficult, turbulent time.   Essentially, after 10 years [for me, and decades for data journalism as a discipline] it feels like the world has finally *got* data journalism. It’s sad that it took a lethal global pandemic, and it’s sad that even now it’s often the wider public who appreciate the value before an old-school news editor does, but all I can say is it’s been an immense honour to have had the opportunity to reach so many people across the world, to <a href=""https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=%22logarithmic%20scale%22"">introduce millions to log scales,  and to improve public understanding of a global health crisis at a time when they were so poorly served by political leaders and other parts of the media.   After a year of at times literally round-the-clock efforts to bring the best and most important information to people as quickly as possible, a year where I feel I have graduated from ""charts and numbers guy"" to bona fide journalist, it would mean an enormous amount to me to be considered for the portfolio prize at this year’s Sigma awards. ","Pre-pandemic work: I used R to carry out an original, high-level economic analysis of detailed data on the UK labour force, showing which parts of the UK would be most affected by a proposed tightening of the country's restrictions on immigration from the EU in the aftermath of Brexit. The raw Labour Force Survey data is the source material that the UK's government statisticians use to calculate economic statistics, but it is rarely analysed outside of this context other than by private sector economic analysts, think-tanks and academic researchers. To the best of my knowledge, no journalist has ever done their own analysis of this data before. The result was a custom dataset exclusive to the FT, and a strong and important story on how strict immigration rules will impact migrants and locals alike in different areas of the UK. Story link Main pandemic work: In early March I built and published the first version of what went on to become our iconic Coronavirus Trajectory Tracker chart. For the next 45 successive nights, I updated this chart, going on to add more than nine additional charts as well, covering data in subnational regions and incorporating an ever-growing number of countries. The data sourcing work here was extremely complex, since we did not trust some of the uncredentialled aggregator sites such as Worldometer, and Johns Hopkins University (who were using data from Worldometer). This meant I had to resort to techniques including scraping government press releases and extracting figures from within paragraphs, scraping near-unscrapable dashboards built in Tableau and PowerBI, crowd-sourcing translations of Korean-language PDFs, and setting up an entire new email inbox to receive tips from readers on data sources. Between the data sourcing and the charts, this unbroken series of daily work, seven-days a week, is probably my career highlight in terms of the public service that I delivered. Story where charts appeared at the time As important as the data sourcing and the charts, in my view, were the explainers that I did throughout the pandemic to ensure people were not confused or misled. These included: an explainer on log scales, which we then spun out into a full explainer video covering multiple bases. That video was followed by others introducing and explaining other useful ways of representing and following the evolution of the pandemic, and latterly a myth-busting explainer of why Covid-19 is not simply a bad flu, and the virus's winter surge is far more lethal than past winter flu seasons I spent several weeks compiling data on deaths from all causes in dozens of countries around the world, allowing us to estimate the number of ""excess deaths"" during the pandemic around the world. This involved holding authoritarian regimes to account, and allowed us to show the true death tolls at at time when many countries were struggling to keep track. The data collection task here was the most ambitous of my career, involving the automation of convoluted processes for different countries with different data formats and often in different languages. I wrote scrapers in R and node.js, cleaned, transfored and analysed the data in R, and plotted the charts in d3.

United States,"Big Local News in collaboration with Pitch Interactive, an evictions project by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and partners.",Small,Shortlist,Big Local News - sharing local data for journalistic impact,"   Big Local News is a program of Stanford University’s Journalism and Democracy Initiative and collects local data to discover the patterns that will yield stories with impact. We go after data sets that are hard to obtain because they’re kept in disparate, scattered locations by multiple jurisdictions. Big Local News works with newsrooms to process, analyze and archive the data they collect, including building tools to help journalists retrieve the information they need to tell important stories.      This platform allows journalists – whether freelancers, reporters from one company or collaborations across multiple news organizations – to share data and work together as they report out stories. The platform is being integrated with specialized tools for data cleaning and analysis. Big Local News also has a relationship with the Stanford Digital Repository where both raw and processed data can be archived permanently. Archived data is then be made publicly available.      This work is designed to be journalist-driven and transformative, to help find solutions for local newsrooms’ ability to produce accountability journalism — the type of journalism that can shift policy and law and create impact.  ","   The first week of March 2020, Big Local News launched its platform at NICAR, the annual conference for data journalists. At the conference in New Orleans, we held two sessions where we demoed the platform and answered questions, and then also led a hands-on workshop for developers to familiarize them with using the API to pipe data in and out of various projects.       This happened just as the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in shutdowns across the country and the globe. The platform launched in beta, but quickly transformed to a vital hub of information and guidance related to understanding data that could be used to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on local communities. Within the space of three weeks, the three Big Local News staff members, engaged Stanford students and partner newsrooms collected, processed and released a dozen data-sets. Among them: data on community vulnerability; hospital beds data from Medicare Reports, leavened with contextual detail from the Census; data on nursing homes; daily updates of the four main repositories of COVID-case data; and tweets from governors, health departments and more. Platform users have added more data to share with others as well, from data on efforts to provide free meals to reports from medical examiners and COVID case models. The Big Local News team has added even more contextual data on hospitals and data on layoff notices, updated weekly. And students working with Big Local News has been a part of analyzing data and reporting stories on these topics.      That week of the conference, there were around 70 users of the platform. A week later, there were nearly 200. By mid-May, there were 827 users, and also more than 800 files being hosted on the platform in more than 60 projects. We twice have seen usage jump by more than 70 new users in a single day. Today, there are more than 1,500 users, 177 projects and more than 2,900 data files. The platform features 33 Open Projects -- those open to anyone using the platform, with data ranging from evictions to nursing home inspections, PPP loans and layoffs.       Our goal throughout has been to support local journalists. Toward that end, and with Google News Initiative support, we created the <a href=""http://covid19.biglocalnews.org/county-maps/index.html#/"">COVID19 Case Mapper  along with a design studio, Pitch Interactive. It went live on April 14. By creating embeddable interactive maps at the national, state and county levels, using <a href=""https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data"">New York Times data  for the U.S. map and Johns Hopkins data for the global map, Big Local News made embedding maps for local journalists simple and quick. As of Jan. 4, 2021, our Case Mapper had 10,687 embeds and generated more than 2 million page views. Here are just a few examples of how the embed was used by local news outlets: <a href=""https://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/iowa-department-public-health-coronavirus-map-counties-covid-19"">The Gazette in Cedar Rapids, Iowa ; <a href=""https://abc11.com/nc-coronavirus-map-update-covid-19/6087356/"">ABC 11 in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina ; <a href=""https://thepublicsradio.org/news/updates-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak"">The Public’s Radio in Rhode Island ; and <a href=""https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-investigations/2020/04/18/at-least-20-pima-county-coronavirus-deaths-single-tucson-nursing-home/5141208002/"">AZCentral in the Phoenix metropolitan area.       We have embarked on other projects too, providing nearly $200,000 in grants to journalists around the world to pursue data-driven COVID stories and then share the data and recipes for how to replicate similar stories elsewhere.      Now, we are working toward automating courts data we have scraped on evictions in collaboration with the University of Maryland, and developing new tools within the platform to make it easier to find the important stories within the data.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Shortlist,The Guardian's Coronavirus portfolio," This year, I’ve been focusing on making the nuances of the coronavirus pandemic more understandable for Guardian readers. Since joining the Guardian, this has meant digging through the noise to find data-driven stories that reveal new points about the pandemic.    Aside from our live-tracking pages, I have also uncovered stories on how 2020 summer relaxations were leading 10 countries to face rising cases, how densely-packed and deprived BAME communities were hardest-hit, how modelling showed that the 'real' English infection rate could be as high as 20%, and how the winter wave has driven record demand on the NHS.   Collectively these data-driven news stories have received hundreds of thousands of views. While our trackers continually serve to cover the bases of the pandemic’s progression, these pieces of data journalism aim to take the story further: they aim to reveal how coronavirus is impacting specific communities, or how government policy has led to coronavirus spreading in a certain way. These require a more bespoke analysis on a specific issue compared to the trackers, but are just as important to cover.   Such pieces use data to unveil problems or injustices that need addressing. They raise awareness of these issues, and therefore try and hold power to account. The Guardian’s reader community responded well to these stories, with the pieces receiving positive comments, with many positive comments, shares and engagement times of over a minute.  The data analysis components of these pieces were mostly conducted in R (mostly dplyr, tidyr) and Google Sheets. The static charts were built in R (ggplot) and final stylistic edits and annotations made in Adobe Illustrator. The interactive charts - in both the international piece on relaxed countries seeing coronavirus increases, and the England modelled 'real' infection rates - were built in d3. ​ "," Finding data on the pandemic has been challenging, with different countries and authorities recording different metrics in slightly different ways. Authorities have also made certain metrics hard to access. This often made data analysis a harder job than usual, meaning that even more care had to be taken when at the checking and verification stage of a project. This was especially true for the “data shows 10 countries risking coronavirus second wave as lockdown relaxed” story.     Also, each of these pieces were collaborative projects, involving work with both other journalists on the Visuals or Data teams, or wider afield with reporters on the news desk. As so many people have come to learn, working from home presents extra challenges when working on collaborative projects. I joined the Guardian during this period of remote working, and so have never actually met some of the people I've worked with on these projects in person. Having to arrange calls instead of simply looking over a colleague’s shoulder, for example, made some of these stories more challenging. However, this challenge has been reduced from the start due to the fact that my colleagues have been so understanding, patient and helpful. The challenge has also been reducing as I become more adapted to remote working, and the process becomes more embedded and efficient in the newsroom.  I think the coronavirus pandemic and the data-led reporting around it has shown how data and visual journalism needs to be at the forefront of the newsroom. Every day, most national and international publications are reporting on newly-published statistics that not only help people understand how the pandemic is progressing, but also help authorities in combating the disease. These numbers are not easy to understand without explanation and context, which is where our job comes in.    Visualisation can help report these numbers in a balanced but engaging way. We can create time series charts to show the trajectory of death rates, or build a map that shows the geographic context of a particular area or countries’ latest case numbers. Without this data journalism, reporting on the the coronavirus pandemic - the most important story of the last year - would be inferior, lacking context and potentially misleading as communities either placed too much or too little emphasis on individual numbers.    The work of data analysis and data visualisation has never been more important.

United States,The Seattle Times,Big,Participant,2020 portfolio of Emily M. Eng," 2020 and the year of COVID-19 proved to be one of the most graphically difficult beats to cover. From breaking news to lack of data to contradictory information, the pandemic challenged me to stretch my reporting, my technical skills and my creativity. My portfolio highlights the breadth of visual skills, including infographics, mapping, charting, coding and science illustration that I utilized to help our readers understand the pandemic.    I joined the graphics team at The Seattle Times in 2016 as a news graphics artist before being promoted to graphics editor. I work across the newsroom on all subjects ranging from the environment to sports to politics. Trained as a science illustrator with a background in biology, I bring data and facts to life. I specialize in layering information in data-driven visualizations and infographics and I work in both print and digital spaces. For each story, I innovate different visual approaches to help impact an audience and convey information in ways that educates and illuminates. "," Here’s some of my 2020 coronavirus work:     CORONAVIRUS FACT PAGE: Here in Washington, we were considered the first epicenter of the infection in the United States and back in late February and early March there wasn’t much information, especially scientific, on novel coronavirus outside of China. To help illuminate what we did know at the time, I put together a poster of coronavirus facts and public health information to help our readers stay safe. The challenge was getting the information out as quickly as possible while also being accurate. So, I reached out to epidemiologists, government officials, including the WHO, to make sure that my information was correct and to review the infographic. I started my research on a Monday, March 2 and we printed the infographic as a full-page poster in our paper that Friday as a public service. Online we removed the paywall, linked to other language guides and made it downloadable so readers could print it out at home. I continued to update my story and infographic for months afterwards and have reached over 680,000 readers (pageviews).   THE STATE OF OUR STATE PRESENTATION: In April, Washington state was in lockdown and coronavirus had touched every aspect of our community. We wanted to giver our readers a status update on where we were in our fight against coronavirus from all departments and beats newsroom wide. I created 15 graphs that accompanied each section and built an interactive side-by-side presentation that arranged the data visualizations to be read as part of the story text — allowing the text and visuals to play off each other. The hardest part of this story was the incoming daily new data — updating all 15 graphs the day before publication was important and necessary as we wanted to be as current as possible for our readers.   LIFE CARE CENTER TIMELINE: Through our investigative work we were able to trace back how the virus spread undetected at Life Care Center a month before the first resident’s death. I built an interactive timeline to voice the 911 calls out of Life Care asking for help and compared that to the growing number of coronavirus cases and deaths. This presentation was unique as it gave you a glimpse inside the Center, through 911 audio recordings, while showing what was happening outside in our community.   WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN: Throughout the pandemic different types of data sets, figures and metrics are used to measure success. Based on reader feedback, we realized that our audience was getting confused on how to read all these graphs. So, we created this public service story, a cheat sheet/resource on what each metric and graph was showing. I created 8 graphs and used a more conversational voice with directional arrows style to highlight what to look for in each graph and what it means in terms of the virus in the community. The difficult task with this project was making these explanatory graphs without using any specific data in order to help keep them evergreen and continually useful.   MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES EXPLAINED: As the pandemic continued, we covered a local researcher working with monoclonal antibodies as a possible way to slow the virus spread. The goal for this graphic was to explain what monoclonal antibodies were and how they potentially could help save lives. The challenge was simplifying a complex system like the immune system and depicting things you can’t see with your naked eye. I worked with the researcher directly to include only the relevant immune system steps and then constructed process diagram that was accurate, eye catching and still easy to   ",https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/facts-about-novel-coronavirus-and-how-to-prevent-covid-19/,https://projects.seattletimes.com/2020/charting-coronavirus-outbreak-washington-state/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/coronavirus-spread-in-a-kirkland-nursing-home-for-weeks-while-response-stalled/#timeline,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/covid-19-data-what-the-numbers-mean-and-how-to-tell-if-the-coronavirus-is-spreading/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/monoclonal-antibodies-could-fill-the-covid-19-treatment-gap-until-vaccines-arrive-but-at-a-cost/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/lost-battle-how-coronavirus-overwhelmed-washington-states-efforts-to-contain-it/#timeline,http://projects.seattletimes.com/2020/coronavirus-covid-19-washington-state-virus-pandemic-fight-six-months-july-charts/,https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/coronavirus-pandemic-job-losses-falling-hardest-on-people-who-were-already-hurting/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/in-yakima-county-tensions-grow-as-some-want-life-back-to-normal-while-agricultural-workers-want-more-protection-amid-coronavirus/,https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/seattle-scientists-fast-track-potential-treatments-for-covid-19/,,,,,,,,
China,NBD (National Business Daily of China),Big,Participant,A-share Green Report," Every day, governments at all levels in China would publish a large number of information in regards to environmental administrative penalties, pollution source emission monitoring, and the ECA (Environmental Compliance Approval) information on specific public networks. These environmental risk information concerning the public interest is often over-dispersed, complex and too professional, so it is rarely paid attention to by the public or revealed by the media.   Since September 2020, NBD (National Business Daily of China), China's leading professional financial media, has been working with IPE (Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs),  a well-known non-governmental organization in environmental protection, to tap into China's complex environmental risk data from the perspectives of public company environmental responsibility and green investment.   We have applied technical methods to monitor nearly 4,000 A-share listed companies in China and the companies they own or have invested in. Every week we apply in-depth analysis to the data, looking for particularly noteworthy stories or misconducts, and using AI + Writing to write news stories that are easy to understand. Then we try to get the stories to reach more people, especially for holders or potential buyers of listed companies' stocks to see the risk of investment behind environmental problems.   NBD is a cutting-edge financial newspaper in mainland China, known for revealing reports on listed companies and investment and financial management. It is committed to becoming the watchman of China's economic society and capital market. The project was planned and led by the Beijing team of the company channel, the core news division of NBD, who mainly studies and reports on listed companies. They believe that how a company is operated will affect the public interest, and therefore having supervisors watching what they are doing is beneficial to the public welfare. "," The ""A-share Green Report"" project is a long-term data journalism project that continuously generates new stories and is constantly getting upgraded. From September to December 2020, we reported more than 200 environmental risk events through AI + Writing, and conducted 16 in-depth analysis reports.   Every week, nearly 100 pieces of data which is provided by IPE are getting verified and categorized by our reporters, and then they would turn the information into instant news in batches by AI + Writing. The reporter then would further cross-compare other information from listed companies to analyze and explore the impact of environmental incidents on listed companies, and ultimately they would carry out an analysis report called ""A-Share Green Weekly"". This project has pioneered a new model for mining news through dynamic data in China and has also created a unique environmental risk assessment list for listed companies in China.    The challenge we face is to verify and categorize complex and mixed raw material, and to accurately match the equity relationships of related companies. At present, the reporter has worked out a set of efficient methods with technical assistance. In addition, to come up with a standardized evaluation system for professional information concerning the environment is also a challenge. But now we have jointly developed a set of persuasive scoring mechanisms that evaluates the environmental performance with our partner institutions IPE. In this project, the most complicated is to cooperate with different departments and agencies. In the long run, we still need to continue to explore in order to better work out the workflow and mechanisms.   The impact of the ""A-share Green Report"" project is obvious. It has received positive rectification and feedback from more than 30 listed companies on environmental incidents since it was put into operation, which has been four mouths as of today. And unexpectedly, the project also received feedback and attention from Zhejiang Monetary Authority, as it is also their job to urge listed companies to improve their environmental protection level.

Philippines,ABS-CBN News & Current Affairs,Big,Participant,ABS-CBN News (Investigative & Research Group and News Digital Group)," I am submitting this entry during a very challenging time for my media organization, ABS-CBN News in Manila. Our broadcast network, which used to be the biggest in the Philippines, was shut down by the government last May when our broadcast franchise expired. For several years, Congress did not act on the bill renewing our franchise, in large part because of President Rodrigo Duterte’s attacks against our network. Since he assumed power, the president had repeatedly said he would not get our franchise approved and he would shut the network down. And he made good on his word.   Our national free-to-air channel, regional channels, and AM radio stations were forced off the air. Thousands of our colleagues lost their jobs. All this happened in the midst of the pandemic, when movement was limited and the economy was in a slump. But those of us who were left in the newsroom did not back down from demanding transparency and accountability from the government through our stories in general, and data-driven stories in particular, especially on the coronavirus issue.   You see, before we could even think about data crunching, analysis, and visualization in the Philippines, we have to contend with the more fundamental challenges of limited access to information, a shortage of accurate and timely data, and the sheer lack of open data.   The biggest task for us has been, and still is, relentlessly putting pressure on government to make accurate and complete data readily available. The other challenge is how to make these understandable to the varied audiences of ABS-CBN.   While we still cannot air on free TV, our flagship newscast airs on cable and satellite TV, and on our digital platforms. Since the shutdown, the subscribers of our news channel on You Tube grew exponentially, and now has more than 11 million subscribers.   We always strive for a multi-platform presentation of our data stories and projects. The portfolio we submitted for this entry involves a collaboration with different teams: the Investigative and Research Group (my team), a reporter, in this case Kristine Sabillo, and our News Digital Group’s multimedia team.   The biggest challenge for us has always been rendering data-driven reports for TV, for the primetime newscast, because it is a very limiting platform. It’s a constant struggle how to make our TV audience appreciate data and see how data could make sense of the issues and policies that affect their lives.   Since our team has been created, we’ve been relentlessly pushing for creative ways to present data on TV, for a mass audience, and we think we’ve attained relative success in it, judging by the very high engagement of our data-driven TV reports.   We would like to experiment with more interactive pieces and with a team of data crunchers and developers to produce reports like the fantastic data-driven pieces of Pro Publica, Reuters, The New York Times, and The Washington Post.   But we are still a long way from there. Right now, we are just chipping away, bit by bit, at this regime’s opaque walls, and explaining issues to Filipinos the simplest way we could, through data, armed with the extremely diminished manpower and resources that we have.   Despite all this adversity—our network’s shutdown and reduced resources amid the pandemic—we kept on challenging the accuracy of government’s coronavirus data, and we have been the only media organization consistently doing this. In fact, other news outlets have been quoting our analysis in their reports.   Because of this, ABS-CBN News, particularly the Investigative and Research Group, and News Digital Group, should be considered for the SIGMA Award. "," I am submitting this portfolio of data-driven stories on COVID-19 because it narrates our continuing effort to pressure government to be more transparent and accountable in addressing the crisis. These document our relentless challenging of government data (or lack of it) and how this forced government to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and relevance of its data. But a lot of gaps still need to be addressed.   Since the first confirmed cases in February, we have been demanding more accurate data from government. In March however, the health department (DOH) ceased publishing coronavirus case information, directing people to its website instead, which contained only aggregate data and a lot of inaccuracies.   We requested more information from DOH, and for them to publish in open data format. Only after a lot of follow-up letters, calls, and reports did DOH start publishing a database of COVID-19 cases. But our constant monitoring and analysis of the data revealed a lot of gaps and inconsistencies.   In March, our analysis showed how majority of COVID-19 deaths were confirmed positive for the disease on the day of death or after. We did another analysis in April, and again in June, with progressively worse findings.   In reaction to our consistent coverage of such gaps, DOH official Rosario Vergeire promised several times that they were addressing the ""backlogs"" and ""delays."" Our coverage eventually pressured government to improve its data.   We also called out DOH whenever it stopped publishing certain data fields, like the date of laboratory confirmation and when patients were counted in the recoveries and death tally. We then found other ways of analyzing the data using the remaining data fields.   In August, we revealed DOH's removal of over 4,000 cases from the coronavirus case tally in only 2.5 months because these were ""duplicates"" or COVID-negative. DOH also revised the recoveries tally because 309 patients it initially tagged as recovered turned out to be dead.   After this story came out, Vergeire said DOH ""strongly reminded"" local officials ""of the need to immediately report deaths"" and recoveries, and that DOH is creating a data management unit.   In October, just when we thought DOH was getting its act together, our analysis revealed nearly 16,000 cases that were only included in the tally a month or more after exhibiting symptoms. Our findings showed that it took the government an average of 68 days to include such patients in the official tally.   After this story came out, Vergeire admitted that there was ""a gap in the system"" that was ""being fixed.""   We also dissected COVID-19 loan documents and laid out in simple terms what they imply for Filipinos. We intend this to be a baseline for monitoring later how the money will be spent. We also drilled down COVID-19 data to the province and city level.   We are the only media outlet that continues to analyze COVID-19 infections among healthcare workers, pointing out reporting delays in this sector.   We render our stories multi-platform. The story versions for TV and radio are rendered in a simpler way to make TV audiences appreciate what the data mean in their life.   Our stories, analyses, and data visualization were cited by other media outlets. In August, WHO quoted heavily from our analysis in its COVID-19 Situation <a href=""https://www.who.int/philippines/internal-publications-detail/covid-19-in-the-philippines-situation-report-50"">Report</a>.   Our data-driven reports also had high engagement on social media. The stories that we included in this entry alone had approximately 121,000 reactions, 14,000 comments, and 20,000 shares altogether—and that's only on Facebook.   People also expressed their appreciation of our analyses and data-driven reportage, saying that these have shed light on the government's shortcomings in addressing the crisis.

Spain,El Orden Mundial,Small,Participant,Álvaro Merino," When I joined El Orden Mundial (EOM) as a trainee almost two years ago, there was no data team nor graphic section in the newsroom. They were only focused on the political analysis of international issues, but wanted to expand borders and try new formats. Since that very moment, I have been the person in charge of creating a data journalism department to which more journalists could adhere in the future. As such, I have had to design the tenets of our work process, from the data treatment to the (graphic) way we present our conclusions. It has not been an easy task: I landed at EOM right from my master degree in investigative, data and visualization journalism, so I had little experience in the field. At that time I could get on with ideas at the national level, but having to think internationally, merging academics with journalism, presented a tremendous challenge.   In spite of the difficulties, I believe I have lived up to the expectations. I have mastered techniques and data sources and have come up with creative ideas. I am also proud of having established a data methodology and a visual style guide. In this sense, I should mention that, together with a cartographer, around three-quarters of my work time were spent on designing data visualizations (maps and charts) for our <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/mapas/"">map library</a> –we have published more than 250 visuals during 2020–, while the rest of the time was devoted to writing data articles on my own.   With regard to El Orden Mundial, I would like to highlight that it went professional just three years ago and, at the moment I joined them, there were only three full-time workers –the actual founders– and one part-time geographer. None of them was a journalist. We have become the reference media when it comes to international affairs and already count on more than 2.000 subscribers. "," I have collected nine examples on which I used data analysis in order to explain a particular trend or issue. In all of them I made use of data visualization to better expose the dynamics and the main conclusions of my analysis:  <ul>  The European Union is ageing and <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/como-sostener-los-sistemas-de-pensiones/"">the economic weight of pension system is starting to put some economies in trouble</a>. The reform of the system of retirement provisions has become an issue in several countries, particularly in Spain. I analysed data from the World Health Organization, the United Nations and the European Commission to explain how medium age will grow in the whole world in the coming decades, and how that will affect pension systems. I also included some possible solutions and identified effective measures developed by some governments.   The pandemic soon attracted our attention and I published two related articles: <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/sistema-sanitario-estados-unidos-coronavirus/"">one telling the problems the liberalised health system of the United States could cause</a> and <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/organizacion-mundial-de-la-salud-china-ee-uu/"">another on the impact the American retirement from the WHO funding could have on the organization</a>.   The analysis of the <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/vino-europa-produccion/"">evolution of European vineyards in the last two decades</a> was probably the most special project of the year for me. Making use of Copernicus’ CORINE Land Cover data, I concluded that the EU lost 15% of its vineyards since 2001 while tripled the economic value of its exports of wine. I called it “the revolution of European wine” and found the insights particularly interesting.   2020 was a difficult year for the Spanish monarchy and I decided to investigate <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/transparencia-monarquias-europa/"">the financial aspects of the rest of European royal families</a>. More transparency was needed in the majority of cases and I reflected it in my article, together with a comparison of the salary and costs of European monarchies.   <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/onlyfans-revolucion-porno-economia/"">A boom of amateur porn sites such as Onlyfans followed the pandemic</a>. People who never had a contact with the porn industry before started to upload erotic content from their homes and they had a lot of success. I talked to several creators and analysed web traffic to Onlyfans.   I was impressed by the fact that The Netherlands always appeared at the top in the ranks of food exports, in spite of its small size. I dug on the issue and discover something called “the Amsterdam effect”: <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/como-los-paises-bajos-han-llegado-a-ser-el-segundo-exportador-mundial-de-pina-y-aguacate/"">the Netherlands are specialised in the re-export of food</a>, they buy a lot of food in order to sell it again to a different country, so their volume of trade is overestimated. It was hard to collect the data that demonstrated such a complex industry.   Poland is known for its strong Catholic tradition, but <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/pederastia-politica-aborto-poderosa-iglesia-polonia-perdiendo-fieles/"">young Poles are starting to question an old and regressive institution</a>.   I was curious about what happened to remittances during the pandemic. <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/pandemia-no-ha-podido-con-las-remesas-ahora/"">They resisted in a way nobody expected</a>, especially in Latin America, and I used World Bank data to explain the trend.  </ul>  Finally, I have also included in my portfolio a map. As I mentioned in the cover letter, the <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/mapas/"">map library</a> is an essential part of EOM and probably the one our subscribers enjoy the most. Our best visuals are usually behind a paywall, and we invert a huge amount of time an effort on them. <a href=""https://elordenmundial.com/mapas/geopolitica-mediterraneo/"">The map of the geopolitics of the Mediterranean</a> is a good example. It combines a beautifully designed map layer with a deep analysis of the dynamics that help to explain the functioning of the Mediterranean Sea: ports, main cities, chokepoints, oil and gas fields, pipelines, maritime disputes, migration routes and military bases.

Brazil,Self-employed,Small,Participant,Ana Clara Faria," To Whom It May Concern,   I am a freelance journalist from Curitiba, Brazil. I graduated from college in 2018, and last year I got a Specialization degree in International Relations and Diplomacy. I am particularly interested in writing about topics such as climate change, sustainable development, and human rights. In 2019, I started a personal blog about environment and sustainability called ""Info Sustentável"". Aside from building up my portfolio and developing my writing and digital communication skills, my goal with this project is to help spread relevant information about several topics regarding climate change and environmental issues. I also like to write in my blog about positive and transformative actions being taken in my country, especially by civil society, for protecting the environment.   My familiarity with these topics has increased in the last few years; in college, I wrote an article about the effects of climate change, for which I received a scientific journalism prize from Paraguay's National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT). In 2018, I attended an international youth conference (""The Youth Assembly"") in New York City and Washington, D.C. about the 2030 Agenda, where I have learned more about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, I began two volunteer works that are also linked with my topics of interest. First, I attended a ""Climate Reality Project"" capacitation program in Atlanta, U.S., where I had the opportunity of seeing the Former Vice-President of the United States Al Gore's live presentation on climate change. A few weeks later, I joined the volunteer staff of the ""Youth Action Hubs Brazil"", an initiative supported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) that aims to engage young people in implementing the 2030 Agenda in their communities.   I am submitting my portfolio to the Sigma Awards as a form to encourage myself to keep writing about topics I am passionate about, even when it is just a personal, individual project with no remuneration. I have never received any sort of funding for creating and keeping my blog; I just started by myself, using the tools I had access to, and my previous knowledge in journalism, blog editing, and social media (I create the Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter posts as well). You can also notice that some of my posts contain my own illustrations and infographics, which reflects my efforts to deliver easily understandable content. My goal is to keep telling inspiring stories, explaining facts, and raising awareness on all relevant sustainability topics so that people can be inspired to take action themselves.   2020 was a really challenging year for everyone, and it required from me an extra dose of motivation and resilience to keep up with my ideas and aspirations. The results of my personal efforts to keep my journalistic projects are shown in this submission.   Thank you very much for your consideration.

United States,Insider Inc.,Big,Participant,Angela Wang," Data journalism wasn’t a lifelong passion of mine, but rather, an interest that revealed itself as I became cognizant of the ways in which numbers and striking graphics were used in stories I enjoyed.   As a 2019 graduate of Columbia Journalism School’s Data M.S. cohort, I am early in my career as a data journalist. I have learned magnitudes in the past two years — from writing my first line of code in mid-2018 to publishing my first data-driven story in the New York Times the following year — both as a student and subsequently, as a reporter at Business Insider, and I’m eager for what the future brings.   My path to data reporting has been atypical but understandable. I studied Art History and Studio Art as an undergraduate at Northwestern University, where I blogged for Northwestern Art Review, writing stories about my experience living and working with a leftist art collective and the visual ephemera surrounding Occupy Wall Street. My undergraduate experience bolstered my interest in analyzing source material and communicating well-researched ideas in ways that lay audiences can understand.   Prior to journalism school, I worked for more than five years as a copywriter and creative at BuzzFeed, Gawker, and Gizmodo. My proximity to journalists furthered my interest in reporting and deepened my desire to contribute more meaningfully to society through my work.   I’m grateful to have attended journalism school on a full scholarship, and I hope my experience shows other aspiring reporters that entering this industry is possible without a linear background, and potentially without taking on too large of a financial burden.   I owe great credit to my graduate school professors, who supported and entertained even my most frivolous ideas, from analyzing seawater sample data to determine which popular New York City beaches were host to the most fecal bacteria, to using public data to test the theory of whether Hurricane Sandy led to stronger and better-adapted rats living along the Eastern seaboard. (It didn’t, although rat populations have experienced logistic growth.)    My editors at Insider have also served as my mentors, guiding each of my projects and helping me widen my reporting range. In my year on the Investigations team, I have expanded my skill set by virtue of working on a wide variety of projects — writing more efficient code and thinking more resourcefully about how to use publicly available data — all with an ethos of solving mysteries and furthering novel reporting techniques.   I hope my candidacy for the Sigma Award shows what work is possible for a budding data reporter working on a lean and new team, as well as the breadth of data skills that reporters can pick up in a relatively short amount of time.    Thank you for your time and consideration. "," My portfolio reflects the work I have produced as an early-career investigative data journalist at Insider. Being the lone data reporter on my team requires a nimble mindset, helping other reporters with data relevant to their stories, as well as executing my own projects without the support of an established data desk. My portfolio demonstrates this make-do spirit, incorporating a wide range of tools, from scraping to flight mapping. It also illustrates the collaborative nature of data journalism, as each piece is the result of a group effort between myself and my colleagues to tell data-driven stories with an impact.   The databases for Jeffrey Epstein's address book and flight logs, both of which were difficult or impossible to search within, provided an unprecedented insight into the people and places in Epstein's orbit, and laid a solid groundwork for future investigations. For example, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-tom-hanks-not-on-epstein-pl-idUSKCN24F20V"">Reuters</a>, <a href=""https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jul/31/facebook-posts/no-tom-hanks-name-not-jeffrey-epsteins-flight-logs/"">Politifact</a>, and <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/epstein-bankrolled-strange-foundation-with-ties-to-former-french-minister-jack-lang"">The Daily Beast</a> have all relied upon these databases to fact-check and expand their own reporting.   The QAnon investigation supplied entirely novel evidence for the real identity of ""Q,"" the conspiracy theory's anonymous figurehead. This investigation <a href=""https://www.orphanalytics.com/en/news/proa20201215"">inspired</a> a Swiss research firm, previously known for identifying the pseudonymous writer Elena Ferrante, to conduct their own analysis of Q's writing. Their <a href=""https://www.orphanalytics.com/en/news/whitepaper202012/OrphAnalyticsWhitePaperQAnon2020rf.pdf"">results</a> found further evidence that Q's messages were likely written by more than one person.   The greatest challenge behind my work is operating alone as a budding data journalist. It means I'm frequently teaching myself new skills and referring to the work of other data journalists for inspiration and ideas to build upon. I check every step of my work and rely strongly on my editors for their feedback on my methodologies. While this can be a difficult environment to operate in, it helps me articulate my processes and present my data more clearly.   Equally challenging are the projects that require elbow grease and manual labor, as well as dispelling the magical thinking that technology can solve any problem quickly. This was especially pertinent to the Jeffrey Epstein databases, which were largely compiled from scanned records that no OCR methods could parse well. Epstein's flights database was predicated on handwritten flight manifests kept by Epstein's pilot, made public via court records, as well as incomplete ADS-B signals associated with his private jets. For these databases, I relied primarily on manual transcription and analysis (determining incomplete flight paths by altitude and timestamp, guided by QGIS). Ultimately, human judgment is necessary to make sense of data.   My hope is that other journalists will feel more confident in using data to strengthen and expand their reporting, even without a technical background. Any journalist can compile databases from information they obtain in the course of reporting, including publicly available records. My portfolio has sparked an interest in database reporting within our newsroom, and I hope our work extends this interest to other reporters.   My portfolio also shows how much information can be gleaned from publicly available data sources, from social media posting times to aviation signals. These sources of data don't require a technical background to review at a basic level, but paired with basic programming skills, they can reveal a lot about an entity's behavior over time. I hope that this inspires other journalists to explore these methods.

United Kingdom,Reach,Small,Participant,Annie Gouk," I first entered the world of data journalism in 2016 after completing my masters at Goldsmiths, University of London. My role as a journalist with the Reach Data Unit (then the Trinity Mirror Data Unit) was my first job in the industry altogether, and I had no experience of data at all at the time. Little did I know that it would become a passion.   I'm forever grateful to my then-manager and mentor David Ottewell - now head of data journalism at the New Statesman Media Group - for taking a punt and hiring me despite my lack of experience, as now I can't imagine doing anything other than data journalism as a career. Since then I have quickly risen to deputy editor of data and multimedia at Reach, within just a few short years.   In that role, I use open data, FoI requests and data scraping to create content for all the regional and national titles in the Reach network. Alongside long-term investigations and quick-turnaround, breaking news stories and longer-term investigations, I regularly collaborate with designers, coders and multimedia specialists to produce data visualisations, interactives, videos and audio. One example of this is my role as the creator of The North in Numbers podcast. That's on top of managing the rest of the team, editing their work and training new staff members and those on work experience with us.   Outside of my role with Reach, I am a recurring guest lecturer and teacher of data journalism at both Goldsmiths and the University of Central Lancashire. I also regularly give talks about the importance of data within journalism (particularly at a local level) - including on a panel discussion for News You Can Use with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, and speaking at events such as PyData Manchester, Open Data Manchester and Tech for Good Live.   I truly believe that data is one of the most important fields of journalism at the moment, and that no journalist is truly well rounded unless they have at least basic statistical skills. I think this has become particularly apparent in the last year, with the coronavirus pandemic putting a spotlight on statistics. However, despite the clear need for technical and mathematical ability in dealing with data, in my opinion the journalism part of data journalism is equally, if not more, important.   In my view the main role of a data journalist is to make those facts and figures relevant and engaging to people who are not data specialists themselves - and I aim to do this through the focus on people in my storytelling, along with the use of data visualisations and interactives. An inspiration to me on this front is Mona Chalabi, data editor at the Guardian US. Her use of illustration not only brings data to life but clearly and concisely explains complex issues, which is something I strive for in my own work.   I am also a firm believer in the importance of data for everyday news. While large scale investigations that take months to complete and look really impressive are an essential part of showcasing what data can do, there is also a need for data to fit into the model seen for other kinds of journalism. That means being able to create quick turnaround pieces that are responsive, relevant and drive pageviews. This is particularly relevant at Reach, and much of my work involves creating multiple, localised versions of a story using the same set of data to get the most from the figures, creating content for not one but many titles in the network. "," My investigation into Universal Credit was months in the making, combining several sets of data for the first time for a deep-dive into the benefits system. At a time of growing concerns about the impact of UC nationally, this project shed light on the devastating human cost of these policies at a local level.    Built by Adam Walker, the sites use innovative, animated data visualisations with illustrations by Marianna Longo, and case studies provided by local journalists, to bring the figures to life.    This is one of several sites created for different newsrooms from the same data. They have brought in hundreds of thousands of page views across the network, with an impressive average engagement time of 15 minutes thanks to their creative use of data visualisation.       In 2020 I also continued The North in Numbers for the Reach-wide Laudable project, with sound and production by Mark Magill. The first of its kind, this local, data-led podcast tells the human stories behind various statistics for the north of England. I bring together data analysis, wider research, and key interviews with experts and those most affected to provide new insight into vital issues that have a major impact on the north.   The focus on people, and the addition of images, links and data visualisation through Entale, helps engage a wider audience in statistics - which can otherwise feel impenetrable for many. As the episodes can be embedded directly into articles, there’s also scope for them to be used again and again in any related stories published by northern titles within the network.    Of course, much of my work in the last year has been taken up by coronavirus statistics, and I was particularly interested in combining these with other figures to provide fresh analysis on the topic. An example of this was my piece on student neighbourhoods that had seen a huge spike in cases since term began. I also worked with colleagues to provide accompanying graphics and video for social media, helping newsrooms share the story in a quick and engaging way.   Meanwhile, my piece on the dangerous myth of ""Black on Black violence"" used data from the Ministry of Justice to explore the issue in the wake of George Flyod's murder in the US - showing how existing data can be analysed in response to the national news agenda. Similarly, the video on police targeting of Black people in the UK involved analysis of various figures from the Home Office to confirm what many were saying - that this is not just a problem in America. This also highlights how data can be vital in backing up anecdotal evidence.   The next three pieces in my portfolio are excellent examples of how I use interactives to bring data to life. All use postcode search to let readers explore hyperlocal data for their area, making it instantly more relevant and engaging. These widgets also have a use far beyond the pieces they are first published in; they are used again and again in related articles, adding value and driving registrations across the network.    Not all my work is digital-focused, however. I also produce content that is intended solely for use in print, with a focus on data visualisation. One example was my investigation into sexual offences in the armed forces. What this piece shows is the importance of not taking figures at face value, and instead digging deeper to get the real story behind the stats; again highlighting the importance of “journalism” in data journalism.   Each piece shown here is just one of many versions that were published across Reach sites.

To achieve this goal, it also plays a key role in the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals.   The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework was adopted in 2015 by the United Nations and its members and established 17 development goals to be achieved by 2030. To monitor these SDGs, 169 targets and more than 230 indicators were developed. The World Bank is a custodian or co-custodian for indicators in areas including poverty, gender equality, social protection, remittances, among other and works closely with the United Nations, partner agencies, and countries around the world to monitor progress towards the goals.   As an observer of the SDG agenda, the team also takes keen interest in creating awareness about the SDGs and seeks to incentivize action through its work on data literacy programs and statistical capacity building.   In an effort to educate audiences on the trends and measurements of the SDGs, the Data Group and the team have produced the Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals since 2017. Each edition of the Atlas has been unique and has taken a different approach. The 2017 Atlas focused on educating its audience about the key ways in which SDGs are measured. The 2018 edition was an open data and open code publication – the first of its kind at the World Bank.   The latest edition, and our current submission, focuses on integrating storytelling and data visualization on an interactive platform. The publication was prepared by a team led by Ana Florina Pirlea, Divyanshi Wadhwa, and Andrew Whitby, with editorial guidance from Matthew Welch under the management of Umar Serajuddin and the overall direction of Haishan Fu. Data visualizations were produced by Maarten Lambrechts, Yaryna Serkez, Jan Willem Tulp, and Elbert Wang. "," The Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2020 presents interactive storytelling and data visualizations about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Atlas consists of 17 stories, each focused on a different goal. The stories highlight trends for selected targets within each goal and explain how some SDGs are measured. Where data is available, they also show the emerging impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the goals.   The 2020 edition of the Atlas is the third in this series. Each edition has aimed at bringing awareness to a wide audience about the progress made towards achieving the SDGs, how they’re measured, and how countries compare. The previous two editions, which were conceptualized as print publications, also used visualizations to communicate stories and data. For the first time, the latest edition – our submission - is an entirely web publication and uses the online platform to integrate storytelling and data visualizations through an interactive approach.   This project was envisioned before the pandemic and therefore our biggest challenge was showing the impact of COVID-19 on progress towards the sustainable development goals. For some chapters this involved changing the story mid-way through the project to focus on a different, more timely, topic and locating the latest research and estimates, to the extent available.   Development data is rarely real-time. In fact, most often the data presented has a lag of at least one year. This is usually acceptable since changes in development indicators such as poverty rate, maternal mortality, PM2.5 levels, or access to infrastructure including roads or electricity over a period of one year are usually not large. However, in the event of a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, where all countries were deeply impacted, the data at hand was not always meaningful.   To address this, we had to be creative. For some indicators such as poverty rate and learning outcomes, the World Bank produced new forecasts. In other cases, there was information based on rapidly deployed phone surveys. But very recent data for many of the targets was hard to find. We also used examples of past crises that could inform the current situation, as well as anecdotal evidence to support and caveat that data we displayed.   With the Atlas we aim to reach out to a wide audience including students, journalists, policymakers, academics, as well as specialists and all those interested in development and wishing to learn more about some of the biggest challenges confronting the world. This way we wish to increase data literacy and to spur both dialogue and action towards meeting the Goals. Since its release on November 16, 2020 the website has been viewed by nearly 50,000 unique visitors and has amassed a total of 137,000 page views. Vey soon after its launch, the Atlas was featured on the United Nations home page.   The Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals 2020 was produced by the Development Economics Data Group (DECDG) of the World Bank, in collaboration with various units across the World Bank. The Atlas draws from the World Bank’s <a href=""http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/"">World Development Indicators</a> database, as well as from a wide variety of relevant data sources from scientists and other researchers worldwide.

Indonesia,BBC East Asia Visual Journalism team,Big,Participant,"BBC East Asia Visual Journalism team (Aghnia Adzkia/Journalist, Arvin Supriyadi/Designer, Davies Surya/Social Media Artis, Leben Asa/developer) teaming up with Ayomi/Journalist of BBC Indonesia, Rebecca Henschke/Asia Editor"," BBC East Asia Visual Journalism team is a small group of a journalist, a developer, and two designers who worked on data-driven projects. We did projects by ourselves and some projects teamed up with other BBC journalists across the region.    The small team was established in 2017 and has been doing data-driven stories and graphics for BBC across the region. We contributed to the development of data journalism from China, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Indonesia.    Some of our projects received huge responses from the community and played such a great deal in journalism growth in the region; e.g. Burmese election coverage, oil palm investigation in Indonesia, and healthcare facility in facing pandemic in Indonesia.         "," 1.  Oil palm company investigation in Papua, Indonesia.   BBC Visual Journalism East Asia Hub teaming up with Ayomi from BBC Indonesia and Rebecca, Asia Editor, Greenpeace Indonesia, and Forensic Architecture have produced a data-driven investigation of forest fire in oil palm concession under Korindo group, PT Dongin Prabahwa. The research found a Korean oil palm group company, Korindo group, did the forest fire within the concession to clearing the land in Papua from 2011 to 2016, which against the green agreement they ratified with the Forest Stewardship Council. In addition, the number of actions they took to solve problems with the community have allegedly violated human rights: 1) A member of the community has been killed after protesting the land clearing of his banana plantation; 2) the company bought only 5 USD per hectare for the land.   The story has been well received by the audience through media social (on Twitter), https://twitter.com/BBCIndonesia/status/1326679332534808576?s=20, quoted many times by local publication, and a month after the investigation released, the House of Representatives had a meeting to discuss the specific matter.    2. Health care facility in Indonesia is not ready facing the pandemic   A data-driven analysis made by data journalist of BBC Visual Journalism East Asia Hub, Aghnia Adzkia, looking at health care facilities in Indonesia. The research found that the facilities at the beginning of the pandemic were not ready to face the Covid outburst that has been forecasted to reach the peak in June and July. Aghnia also compared the facility and Covid testing and strategy with other East Asian countries.    The piece received word of mouth and good responses from the community. Local publication and well-known TV station, Kompas TV, has interviewed Aghnia to discuss her analysis on the matter.    3. Data-driven coverage on Burmese election    BBC East Asia team worked with the BBC Burmese to cover the election in 2019. We made series of video explainers about the rules and procedures of the election. On the day of the election, we made a live-result page which has been received a lot of attention from the Burmese community. In the Myanmar media context, such storytelling is rare, and having the live result map and parliamentary seat graphic is such a huge development in data journalism for Burmese media growth. The pieces we made receive more than a million responses on Facebook and hundreds of thousands of page views, which in the Burmese context, is a huge deal. This project has been pinpointed within the BBC as an example of engagement and visual journalism storytelling.    4. Covid drawing    Illustrator Davies Surya worked with Lara Owen, a women reporter in BBC for Asia, to create a compilation of children drawing during the pandemic. The beautiful pieces have been translated to over 16 languages and received a huge amount of positive response from the audiences.     5. Thailand covid graphics   The pillar story depicting latest situation of Covid -19 in the country through data, storytelling, and graphics. It reaches 1 million page views and accessed by the community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we update the piece regularly.  ",https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-54911171,https://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia-52153187,https://www.bbc.com/burmese/burma-54864058,https://www.bbc.com/burmese/burma-54763395,https://www.bbc.com/burmese/media-54723650,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/g7fg26ab8b/drawings-from-lockdown,https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-52090088,,,,,,,,,,,
United Kingdom,BBC News,Big,Participant,BBC News: What Covid-19 means for you," The BBC News Visual and Data Journalism Team is made up of data journalists, visual journalists, data scientists, as well as developers and designers. The team produces data-led journalism and visual storytelling for the BBC News website. The data team also supplies expertise and resources to journalists and producers across BBC News  - online, radio and TV.   The data team has also pioneered the use of R to create data visualisations at the BBC. It is now used on a daily basis to create content broadcast on TV and published on the website.   Over the course of this project many people on the team have played a key role in the Covid content highlighted here, and the only way it has been possible is down to continual collaboration, support of and oversight of each other's work.   Because of the pandemic, our team has adapted to delivering our content remotely.  It has been a major adjustment, but the service has not been disrupted purely as a result of home working.   "," Since January when Covid-19 first emerged, people have looked for reliable and trustworthy information about what the virus means for them.    To fulfil this public service we have put together a comprehensive package of online information.   It focuses on:    1. Tracking the severity of the virus across the UK   2. Lockdown restrictions in the UK's four nations   3. The picture around the world   All three pages have been continuously updated since publication. With more than 330 million views, the UK tracker is the most viewed webpage BBC News has produced.    Making sense of the data     The  UK tracker  was launched on 6 March, and has been updated ever since.   To get details of cases and deaths in an area  ,   you enter your postcode or a council name.  Our page has grown and improved, adding more local detail as time has gone on.    The page was ahead of central government, in publishing a similar postcode search.   On 3 October we launched our  UK lockdown rules  search tool.    It was aimed at dispelling public confusion about which rules applied where, as differing restrictions across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland affected what people could do. It is updated whenever new rules are announced.   Our  world tracker,  was launched on 24 January, initially with maps of China and the surrounding countries.   It has evolved into a comprehensive picture of the virus around the world with an interactive table and map of cases and deaths.    A huge impact    Our pages have attracted hundreds of millions of page views.   The world tracker is published in more than 40 languages through the BBC World Service.  The English version has had more than 83m page views.   Our UK lockdown rules tool was recommended by Robert Jenrick, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, appearing on BBC Radio 4’s Today Programme. It has had more than 55 million page views.   Professor Sir David Spiegelhalter from The Winton Centre for the Understanding of Risk at Cambridge University described the tracker pages as “great resources” not just providing data clearly, but offering interpretation as well.    How we did it    The three pages bring together many data sources to provide a rounded picture of the pandemic.    The world tracker uses six different data sources, with tens of thousands of data points.    The UK tracker page currently draws on eight different sources of data with about half a million data points, each processed every week day.   The information for the lockdown rules search tool draws on announcements by the UK government, and information from the relevant government websites for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.   We write code using the programming language R to download, clean and compile the data. This data is then checked before it is published.   It is uploaded to the sites using a newly-devised publishing tool which pushes the data to the postcode searches, interactive tables and maps.    The data is then used to create static charts used across BBC News Online and TV news.   Every element of each page can be updated in around an hour by two people each day.         ",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54373904,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

China,"China Global Television Network, or CGTN, Fenghuo Datanews Technology Ltd.",Big,Participant,"China Global Television Network, or CGTN, Fenghuo Datanews Technology Ltd."," China Global Television Network, or CGTN, is an international media organization launched on December 31, 2016. It aims to provide global audiences with accurate and timely news coverage as well as rich audiovisual services, promoting communication and understanding between China and the world, and enhancing cultural exchanges and mutual trust between China and other countries.   Headquartered in Beijing, CGTN has three production centers, located in Nairobi, Washington D.C. and London, all staffed with international professionals from around the world.

CGTN, a pioneer of media convergence in China, delivers digital content through CGTN Digital, which is accessible via CGTN.com, CGTN mobile applications, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Weibo and other social media platforms, with over 150 million followers across the globe. "," This series focuses on Donald Trump’s performance in the Oval Office. Published before the big Election Day, it tries to answer the following questions: Who had actually benefited from Donald Trump's trade polices? Did the U.S. become safer during Trump's term in office? Who was winning on the Twitter battlefield for the White House?   To this end, we, as a data-driven news media agency, produced three episodes, trying to answer the questions with accurate statistics. Each episode is visualized with animation and sound effects to most effectively communicate with the audience.   Data in the first episode shows that Vietnam, Ireland and China's Taiwan region are high on the list of winners of Trump's trade policy. Europe and North America also saw rapid rise in U.S. purchases after Trump's trade war against China, but this came to end with COVID-19.   The second episode finds that the rate of serious crimes increased amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Official figures contradict on whether the U.S. was becoming safer before the pandemic, but it's clear the country is turning more violent.   In the third episode, data shows that Trump may be more influential on the social networking site, but his Democratic challenger has gained more prominence over the past three months. If ""retweets"" mean reach and ""likes"" reflect preference, Biden is winning the war on Twitter.   It was challenging to find some of the data, and nationwide statistics require time to be collected and categorized. We did our best with limited sources and put together a series of refined work under a tight timeline. It demonstrated fabulous teamwork and in total, we reached 1.5 million views on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, alone.   Knowing that our work would inform and enlighten more people around the world, we are also grateful for people who sent out surveys and gathered data. We are beyond thrilled to show you what we have learned and accomplished throughout the project, and hopefully you will walk away with new information and insights that you would not have learned elsewhere.

Brazil,CNN Brasil,Big,Participant,CNN Brasil - Covid cash assistance paycheck malfeasances in Brazil," Hello, my name is Cecília do Lago, im a data journalist from Brazil. I have three years working full time as data journalist. I started at Estadão Dados the data journalism team of the newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo. After, i came to TV Broadcast CNN Brasil. Data journalism is very proeminent in Brazil but still at start.     Using data journalists principles i show to the public a quantitative way to see the politcs, education, unequalty, crime and elections. Our team made a map that show for the first time, how vote almost (70%) every neighborhood in Brasil at 2018 elections. Experts uses our maps to study the phomenal victory of the actual president, Jair Bolsonaro. We show, using a map, were are each phone robbert in the city of Sao Paulo for two year, showing that the robbery problem is widespread even at poorest areas of the city. This map was the first infograpich coverpage of a newspaper in Brasil, in 2017. Also, we made another map, that reveal the story of a little girl in a countryside small city at one of the poorest regions of Brazil. She is one of twelve children that study at the best school of Brazil in teaching letters to the children. Her parents cannot read or write, but they gave some books for her and she teachs them how to read and write. The family is very very poor. The small city has the best numbes on teaching letters, as part of a state, that, year by year, increses the education rates besides being a poor state. That state, Ceará, is rising above unequalty by education and changing the shape of the future of an entire generation, and have best education than the richest state of Brazil, São Paulo.   Me and my colleagues at CNN Brasil, Luiz Fernando Toledo and Pedro Duran, made this series about emergency pandemic paychecks, to bring light to this matter that affect one in three brazilians. By the importance of the subject, we think be considered by the Sigma Awards.    Thank you very much,     "," This is a serial story about wrongdoings in brazilian covid emergency paychecks. All the stories were made using public database on the covid paychecks and other public bases, like the military, the public workers and the entrepreneur linked to enterprises hired to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Our data team, me and Luiz Fernando Toledo, and the TV reporters Pedro Duran, Roberta Russo, and the fact checker Giovanna Bronze reveal some situations that show error and misconduct on public policies about the pandemic. I get the data and analysis, Luiz Fernando locate and talk with the persons and Pedro Duran, Roberta Russo, and Giovanna Bronze confront the receivers.   The first story is about 28 thousand military man that received the emergency paycheck that is not allowded to anyone that have a government job or full time job. The story show that the government made payments automatically without check the rules of the paychecks. The situation made noise on the press and, more than one month later, the government didn't correct the situation yet. The second story is about the government admiting the wrongdoing and working on the corrections. The third story is a prequel for the fourth. Is about the amount of money the states and federal government spend with the pandemic.   The fourth story show the worst situation. Some people, that own the enterprises that fight againt the pandemic, some with million dollars contracts, were receiving the emergency paychecks as they don't have work or nothing to eat. One of them seems to be a case of corruption becausa the enterprise have a millionaire contract and it's to small to fullfill the job. His owner admits that received the paycheck and argue that he was in need, because the enterprese was not his.   The last story is a follow from the first. After two months, 9,5 million reais still was in the pockets of government workers that shoud never received the paycheck at the first place. Some of them received three times.         ",https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/business/2020/06/13/28-mil-militares-nao-devolveram-o-auxilio-emergencial,https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/nacional/2020/06/19/governo-vai-recolher-mais-de-r-200-mi-de-auxilio-indevido-pago-a-servidores,https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/nacional/2020/07/31/governos-gastaram-r-13-bi-em-contratos-contra-covid-19-a-maioria-sem-licitacao,https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/business/2020/08/08/auxilio-emergencial-foi-pago-para-socios-de-empresas-que-combatem-a-pandemia,https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/business/2020/08/17/servidores-e-militares-ainda-estao-com-r-9-5-milhoes-do-auxilio-emergencial,,,,,,,,,,,,,

United Kingdom,Reach Data unit,Small,Participant,David Dubas-Fisher,"  I started work as a sport data journalist for the Reach Data Unit in 2013. Back then I thought it’d be six months, tops, before I ran out of ideas of how to turn spreadsheets of old football results and league tables into stories. Seven years later I’m still here and still producing stories based on data. But while I still do the odd article on head-to-head stats or how many points you need to avoid relegation, I also do my own research and collect my own data sets. One such example is my State of Football Finance project, which required me to manually go through over 200 sets of company accounts and record the data. There was also the away ticket project which required me to log the prices charged for every Championship away ticket last season. Sadly this project never saw light of day due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It’s through this kind of investigation and data analysis though that allows us to provide sport stories that look at what’s happening in football away from the pitch.   ","  My first submission is the State of Football Finance project. Football finances don’t get many fans’ hearts racing, but the covid pandemic has shown just how vital they are for a club’s continued success. Performing well off the pitch helps clubs perform well on it. Clubs publish their accounts on the Companies House website as PDFs. However, that format means finding key data is tricky for the average fan, and comparing to other clubs or previous years is impossible. The State of Football Finance project made this data more accessible to fans. To do this I first had to learn how to read company accounts. I then collected the data manually by reading the accounts of every club in the top two divisions of English football going back four years. That worked out at over 232 sets of accounts. I then helped design the gadget which displays the data to readers. Using the data collected I have been able to produce a number of articles about football finances, two of which I have included for your consideration in links one and two of the form.          My second submission is an episode of the North In Numbers podcast which I guest hosted. In this episode I looked into the health of Northern football clubs, discussing how clubs in the lower tier face financial oblivion unless they get promoted, while those in the top are taking over the world. This is link three in my submission form.          Racism is a growing problem in football, as my third submission (link four) revealed. I submitted an FOI to police forces up and down the country to find the number of racist incidents at football matches which were reported to the police. The investigation found that such incidents had doubled in four years.         Football agents are legally allowed to represent all three different parties in a transfer - the buying club, the selling club, and the player. That doesn’t stop the practice being controversial though. In fact, FIFA are planning on banning it. The FA handily publishes a list of all transfers involving agents which - after much work to convert it to an analysable format - I interrogated to see just how prevalent the controversial practice is in English football.          The covid-19 pandemic has meant that English football clubs are playing behind closed doors. This comes at a huge financial cost to clubs. Using figures from club accounts I was able to work out how much every game played behind closed doors costs clubs in terms of lost revenue. This is in link six.          The compacted football calendar was a source of concern for managers, many of whom felt that the lack of rest between games put the wellbeing of their players at risk. I analysed the calendar to work out how many days rest players got on average and how it compared to previous seasons. Project link seven.          Another debate regarding player welfare was the possible reintroduction of five substitutes compared to the usual three. Managers of clubs with lesser financial resources were less keen on the idea though, fearful that richer clubs had more world class talent to call upon. I gathered data on every club’s sub bench for all league matches this season and cross reference that with player market values from a third party site to show just how much of a discrepancy there was, with some clubs’ benches being valued at six times less than others. Link eight.         Link nine - most expensive shirts   Link 10 - North/South season ticket divide ",https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/stoke-city-accounts-finances-ffp-4287338,https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/newcastle-united-missing-out-over-18956460,https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/north-numbers-podcast-episode-six-17748392,https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/racist-incidents-football-matches-doubled-21202692,https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/football/hull-city-wigan-lopes-transfer-4294648,https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/sport/leeds-united/eye-watering-cost-playing-behind-18958757,https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/chelsea-advantage-premier-league-tottenham-19347392,https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/benches-premier-leagues-richest-clubs-19398834,https://www.lancs.live/sport/football/football-news/premier-league-kits-burnley-liverpool-18781253,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d34Lj0TplFiEKIJiavmyKr9N4E-7etHS/view?usp=sharing,,,,,,,,

Brazil,"Fiquem Sabendo, CNN Brasil, Abraji, FGV-EAESP",Small,Participant,Disclosing massive ammounts of data to improve journalism in Brazil,"  I am a proven leader in the intersection between journalism and transparency in Brazil and believe that the more citizens know about the government's decisions that affect them, the stronger our democracy will be. My articles have concretely helped governments to<a href=""https://educacao.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,denuncia-do-estado-faz-prefeitura-abrir-nova-licitacao-e-economizar-r-15-2-mi,1608767""> save money</a> (R$ 15 million, after I revealed that a government contract had winners before the bid was set),<a href=""https://sao-paulo.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,prefeitura-exonera-funcionaria-apos-reportagem-do-estado,70002051157""> remove public servants who performed illegal acts</a> (revealing that a public servant hired her own company for public service),<a href=""https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/nacional/2020/09/15/apos-reportagem-da-cnn-empresa-de-taxi-aereo-e-primeira-a-ser-cassada-no-pais""> </a><a href=""https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/publicos/governo-vai-proteger-identidade-de-quem-pede-informacoes-publicas/"">influenced the shape of transparency policies</a> (revealing how São Paulo’s City Hall <a href=""https://sao-paulo.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,doria-demite-chefe-de-gabinete-que-dificultava-transparencia-na-prefeitura,70002076541"">used journalists data to hide public documents</a> and then it was used by the federal government as example to allow anonymous requests) and <a href=""https://politica.estadao.com.br/noticias/eleicoes,maior-rede-pro-bolsonaro-do-facebook-e-excluida-apos-denuncia-do-estado,70002558430"">revealed to Facebook the most influential disinformation network in Brazil during the 2018 elections</a>, with 12 million daily interactions (Facebook removed the pages after it was published).     Beyond doing such work for the most influential news outlets in Brazil, I’ve been leading initiatives to improve public transparency and put a spotlight on the use of public money. I'm a co-founder of<a href=""https://fiquemsabendo.com.br/faca-parte/""> Fiquem Sabendo</a>, an agency with a R$ 250,000 annual budget and 10 professionals that disclose public data to support journalists, researchers and lawyers, with 5,000+ qualified subscribers (senior professionals and public sector leaders). I send daily information requests to public agencies with the support of my team, analyze the data received and then simplify it <a href=""https://fiquemsabendo.substack.com/"">in a newsletter</a>. Our impact is huge on both mainstream and regional media outlets in Brazil, with <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02IQFJya8GliIJS2zEJyWqMuFH9Sw%3A1602821072420&ei=0BuJX8iTGai-5OUP_s6AgAk&q=%22fiquem+sabendo%22+%2B+%22lei+de+acesso+%C3%A0+informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%22+-fiquemsabendo.com.br+-fiquemsabendo.substack.com&oq=%22fiquem+sabendo%22+%2B+%22lei+de+acesso+%C3%A0+informa%C3%A7%C3%A3o%22+-fiquemsabendo.com.br+-fiquemsabendo.substack.com&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCCMQrgIQJ1CnG1iNSmDGS2gBcAB4AIABuwKIAas4kgEJMS4zNy4xMC4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBB8ABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjIu6PlnbjsAhUoH7kGHX4nAJAQ4dUDCA0&uact=5"">more than 1,000 articles published</a> since 2019 using it as a source.     My work also makes governments more transparent. A good example was when I published, for the first time, all <a href=""https://fiquemsabendo.substack.com/p/aps-denncia-da-fiquem-sabendo-governo-17d"">payments to thousands of pensioners in Brazil over the past 100 years</a>. They are relatives of federal civil servants who are entitled to a lifetime payment because of the family relationship, with payments up to R$ 30,000 monthly. From this revelation, that came into public after our lawyer put a lawsuit, I and another director mobilized journalists from all over Brazil to research the data and they found, for example, <a href=""https://apublica.org/2020/01/as-pensoes-vitalicias-dos-acusados-de-crimes-na-ditadura/"">life pensions paid to military agents accused of having committed crimes in the dictatorship</a>. They also found <a href=""https://piaui.folha.uol.com.br/pensao-de-107-anos/#:~:text=Foi%20a%20pens%C3%A3o%20mais%20longeva,108%20anos%2C%20em%20S%C3%A3o%20Lu%C3%ADs"">a person who received pension for 107 years.</a>      My leadership has been recognized in different situations in 2020. I became the youngest Abraji director, a R$ 2 million annual budget entity that led the fight for the approval of Access to Information Law in Brazil. My responsibility in the organization goes from educating the next generation of investigative journalists by conducting <a href=""https://twitter.com/toledoluizf/status/1304488352234852354"">courses</a> to 10,000+ journalists/year to monitoring transparency by editing <a href=""https://www.abraji.org.br/noticias/sao-paulo-abre-dados-sobre-pedidos-e-respostas-via-lai"">reports on government’s open data that shape public policy change</a>. I also became the first Brazilian member of the <a href=""https://www.occrp.org/en/about-us"">OCCRP</a>, an international investigative reporting platform for a worldwide network of independent media centers and journalists and my job is to find out stories concerning international crime and corruption and connect the best Brazilian journalists with our team.  ","In 2020 I have worked on some of the most impactful projects of my career so far. Here are some projects: - Me and my team at Fiquem Sabendo revealed, for the first time in 100 years, who are the thousands of pensionists in Brazil and how much public funds they receive from the federal government, after 3 years we've put a lawsuit against the federal government and then spent months organizing 27GB of data to disclose it to the public. Pensionists are relatives of civil or military public servants that receive a lifetime payment that can go up to R$ 30,000 monthly (the same amount paid to the president of Brazil). In 25 years, the federal government spent almost R$ 500 billion (US$ 100 billion) with them. The impact was huge and dozens of stories have been published by some of the most important news outlets in Brazil (Estadão, Piauí, Gazeta do Povo, SBT, Band, among many others), revealing military servants who receive money even after being accused of torturing people, people who received a pension for more than 100 years, etc. More than 100 articles were published in print, online and TV media using our database. - Me and my team at CNN Brasil (and after that, in a separate article, at Fiquem Sabendo) revealed how the government bought overpriced chloroquine to fight Covid-19 even after many scientific studies show that there is no evidence of its benefits for patients. To do so we had to scrape data from the Federal Gazette in the past 10 years and see how much the Our stories were very impactful and led to investigations against the chief of the Army, the minister of defense and the minister of health. There is also a request for a comission of inquiry in the congress after our story was published. - Fiquem Sabendo, a project that I co-founded, disclosed more than 160 different databases and documents in 2020 and we were quoted as the main source of more than 500 articles in 2020, from small newsrooms in north and northeast of the country to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/?edition-redirect=br), a huge impact for a very small project with people working part-time on it. - I have leaded a project, at Fiquem Sabendo, with the support of ICFJ, to teach how to use access to information law in Brazil and comparing it to the US FOIA. We've published interviews and tutorials for 4 months in our website - https://ijnet.org/en/node/9253 - As Abraji director, the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism, I have denounced monthly the lack of data about Covid-19, produced reports both in Sao Paulo and Brasilia (Brazil's capital) and revealed that the Ministry of Health stopped answering public FOIA requests using the same legal argument (but ilegally). After I published it in Abraji's website, they started to answer the requests again - https://abraji.org.br/noticias/ministerio-da-saude-volta-a-atender-pedidos-de-informacao-apos-seis-meses-de-recusas I was also responsible for writing Abraji's annual report on transparency, focusing on São Paulo, and revealed that governor Joao Doria is ignoring half of the health FOIA requests during the pandemic and some requests take 1 year to be answered - https://www.abraji.org.br/noticias/secretaria-da-saude-de-sp-atrasa-mais-da-metade-dos-pedidos-feitos-pela-lai-durante-a-pandemia / https://www.abraji.org.br/noticias/sao-paulo-abre-dados-sobre-pedidos-e-respostas-via-lai / https://www.abraji.org.br/publicacoes/relatorio-de-descumprimento-da-lai-no-estado-de-sao-paulo As a researcher, I have revealed, in a scientific article, with the support of another researcher (Marcio Cunha) that the Brazilian government is hiding 100,000 documents in 2020, more than ever, with the legal excuses of ""protecting the state"". It had a good repercussion in media - http://bibliotecadigital.fgv.br/ojs/index.php/cadernosebape/article/view/82160 / https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/gestao-politica-e-sociedade/sem-controles-efetivos-orgaos-federais-mantem-mais-de-100-mil-informacoes-sob-segredo/ - I also offered more than 20 workshops for journalists about access to information, data and investigative journalism in 2020.

Thailand,"Punch Up World Co. Ltd., in the name of ELECT",Small,Participant,ELECT," ELECT is a civic tech platform for Thailand’s election and democracy, founded in late 2018 by a group of journalists, designers, and developers, aiming to provide useful data and information about the electoral system and the democratic ideas to the public, especially the young generation. For almost 2 years, adopting our expertise in data, technology, storytelling and design, we have created new data-driven media to strengthen public understanding of the country’s up-to-date political and democratic events, while encouraging civil engagement in constructive debates equipped with accurate information and context. We also support organizations and individuals, who are also working on the same topics to strengthen civil movement. As a civic tech, we strongly believe that the ideal democratic mechanism should get participated, contributed and owned by people. "," In 2020, we have launched several projects relating to Thailand's constitution which is a vital issue in our country, as well as a legacy of the coup that was in power for a long time in the history. Here are some selected projects.   Since May 2020 marked the 6th anniversary of the 2014 Thai coup d'état, we have launched 2 projects relating to the event : <a href=""https://couphistory.elect.in.th"">Coup Democracy</a> and <a href=""https://coupevents.elect.in.th"">Before the Coup</a>. We have researched, digitised and analyzed piles of information about the coup d'état from the beginning of Thailand’s democracy. We have portrayed history as a timeline going forward, when democracy took place, and backward, if the dictatorship gained power. Then, all Thais realized that we haven’t moved that far from the beginning.    Another aspect that may be linked to NCPO’s or the coup legacy is the overwhelming roles and powers of the military. After the 2014 coup, the key policy of the state enterprise reform under the leadership of PM General Prayut Chan-o-cha was to appoint new former-military committees in state enterprises with so-called announcement. So we have gathered and analyzed data relating to this issue and featured in <a href=""https://elect.in.th/coup-board"">The Coup and State Enterprise</a>.   Then, 24 June marked the 88th anniversary of the bloodless Siamese revolution, led by the People’s Party, making Thailand transformed into a constitutional monarchy. Not only democracy, but also many cultural heritages have been left by the People’s Party. But some have been forgotten, some have been demolished, while most are not protected by the law. The heritages have been listed in documents, not often seen by the public. So, on the anniversary, we decided to digitize and visualize them on <a href=""https://elect.in.th/khanarat-legacy-map"">The People Party’s Legacy Map</a>, making the heritages more accessible and relatable. Also, we have opened the platform for additional information from the audiences, encouraging them to be a part of the legacy.   Besides, due to the cabinet change during the middle of the year, we have digged into historical and personal data of the cabinet members, dating back for 20 years, starting from the great economic crisis in 1997. We have analyzed them based on different groups of power and featured in <a href=""https://elect.in.th/cabinet-dynasty"">The Cabinet Dynasty</a>. So many times the cabinet seat becomes a bargaining tool in politics allocated between groups of power, which affects the government’s stability and this dataset possibly proves that idea.   Apart from tracing the politicians, in October, there’s an anniversary commemoration of the 6 October event, or the Thammasat Massacre. With the information from Documentation of Oct 6 (doct6.com), we have created the campaign #Oct6onthisday (<a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Oct6onthisday"">https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Oct6onthisday</a>, <a href=""https://web.facebook.com/hashtag/oct6onthisday"">https://web.facebook.com/hashtag/oct6onthisday</a>) to make this memory not forgotten. With the concept ‘what if there were social media on October 6, 1976,’ then we posted every single event in real-like time. Moreover, we have also visualized key locations where events took place on <a href=""https://elect.in.th/oct6"">Oct 6 Story Map</a> to make them related to real life.   And during the last months of 2020, the Constitution became the main focus of Thailand's politics, so we developed and launched 2 projects. The first is <a href=""https://elect.in.th/con-vote/"">Live Con Vote Count</a> to see how the senate and the MPs vote about the consitution amendment. The latter is <a href=""https://recon.elect.in.th/"">Re-Constitution</a> to digitize, simplify, analyze and visualize Thailand's 20 constitutions into a digital platform where audiences can learn, understand and compare them more easily, leading to better and inclusive discussion in the society.

China,Fenghuo Datanews Technology Ltd.；Tencent；Meetyou APP；the Paper,Big,Participant,Fenghuo Datanews Technology Ltd.," Founded on Christmas in 2019, our team is an independent and small-sized newsroom focusing on data news and visualization, and has rich experience in data news production, which is one of the few professional institutions in China. We are a team with international vision and standards. Our team members include outstanding journalists and designers from China and France, and researchers from the top universities in China. We have experience in customizing and producing data works for national media and our works are well received by the co-operate media and the market.     "," I am the team leader of the project. In recent years, China's fertility rate is gradually declining. Our report focused on the current situation of Chinese women who are preparing for pregnancy, especially those who have difficulties in it. In the article published on Tencent, we found that during the isolation period of the COVID 19 pandemic, the number of women preparing for pregnancy was increasing rapidly, but the success rate was not satisfactory, and what’s worse, the situation was more serious in Beijing and other first-tier cities. In the article published in the paper, we explored the variables that could affect women's pregnancy preparation and decision, and in the co-production project with the Meetyou app, we further observed the efforts made by the difficult pregnancy group to have a baby. It is worth mentioning that our insights are all based on the data provided by an app that records data on millions of women's physiological situations, which is very rare now when the public second-hand data is more commonly used as a reference for reporting. All the reports were published on the influential we media platform in China, and received more than ten thousand reading and attention.

United Kingdom,"JPIMedia, Radar AI",Big,Participant,Harriet Clugston," I began my journalism career in August 2017 as a trainee multimedia reporter at a small newspaper, the Hertfordshire Mercury. I arrived down a non-traditional route, without the usual qualifications - I had not studied journalism or taken a National Council for the Training of Journalists course. In my early days, with no contacts and inexperience on my side, I found open data a great way to generate stories. I would read national newspapers for data-driven stories that I could try to track down figures for and localise. I learned firsthand however how difficult it can be for stretched local news journalists to find the time to get to grips with and interrogate data when faced with day-to-day news cycle demands within a shrinking workforce.   From here I moved onto a role as data journalist for Radar AI, the Press Association’s local data news agency. Here I learned to use Natural Language Generation software to produce data-driven stories on a mass scale for hardpressed newsrooms across the UK. I found open data, nosed out stories, cleaned and analysed datasets and fed the figures into the NLG CMS where I wrote conditional scripts that would cover every scenario the data could throw up for each local area within the dataset. That could range from 43 police forces in England and Wales, to 350 lower-tier local authorities, generating a story for each locality that would then go out to hundreds of clients. I stayed at Radar for more than two years, rising to senior reporter after one year, before taking up a new position as data and investigations editor at JPIMedia, where I have been since October. During that time I won data journalist of the year at the Regional Press Awards for a portfolio of stories which included reports on failures by local authorities – and in particular the private companies they employ –  to carry out safeguarding interviews for children who go missing from care, and on allegations of abuse of vulnerable patients within care homes.    I am not a data scientist and do not pretend to have training and skills to that effect – I am a journalist with a strong local and national news sense who can mine data for the nugget of a story, contextualise it and present it in compelling copy that tells the reader the human story behind the numbers. With this approach, I’ve made use of the vast and underutilized wealth of open data in the UK to provide public interest journalism to newsrooms up and down the country – both while at Radar, where I would generate hundreds of ready-to-print stories at one time, and now at JPIMedia, where I distribute data and copy to all our 100+ titles and support newsrooms with data journalism and their coronavirus coverage. In the past four months that I have been with JPI I have turned towards data visualisation tools for the first time, using Flourish to create a wide range of charts to illustrate my stories and bring data to life for readers.   I believe I should be considered for this award based on the strength of my data-driven portfolio, the breadth of my reach and track record bringing high quality and impactful data stories to underserved communities, and the fact that I have done so without any formal training in data journalism. "," Data journalism exploded into every newsroom in 2020, with many unprepared journalists having to adapt to serve an increasingly data literate audience. With coronavirus case and death statistics coming thick and fast, I have tried to deliver data-driven stories that approach the pandemic from an angle, contextualising the impact of the health emergency on different groups and communities.    This has included:  <ul>    An analysis of NHS data that showed referrals to mental health services had fallen by 57% in April, as medics and charities warned people were struggling to access support during a time of increased stress and anxiety        An analysis of cuts to local authority public health budgets in the years leading up to the pandemic and how this could have weakened councils’ preparedness to respond       Exploring the prevalence of overcrowding in each council area in England and Wales at the start of the first national lockdown, and the challenges it presented for poorer households trying to follow self-isolation guidance       An overview of existing understaffing of children’s social services amid concerns the pandemic would only make children more vulnerable       An analysis of the use of zero hours contracts among care workers, and unions’ fears that it could prevent staff self-isolating       Analysis of the number of retail jobs lost in every council area in Great Britain, as news broke of the collapse of Debenhams and Arcadia (this threw up some interesting lines in local areas, such as a surge in jobs in bakeries and butchers in Yorkshire)    </ul>  The story I was proudest of in 2020 however was a national story I wrote for the Press Association on domestic abuse. I was trawling through a large NHS dataset on hospital admissions due to an external cause. While reading through the list of diagnosis codes, one caught my eye –  ‘Y07 - Other maltreatment’. After looking up the code in the International Classification Disease dictionary I discovered this was a category that encompassed domestic and sexual abuse. Analysis of the figures showed admissions among female patients had increased by a third in five years, and it was the second most common cause of female assault admissions. Meanwhile admissions of women for rape and sexual assaults had increased by 89%. When I spoke to domestic violence charities, it transpired they had not been aware this data existed, and the story I wrote was an exclusive and broke new ground. Once published, the story generated a lot of interest among domestic violence organisations, women’s charities, and the Victim’s Commissioner for England and Wales. The charities believed the figures strengthened the case for independent domestic violence advisors (IDVAs) in hospitals, as medics were clearly routinely encountering abuse victims. I have since returned to this topic and I am now undertaking a more indepth project, using FOI requests to obtain data at a hospital trust level and to gather new statistics on how widespread the use of IDVAs is at present.   Please note that many stories do not carry my byline as Radar was a news agency. I can provide screenshots/downloads direct from Radar’s wire service however of the original article with my byline. I have selected 'big organisation' as JPIMedia is a large organisation however the bulk of the work I have submitted was produced at Radar, which was a team of fewer than 10.

Brazil,Colaboradados,Small,Participant,Judite Cypreste," I have 27 years and 4 years of experience as a data journalist in Brazil. During that time, I was responsible for producing several journalistic investigations and also teaching other people techniques for analyzing and scraping data. In my career, I have always tried to teach the little I knew, which also made me learn a lot. I am constantly called upon to give free lectures and courses, which I do with pleasure. Through an initiative created by me, the Colaboradados platform, I write tutorials and teach programming techniques for free to people. I believe I should win this award for also representing a minority in the country: that of a female data journalist. In my country, the area is predominantly male and it is not uncommon to suffer prejudices about my abilities just because I am a woman. Winning this award will be the valorization of my work not only as a data journalist, but as someone who tries at all times to bring data journalism to everyone's teaching and knowledge. "," I have been a data journalist since 2018, with a primary focus on public administration data. I am currently a producer at GloboNews, a large Brazilian television journalism company, where I focus on the production of guidelines that use data crossing, mainly those made available by public entities.   I am also the director and co-founder of Colaboradados, a collaborative vehicle on government transparency and data journalism in Brazil. In the project, I built several ways of approaching these issues and making them more palatable for civil society, having been cited as a reference for opening data in the Open Data Project of CGU (Comptroller General of the Union), the Federal Government agency responsible for the defense of public assets, transparency and the fight against corruption   In the project, we publish reports that address topics on the issue of open data in Brazil. In one of these reports, we showed how government websites in cities in the state of Alagoas were encrypting currencies on users' computers. In another, we investigated how several transparency portals in Brazilian municipalities had devices that allowed adding, modifying and even deleting public data. This second report was a reason for mobilization within the Brazilian Public Ministry that began to map other sites that had the same vulnerability elsewhere in Brazil.   I was also responsible for creating and programming a bot that monitors when government portals are unavailable to public access. The robot, known as @colabora_bot on Twitter, notifies its followers whenever these portals are not accessible and requests that society covers the maintenance of public entities. The way the bot practices monitoring governmental portals has reverberated internationally, and the project was one of the finalists in the world's largest data journalism award, the Sigma Awards.   Through my work with Colaboradados, since February 2019 I have been more closely monitoring the problem of making public data available to society. From formats that do not work to simple information that is not available, the public administration has several problems in making public data available, which harms not only the work of journalists but the idea of ​​monitoring society for the public.   I also spent time at UOL, in 2019, another great Brazilian journalism vehicle. There, my mission was two: to produce guidelines with data and also to make the rest of the newsroom understand what data journalism was. It was on UOL that I wrote reports as an analysis in which it shows how Oscar always gave preference to men in his awards and how the faces of the first victims of the coronavirus in Brazil were, highlighting the stories behind the numbers of the pandemic.   Finally, I also worked as a fact-checker at the Aos Fatos agency. There, I was responsible for spearheading a journalistic investigation in an attempt to understand how the works promised by the Brazilian government were after 4 years of the 2014 World Cup in the country. In the middle of this investigation, the government decided to take the data on the subject from the air, in an attempt to censor our report. Then using the means of scraping and analyzing data, we continue the investigation and warn against censorship. Later, I managed to get the data back to the population.

Indonesia,Katadata,Small,Participant,Katadata," Dear Juries of the 2021 Sigma Awards   The digital era has brought about major changes in the communication process and information dissemination around the world. There is much information, which anyone can create, and it spread massively and widely in line with the strengthening role of technology companies and social media.   However, this condition also causes a lot of disinformation and false information (hoax) in society. This post-truth era is a real challenge for journalists and the media industry to convey information based on data and facts and uphold journalism standards.   In Indonesia, the presence of digital news media also adds to the flood of information in society. The media are competing to get “clicks” and be the fastest in delivering information by sometimes ignoring the check and confirmation process and neglecting the depth of data and facts. The media also often amplifies the statements of interested parties, but sometimes it contradicts the reality.   As the name implies, “kata” (mean  word ) and “data,” Katadata is committed to presenting information to the public based on facts and data. Since our establishment in 2012, we have built a newsroom that quotes our sources' statements and verifies their statements with data. We have formed a research and data team to strengthen our editors' work so that the public can get comprehensive information from various sides.   Misinformation and hoaxes are also increasingly prevalent during the current pandemic due to limited direct interaction and increased access to digital media. This condition will undoubtedly complicate the handling of the pandemic, including vaccinations and economic recovery.   For this reason, Katadata.co.id, through the Katadata News Lab, has created many data-based news contents related to the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia. The goal is to provide clear and complete information based on coverage and interviews, research, and data analysis to the public.   Katadata's founders are journalists who have experience in various major news media in Indonesia, such as Metta Dharmasaputra. He has a career as a journalist for more than 20 years at Bisnis Indonesia and Majalah Tempo and wrote books on investigative coverage and journalism data concerning tax cases and bank closures in Indonesia. We also have Yura Syahrul, the Chief Editor of Katadata, who has been a journalist for 20 years in Tempo Group and Harian Kontan.   Katadata editorial staff are also experienced journalists from various major news media in Indonesia. In 2018, Katadata formed the Katadata News Lab. It accommodates journalists, researchers, data scientists, graphic and multimedia designers, and IT developers to collaborate and focus on developing data journalism. Currently, Katadata publishes data-journalism contents every day in various forms. "," Katadata submitted three Data Journalism works in this competition. All talk about the Covid-19 pandemic and its handling in Indonesia. However, they have different characteristics and challenges in their work process. We attach translations of the three projects in a <a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Jpsy76Smfsgz3eXWtsvAE-gDKCUY_cB9?usp=sharing"">Google Drive link</a>.    1. <a href=""https://katadata.co.id/timdatajournalism/analisisdata/5ecb63ef78264/asal-usul-virus-corona-masuk-ke-indonesia"">The Origin of Coronavirus in Indonesia</a>   <ul>   The objectives and hypotheses:   </ul>  The objective is to explore how the coronavirus entered Indonesia for the first time and how it mutated. The hypothesis is that the virus may have entered Indonesia in early 2020, or before the government officially announced the first case in March 2020. This delay could cause Indonesia to be late and not ready to handle the pandemic early on.  <ul>   The work process:   </ul>  This article was compiled based on the coronavirus's genome data from Indonesia, which was sent to GISAID. The greatest challenge in compiling this article was reading the sequencing of the coronavirus genome. Since there is so much data available, we have to sort them first. We also interviewed experts who could explain how GISAID works and the coronavirus genome sequencing mechanism.  <ul>   The impact:   </ul>  This article received positive responses, including from the new Health Minister Budi Sadikin. In a meeting, he quoted the contents of this article regarding the virus transmission process. This article has been read 56,779 times since it was first published on May 22, 2020. It received 31,173 reach on Facebook and 26,076 impressions on Twitter.    2. <a href=""https://katadata.co.id/safrezifitra/analisisdata/5f474f0156752/tumpulnya-jurus-3t-melawan-covid-19-di-indonesia"">Indonesia's Ineffective ""3T Protocols"" Against COVID-19</a>   <ul>   The objectives and hypotheses:   </ul>  This article wants to highlight the government's performance in dealing with the pandemic, which has been going on for six months. The hypothesis is that the government has not succeeded in suppressing Covid-19 positive cases. It is based on data about the Covid-19 case in Indonesia and its comparison with cases in other countries. The assessment standard refers to the three ways of handling a pandemic: Testing, Tracing, and Treatment (3T).  <ul>   The work process:   </ul>  In preparing this article, we organized a webinar featuring several experts to discuss the 3T implementation. The main challenge in covering the Covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia is the lack of transparency in government data. We had to explore the unorganized data from ministries and then verify it with other information gathered from fieldwork.  <ul>   The impact:   </ul>  This article received sufficient response from readers, especially on social media, who questioned the government's performance. This article has been read 4,396 times since it was first published on August 27, 2020. It received 2,363 reach on Facebook and 31,320 impressions on Twitter.    3. <a href=""https://katadata.co.id/sampah-jakarta"">Plastic Waste Flood during the Pandemic</a>   <ul>   The objectives and hypotheses:   </ul>  This article focuses on waste production, especially plastic and medical waste, during the Covid-19 pandemic. This article hypothesizes an increase in household waste production and trade in line with restrictions on social activities. On the other hand, the ability to sort and process waste is still deficient, resulting in waste accumulation.  <ul>   The work process:   </ul>  This project consists of three parts and involves a sizeable team, including research teams, graphic designers, and IT. Lack of waste data from the government is one of the challenges, especially regarding the pandemic. We tried to find the data from various sources and submit it to the data team for processing.  <ul>   The impact:   </ul>  This project received a good response from readers, especially on social media. This article has been read 8,522 times since it was first published on December 2, 2020. It received 16,076 reach on Facebook and 12,715 impressions on Twitter.

Hungary,"ATLO, Átlátszó",Small,Participant,Krisztián Szabó," I am Krisztián Szabó, a data journalist from Budapest, Hungary. I work at Hungarian investigative newsroom Átlátszó, and its subdivision ATLO, the first Hungarian team dedicated only to visual journalism and interactive graphic content production.   Before March 2020, I had minimal connection to statistics, excel sheets or visualization tools. As part of my university curriculum, I attended a course that introduced me to the world of data journalism. My lecturer, Attila Bátorfy, is a data journalist at Átlátszó and the founder of ATLO, and based on my remarkable projects created during the course, he offered me the chance to continue working in the data journalism area with him.   In the past months, we have worked on multiple big projects together, including the internationally acclaimed Koronamonitor, which is a site dedicated to tracking the coronavirus through charts and maps in Hungary. Moreover, I was in a fortunate position to work on multiple collaborative projects with other companies and governmental institutions. We have created projects for the Municipality of Budapest (which is the capital city of our country), and for the Hungarian website of Radio Free Europe. I have also attended data journalism conferences both as audience and speaker.   When I start a new project, i try to incorporate a new method I have in mind. I aim to include more and more custom-built codes to the projects I am working on, as custom solutions both have a virtually nonexistent tradition in Hungary and it is an international standard, mostly in Western countries. For these projects, coding is preceded by a learning stage, since I have no official education in computer studies. I am intrigued by the technical choices that big newsrooms (such as The New York Times or Reuters) incorporate into their data projects. These give me inspiration and I try to understand them (and reproduce the basic mechanics) as much as I can. One of these is the scrollytelling method, which is both popular and easily consumable for the readers.   My ideas mostly come from current topics public life, although I rarely have time to bring these ideas to life. We have more requests for big project collaborations, and since ATLO is a project only run by two people (Attila and me), I have limited time left to realise other projects. Nonetheless, whenever I have some spare time, I look for articles with interesting approaches at visualizing data and I try to understand them, learn from them, replicate the codes from them.   With my submission, I wish to apply for the Young Talent category.  ","The projects I included in this application are the projects I worked on during the second half of 2020. Határon túli utcanevek Magyarországon (Over-the-border city names on Hungarian street-plates): My first project (that started out as a university project at the data journalism course) was published in the beginning of June 2020. It compiled street names in Hungary that were named after cities over the borders of Hungary, in the neighboring countries. It was visualizing a sort of national heritage, showing that even though the Kingdom of Hungary was broken up into several countries after the First World War, there is a solid connection between these areas, which is even visible on street-plates. The project got a larger than average feedback on social media, resulting in it being the most-viewed project of 2020 up to that point. Because of how well the project resonated with the audience, we received an offer from the Budapest City Archives to recreate this project but focusing only on the capital city. The data collection was done manually by the Archives's employees, and the whole site was created by me, utilizing custom coding and Mapbox tutorials. The resulting project (Határon túli helységneveket őrző közterületnevek Budapesten (Over-the-border city names on Budapest street-plates)) received national feedback, appearing in not only online news sites, but on the National Television as well. There was another inquiry from the Municipality of Budapest for 20th August, our national holiday (Befogadó Budapest (Inclusive Budapest). It was to create a video, showing how people from previously Hungarian areas migrated to Hungary after the Treaty of Trianon. This was based on a project Attila Bátofy had worked on before, though the majority of the work (creating the video) was recorded and cut by me. The website where it was uploaded later was also my task to create. For the launch of Fadio Free Hungary's Hungarian website in September, we have created a visualization, showing the past 30 years of the Hungarian Parliament (Parlament 30 (Parliament 30)). The charts themselves were created in Flourish, but the part that made it stand out from any other project was the scrollytelling method. Previously we have implemented scrollytelling in multiple map-based projects (Over-the-border city names on Budapest street-plates, Két lábbal, két kerékkel, négy kerékkel (On two feet, on two wheels, on four wheels)) and in a fully custom-made project showing the expenses of the past 10 fireworks of the 20th August celebration (named Játék a tűzzel (Playing with fire)), but it was the first time we have connected scrollytelling to Flourish. To perfect it, I have looked for inspiration in Carmen Aguilar García's articles. The site was created in both Hungarian and English, so international audiences can learn the changes that happened in the Hungarian MP system. Both On two feet, on two wheels, on four wheels and Playing with fire are results of my self-taught coding studies. The former was the first actual project where I used any coding, let alone scrollytelling. As simple the project's premise is (showing how far one can get from shire-towns walking, cycling and driving), as difficult the creation was for me, as I had no experience in coding before. I later updated the site to a better working code, but I include the original version as well. The latter was also a scrollytelling project, fully built from the ground up.

Brazil,Fiquem Sabendo,Small,Participant,Maria Vitória Launberg Ramos," I am a 24-year-old journalist-entrepreneur leading Fiquem Sabendo, a media start-up keeping the powerful accountable through FOIA requests. In 2020, as the co-founder and CEO of a data-journalism initiative in Brazil, I have coordinated multiple data-driven projects, edited over 50 exclusive new stories in partnership with Yahoo Brasil, monitored public datasets on socio-environmental issues in a collaborative effort with Transparência Brasil and Abraji.    I am currently on the 2021 cohort of the Product Immersion for Small Newsrooms program at The Newmark Graduate School of Journalism. In 2020 I was part of the United States Department of State's International Visitor Leadership Program for ""Transparency and Accountability in Government"". In 2019, I participated as the leader of Fiquem Sabendo at New Ventures Lab II, an accelerator run by Chicas Poderosas, a global community that promotes female leadership in independent news outlets.   My biggest inspiration is Hans Rosling and GapMinder! Michael Morisy and Muckrock are benchmarks and Repórter Brasil's Slave Labor List is a local example of FOIA's power in Brazil. When talking about mentors there is no one like Léo Arcoverde. I was a 21-year-old student when we decided to take his personal project to the next level. He gave me all the passwords and a free pass: go and try everything, I will be here if you fail. For me, a mentor is someone that shares their confidence in you before you have realized you are capable. On that same page, Mariana Santos has shown me the way to lead as a woman in media. Finally, Adriana Garcia helped me clear the path for real innovation.   Graduated in Journalism from the Faculdade Cásper Líbero, I was a reporter for Ponte Jornalismo, exposing violations of Human Rights by the police and armed forces in Brazil. I am the author of ""Indigentes: the State that buries without warning"", an investigative book that exposes the heartbreaking system that keeps families looking for supposedly missing people for years when they have been buried by the Brazilian government. The book was chosen by the Brazilian Association of Investigative Journalism (Abraji) as one of the best pieces of 2019 and selected for the 4th Conectas Human Rights Fair.   I believe I am a good candidate for this award due to my commitment to push data journalism forward in Latin America, overcoming data censorship, fostering collaboration between journalists, newsrooms, and citizens, and developing a business model for freeing up data in Brazil. ","  Fiquem Sabendo,  cofounder and director    Fiquem Sabendo's mission is to spread access to information and transparency tools in order to promote active oversight of public power, strengthening participatory democracy. We make requests, reports, and lawsuits for access to information with a multidisciplinary team to obtain information of public interest.  We process data and analyze documents and disclose relevant information to society.   We distribute government data to citizens, journalists, researchers, news outlets, activists, and NGOs committed to government transparency, democracy, and Human Rights. Fiquem Sabendo is a data-journalism centered organization and publishes exclusive news stories licensed under Creative Commons CC BY 4.0.    In 2020 I lead a team of 10 people and together we:   - 22 editions of the ""Don't LAI to me"" newsletter with 166 databases and/or unpublished public documents released;   - 49 reports published with new data on Yahoo Br with 300 thousand readers;   - 48 texts, articles, and guides published on the website, which received 48,985 readers in 2020;   - 2,724 requests filed with the federal government;   - Finalists of Livre.jor's ""Jornalismo-Mosca 2020 Award"", with two reports in the main category and three in the university category. We won first place in the main category with the ""pensioners case"" and in the university category with a report on eviction actions in São Paulo during the pandemic;   - Finalists in the Open Data category of the Cláudio Weber Abramo Award for Data Journalism, also with the case of federal government pension payments;   - 21 workshops/lectures held, for hundreds of people in several Brazilian states, in addition to participation in international events.    Product Manager,  20 years of darkness: shedding light on government pensions in Brazil     For over a century Brazilian taxpayers have given a blank check for the government to use on pensions for public servants with no oversight. For three years Fiquem Sabendo battled in the Supreme Audit Institution of Brazil,  pressuring for access to historical records. In 2020 we won, freeing 26 years' worth of data about payments. The whole process of cleaning, analyzing, uploading the data online, identified issues, and correcting the official database by collaborating with the Ministry of Economy was coordinated by myself. I then organized a pool of journalists to produce stories and gave free access to our tool for everyone.    -o take these historical findings to the broader public, I coordinated a collaborative task force with four journalists to produce stories from the dataset. Lucio Vaz (Gazeta do Povo), Eduardo Barretto (Época), Bruno Fonseca (Agência Pública), and Taís Seibt (Fiquem Sabendo/Yahoo) worked for over a month with our team to find scoops. Agência Pública, for example, found that hundreds of officers accused of torture during the dictatorship have been receiving lifetime pensions from the government. Over a year since the data was released by our small independent team, it is still being used by many major news outlets (Google ""Fiquem Sabendo"" ""pensionistas""). Even president Bolsonaro tried to weigh in the situation by falsely claiming on social media he was the one to order the release of the dataset. The House of Representatives leader condemned the pensions.

United States,ProPublica,Big,Participant,Moiz Syed," I was originally drawn to data journalism because of its ability to rigorously document our world, putting large amounts of information into the hands of the public. As reporters, I believe one of the most important services we can provide is unearthing and communicating data that empowers readers to understand what is shaping their lives, and act on it.   Historically, some of the most inspirational and effective advocates for communicating information in the public interest have at heart been data reporters -- figures like W.E.B. Du Bois and Ida B. Wells. The work of heroes like these ran counter to power structures of the time, and sparked revolutionary change that had direct benefits for the lives of Americans. Today, I think the best of our efforts share some of the same goals that they had: accessibility, equity, accountability, and free, actionable data.   I came to journalism from working within the tech space, including at the Wikimedia foundation, which runs Wikipedia. This job taught me how important journalism’s role is in our society, as Wikipedia itself cannot be written without good journalism as its primary source. I decided to move into journalism from there, starting at The Intercept in 2016 as a data journalist and designer. When a position opened up in ProPublica’s News Applications team in 2019, I jumped at the chance to be part of a team whose core mission was discovering, vetting, and freeing large datasets to help readers understand what their governments were doing and keep them accountable.   Data journalism has given me a chance to use my academic and professional background in design, data analysis and computer science to tell powerful visual and data-driven stories. As I continue my career, my hope is to continue to learn and grow from a field that cares deeply about free information, and serves its readers with rigorous, empowering storytelling. ","  Coronavirus Contracts: Tracking Federal Purchases to Fight the Pandemic    This project was built over the course of a few weeks during the early days pandemic in the U.S., tracking how the federal government was spending money to combat the virus. We designed a searchable database to allow readers to explore who the U.S. government was buying from, what it was buying and how much it was paying. This news application became an engine for many ProPublica stories throughout this year investigating the government’s COVID response contracting apparatus.   My role in the project was design, development and data analysis. I collaborated with my colleague, Derek Willis, to build the app, with him leading data analysis and me leading design.    Tracking PPP Loans: Search Every Company Approved for Federal Loans Over $150k    This news app tracks the almost 5 million loans that the federal government distributed as part of the first phase of the Paycheck Protection Program. Readers can search the app for PPP loans by organization, lender, zip code or business type.   My role in the project was design, development and data analysis. I again worked with my colleague, Derek Willis, who led data cleaning and analysis while I designed and built the app.    The NYPD Files: Search Thousands of Civilian Complaints Against New York City Police Officers    This project published a searchable database of disciplinary records of almost four thousand NYPD police officers. Soon after New York state repealed a law that kept police disciplinary records a secret, ProPublica obtained those records from the civilian board that investigates the NYPD and decided to publish them. The design and development of this project happened, under tremendous pressure, in just over a few days as NYPD unions were suing to block the city from making this data public.   My role in this project was design, development and data analysis. My colleague, Derek Willis, helped with development and data analysis.    We Reviewed Police Tactics Seen in Nearly 400 Protest Videos. Here’s What We Found and We Are Tracking What Happens to Police After They Use Force on Protesters    This set of projects focused on demonstrating and contextualizing the violence that police used against Black Lives Matter protesters following the death of George Floyd. Using public footage of police violence from social media, we presented video alongside expert commentary and our own research to help bring accountability to the actions of officers.   My role in these two projects was to lead design, development and data analysis, collaborating with a team of reporters and video journalists to gather and report the story.    Charting the Long-Term Impact of Trump’s Judicial Appointments    This project is a comprehensive overview demonstrating how effectful the Administration was in appointing not just a record number of federal judges, but also large numbers of younger judges, many who are likely to remain in the judiciary for decades to come.   This interactive graphic charts out each federal judge by their current age, and shows how long they will likely serve before retirement.   I was the sole byline on this project, carrying out all design, development, data analysis and reporting.    Tracking the Trump Administration’s “Midnight Regulations”    The Trump administration rushed to implement dozens of policy changes in its final days. We built this project to track some of the most consequential and controversial of those policies. As policies rolled through passage and implementation in the final weeks of the Trump presidency, we kept the tracker updated on an almost-daily basis   I worked with a team of reporters on this project, and led the design, development and data analysis.

Ireland,"Euro News, Middle East Eye",Big,Participant,Mostafa Darwish,"  I am a visual journalist currently based in Ireland.      I started my career in 2011 as a photojournalist covering the aftermath of the Egyptian revolution.     In 2019, I won the Thomson Foundation’s mobile journalism (‘mojo’) competition, for my report on Egypt’s sharp fare increases to an already inadequate train system.      Since beginning my career at the start of the Egyptian revolution in 2011, I had covered major news events in Egypt for both local newspapers as well as international news agencies including EPA,  the Associated Press and AFP.     As a freelance multimedia journalist, I worked for APTV on more than 160 stories since 2015 alongside working for Mada Masr, BBC, al-Jazeera, aj+, Great Big Story, al-Monitor, ZoominTV.      In addition, he has led journalism workshops in Lebanon and Egypt.      I travelled across the Middle East and Europe, covering news and documenting life in Sudan, Turkey, Malaysia, Sweden, Georgia, Latvia, Ireland and United Arab Emirates.     I was awarded the 2019 Zenith magazine grant, and I filmed a documentary about Egyptian exiles Georgia under the Open Media Hub grant.     In February 2019 I was featured as the journalist of the month by International Journalists’ Network (IJNET)     Most recently, I am covering the migrants issues in Ireland publishing for Euro News,  Middle East Eye  and The Associated Press alongside my master studies in journalism at the University of Limerick and working on some guest lecturing for Irish local university Griffith College Dublin and International Centre for Journalists.     In July 2020 I  was selected Ireland Student Journalist of the year by Ireland National student Media Awards.  ","  My portfolio is part of my work I have done in 2020 about asylum seekers community which is voiceless community, I was involved with them myself as I am a former asylum seeker and I have noticed that there are a lot going on in the asylum centers across Ireland and I wanted to publish it, I couldn't publish it on Irish national media outlets therefore I went for Euronews and others.     two of those stories that made a big impact for asylum seekers, first one the story about the excluding asylum seekers from the financial services in Ireland. As the story went viral after publishing it, some national media outlets have done similar stories which impacted and there's potential law to release a separate ID for asylum seekers to help him to open bank accounts, at the same time, asylum seekers on the whatsapp groups were talking about some of them opened accounts easier than before.     The other story is about the impact of Covid on people living in asylum centers, the same week after publishing this story the centre that was shown in my report that has 7 residents in one bedroom, they were moved to other centers and RTE and Irish times did similar reports later.

Canada,Radio-Canada,Big,Participant,Nael Shiab," At the beginning of 2020, I set myself a new goal for the coming months: to create interactive 3D dataviz projects. And you'll find in this portfolio the projects I've been able to publish while exploring this new way of explaining complex topics to the readers.   I started my career as a TV reporter in 2011, but after a few years, I decided to learn how to code. I wanted to apply a more scientific approach to my journalistic work. I first learned how to use Python for data analysis in 2015. After several stories, I realized that I needed to visualize my data to explain it more efficiently to the readers. So I learned javascript as well, in 2016.   After a few years of 2D dataviz, often animated in scrolly telling templates, I wanted to push further my data visualization skills. And I thought 3D representations could help me to create more immersive experiences for the readers.   I learned how to use the ThreeJS library at the beginning of 2020. It was challenging since I wasn't able to find many examples of 3D representations of data, even less journalistic ones! But I persevered.   In the end, I am quite proud of the projects I was able to create. I think sometimes 3D interactive dataviz could help explain complex topics to the general public in a more interesting way. Not always, of course. But the 3D scenes have an extraordinary potential for immersive experiences and I hope more journalists will use them in the future.   From a technical perspective, ThreeJS uses WebGL technology which makes the dataviz very efficient, even on mobile phones. I suggest you try the projects presented here on both desktop screens and mobile phone screens. Since half our readership now uses a mobile phone to read our stories, I always work hard to optimize my projects for big and wide screens as for narrow and small ones.   Now that I know how to code 3D scenes, I plan on applying my new skills to explore AR and VR interactive dataviz projects in 2021. The digital world evolves quickly and we have to keep on learning and exploring new forms of journalism.   I hope you'll find the projects in this portfolio interesting. Thank you for your consideration. "," This portfolio includes four interactive 3D dataviz projects. I conceptualized the experiences, gathered and analyzed the data, and coded the projects. I am helped by a designer to improve the look and feel of the experience.   I start my projects with a React.js custom template I coded. This template keeps the visualization visible at all times. With this template, I can trigger javascript functions when the user scrolls or clicks on a button. For mobile phones, my template can use the swipe gesture, which is more natural for touch screens. I used ThreeJS to create the 3D scenes and to animate them. Behind the hood, it's using the WebGL technology. There are some D3 functions in the mix as well. Most of the time, I code Node.js scrappers to compile the data needed for my projects and Python scripts to analyze it.   All of these projects are optimized for both desktop screens and mobile phone screens. It's very important for me that all readers have a complete and satisfying experience, whether they use a computer or a cellphone.    1) Two parts of a pandemic: How the coronavirus spread in Canada / December 16, 2020    For the end of 2020, I wanted to publish a geographical analysis on how the COVID-19 pandemic stuck the country. But in Canada, some health regions are very big and others are very small. So I decided to create a 3D data visualization of the country in which spikes coming from the health regions would represent the data. With this approach, the readers would be able to recognize the country areas while being able to see and understand the data.    2) The Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Canada / July 16, 2020    In this project, I coded myself, 4 economic experts, and 5 economic indicators in 3D. The idea was to invite the readers to explore with me the economic impact of the COVID 19 pandemic in Canada. Since economic numbers could be boring for the general public, I decided to create a video game-like experience to inform and entertain the readers at the same time.    3) Who has died from COVID-19 in Canada? / June 8, 2020    During the COVID pandemic in Canada last year, the general public heard every day about the number of people who died. But how old were they? Where did they live? I felt that we should publish a story to give the public a more precise idea of who died because of this coronavirus. I decided to create an interactive 3D dataviz in which each death is gravitating particle.    4) Quebec’s budget explained with Lego blocks // March 11, 2020    What better way to understand a government’s budget than with construction blocks? In this 3D dataviz, each block represents 5 million dollars. Governments' budgets could be boring for the general public, but they are very important from a democratic perspective. With this project, I tried to transform a dry topic into an interesting and colorful experience.    In conclusion    These projects are among our most-read stories of 2020. The public enjoyed a lot these interactive and immersive experiences. They asked us to do more of them and I plan to continue to explore this way of doing data journalism in 2021!   Thank you for your consideration.

Sweden,Newsworthy,Small,Participant,Newsworthy's corona coverage," Newsworthy is a Swedish news service dedicated to local data-driven journalism. We want to nominate our 2020 coverage of the coronavirus, which has helped local newsrooms, public servants and the general public understand the pandemic. We think our portfolio is worthy of an award because of its innovation in methods and high journalistic ambitions.   Newsworthy is built upon a highly automated technological platform for data collection, analysis and text generation. With NLG technologies we are able to write articles that take hundreds of local versions and that re-write themselves whenever new data is published.   This allows us to produce a large amount of high quality data journalism with very limited resources. At the moment of writing Newsworthy employs three journalists.   Newsworthy was founded in 2016 by Journalism++ Stockholm after receiving a grant from Google’s Digital News Initiative. The initial ambition was to serve local newsrooms with automated story leads found through statistical trend and anomaly detection. Since then Newsworthy has found a broader audience among local civil servants and elected representatives, as well as the general public.    As data journalists our mission is to understand the world and make the world understandable through the lens of data. We want to empower organizations such as small newsrooms  that lack the resources and skills to collect and interpret data.   This is achieved through automation. We build pipelines that collect data, determine newsworthiness and ultimately produce ready-to-publish articles. However, we use the buzzword “robot journalism” carefully. We want to make journalism that reacts to real world events, interprets numbers (with human input!) and says something meaningful – for example about the coronavirus pandemic. We see ourselves as a little more “traditional” than some of the actors offering fully automated media products, yet clearly more automated than traditional data journalism organizations.   Much of the challenge in developing a service like Newsworthy has revolved around business, rather than content development. We have been able to grow with a business model founded in commissioned work supporting our own, independent reporting. This model allows us to keep the news service openly available to organizations, professionals and individuals with limited resources. "," With this nomination we specifically want to highlight our coverage of the covid-19 pandemic. The coronavirus news cycle was, in many ways, tailored for our highly automated workflow. Every day tonnes of new data was published – data that needed to be interpreted and put in sensible context. Our coverage has consisted of:  <ul>    Daily/weekly articles about the spread of the virus in all 290 Swedish municipalities.       Weekly analysis on mobility trends.       Reports on the mounting effects of the pandemic on healthcare waits.       Weekly and monthly articles about the economic effects in unemployment, company liquidations, housing prices etc.        Pan-European comparisons of regional excess deaths.    </ul>  All in all our small team has been able to produce tens of thousands of articles describing the impact of the coronavirus on society.   We are especially proud of our monitoring of regional excess deaths. In three larger publications we have shown how differently regions across Europe have been affected by the pandemic. While some regions have been largely untouched in terms of deaths, others have seen unprecedented excess death. This project was produced as part of the European Data Journalism Network and published on media outlets across the continent. These are just a few: <a href=""https://www.svd.se/stockholm-ett-av-europas-varst-drabbade-omraden"">SvD</a> (SWE), <a href=""https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2020/06/24/ett-fatal-regioner-i-europa-star-for-majoriteten-av-coronadodsfallen-de-flesta"">YLE</a> (FIN), <a href=""https://www.alternatives-economiques.fr/covid-19-une-majorite-de-morts-une-minorite-de-regions-europeennes/00093460"">Alternatives Economiques</a> (FRA), <a href=""https://www.balcanicaucaso.org/aree/Italia/Misurare-l-impatto-del-COVID-19-nelle-diverse-regioni-d-Europa"">OBCT</a> (ITA).    Our coverage was much appreciated in small and hyperlocal newsrooms and among local decision-makers. The number of subscribers increased threefold in just nine months. In November Newsworthy was named one of Sweden's top 5 news sites by <a href=""https://topp100.idg.se/"">IDG.se</a>.    One of the challenges in the project has been to maintain data quality. Early on we were dependent on scraping more than 20 regional websites every day to get the latest number of hospitalized patients. At least one or two of these scrapers would break on a daily basis. And regions tended to report their numbers slightly differently, making regional comparisons rather challenging.

Ireland,Noteworthy (Journal Media),Small,Participant,Noteworthy.ie,"  A community-led investigative journalism platform     Noteworthy  launched in April 2019 as an online crowdfunded investigative platform that invites submissions from the Irish public for investigations and issues that have not received media attention. The public can submit story ideas via our website, social media or email, which are then assessed by the team. If suitable, a public proposal is launched to crowdfund the investigation.    We wanted to create a new platform for supporting important journalism, one where reporters and members of the public can team up to deliver the stories that matter. We were inspired in part by the emergence of similar community-engaged and/or funded platforms such as The Bureau Local in the UK, De Correspondent in the Netherlands and Revista 5W in Spain.    The  Noteworthy  team consists of five staff employees but collaborates and commissions freelance journalists, data analysts and other experts as appropriate to a project.   With clear warnings of an increasing lack of trust for the media among the Irish public, we thought that it was vital to initiate a media platform that essentially acts as a large-scale listening post for the Irish public’s concerns that allows the audience to help shape the news agenda and motivates them to contribute to seeing that journalism delivered.    Since launching, we have received hundreds of ideas from the public, launched over 125 investigative proposals, and completed 29 investigations, tackling everything from under-regulation in care homes and for-profit DNA collection to digging into Airbnb landlord data and uncovering the negative impacts of plantation forestry.     Data is integral to our investigations     The use of data has formed a bedrock of a large proportion of our work, often acting as a catalyst for potential investigative ideas or as a visual aid to support key findings of our investigations in a digestible form for our audience. In many cases, it has been key to both.   In many cases, for example, drilling down into available public datasets or data released through information requests acts as the springboard for the team to be able to hone in on topics or areas of interest that we decided required a deeper dive or further investigation.    Data has also proven to be a key ally in helping us to confirm or disprove subjects of attention during investigations, with data analysis revealing cold, hard facts and figures to support hypotheses developed or to indicate to us that there was a need to reshift focus.     The journalists who completed the below submitted projects are:      Maria Delaney  is an investigative journalist who is a health specialist with experience in the pharmaceutical industry. She was shortlisted for the prestigious Mary Raftery Prize in 2020 for a  Noteworthy  investigation into a local council development. Previously, she won the Association of British Science Writers Newcomer Award for Britain and Ireland for an investigation she undertook on how Irish hospitals were not complying with infection control guidelines.    Niall Sargent  is a multimedia investigative reporter with investigative experience in two national media outlets, is the former editor of an online climate change news website, and has a background in intelligence and data analysis for Interpol. He has previously received funding from projects from the Simon Cumbers Media Fund and an investigative bursary from the Mary Raftery Journalism Fund.    Peter McGuire  is a freelance reporter who regularly undertakes projects for  Noteworthy . His recent  Noteworthy  investigation into lack of support of sexual crime survivors won the Mental Health Content award at the Headline Mental Health Media Awards 2020.  ","  Bicycle Blackspots     Noteworthy  mapped the most dangerous roads and junctions for cyclists across Ireland, spending two months scrapping, cleaning and analysing data from the Road Safety Authority and other sources.    Cyclist injuries had grown substantially but few had documented this. Our project was the most in-depth investigation on this subject in Ireland which revealed - through data and visualisation - the areas worst affected and questioned local councils about their plans. The series picked up over 105,000 views.   We mapped thousands of data points of collisions in an easy to use format so that our audience could zoom in to their local area to locate potential bicycle blackspots near to them.   Following publication, local authorities rolled out new bicycle safety measures including the installment of wands. A number of these were installed on sections of roads and junctions that were highlighted as blackspots in our articles. Our analysis, maps and videos are used by cycling campaigners to advocate for safer infrastructure.     Spruced Up     In this investigation on State forestry policy, we pieced together data on over 30,000 forestry licences to reveal the Forest Service was granting licences for plantation forests in biodiversity-rich areas without proper environmental assessments.    A major challenge was the lack of any forestry licence database in Ireland, with the Forest Service releasing sporadic and sparse details in PDF format. We used our skills in scraping to pull down data and Access to Information on the Environment (AIE) requests to collect 10 years of licence data.   Another problem was that data was in various formats (excel, pdf, word) with numerous spelling errors. We used Tabula and OpenRefine to collate, correct, confirm and analyse the large datasets.    The series was read over 120,000 times. The Environment Minister praised the work as ""excellent investigative journalism"" and the Forest Service published forestry appeals data within days of publication of our investigation.     Academic Uncertainty     In this investigation, we examined the casualisation of third-level sector education and exposed the harsh reality facing thousands of workers unable to afford housing and other essentials.    The series was read over 135,000 times. The impact was immediate after publication, with members of the Irish Parliament raising our findings on multiple occasions through statements, debates and parliamentary questions, as well as at cabinet committee level. In December 2020, for example, the Minister for Higher Education stated: “I acknowledge the work of  Noteworthy  on this issue.”   Our investigation took six months due to the extent of data gathering involved. We communicated with over 30 people in temporary or short-term jobs in higher education. We submitted numerous Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to every university and institute of technology.   This huge amount of work produced new findings not compiled in Ireland previously. One of the main revelations was that an average of 11,200 lecturers were working on a temporary or casual basis across Irish universities and ITs.    Caring for Carers     Our investigation into the home care sector - which found poor pay in a profitable sector - analysed financial statements over three years to reveal the top five companies contracted by the public health service. This analysis shaped our investigation and revealed these companies received over 70% of all revenue allocated to private home care providers in 2019.    Cut Down to Size    Data analysis was a key part of this investigation into urban tree-felling that allowed us to reveal 10,000 trees were cut down by local authorities since 2015. We sent AIE requests to all 33 authorities from which we collated data, using charts and maps to present findings in a location-based and searchable format.

China,The Paper,Big,Participant,Open Data for the COVID-19 Pandemic," We have published three times of the open data for the COVID-19 so far.   At the very beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, we built up our own dashboard for tracking case numbers in China. Just two days later, on January 24, we shared the full updating dataset with the public, which we continuously updating and sharing until now.   After two weeks, on Feburary 6, for another story, we collected, cleaned, and published another dataset with the tracking details of 763 confirmed cases.   At the end of the year, on December 23, to memorize the anniversary of the COVID-19, we opened up the application for a dataset containing 11699 confirmed case tracking details to the public.   We published and update our datasets both on Github and Shimo spreadsheet, so that they're accessible for users in different countries. And we promoted our datasets in our interactive tracking dashboard and in our Wechat post.   The series of open data articles have gained over one hundred thousand page views. Our repository of the daily coronavirus update numbers on Github has been stared 166 times and forked 73 times. In addition to these, our newsroom, other media, and many concerned citizens have published multiple articles with the numbers and details of our datasets. For example, in Feburary, the Netease data column, which has a smaller data news team, used our dataset for their data-driven story.  "," Project link 1: COVID-19 daily update dashboard (Jan. 22, 2020 till now)   Project link 2: COVID-19 daily updates on Github (Jan. 11, 2020 to Jan. 28, 2021)   The columns respectively contain the date of report, province of China/country, city of China, number of new confirmations, number of new recoveries, number of new deaths, source, first link, second link, third link, and notes.

Spain,OUTRIDERS,Small,Participant,OUTRIDERS VISUAL STORYTELLING," Dear Mrs/Mr,   We are writing to nominate OUTRIDERS to the SIGMA AWARD 2021.   Outriders is a Poland-based non profit media organization that uses innovative tools to explain crucial topics. Our projects combine the foundations of traditional reporting with visually compelling designs.   We would like to highlight  5 projects  that we published during 2020, where we used different tools and approaches, such as  a comic, illustrations, Google Earth, Whatsapp as a reporting tool or a large database of global responses to the effects of COVID-19.     1) Favelas vs COVID-19: What the residents living on the periphery can teach us about strategies to combat the pandemic .     FORM - COMIC JOURNALISM      HIGHLIGHT - CROSS-BORDER & SOLUTION JOURNALISM    It is  a multimedia comic  about the grassroots initiatives that were launched by the residents of some favelas in São Paulo to face the problems caused or exacerbated by the pandemic. The idea arose after searching and  analyzing over 1,000 responses to the effects of the pandemic  with a cross-border team. We used a  solution journalism approach. It was published in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Polish.     2) Rojava Diary.      FORM- MULTIMEDIA     HIGHLIGHT: USING WHATSAPP AS A REPORTING TOOL    Following the Turkish offensive, in October 2019, Outriders worked on a diary from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, also known as Rojava, working   together with a local journalist in the field and  using WhatsApp as a reporting tool.       One of the novelties of this project is that we use WhatsApp to collect data on the field and reporting. We chose WhatsApp to facilitate the immediacy and speed when sending materials from anywhere. For instance, the reporter visited a road in the Turkish border, or a village or a prison, and he sent pictures, videos, interviews and observations using voice and text messages by WhatsApp on site.    3) RADAR     FORM - DATABASE      HIGHLIGHT: DATA JOURNALISM, SOLUTION JOURNALISM AND CROSS-BORDER    For three months, a cross-border team of journalists tracked positive responses to the effects of Covid-19, collecting more than 1,000 responses from around the world. The team of reporters were from Brazil, Botswana, Taiwan, Belarus and Spain. They collected responses to different direct or indirect effects of the pandemic including unemployment, shortage of health resources, abandonment of vulnerable populations. They were responses created by diverse initiators: individuals, NGO’s, communities, governments, companies. Measures include launching a radio show in several indigenous languages to inform of prevention measures, using sound cars with hip hop and lyrics about health in a Brazilian favela or Educational TV shows in Portugal or Rwanda to train childrens during the lockdow   4)  Biopirates of the Indian Ocean      FORM:  MULTIMEDIA     HIGHLIGHT: ILLUSTRATIONS AS A BOTANIC BOOK STYLE    This article, which  resembles the antique botanical books,  is a visual journey through the iconic cases of biopiracy in Sri lanka. Biopiracy is the name given to the practice of using and commercially exploiting the biological resources and indigenous knowledge of a country without permission or compensation.    5)  Fleeing the Syrian war to war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh.     FORM- MULTIMEDIA     HIGHLIGHT: GOOGLE EARTH     It is a story of the family who drove the 1,600 km that separate<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aleppo?src=hashtag_click"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> Aleppo from Stepanakert </a>in their black Kia to start from scratch. We used Google earth to draw the specific road and trip that this family drove to show the readers the long way of a migrant family who left their past, since we think when the media writes about how long or hard the trip of a migrant is it might be difficult to imagine it.   Thank you for the consideration,   Outriders team.     ","  1) COMIC   - Favelas vs COVID-19: What the residents living on the periphery can teach us about strategies to combat the pandemic .   When we decided to write about the solidarity initiatives in some Brazilian favelas during the pandemic, we expected to respect three premises:  <ul>  Firstly, we wanted to know further details about the initiatives of these favelas but without exposing their residents to the risk of contagion   secondly, media rarely write about the positive aspects of these neighbourhoods; we wanted to focus on the responses to difficulties rather than to show difficulties   and finally, we wanted to talk about the pandemic, but we knew that readers were overwhelmed with news about the pandemic so the format should be engaging.  </ul>  A comic seemed an ideal tool to achieve our three requirements: first, illustrations allowed us just visiting some of the people involved without an excessive presence. Second, the comic was an ideal platform to give visibility to the interviewees as heroes instead of as victims and finally, it offered us an engaging format to attract the reader’s attention.   We believe that a comic is an ideal format to cover sensitive topics, not only during a pandemic but during a conflict or harmful event. On the one hand, it seems less intrusive when it comes to portraying the reality of people than photographing or making a video; on the other hand, it has an engaging component to attract attention to important topics.    2) Rojava Diary.     We used WhatsApp to create a multimedia crossborder story from a conflict zone.    3) RADAR    We found over 1,000 responses to the effects of COVID-19 created by diverse initiators: individuals, NGO’s, communities, governments, companies. Measures include launching a radio show in several indigenous languages to inform of prevention measures, using sound cars with hip hop and lyrics about health in a Brazilian favela or Educational TV shows in Portugal or Rwanda to train childrens during the lockdow   4)  Biopirates of the Indian Ocean     It includes interviews with  Mr Samantha Gunasekara, former Srilankan Deputy Director of Customs, who spent two decades trying to prevent the island’s resources and heritage from being looted; the visit to the Institute of Indigenous Medicine in Colombo, where the ancient manuscripts with formulas on palm leaves are stored or the interview to a five generations family of Ayurvedic   practitioners behind the only Sri Lankan company that owns a patent of a product made from endemic plants in the island. The article also explores four successful cases fighting biopiracy around India, Peru, Ethiopia and Brazil.   5)  Fleeing the Syrian war to war-torn Nagorno-Karabakh.    Google earth  can be a fantastic tool to show give context to the stories. We used it to tell the journey of a  family who drove the 1,600 km that separate<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aleppo?src=hashtag_click"" style=""text-decoration:none;""> Aleppo from Stepanakert </a>in their black Kia to start from scratch.

United Kingdom,The Guardian,Big,Participant,Pamela Duncan," 2020 will be remembered as the year our lives were turned upside down. No one was prepared. Everything was in flux.    Amidst the chaos, data journalists, the Guardian data team among them, proved their mettle. 2020 was the year that data journalists became “<a href=""https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j2s6"">the rockstars of the news business</a>” according to BBC radio’s The Media Show. It was the year that brought data to the fore as a key pillar of facts-based journalism in the minds of the public.    The Guardian data projects team has always been involved the analysis of existing or newly published data. But the role also allowed us to innovate: our mainstay was a creative process involving merging, scraping and creating datasets from previously unstructured data.    In 2020, as internal communication became harder, deadlines were shortened, the competing copy was formidable and the public displayed an understanding and expectation only previously matched by that of our editors.    Although always an aspect of the role, it became increasingly important for data journalists to be defenders of the data, especially in a time where mistakes gave fuel to those who claimed Covid deaths were being exaggerated.    Very early on we discovered and highlighted holes in the data, for example, the government’s early exclusion of deaths occuring in care homes.   We counted the dead and explained why that wasn't an easy thing to do. We questioned the data; we spotted the gaps. We reacted to and drew attention to government data failings, we reported on the very real life implications of data errors and omissions.    A year on, as we are still feeling the effects of Covid, lockdown and the losses they brought about, both personally and economically, data journalists remain a key in documenting and making sense of the pandemic. "," I work for one of the largest media organisations in the UK and one of its most trusted. I am one of a three-woman team - along with data editor Caelainn Barr and data journalist Niamh McIntyre - who are embedded at the heart of the Guardian newsroom.   I make this submission to the Sigma data awards on the back of 10 months of non-stop data work on the impact of the Covid pandemic.   The 10 news stories I have chosen for this submission are representative of a period in which I have become an in-house expert in UK coronavirus cases, hospitaliations, vaccinations numbers and most importantly, deaths.    At the time of writing (1 February, 2021), I had accumulated 401 bylines in my five-and-a-quarter years at the Guardian.  Two-in-five (39%) of these were written since my first Covid-related byline on 17 March 2020. Of the 155 news, features and live blog bylines I have had since that date, 97% were Covid-related.    I feel that my work in 2020 improved the understanding and importance of data in what has been an unprecedented period.    I broke a number of stories, such as revealing that the true April death toll in the United Kingdom was as high as 1,445 deaths in just one day, far higher than the contemporaneous figures published by the government, as well as highlighting the number of excess deaths occurring in private households as the public shied away from, or were unable to access, health appointments.    I developed a methodology for the Guardian that combines the statistical agencies’ death count (which is more robust but is published at a time lag) with the government’s figure (which, for the purposes of speed, only counts those deaths within 28 days of a positive test and is, therefore, an undercount) to allow us to calculate the most complete and up-to-date death toll possible.   A key aspect of my work as a data journalist has been the continued collaboration with my direct colleagues on the Guardian data projects team, the visuals team, as well as news reporters and correspondents. I have long felt strongly that collaborations make combined journalistic output stronger: 2020 cemented this.    My journalism is underpinned by detailed interrogation of the datasets behind the headline. As well as using data to inform the public, I have written repeatedly about data gaps and failures which, either through accident or design, misled rather than enlightened the public.    Working with the visuals team I was able to communicate complex data sets to our readers, both online and in print, enabling readers to interrogate this data in an accessible and entertaining way.    Along with visual projects editor Lydia McMullan and others on the visuals team, I co-authored two innovative and accessible features on Covid: one on the mental impact of the pandemic and lockdown on our mental health; the other a timeline juxtaposing the UK governments’ U-turns and mixed messages with an ever-increasing death toll (please note that this was story was updated in February 2021: the original time stamp is, however, within the period covered by the Sigma awards).    I also collaborated with so many more people who ordinarily work outside the London office making new connections as the pandemic reorientated data’s role in the newsroom.    I frequently contributed to our live blog: an immediate way of breaking news to an engaged audience.   My contribution to telling the story of the pandemic as it unfolded was significant, both in terms of helping readers understand the rapidly changing health environment around them and, at a political level, holding the government and public bodies to account.

Brazil,"Pindograma, Folha de São Paulo, revista piauí, Agência Mural, O Tempo",Small,Participant,Pindograma," Pindograma is a new data-journalism organization, created in the first semester of 2020 and now counting with 6 months since its website launch. The project was created by 4 Brazilian students that wanted to bring together their interest in the social sciences with Brazilian politics and data science. We were all readers first, that got inspired by the pioneers of Brazilian data journalism, together with academics such as political scientists and political economists, and by good data journalism being done abroad, such as 538. The team now counts with 6 people, 5 university students and a recent journalism graduate, all in their early 20s.    Pindograma arose from a belief that good journalism can cause positive impact in society. Thus, our initial objectives were to contribute to the Brazilian journalism scene by making 100% of our code avaliable. All our projects can be replicated and ideally scrutinized by any individual or organization. We believe that one of the ways to strengthen the accountability of journalism is through the transparency of open-sourced data. Additionally, the replicability of our projects allowed for collaboration with people in academia and also other journalists. That improved our own work, besides allowing for our tools to be used by other people. A more accessible data environment in Brazil what we strive.   The other main motivation of the project was to provide more quantitative analysis about politics in Brazil. We introduce pieces that analyse phenomena in depth, trying to go beyond the more 'instant' news cycle that is usually adopted by data journalism in our country. We think that there is still a large gap to be filled in journalism that crosses different databases to give more light about the framework of the Brazilian government and things that revolve around it. We don't think it's enough to only replicate what is in a singular database, so we try to include analysis that considers different databases to provide more global and in-depth reporting.   We think that we should be considered for the Sigma Awards because of our compromise to contribute to the data-journalism scene, which has proved to be successful so far due to our interactions with other organisations and journalists. Pindograma plans to keep doing that, to also start new long-term projects that will be replicable later and could help people outside of organization, in the form of open code or pieces as well. Additionally, we have achieved the production of good content with a very young and unexperienced team and we think the award would allow us to continue improving even more. "," The portfolio showcases some of the pieces that were result of long-term projects. We compiled the translations of the pieces in a google document, available in this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cj1zIalKLU1OuKomWuseTWqfm65F8dGZyMCINyUb-cU/edit?usp=sharing.    Pindograma's Electoral Map : Through extensive work we were able to develop one of the most detailed electoral maps of Brazil. It allows any user to map out how every specific voting station in the entire country voted in all elections for every position since 2008. We collaborated with other Brazilian media outlets such as revista piauí, Folha de S. Paulo, and Agência Mural to publish pieces using our map framework. They will all be linked in the portfolio. We also used the map to do more in-depth analysis such as a piece that used the map's information and the income of voters to identify patterns and analyse how income gaps shape municipal elections.    Project Links:  1.Large Brazilian cities vote along class lines   2. Piece analysing how former election results in the city of Vitória could affect the 2020 election   (Both are translated in the google document)        Pindograma's Polling Institutes Ranking:  By systematically gathering all registered polls since 2012, Pindograma developed a ranking of all Polling Institutes that had registered polls from 2012-20. We did a double effort of using the polls to evaluate each institute's performance but also to create the most extensive poll aggregator for Brazilian elections. Our ranking was used to tell the story of how some institutes with really bad results were actively commiting fraud and ended up also serving as a reference for other publications.   Project Links:   4. The Ranking   5. The poll aggregator   6. Our evaluation of the general performances of polling institutes in the 2020 elections (translated in the google document)        Parties in Numbers:  We made a series analysing most Brazilian parties using various data about their composition, electoral performance and other aspects. The objective was to provide an extensive picture of Brazil's parties using data but also talking about their history and formation process. Brazil has 36 active parties and it is normally hard to find data and information available about smaller parties.    Project Links:   7 - Brazilian Democratic Movement (Example of the piece format we used, it's also translated in the document)        Interesting Collaborations:  I will be using the other project links to show some interesting collaborations Pindograma did with other publications. The first one was a piece we wrote about the lack of political rights for provisional convicts, which represent about 40% of the incarcerated population, about 300k. The second is an interesting example of how our map got used for regional politics reporting, as one of the major newspapers of the state of Minas Gerais used it to report on the elections in the state capital. Lastly, we have a piece that used our map information to report on the electoral patterns of the largest slums of São Paulo, another example of how our map could be used for regional reporting. It is important to note that this piece was written by the Agência Mural, while we provided them with our maps and contributed with some editing.

Portugal,Público,Big,Participant,Rui Barros - Público," My name is Rui Barros, a 26 years old data journalist/journocoder based in Portugal currently working at Público. 2020 was a weird year for everyone, but it was a year of change for me. After four years at Rádio Renascença, where I bootstrapped their data practice and team, I decided to accept the offer to work at Público - one of the biggest newspapers in the country. A hard decision to make, because I was leaving all the work I had built there and starting everything from scratch. And then covid-19 came.   Hired to start up, just by myself, a data journalism practice on the most read online newspaper in Portugal was quite the challenge, especially in a country where you can count with one hand how many data journalists there are. Most colleagues don’t really gasp what you really do and creating an understanding of the role in a new newsroom seemed impossible to achieve in only one year. But covid-19 helped to bridge the gap. There were numbers, so many numbers to report on. And mostly importantly, we needed to add context to those numbers.   That’s where my love for content personalization came in. I knew that I could not only help report on those numbers, but also offer the reader tools that provided personalized information about those numbers, while allowing them to further explore the data without any statistical knowledge. During 2020, I developed several of those news apps: related to covid-19 numbers by municipality, to measure the levels of confinement or allow people to check how the government was spending public money to fight the pandemic.   Even though developing news applications is one of the things that makes me love this job, I didn’t stop there. I worked on two international investigations, with european publishers, and produced several news pieces that allowed the public to understand how the portuguese NHS was coping with the pandemic. I  also worked in some education related pieces, since it was one of the areas that was most affected by the pandemic.   When I was not working on such big projects, I collaborated with specialized journalists of the newsroom - who lacked data knowledge but compensated with their field knowledge when it was the time to contextualize the numbers.   Sigma Awards provides me with an opportunity to look back and reflect on my work of the previous year. Working all alone and doing everything from data analysis to coding the interactive feature surely is hard. And even though this year I was able to further develop my skillset (working for the first time with Machine Learning, for example), that’s not what matters: I truly believe I was able to contribute a bit more to a more informed and clarified discussion on the range of topics I worked on.   I believe the projects showcased below are representative of the quality of my efforts and work, making me eligible for this award. "," These projects are some of the works that I’m most proud of and that I believe hilight what my data journalism skills can do. In all of them, I was the first responsible for them, doing everything from the data collection, analysis, interactive features and interactive data visualization.    [Project link 1]    It was my first week in the newsroom when the health reporter said that a source told her that the NHS health emergency line was “chaotic”. I quickly added: wait, there’s public data on that, giving my first front page headline. Colleagues who didn’t really understood what a data journalist could do got a glimpse of what I could add to the newsroom.    [Project link 2]    Using covid data and contextual information about the municipalities, I built a news application that generated a personalized news story about every one of the 308 municipalities in Portugal. Everyone was reporting on the national numbers or just talking about the outliers. But I felt that people wanted to know a bit more about where they actually lived.    [Project link 3]    A national lockdown was something new for everyone. Everyone felt that the country was changing. But what exactly was changing? We turned to data to figure it out. We ended up combing about 20 different data sources that showed us expectable things - such as the fact that pollution levels dropped. But also some really surprising stuff - like the fact that people seemed to be listening to happier songs.    [Project link 4]    A collaborative effort between Público and other 15 european news organizations, coordinated by OCCRP, found out that the european market was being flooded with fake and faulty FFP masks. Using a data-driven approach, I found out that Portugal had bought at least 627 thousands of FFP masks that had fake or dubious certification.    [Project link 5]    Using the data from the national exams and the percentage of poor students by municipality, I calculated the euclidean distance to an hypothetical place where all students were poor and yet had 20 out 20 on their national exams. That led us to four municipalities that contradicted the trend of a poorer environment meaning worst marks.    [Project link 6]    At the start of the school year, and amid the covid-19 pandemic, the portuguese government ruled that every coffee shop 300 meters from any school would have a limit of four people per table. But how many businesses were affected by this rule? No one seemed to know - not even the government. I turned into to the Google Maps API to get an answer.    [Project link 7]    With the covid-19 pandemic, governments across the world increased their spending on several medical equipment and services to fight the spread of the vírus. Portugal was no exception. But how much was spent? And which companies profited the most with the pandemic? No one seemed to know. Using the Portuguese Public tenders database and Machine Learning, we were able to provide some answers.    [Project link 8]    The problem with covid-19 data by county is that it gives the impression that the risk gets higher or lower everytime you change from one county to another. To tackle this issue, a team from a Portuguese university divided the country into a 2km X 2km grid and calculated the risk associated with that area and the uncertainty of that forecast. After talking with some members of this team, I developed an interactive map that allowed people to check the risk of getting the virus where they lived.    [Project link 9]    Portuguese started listening to Christmas songs 11 days earlier.

Malaysia,STAR MEDIA GROUP,Big,Participant,STAR MEDIA GROUP - MALAYSIA," My name is Razak Ahmad, and I'm a data journalist with The Star, a Malaysian news media organisation.   As a News Editor I coordinate a small team that creates data-driven and visual stories for The Star Online (thestar.com.my).   Most of the content my team creates appear in StarPlus (https://www.thestar.com.my/starplus) which is a special section in the Star Online website that highlights data-driven, visual and interactive content.   The Star Online was launched on June 23, 1995 and is Malaysia's first news website.   As the digital companion to The Star newspaper, The Star Online is part of a portfolio that offers content through print, The Star ePaper and a mobile app.   The website was recognised in 2014 as one of the best in Asia by the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA).   I have been a journalist for 22 years, and have worked in another Malaysian newspaper and as a Reuters correspondent for the Malaysia bureau prior to joining The Star.   About a year and a half ago, I proposed to my boss to introduce data journalism and set up a unit that will spearhead the creation of data-driven content.   The aim is to better engage a changing news audience that is moving away from print and add value to our paywall customers.   Star Plus, which was the result, has been up for about a year. Page views, engagement time and other measurements for the data-driven content we produce have been unexpectedly strong and positive.   As a result, data-driven content is now one of the priorities for The Star. For this year we plan to actively expand our team, capabilities and skills and inject data-driven content into other sections of the news operations as well.   I am self-taught in data journalist and still have much to learn, but this has been an exciting journey.   All the stories submitted here have received particularly strong reader responses and engagement.   I hope that by entering our work in The Sigma Awards my team and organisation can hopefully receive encouragement and recognition of our efforts to learn and create better data-driven content.   Thank you. ","The Star Media Group's portfolio has four stories: 1. Predicting the Next Pandemic. This is a story about the work of PREDICT - an international pandemic early warning project. Scientests on the programme have been testing people and animals in countries including Malaysia for the past 10 years in search of zoonotic viruses that potentially pose a threat to people and livestock. I proposed the story to highlight their work in Malaysia so they can get better support from Malaysian authorities and organisations at a time when their work was being derided by the Trump adminstration (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus) The story also highlights the importance of protecting Malaysia's endangered bats amid negative publicity following news that the animals may be carriers of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The biggest challenge was finding the best way to analyse the large amount of raw data relating to the specimens tested and to visualise what we found from the data in a way that is engaging for readers. The biggest impact - judging from reader comments - was in highlighting the importance of environmental and wildlife conservation and showing how our failure to do this can result in something as catastrophic as a pandemic. 2. Turning the tide on Malaysia's third Covid-19 wave. This is a data-driven visual story that explains how the Covid-19 pandemic developed in Malaysia over 10 months. I proposed this story at a time when Malaysia was seeing a spike in cases from a third wave of infections but public awareness of what was happening was still no The biggest challenge was building a dataset that covers the 10 month period of the pandemic. Malaysia's health authorities releases data daily, but the data released is relatively limited in scope. The story which was also one of the most popular data stories for 2020 gave readers an overview of what's been happening in Malaysia which I feel is still something that is in short supply as most news media organisations are focused on just the daily reporting of Covid-19. 3. How effective was your MP in Parliament? Find out here People in many countries including Malaysia often complain that their elected representatives don't perform. I proposed this story because I felt that in Malaysia, parliament reporting was still stuck to merely repeating arguments by MPs. I felt that The Star should do a data story that objectively measures how well - or not - our MPs are doing in Parliament. The story uses the Hansard from a recently completed Parliament meeting as the data source to find out what the MPs talk about and how they were. The biggest was the amount of words that we had to analyse, and figuring out how best to analyse the Hansard. One problem which we found was that quite a number of MPs from both sides - instead of arguing substantive issues - resorted to using unparliamentary and offensive language and words. We highlighted this issue in the story among others. Since then, I have not heard any more widespread complaints of MPs using unparliamentary language, which I like to think is partly to the impact that the story had! 4. Here's how Macau scammers conned Malaysians out of RM256mil this year Phone scams are a big problem in Malaysia, with more than US$60 million in losses recorded for the 11 months of 2020 alone. However, media coverage is mostly just on individual cases and rarely looks at a wider perspective. We used media reports as a data source to find out how the scammers operate in order to raise awareness and help readers protect",https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/08/15/multimedia-predicting-the-next-pandemic,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/10/14/turning-the-tide-on-malaysias-third-covid-19-wave,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/01/11/how-effective-was-your-mp-in-parliament-find-out-here?fbclid=IwAR20eKsgKugGAT6J3dnixsj22MF9PoxeyAxuGYsbRpetmObftNiZ08VVG54,https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/11/28/interactive-heres-how-macau-scam-criminals-conned-malaysians-out-of-rm256mil-this-year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
South Africa,"InfoNile, Code for Africa, African Network of Centres for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting, IHE Delft Partnership Programme for Water and Development, Mada Masr, Juba Monitor, Zehabesha, New Vision, Science Africa",Big,Participant,Sucked Dry," River Nile, the world’s longest river, stretches through 11 countries in Africa: Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, DRC, Kenya, South Sudan, Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Egypt. Over 257 million people live within the Nile Basin, depending on the river to support their livelihoods.     Water Journalists Africa maintains a network across the African continent of hundreds of journalists who report on issues of water and environment. These are important topics, but they are often under-covered by local media houses. Our geojournalism project InfoNile.org supports journalists across the Nile River basin countries to report these critical stories.      InfoNile is a young platform, launched in 2017 with inspiration from an IHE-Delft research project on water communication in the Nile Basin, which found that media reports in the basin were highly simplistic and nationalistic, tending to encourage conflict on transboundary issues and lacking science, data and multimedia. Since our founding four years ago, we have supported more than 100 journalists from across the Nile Basin countries with funding, mentorship and training in data and science journalism, helping them produce in-depth multimedia stories on environmental topics including water scarcity, climate change, wildlife conservation, biodiversity and others. Code for Africa, Africa’s largest civic technology and data journalism initiative, is our main partner in data visualization and training. InfoNile is based in Uganda with coordinators in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Sudan and Ethiopia; our staff is composed of mainly young journalists, communications professionals and environmental activists, majority women and majority African.     Our stories make a meaningful impact: According to our 2020 Impact Survey, 28% of responding journalists said their story had led to institutional action, while 16% said it had led to policy change and 12% said it had led to a governmental investigation. 94% said it had led to increased awareness, including other media picking up the story or public officials or other organizations citing the story.     In the Nile River basin, water use and access are tied intrinsically with land issues. Countries in this transboundary river basin have historically fought over the use and division of water from the Nile. Currently Egypt, which is almost entirely dependent on the Nile water, is in conflict with upstream countries Ethiopia and Sudan that are expected to benefit from the new Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that will become the largest hydropower dam in Africa. But while the GERD has received much press and attention, we were interested to uncover other little-known projects - especially those owned by foreign corporations - that are also extracting large amounts of water from the Nile, but exporting profits abroad.      From our analysis of data collected by the Land Matrix, a global independent land monitoring initiative, we discovered that countries from all around the world are increasingly seeking a stake in the Nile’s fertile lands. In the 11 countries in the Nile river basin, we found there were at least 445 acquisitions of land since 2000 with contracts totaling 16.9 million hectares of land, or 169,000 square kilometers, mostly for monoculture.     The yearlong investigation involved over a dozen journalists, researchers, drone videographers and data wranglers. Throughout the project, we focused on telling investigative stories using innovative formats - data, multimedia and “geo” journalism such as data visualizations, maps and drone imagery - to demonstrate the widespread environmental, economic and social effects of these “land and water grabs” on the countries and communities where the projects are located. Through these investigations coupled with land deals location data from the Land Matrix, we discovered that foreign investors are acquiring huge swaths of land in the Nile Basin, consuming enormous amounts of water, displacing communities and exporting profits.    "," Sucked Dry is an investigative project produced by a cross-border group of geo-journalists, led by InfoNile. This project, created in partnership with Code For Africa and supported by Pulitzer Center On Crisis Reporting, combines scientific research and video and photography, with drone, data and geo-journalism to demonstrate the impact of foreign land grabs across Nile Basin countries and highlight the complex environmental, economic and social impact of land grabbing on nearby communities over the years.     Our team of investigative journalists worked across 11 countries, producing 12 in-depth multimedia story packages exploring land use issues in communities from flower farms in Ethiopia, to timber companies in Uganda and Chinese businesses in South Sudan, to the enormous amounts of water being extracted by alfalfa farms in arid Egypt and Sudan for export to the Gulf countries. Our journalists reviewed troves of documents, analyzed datasets and traveled to remote areas to interview the people most affected by these foreign investments.      Despite challenges to press freedom, particularly in South Sudan and Ethiopia, they were able to publish critical reports in local and national publications in the Nile Basin countries: Mada Masr in Egypt, Zehabesha in Ethiopia, Juba Monitor in South Sudan, New Vision in Uganda, ScienceAfrica in Kenya, and the Earth Journalism Network. These initial reports were published in 2019 and in 2020 stories were translated into Arabic, Swahili and Amharic by InfoNile coordinators and published on InfoNile.org.   After publishing all the individual stories, we created our final interactive multimedia project on the Shorthand multimedia storytelling platform in 2020, incorporating content from all of the 12 stories as well as overall analysis, video documentaries, photos, drone imagery and interactive data visualizations. This was republished subsequently by national and regional media houses including New Vision and Science Africa.   The investigation was initiated based on data generated by the Land Matrix in 2019. Visualising these large datasets (some more than 100 rows of data) for our readers proved challenging. To make it  user-friendly, we used interactive alluvial charts from Flourish.Studio to give readers a more thorough understanding. Similarly, an interactive map with filters presenting land deals in the Nile basin was published on InfoNile.org. Users can view country-level analysis, as well as get information on the land acquisitions in a particular area. Stories were also ‘mapped’ on top of this map.     Journalists took drone videos and photographs to showcase the beauty in the Nile Basin that could be lost if land grabbing continues. Google Earth provided high-quality images of Rumaylah in the present day and two decades ago. We used an image slider to overlay the two images, showing viewers the drastic change in only 20 years. Readers can also witness the development of the Toshka Project over time via Google Earth Timelapse.     To summarize details about concluded land deals, we made a motion graphic using After Effects CC. This tool allowed us to animate the data in a progression that showed the relationship between the different datasets. The satellite map also helped put each country in context for our readers in the beginning of the article. The biggest challenge was to ensure that the data is accurate throughout the video. We overcame this by making meticulous calculations and making sure bar and point sizes were relative across all published visualisations.  The compelling stories, engaging media and the large amount of accompanying data in this story led InfoNile win the WAN-IFRA African Digital Media Award for best data visualization. The combined efforts of every team member produced a beautiful and profound piece shedding light on the injustices happening in the Nile Basin.  ",https://pulitzercenter.shorthandstories.com/sucked-dry-newvision/index.html,https://pulitzercenter.shorthandstories.com/sucked-dry-infonile-scienceafrica/index.html,http://bit.ly/3awfVQU,http://www.jubamonitor.com/this-story-was-made-possible-with-support-from-infonile-and-pulitzer-center-more-than-2-5-million-hectares-of-land-in-south-sudan-have-been-acquired-mainly-by-international-investors-since-2006/,https://www.zehabesha.com/rose-the-flower-impairing-blue-nile-river-and-communities-in-ethiopia/,https://scienceafrica.co.ke/yala-swamp-saga-broken-promises-and-idle-land/,https://infonile.org/trapped-in-the-buffer-zone/,https://www.jubamonitor.com/uncertainty-over-laws-fuel-land-grabs-in-south-sudan-foreign-investors-acquired-2-5-million-hectares-of-land-since-2006/,https://earthjournalism.net/stories/road-river-the-story-of-a-river-dried-by-illegal-land-acquisitions,https://waterjournalistsafrica.com/2019/05/land-grabbing-and-its-implications-for-sudanese-views-from-a-scholar/,,,,,,,,
Sweden,SVT Swedish Television,Big,Participant,SVT Datajournalistik," We are a team of five people, journalists and developers, that work togehter with data journalism. This year has been a special one - for the whole world and for us. I want to nominate our portfolio of the best articles we have done on corona during 2020. Our mission has been to make avalible as much data as possible, giving our audience facts in a time of distress and worry. Our audience come to us to get the facts, not opinions och ""news with an angle"". Our team has worked together for about three years in this constellation, with little to non steering from above. We are and strive for continuing to be a ""free"", experimental team that find our own path - with the ambition to set data free and visualize it in a way so that our readers can decide for themselves what they want to kno more about, and how much they want to learn. In a pandemic era, the need for information has never big bigger. Our goal is to continune (as we have up until now)  to develop our articles as new data gets out, and in cooperation with our audience. They ask - and we give, when possible. This year we have been depentent on our authorities and the data they release. Data has been released in many different forms och shapes, only to change next week. To keep our biggest articles up to date every day has been a challange and a new way for us to work. We have a number of scripts that run many times a day to find new data to fill our articles with. But the most special thing about this year, and the portfolio I am presenting, is the collaboration with our audience. Some of the ideas, and many of the detalis of our articles has been made because of ideas och wishes from our audience. Several of our articles are like living materia, that continues to change and develop as times goes along. Apart from thoose articles that we update every day, we have also done several others, ""one offs"" on the topic. And of course we covered the US election and a lot of other stuff. But this portfolio is concenrtrated on corona. ","This portfolio belongs to the whole team: SVT Datajournalistik. We work closely together and we are equals in this so there is no principal creator. I am the editor or the team and has therefor taken on this role as the one who nominates us. One of the biggest challenges this year has been the constant change of data. We have two articles that updates several times a day, three or four that updates once a week. We prefer it when ours scripts just get it and pushes it to our pages, but the authoreties often change the data formats in different ways that brakes our scripts. So we rewrite them - and fast. We built a warningbot that emails us when one of sthe scripts fale, this has worked fine both for us but as a plus also for our sources since our bot also sees when there's something fishy going on on their sites. Several times we have been able to tell our sources that their data is wrong so they can correct it, by letting our bot to simple calculations of what is a resonable number to get and so on. In that way we have been a part of contributing to make sure that the data that every mediahouse in sweden uses is correct. As a Public Service companie, we have also built an iframe version of one of our most popular articles (intensive care in corona) that we share (for free of course) with every lokal media that wants to embedd it. It has been a tough year - we are only five people and we work weekends and hollidays if new data arrives or if one of the scripts brake. We are always on call, since our audience demands (and deserves) to know how the situation is every single day. Okej so some english explination of our articles (even thow I think google translate will work okey). - ""Här sprider sig coronaviruset"" = The spread of the corona virus. This is also avalible in english - BUT is not up to speed with the development of the swedish one (for example it still shows number of recovered witch we don't whos in the swedish anymore and will take our of the english). You can however read the english version as a translation - but look at the graphs of the swedish one. This article shows the development of corona in sweden (regions and municipalities) and the rest of the worlds countries - ""Corona i intensivvården och slutenvården"": Corona in intensivecare and hospitals. Show the numbers of people, both new per day and in total, that has been given intensive care (and other) for covid. Also shows riskgropups, mortality, age groups and more. - ""Corona så ser det ut i din kommun"": Corona in your municipality, development of cases and deaths. - ""Social distansering"" : we have an english version of this so I give you that link. - ""Corona - de senaste tio veckorna"". Corona, the last ten weeks. Shows whatever contry you want - both the hole period but with extra focus on the last ten weeks. Has an ""explore your self"" at the bottom. - ""Överdödlighet under coronakrisen"": Exsess mortality during corona. Show deaths compared to earlier years. - ""Så påverka corona möjligheten att opereras"" = This is how corona affects your possibility to get your scheduled operation. We compare the number of operations tat is usually done with how many are being done now. Per region, updated once a week.

Germany,"ᴜᴄʟᴀʙ - University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (FHP), Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Wageningen University and Research (WUR), Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI)",Big,Participant,The Senses Toolkit - making sense of climate change scenarios," SENSES is a joint effort by four international climate research institutions, namely the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Wageningen University and Research (WUR), and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the ᴜᴄʟᴀʙ, a visualization research group situated between design, computing, and the humanities at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam. SENSES is part of the European Research Area for Climate Services (ERA4CS), an ERA-NET initiated by JPI Climate. It is funded by BMBF (DE), BMWFW (AT), NWO (NL), FORMAS (SE) with co-funding by the European Union.   The research project running from 2017 to 2020 was aimed at fostering understanding of the new generation of climate change scenarios by the means of knowledge co-production and data visualisation. We held several workshops with policy, business, finance, and regional stakeholders. These enabled us to produce outcomes such as a co-production techniques database, scenario study factsheeets, an application programming interface (API) to make scenario data more accessible, and the centerpiece of the project: The Climate Change Scenario Toolkit, an online resource that features visualisation-heavy articles based on climate change scenario data and explorative interfaces to access the underlying data.   To design our articles we drawn extensively from a wide range of references, going from other newsroom work to our and others prior research efforts. Other articles such as Bloomberg's <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/"">«What's Really Warming the World?» (2015)</a> and New York Times' <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/climate/how-much-hotter-is-your-hometown.html"">«How Much Hotter Is Your Hometown Than When You Were Born?» (2018)</a> to mention a couple. Also other directly unrelated visualizations projects inspired us along the way: like <a href=""http://www.project-ukko.net/map.html"">Moritz Stefaner's Project Ukko</a> and<a href=""https://www.behance.net/gallery/96908251/Noise-pollution""> Federica Fragapane's Noise Pollution project</a>. We also drawn for inspiration directly from the IPCC reports and books like  Image politics of climate change: visualizations, imaginations, documentations  from Schneider, B. and Nocke, T.,  all references that could give us a solid climate science visualization background. Lastly it is important to present also other institutions efforts in communicating climate change scenarios, the <a href=""https://climateprimer.mit.edu/"">MIT Climate Primer</a> was a must in our design process. Our previous research efforts played also an important role as pathfinders: the FHP and PIK<a href=""https://vimeo.com/232557105""> «A Brief History of CO2 Emissions»</a> was a benchmark in deciding how to structure narrative and journalistic instances on climate scenarios. "," The SENSES portfolio consists of 10 data articles part of climatescenarios.org, a toolkit for understanding and using climate scenarios. The individual data-driven articles are self-contained interactive and visual artefacts addressing specific questions on climate scenarios. While the toolkit has been developed for scientific, policy and finance related target groups, the data-driven articles aim at a wider audience including activists, citizens, and other journalists. Each article unravels one aspect of climate change scenarios to make them accessible, understandable and actionable.   The challenge we faced in designing these articles are two-fold. On the one hand our readers come from a wide range of backgrounds, therefore we needed to cover a diverse set of topics: from investment opportunities to mitigation strategies and regional adaptation projects. On the other hand, individual articles have to abide to an high scientific standard to answer questions related to our climate future without being strongly biased or subjectively opinionated. It was not enough to simply visualise climate change scenarios data - we needed to describe and attentively contextualise them. We also needed to explain in detail how climate change scenarios are produced, how they rely on different kinds of models, how they can be interpreted and used. To overcome these challenges, we applied a rigorous user-centred design process that could enable us to meet the requirements of particular target groups and to transform abstract data sets into insightful visualizations. The close involvement of climate scientists throughout the entire process was also a prerequisite for the successful editing of articles. Individual essays were crafted in a joint effort: designers and scientists worked in tandem to ensure the quality of each one of them.   Articles were well received and spread within and outside the scientific community. To this day, climatescenarios.org counts 40.000 unique visitors. We receive various endorsements on social media and other platforms from all kinds of readers and organizations, including The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Single articles have been liked and shared multiple times on Twitter and other social media platforms over the past 6 months and we received offers from various organizations in different countries to translate the toolkit contents to their native language. We had the occasion to talk about our work at several events: the Berlin Datavis Meetup on Climate Change visualization at Zeit Online, the Graphic Hunters S-H-O-W conference and the SENSES online Outreach which attracted a consistent audience.

Argentina,Infobae,Big,Participant,Transparency on patrimony and salaries of public officials," This is the first time that Infobae, the Spanish-speaking media news web site with the highest traffic between other Spanish newspapers, has carried out a project of this magnitude and with these characteristics: searching, asking and making systematic requests of the data, promoting open data, and sharing open data that was obtained from closed data.    The project was focused on transparency, the potential enrichment of public officials and legislators over time, and their income from public funds. It was carried out during 2020 for the Data Unit. The Unit was created two years ago and is composed by two journalists and a programmer.    Several of these revelations had never been published before, as the patrimony and public salaries of the governors, their wealth, and their reserved expenses were always a state secret.    Our objectives were from the beginning of the project:   -  Exhaustive survey through official sites.   - Determine the information to get through Public Information Access requests, and / or in a personalized way.   - Easy navigation graphics to make your content more accessible (that was the reason why we used Flourish, since we understood that the tool is friendly for our users)   - Stories of social value for the audience and political impact.   -In line with the concept of open journalism, at the end of each article it was explained how the information was processed and shared the downloadable spreadsheet in open format             "," The axis of the project were:  <ul>    Patrimony of the governors of the 24 provinces, of 257 national deputies, and of 72 national senators from the analysis of their affidavits of assets       Public salaries of the governors of the 24 provinces of the country       Public salaries of mayors of the main province of the country, Buenos Aires.    </ul>  The production was of 19 journalistic pieces published in 2020, that are listed here with their links:   <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ayYWNLdS8SqHbpApp4TQTCiUaszRFaCYfUjk8K-Vu1c/edit#gid=0"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ayYWNLdS8SqHbpApp4TQTCiUaszRFaCYfUjk8K-Vu1c/edit#gid=0</a>    The initiative included the following process       Web detection of information in open and closed formats       Detection of sites with absence of information       Download of PDFs from official website of Anticorruption Office       Opening closed data, using WebScraping techniques and use of the <a href=""https://tabula.technology/"">Tabula</a> tool       Placed requests for information in cases of non-existent or outdated information.        Personal requests to the actors involved and traditional journalistic reporting was used to complete and confront the information.       Data extraction in cases where it was possible to use the <a href=""https://www.onlineocr.net/"">OCR tool.</a>       Manual data loading in those cases in which the information was delivered in paper format and the OCRs did not work.       Using <a href=""https://www.python.org/"">Python</a> for data mining, with developer work.        Confection of a ranking to compare patrimonies.       Interactive data visualization using <a href=""https://flourish.studio/"">Fluorish</a>       Building history after data mining and displaying information on different types of charts         The main impact was that, for the first time, some of the governors of the different provinces agreed to make public their patrimony, despite the fact that the legislation enabled them to keep it secret. They did so not to be exposed as they were hiding their patrimony after the request of Infobae. In fact, several admitted that they were in debt in terms of transparency, and that they were working or were going to work on better standards in that regard.   In the case of legislators, some of them that have not presented their patrimony affidavits, did it after being exposed in the notes.   Other impact was given by the repercussions and the reaction of the audience that these notes generated, in social networks and in other media. The impact was even higher in the provinces, where the informational locks have historically been stronger.   The third impact has to do with the Web traffic they generate: On average, each piece scored over 300,000 page views per piece.     ",https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/02/16/informe-especial-el-patrimonio-de-los-ministros-de-mauricio-macri-cuando-dejaron-el-poder/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/10/02/cual-es-el-patrimonio-de-cada-uno-de-los-integrantes-del-gabinete-de-alberto-fernandez/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/10/11/quienes-son-los-5-senadores-nacionales-con-mayor-patrimonio/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/10/12/quienes-son-los-5-diputados-nacionales-con-mayor-patrimonio/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/11/01/los-5-gobernadores-con-mayor-patrimonio-y-los-11-que-prefieren-no-publicar-su-declaracion-jurada/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/11/02/el-gobernador-bonaerense-axel-kicillof-declaro-bienes-por-7-millones/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/11/30/informe-exclusivo-cuanto-gana-cada-uno-de-los-gobernadores/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/12/01/el-gobernador-alberto-rodriguez-saa-gasto-en-los-ultimos-cinco-anos-al-menos-usd-14987129-de-fondos-reservados/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/12/22/informe-especial-cuanto-ganan-los-intendentes-del-conurbano/,https://www.infobae.com/politica/2020/12/23/de-135-municipios-de-la-provincia-de-buenos-aires-solo-21-intendentes-informan-online-cuanto-,,,,,,,,
Ireland,University College Dublin,Small,Participant,UCD Data Journalism Studio," UCD Data Journalism Studio is a student publication written and maintained by the students of UCD Data Journalism CPD programme.    UCD Data Journalism CPD programme is a part-time continuing postgraduate degree, composed of only three modules/courses. The students of this programme often are from Journalism and Communication backgrounds and have little to no data background.    At UCD Data Journalism we believe in high quality, yet accessible and DIY, data-driven investigative journalism, with the view and aim to empower every single journalist in every single newsroom to be able to use data in their day to day investigative work and reporting. At UCD Data Journalism Studio we are big fans of openness, transparency, collaboration, and simple yet effective communication.   I am submitting this portfolio in the capacity of the Director of the Programme and the Editor of the publication. All the stories are produced by my students in UCD Data Journalism Programme. Their names appear on the stories.     ","   The UCD Data Journalism Studio   is a student publication, and provides a professional showcase for the work of UCD data journalism students, while also directly engaging with the Irish news industry and its audiences. Using a dedicated site (newslab.ie/ddjucd), students maintaining a sustained schedule of publishing data-driven stories & investigations, within weeks after they start the programme. At the Studio, we follow best practices and models used by collaborative data-driven teams, such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the UK and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism (ICIJ).   The stories published at the Studio are often focused on social matters. In many cases, they are focused on Irish national data, however, given the diversity of students in the programme, we frequently have students who focus on international matters or on comparative stories. The final set of stories in 2020 were written just around when COVID entered our lives. That was when I saw an immediate change of publication direction from the students, where they produced a set of interesting, timely and engaging on the topic stories as COVID was starting to take over our lives.   At the Studio, we form frequent partnerships with Irish news organisations who then co-publish the stories that are produced for the class. A number of our produced stories have been co-published by the Irish news media, including RTÉ (the Irish national TV and Radio), The Irish Times and The Irish Independent.   This has successfully taken the work of our students outside of the boundaries of the classroom, provided a stamp of quality for our produced stories, and helped our graduates to build and maintain professional portfolios, which increases their level of placement in related employment. At the same time, I believe that the UCD Data Journalism Studio is a modest, yet effective showcase and proof of how 'data' could become an integral part of any journalism curriculum and any journalists' practices, taking students with no data background to a stage that they can produce fully functioning, effective and high-quality data stories, with and within limited resources that the academic institutions and newsrooms have to offer.

South Africa,"BBC, Globo, CNN, IPS News, ArchDaily, London School of Economics, Inequality.org, Daily Maverick",Small,Participant,Unequal Scenes," I am a journalist and photographer, founder of Unequal Scenes and africanDRONE, and Senior Fellow at Code For Africa and a Senior Atlantic Fellow for Social and Economic Equity at the London School of Economics. I specialize in creating engaging multi-media stories, photojournalism and video, telling African and world issues related to inequality, urbanization, tech, and art.  I've worked for 11 years as a photojournalist and have been working with Code For Africa for over 4 years as a journalist. During the last four years, I founded and developed Unequal Scenes into a major international drone journalism project on inequality. I helped develop the idea of ""Drone journalism"" in the African context, with the help of Code For Africa, creating a drone journalism code of ethics and operations manual for African journalists, as well as creating many interactive multimedia drone journalism pieces (editing, writing, and shooting) together with international publishing partners such as BBC, The Guardian, The Mwananchi, News24, and The Citizen.       During this time I also co-founded africanDRONE with Code For Africa, which produces content for major international news organizations, develops new and socially aware storytelling methodologies, supports drone mapping and survey operations, and hosts educational drone camps across the continent. africanDRONE is a partner of the African Drone Forum, a symposium, expo, and series of flying competitions to be held in Rwanda in 2020. I also became a Senior Atlantic Fellow at the London School of Economics, which has led me to many collaborations with academics, activists, and policymakers interested in economic justice and social equity issues.     I'm inspired with all forms of visual storytelling which can help us understand our world better. This is why I create projects that involve drones, data, sensors and 360 video, amongst others. The effects of COVID-19 have been tremendous over the last 12 months, greatly accelerating some trends (like remote work) and amplifying others (like health disparity amongst diverse populations). Moreover, issues of racial justice, health equity, and political stability have all become incredibly important, requiring a critical lens and interpretive storytelling to uncover their complicated histories and context. Journalists have a huge role to play in helping understand the changes taking place, and I'm proud to submit my entry to the Sigma Awards.  "," These projects are a selection of drone and data-driven stories. They were the result of a partnership with supporting organizations like the Atlantic Fellowship, Code For Africa, and the London School of Economics.    The project ""Narratives of Displacement"" is a project designed to explore the topic of displacement from a variety of angles and through various typologies. 6 Atlantic Fellows came together to propose the project, which involves collecting medical research related to displacement, COVID-19, and refugee health, essays, and photographs. By doing this across multiple typologies of displacement (economic, war, environmental, and digital) we hope to provide a new lens on a question which affects everyone: Where do I come from?    Narratives of Displacement came from an initial grant from Atlantic Fellowship which allowed me to build the website, take the initial set of photographs of Syrian refugees, and help to organize both a Displacement forum in Jordan and follow-on conversations. This project won the 2020 Atlantic Senior Fellow Award.  2020 also allowed me a unique opportunity to expand my Unequal Scenes project in the midst of the ongoing protests around the murder of George Floyd. I was able to research and document aerial images of inequality in Minneapolis, Cleveland, and Detroit, shedding light on the issues surrounding infrastructure which were made decades ago by racist policymakers (through Redlining, etc). This is in addition to my continued international Unequal Scenes work, notably in Brazil (where BBC Brazil and Globo, two of the biggest news orgs in the country, ran my images and interview) and also in Namibia. Unequal Scenes uses aerial imagery and data gleaned from satellite images and historical data to present a view of systemic inequality. It is a project conceived, shot, and written by myself.   Lastly, I have written several pieces which seek to better understand COVID-19 policies and responses through research, data, and writing. This was challenging as I was under lockdown for many months, but with the help of asynchronous work apps and video conferencing software I was able to connect with the editors and publishing partners to make these stories known.  Though my projects have been published nationally and internationally, I also have a robust social media presence which allows me to reach audiences directly, and many of these pieces (especially the Brazil Unequal Scenes pieces) have gone incredibly viral, reaching hundreds of thousands, if not millions of impressions.  ",https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/geral-55327609,https://inequality.org/research/famous-inequality-photograph-recreated/,https://www.narrativesofdisplacement.org/,https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/07/02/cape-town-photographers-south-africa-coronavirus-ia-spc.cnn,https://www.archdaily.com/900023/social-inequality-as-seen-from-the-sky,https://www.ipsnews.net/2020/06/cities-can-turn-covid-19-crisis-opportunity-build-better/,https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2020/04/18/covid-19-in-american-governance-we-trust/,https://unequalscenes.com/minneapolis,https://unequalscenes.com/detroit,https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2020-04-22-prepare-now-to-open-the-skies-for-post-covid-19-international-tourism/,,,,,,,,

Nigeria,Premium Times,Small,Participant,Yusuf Akinpelu," ​This story was a data driven analysis of the dwindling turnouts for elections since Nigeria's independence. It did a comparative analysis of the participatory level of Nigerians in elections with other nationals across the world.   The first story is about the turnout for elections in Nigeria since independence compared to other countries.   Aimed at unveiling the reasons for the increasing absenteeism in the nation's general elections, and trigger a policy change, the story took a historical and data-analytical approach to trigger socio-political debate in the country.   This was achieved.    First, that it was published some days after thousands of Nigerian youths, under the motif #EndSARS, trooped to the streets to demand sweeping police reforms and by extension, end to bad governance, it hit a chord.   A sequel to the nationwide protests was a national debate on what Nigerians, over 80 per cent of whom are youths, must do to ensure that the best and the most competent among them govern them.   They wanted to the existing political order by ushering in fresh minds with novel ideas. They especially mirror themselves in the eyes of the American people who voted out President Donald Trump.   But that cannot happen, I argued, per the prevalence of voter's apathy during elections. So the piece placed the stark reality before the eyes of the youthful change seekers.   Judging by the comments of netizens (https://mobile.twitter.com/PremiumTimesng/status/1325370072299352065 and https://mobile.twitter.com/AkinpeluYusuph/status/1325647677174984706), the piece was able to convince some Nigerians that they needed to change their attitudes towards determining who govern them.   There were people, majorly on microblogging site, Twitter, whose comments showed that they will be voting in the next election and will be co-opting those in their cycle to do the same.   The report is rich in research and field interviews of voters and experts on democratic processes.   The story did not just simply share blames, it offered solutions and worked out how to tie the solution to specific s at the steps.   The latter was achieved when the spokesman of Nigeria's House of Representatives praised the story on twitter, asked for an interview with me which I obliged.   He called me on the phone to appraise the report and debate its content. There was a discussion around starting a legislation on how to improve voter's turnout in the country.   This is particularly key because the Speaker hails from Lagos State, Nigeria's richest and most populous state and the economic hub of the country, which has had consecutive lowest voter's turnout in the last two general elections.   Therefore, when Nigeria's INEC Chairman came to the National Assembly, one of the questions he was asked was why there is low voter turnout in the country. His response was detailed here (https://www.orderpaper.ng/politicians-failed-promises-contribute-to-voters-apathy-yakubu/). There was​​ also discussion about how to amend the electoral act to improve the nation's voting system.   This story clearly has spurred the possibility of policy change within the legislative headquarters in Nigeria.   Likewise, the story had a wide reach and was widely shared by top officials in the country, including the Speaker's spokesperson who praised the report. Judging by the average retweets and likes Premium Times gets per post, the story exceeded the usal number of shares by far (https://mobile.twitter.com/PremiumTimesng/status/1325370072299352065).   In all, the story had a great deal of impact and it's impact are still in progress.​ ","When I was a teenager, I had just one dream: have a mastery of words in speech and in writing. As I grew, I discovered journalism to be the key to that dream. So everything I do as a journalist is about desire, passion and talent, not mere coincidence or last resort. So it was not unexpected that from my sophomore years, I had began to freelance and cover local news fo my current platforms, Premium Times, Nigeria's only Pulitzer-winning newspaper, My commitment and talent and craft quickly improved much that by 2018, when Premium Times desired to establish a fact-checking platform, Dubawa, I was contacted to know if I could help shoulder the responsibility of writing for the platform, even though I had not been trainined on fact checking. The desk needed recruits who could raise its stakes and bring novel ideas. At the time, fact-checking was relatively new to the Nigerian media space, but I tried, even without any formal training, to carve a niche for myself in it. I would source for claims and fact-check them, then send them to Dubawa, which publishes. For me, I was merely showing what I could with or without compensation. Months rolled by and one afternoon after class I got a call from the project manager of Dubawa, Ebele Oputa. She told me she would like me to join the Dubawa desk as the management was really impressed about my pieces so far. I was awed. I obliged her. I joined the team officially, and that has shaped my journalism till date. This attribute has defined my sojourn so far as a professional journalist so much that, by 2019, when I was moved into Premium Times newsroom, I got what the paper believes to be arguably its most important — and some say most challenging — beat, the National Assembly. There, because there are usually many reporters who are tasked to tell stories as proceedings unfold, I have committed myself to telling it how no one else might ever think of doing. Where necessary, even for breaking stories, I add statistics, I add necessary anecdotes, I animate my stories to tell the readers what I saw — not just what the speaker said, but how it was said, delivered and, of course, what was left unsaid. For instance, when Nigeria's works and housing minister, Babatunde Fashola, came to the Senate to defend the ministry's budget and said the country plans to build about 3,000 housing units, the headlines everywhere was just that. Instinctively, I knew this amount was meagre. So I searched and I saw that Nigeria actually needed over 700,000 housing units yearly to cover its over 17 million deficit. I therefore told the story from the angle of what the minister failed to say. If for nothing else, my story was unique among all other reporters covering the beat, and I got the praise of my editors in a mail and during our editorial meeting that week. If I must tell a story, I look for unique angles or styles to do it, and this has always been my guiding principle. My attention to details and eye for excellence in part informed why my platform elevated me to the head of the data desk less than two years after I was moved from Dubawa to the newsroom. I became the youngest desk head in Premium TImes. Within months of that assignment, myself and my only team member have succeeded in writing impactful data stories. This series story on election turnout is nonetheless arguably the most impactful.

Kazakhstan,"IWPR, CABAR.asia",Small,Participant,Zulfiya Raissova," Now, I can proudly say that I am a data journalist. Years before after my graduation from the faculty of journalism I felt uncertain about my career path as I did not fully understand what kind of journalist I want to become, what articles I want to write and who will be my audience. This uncertainty lasted until I had a chance to attend the Central Asian Summer Institute in 2018, where I learned about data journalism.   Data journalism is what I am interested in at the moment and what I've been doing for the last two years. My mentors are Anastasia Valeeva, Savia Khasanova and Altynai Mambetova who are the founders of the School of Data in Kyrgyzstan. They opened the data journalism for me and recommended me to the editors of Central Asian Bureau for Analytical Reporting (CABAR.asia). Since that I’ve been working with them for almost two years. The reason why I love working with data is that the data more likely guarantee objectivity and accuracy of the information. Also, I enjoy researching through working with open data. Besides, data journalism in Central Asia is practically not developed now; there are very few data journalists. Therefore, I in cooperation with the CABAR.asia Media School, deliver guest lectures for Central Asian students where I talk about data journalism encouraging students to follow a professional path in data journalism.   I researched access to education for rural schoolchildren, on paedophilia, on criminal violence cases, on trade, the military power of the armies in Central Asia Region. My last published research is about sexual harassment in Central Asian taxis. Most often, my research is dedicated specifically to the legal part of the issue. That’s why shortly I am planning to launch my data media related to the law so I could have a positive impact on the legal system in Kazakhstan. It may sound ambitious, but I have already formed a team and found partners to implement the idea, its delivery seem to be a matter of time.   I could see that my professional knowledge is not enough now, so I want to do a Master's degree in the data in England. And upon its completion, I am planning to continue developing the data community in Kazakhstan by opening a school for data journalism. From my personal experience, it seems difficult to succeed professionally as a data journalist on your own, having the team and the community are important. I want to become the person who can unite individuals interested in working with the data and start implementing the projects that could positively improve the development of states and societies. Also, working with data allows forecasting and disclosing facts/information that are important to the public, but can be intentionally hidden by the government. I hope my data project on legislation in Kazakhstan will have the impact leading to the legal reforms in the country.     "," I have uploaded 10 articles out of 10 possible. I hope you will enjoy reading them. Almost all the works were done by me, except for the works “Harassment in Taxis in Central Asia: Impunity and No Right to Defense "" and the material ""Rapes Classified as Grievous Crime in Kazakhstan"".   First of all, I want to tell you about the material “Harassment in Taxis in Central Asia:   Impunity and No Right to Defense "". This is my last published data work. It is worth noting that this longread was released as part of a 4-month information campaign in Central Asia about harassment in a taxi. The authors of the idea I and my colleague Dastan Akkozha. We involved journalists from Central Asia in the implementation of the project, who collected stories about cases of harassment in taxis in their countries and distributed research questionnaires. We also coordinated the process of taking videos. Why did we start this project? The answer is simple, harassment in a taxi has become so common in our region that many consider it normal, even though harassment can result in a rape.   We independently conducted an online survey, which allowed us to assess the situation with harassment in the region. As a result, we found that 81% of girls in Central Asia experienced harassment in a taxi, and collected more than 100 stories with real cases from girls who faced harassment. The main impact that we received after the information campaign ended is that Kazakhstan continued working on the promotion of the law that increases liability for harassment. Besides, our research data has been submitted to a working group that is promoting this law. Before that, they had no data to rely on. Also, our team is the first to highlight the problem of harassment in a taxi. The full implementation of the project took six months. I was involved in the coordination of material production, analysis, data visualization and writing the text part of the material about Kazakhstan.   The material “Kazakhstan: Only 39% of Criminal Cases on Violence Against Minors Result in Sentences” was written in 4 days. I emotionally wrote the paper after the incident in Satpayevo, where the residents of the city wanted to arrange to lynch for paedophilia. For four nights I analyzed legal statistics to understand what percentage of the victims go to courts and how many cases eventually are brought to the courts. The results were alarming, but I was glad that the material was actively disseminated, and in the winter of 2020, at the legislative level, the punishment for paedophilia become harsher.   The material “Kazakhstan: 88 Convictions for Slander Against Journalists in 10 Years” made it possible to assess the real situation of being a journalist in Kazakhstan. In addition to analyzing legal statistics, I also analyzed thousands of cases to make a game on the most absurd lawsuits against journalists.   With journalist Anna Velichko, we conducted a study on criminal violence cases. The results were presented in the material - ""Rapes Classified as Grievous Crime in Kazakhstan"". The material was published at a time when the law against rapists was actively promoted. Now the criminal terms have been tightened.   Most of the materials are based on the analysis of legal statistics and focusing on non-working laws in Kazakhstan. I also analyzed the military power in Kazakhstan, the history of the Parliament, as well as migration issues in Central Asia.
