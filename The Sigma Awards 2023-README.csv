Here is the full Sigma Awards 2023 data!,,
Why?,"When someone applies to the Sigma Awards, he/she is required to share more than a description of their work. We ask about the technologies used, the impact reached, the context surrounding the project, and more. We also gather data on countries and organisation represented. 

We believe this information can be very valuable to other members of the data journalism community. That's why we are sharing it with you in a usable format. So that you can process it easily and maybe do incredible things out of it.
